Many people used the Pony Express as a communication link. It also encouraged catalogues to be created, allowing people to buy goods and have them brought by horse to the customers.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|pp=25\u201329}} It became the West's most direct means of east\u2013west communication before the [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new U.S. state of [[California]] with the rest of the [[United States]].\n\nThe Pony Express demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the [[American Old West|American West]]. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the [[Frontier Thesis|Frontier]] times.\n\n==Inception and founding==\n[[File:Alexander Majors Pony Express.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexander Majors]]\n\nThe idea of a fast mail route to the Pacific coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After [[California gold rush|gold was discovered there in 1848]], thousands of [[prospectors]], investors and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=9}} The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the [[American Civil War]] approached.\n\nIn the early 1860s, [[William Hepburn Russell|William Russell]], [[Alexander Majors]], and [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and [[drayage]] business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank and an insurance company.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nRussell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Hepburn-Russell|title=William Hepburn Russell {{!}} American businessman|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=4\u20135}} They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932|p=76}}\n\nBy utilizing a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional [[stagecoach]]es, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per {{convert|1/2|oz|g}}, then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.\n\nRussell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.<ref name=\"museum\">\n{{cite web\n|title=Pony Express National Museum\n|url=http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|publisher=City of St Joseph\n|accessdate=December 10, 2012\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312171306/http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|archivedate=March 12, 2013\n|df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nMajors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties.

They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The mochila was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a ''cantina,'' or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these cantinas, which were padlocked for safety.

In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.\n\nIt is unknown if riders tried crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in winter, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Nevada Territory]]. The riders received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43\u2013$1 per day.\n\nAlexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project.

Through Nebraska it followed the [[Great Platte River Road]], cutting through [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], clipping the edge of Colorado at [[Julesburg, Colorado]], and passing [[Courthouse Rock]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], and [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], before arriving at [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming. From there it followed the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], passing [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], and [[Split Rock (Wyoming)|Split Rock]], to [[Fort Caspar]], through [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] to [[Fort Bridger]] and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the [[Central Nevada Route]] blazed by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#History|Corps of Topographical Engineers]] in 1859. This route roughly follows today's [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the [[Great Basin]], the [[Central Nevada Route|Utah-Nevada Desert]], and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] near [[Lake Tahoe]] before arriving in [[Sacramento]]. Mail was then sent via steamer down the [[Sacramento River]] to San Francisco. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to [[Oakland, California]].\n\n===Stations===\nThere were 190 stations along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were very basic.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=113}} The route was divided up into five divisions.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994}} To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from {{convert|5|to|25|mi|0}} apart as the terrain would allow for. At each ''swing station,'' riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while \"home stations\" provided room and board for the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be whisked across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about {{convert|75|mi|sigfig=2}} per day.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}\n<!-- No contemporary linking, please.

Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an \"unrivaled feat at the time\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |title=Pony Express: ''Romance'' versus ''Reality'' \n |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] \n |accessdate=December 10, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021120155/https://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |archivedate=October 21, 2012 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Attacks==\n[[File:Pony Express Stolen Mail 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stolen Pony Express mail.

It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.\nIn the brief history of the Pony Express, it only happened once that the mail did not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indian War in May 1860.\n\nApproximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named [[Numaga]]. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace.{{sfnp|Angel|1881|p=151}}\nMeanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the [[Carson River]] near present-day [[Lake Lahontan]]. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.{{sfnp|Michno|2007|p=89-90}}\n\nDuring the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life.

At the age of 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short {{convert|45|mi|adj=on}} delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of {{convert|322|mi}} over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}  On one occasion when carrying mail he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads and cattle herding on the Great Plains.

Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, {{convert|75|mi}} to the east.\n\nHis greatest ride, {{convert|120|mi}} in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Pony Bob Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of {{convert|190|mi}} without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail where, at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock.

His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of {{convert|10|mi}} or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight [[saddle]]s were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\nThe mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time-consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a ''mochila'' (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\n==Closing==\nDuring its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Replica of a Pony Express mochila |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&cmd=1&id=17889&img=1&pg=1}}</ref> Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]] did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to [[Jeremy Dehut]] in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', [[Ben Holladay]], acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.\n\nShortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the [[American Civil War]] caused the stage line to cease operation.

Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.\n\nThe most complete books on the Pony Express are ''The Story of the Pony Express'' and ''Saddles and Spurs'' by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01914.html |title=Russell, William Hepburn |encyclopedia=American National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Pony Express National Historic Trail}}\n[[File:Pony-express-statue.jpg|thumb|Pony Express statue in St. Joseph, Missouri]]\nFrom 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company [[Wells Fargo]], which provided secure mail service.

Many people used the Pony Express as a communication link. It also encouraged catalogues to be created, allowing people to buy goods and have them brought by horse to the customers.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|pp=25\u201329}} It became the West's most direct means of east\u2013west communication before the [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new U.S. state of [[California]] with the rest of the [[United States]].\n\nThe Pony Express demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the [[American Old West|American West]]. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the [[Frontier Thesis|Frontier]] times.\n\n==Inception and founding==\n[[File:Alexander Majors Pony Express.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexander Majors]]\n\nThe idea of a fast mail route to the Pacific coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After [[California gold rush|gold was discovered there in 1848]], thousands of [[prospectors]], investors and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=9}} The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the [[American Civil War]] approached.\n\nIn the early 1860s, [[William Hepburn Russell|William Russell]], [[Alexander Majors]], and [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and [[drayage]] business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank and an insurance company.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nRussell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Hepburn-Russell|title=William Hepburn Russell {{!}} American businessman|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855 they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=4\u20135}} They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932|p=76}}\n\nBy utilizing a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional [[stagecoach]]es, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per {{convert|1/2|oz|g}}, then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.\n\nRussell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.<ref name=\"museum\">\n{{cite web\n|title=Pony Express National Museum\n|url=http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|publisher=City of St Joseph\n|accessdate=December 10, 2012\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312171306/http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|archivedate=March 12, 2013\n|df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nMajors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties.

They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The mochila was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a ''cantina,'' or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these cantinas, which were padlocked for safety. The mochila could hold {{convert|20|lb|0}} of mail along with the {{convert|20|lb|0}} of material carried on the horse.<ref>Riders were issued a Bible, a horn to alert employees at stations of their approach, a rifle, two Colt revolvers and ammunition for self-defense.

In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.\n\nIt is unknown if riders tried crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in winter, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Nevada Territory]]. The riders received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43\u2013$1 per day.\n\nAlexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project.

Reproduction of Jackson's map issued by the Union Pacific Railroad Company.</center>]]\n{{clear}}\nThe route started at [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] on the [[Missouri River]], it then followed what is modern-day [[U.S. Route 36|U.S. Highway 36]] (US&nbsp;36 the ''Pony Express Highway'') to Marysville, Kansas, where it turned northwest following [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]] to [[Fort Kearny]] in Nebraska. Through Nebraska it followed the [[Great Platte River Road]], cutting through [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], clipping the edge of Colorado at [[Julesburg, Colorado]], and passing [[Courthouse Rock]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], and [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], before arriving at [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming. From there it followed the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], passing [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], and [[Split Rock (Wyoming)|Split Rock]], to [[Fort Caspar]], through [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] to [[Fort Bridger]] and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the [[Central Nevada Route]] blazed by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#History|Corps of Topographical Engineers]] in 1859. This route roughly follows today's [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the [[Great Basin]], the [[Central Nevada Route|Utah-Nevada Desert]], and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] near [[Lake Tahoe]] before arriving in [[Sacramento]]. Mail was then sent via steamer down the [[Sacramento River]] to San Francisco. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to [[Oakland, California]].\n\n===Stations===\nThere were 190 stations along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were very basic.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=113}} The route was divided up into five divisions.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994}} To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from {{convert|5|to|25|mi|0}} apart as the terrain would allow for. At each ''swing station,'' riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while \"home stations\" provided room and board for the riders between runs.

Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an \"unrivaled feat at the time\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |title=Pony Express: ''Romance'' versus ''Reality'' \n |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] \n |accessdate=December 10, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021120155/https://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |archivedate=October 21, 2012 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Attacks==\n[[File:Pony Express Stolen Mail 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stolen Pony Express mail.

The cover is also franked with U.S. Postage issue of 1857, Washington, 10c black.<ref name=\"Scotts\" />]]\n\nThe [[Paiute War]] was a minor series of raids and ambushes initiated by American expansion into the territory of the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indian tribe in Nevada, which resulted in the disruption of mail services of the Pony Express. It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.\nIn the brief history of the Pony Express, it only happened once that the mail did not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indian War in May 1860.\n\nApproximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named [[Numaga]]. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace.{{sfnp|Angel|1881|p=151}}\nMeanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the [[Carson River]] near present-day [[Lake Lahontan]]. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.{{sfnp|Michno|2007|p=89-90}}\n\nDuring the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860,.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005|p=18}}\n\nDuring this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (mochila) did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.\n\n==Famous riders==\nIn 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work&nbsp;\u2013 riders had to be tough and lightweight. A famous advertisement allegedly read:\n\n<blockquote>Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred{{efn|One historian, Joseph Nardone, claims that the \"orphans preferred\" ad is a hoax (dating no earlier than 1902), as no one has found the ad in contemporary newspaper archives.{{sfnp|Thompson|2005}}}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders traveling east or west along the route at any given time. In addition, there were also about 400 other employees, including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied; Waddell and Majors could have easily hired riders at low rates, but instead offered one hundred dollars a month{{snd}}a handsome sum for that time.{{sfnp|Reinfeld|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PSAOQ83qZ2cC&pg=PA49 49]}} Author [[Mark Twain]] described the riders in his travel memoir ''[[Roughing It]]'' as: \"...&nbsp;usually a little bit of a man\". Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenage boys, they came to be seen as heroes of the American West.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}} There was no systematic list of riders kept by the company,{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=73\u201374}} but a partial list has been compiled by Raymond and Nancy Settle in their ''Saddles & Spurs'' (1972).{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=74\u201376}}\n\n{{For|the list of Pony Express riders|Category:Pony Express riders}}\n\n===First riders===\n[[File:Riders Pony Express.jpg|thumb|\"Billy\" Richardson, Johnny Fry, Charles Cliff, Gus Cliff]]\n\nThe identity of the first westbound rider to depart St. Joseph has been disputed, but currently most historians have narrowed it down to either [[Johnny Fry]] or [[Johnson William Richardson|Billy Richardson]].{{sfnp|Root|Hickman|1946|loc=Note 358}}<ref name=\"NPSStables\" />{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994|loc=[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/poex/hrs/hrs2e.htm Chap 2 p. 5]}}<ref name=\"museum\" /> Both Expressmen were hired at St. Joseph for A.

First, Mayor M. Jeff Thompson gave a brief speech on the significance of the event for St. Joseph. Then William H.

At the conclusion of all the speeches, approximately 7:15&nbsp; pm, Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the foot of Jules Street where the ferry boat ''Denver'', under a full head of steam, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1955|p=58}}{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p= 31}} On April 9 at 6:45&nbsp;pm, the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah.

Around midnight on April 14, 1860, the first mail pouch was delivered via the Pony Express to San Francisco. Bringing with it was a letter of congratulations from [[James Buchanan|President Buchanan]] to California [[John G.

After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of {{convert|322|mi}} over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}  On one occasion when carrying mail he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads and cattle herding on the Great Plains. A career as a scout for the Army under General [[Phillip Sheridan]] following the Civil War earned him his nickname and established his notoriety as a frontiersman.<ref>Buffalo Bill's Wild West, R.L.

He was born January 1840 in London, England, and came to the United States as a teenager. Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, {{convert|75|mi}} to the east.\n\nHis greatest ride, {{convert|120|mi}} in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Pony Bob Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of {{convert|190|mi}} without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail where, at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock. On the ride he was shot through the jaw with an Indian arrow, losing three teeth.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=Wyoming Tales and Trails\n|url=http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/OregonTrail4.html\n|accessdate=December 10, 2012\n}}</ref>\nFinally, he reached Buckland's Station, making the {{convert|380|mi|adj=on}} round trip the longest on record.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}\n\nPony Bob continued to work as a rider for Wells Fargo and Company after the Civil War, scouted for the U.S. Army well into his fifties, and later accompanied his good friend Buffalo Bill Cody on a diplomatic mission to negotiate the surrender of Chief Sitting Bull in December 1890. He drifted in and out of public mention but eventually died in Chicago during the winter of 1912 (age 72) in deep poverty after suffering a stroke. Buffalo Bill paid for his friend's headstone at [[Mount Greenwood|Mount Greenwood Cemetery]] (111 Street and Sacramento) on Chicago's far south side.{{sfnp|Corbett|2003|pp=198\u2013199}}\n\n===Jack Keetley===\n[[File:Jkeetley.jpg|thumb|upright|Jack Keetley]]\nJack Keetley was hired by A.

He was one of those who rode for the Pony Express during the entire nineteen months of its existence.\n\nJack Keetley's longest ride, upon which he doubled back for another rider, ended at Seneca where he was taken from the saddle sound asleep.

During the Paiute uprising of 1860 he was chased by a band of Paiute Indians on horseback and was forced to retreat into the hills behind some big rocks where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.{{sfnp|McNesse|2009|p=105}}\n\n==Horses==\n[[File:Pony express crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Frank E.

The horses were ridden quickly between stations, an average distance of {{convert|15|mi}}, and then were relieved and a fresh horse would be exchanged for the one that just arrived from its strenuous run.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nDuring his route of {{convert|80|to|100|mi}}, a Pony Express rider would change horses 8 to 10 times. The horses were ridden at a fast trot, canter or gallop, around {{convert|10|to|15|mph}} and at times they were driven to full gallop at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph}}. Horses of the Pony Express were purchased in Missouri, Iowa, California, and some western U.S. territories.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe various types of horse ridden by riders of the Pony Express included Morgans and thoroughbreds which were often used on the eastern end of the trail.

His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of {{convert|10|mi}} or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight [[saddle]]s were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\nThe mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time-consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a ''mochila'' (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\n==Closing==\nDuring its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Replica of a Pony Express mochila |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&cmd=1&id=17889&img=1&pg=1}}</ref> Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]] did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to [[Jeremy Dehut]] in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', [[Ben Holladay]], acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.\n\nShortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the [[American Civil War]] caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] reached Salt Lake City and connected [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[Sacramento, California]].<!--<h Museum]</ref>--> Other telegraph lines connected points along the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=The First Transcontinental Telegraph System Was Completed October 24, 1861\n|work=AmericasLibrary.gov: America's Story from America's Library\n|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]\n|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/civil/jb_civil_telegrap_1.html\n|accessdate=September 14, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nDespite the subsidy, the Pony Express was a financial failure.

Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.\n\nThe most complete books on the Pony Express are ''The Story of the Pony Express'' and ''Saddles and Spurs'' by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01914.html |title=Russell, William Hepburn |encyclopedia=American National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Pony Express National Historic Trail}}\n[[File:Pony-express-statue.jpg|thumb|Pony Express statue in St. Joseph, Missouri]]\nFrom 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company [[Wells Fargo]], which provided secure mail service.

By default, Player 1 and Player 2 can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled. Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has six stages.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Viewpoint'' also saw release on a variety of home platforms, including the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] game consoles, as well as the [[Sharp X68000]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms. A port for the [[Sega Saturn]] was due in 1996;<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=It Depends on Your Viewpoint|work=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=7|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=May 1996|page=8}}</ref> however, it was cancelled. At one point, an 8-bit version for the [[Game Boy Color]] was planned,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/07/23/game-boy-colors-viewpoint|title=Game Boy Color's Viewpoint|last=Staff|first=I. G. N.|date=1999-07-22|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref> but it was cancelled.\n\nThe Genesis version features a sound and graphical style similar the Neo-Geo arcade game, but has considerably fewer enemies, a lower color palette and suffers from slowdown. The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same. The X68000 version, trimmed down like the Genesis version, is similar to that port in terms of sound and visual style. The FM Towns platform received the truest-to-arcade port, although it suffers the occasional slowdown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065514/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Neo Geo: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065516/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Genesis: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Christopher |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034121/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> PS1: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211012111/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |archivedate=December 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| CVG = Arcade: 95%<ref name=\"CVG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/225/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| EGM = Genesis: 35 / 50<ref name=\"egm65\"/> <br /> PS1: 30.5 / 40<ref name=\"egm78\"/>\n| Fam = Neo Geo: 30 / 40<ref name=\"Fam\"/>\n| GameFan = Neo Geo: 198.5 / 200<ref name=\"GameFan\"/> <br /> PS1: 233 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 1 (January 1996), page 16</ref>\n| GMaster = Neo Geo: 93%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 9 (September 1993), pages 62-63 (published 19 August 1993)</ref> <br /> PS1: 89%<ref name=\"GMasterPS1\">''[[GamesMaster]]'', episode 90 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZdroNphXA&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 10]), November 23, 1995</ref>\n| Play = PS1: 74%<ref>''Play'', issue 2 (December 1995), pages 60-61 (published 16 November 1995)</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Maximum''\n| rev1Score = PS1: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max2\"/>\n| NGen = Genesis: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen3\"/><br />PS1: {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"NGen13\"/>\n| rev3 = ''{{ill|Player One (magazine)|lt=Player One|fr|Player One|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev3Score = Neo Geo: 97%<ref name=\"player1\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Sinclair User]]''\n| rev4Score = Arcade: 96%<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/157/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''{{ill|Video Games (magazine)|lt=Video Games|de|Video Games|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev5Score = Neo Geo: 84%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-12-2634.html |title=Viewpoint (Neo Geo) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> Mega Drive: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-4-746.html |title=Viewpoint (Mega Drive) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> PS1: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-10-1998.html |title=Viewpoint (PlayStation) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = Best Graphics in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award2Pub = ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''\n| award2 = Best Music in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award3Pub = [[GameFan|''GameFan'' Megawards]]\n| award3 = Best Shooter (Genesis)<ref>''GameFan'', volume 3, issue 1 (January 1995), pages 68-75</ref>\n}}\n\nThe Neo Geo version received a positive critical reception.

By default, Player 1 and Player 2 can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled. Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has six stages.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Viewpoint'' also saw release on a variety of home platforms, including the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] game consoles, as well as the [[Sharp X68000]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms. A port for the [[Sega Saturn]] was due in 1996;<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=It Depends on Your Viewpoint|work=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=7|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=May 1996|page=8}}</ref> however, it was cancelled.

The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same. The X68000 version, trimmed down like the Genesis version, is similar to that port in terms of sound and visual style. The FM Towns platform received the truest-to-arcade port, although it suffers the occasional slowdown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065514/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Neo Geo: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065516/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Genesis: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Christopher |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034121/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> PS1: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211012111/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |archivedate=December 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| CVG = Arcade: 95%<ref name=\"CVG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/225/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| EGM = Genesis: 35 / 50<ref name=\"egm65\"/> <br /> PS1: 30.5 / 40<ref name=\"egm78\"/>\n| Fam = Neo Geo: 30 / 40<ref name=\"Fam\"/>\n| GameFan = Neo Geo: 198.5 / 200<ref name=\"GameFan\"/> <br /> PS1: 233 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 1 (January 1996), page 16</ref>\n| GMaster = Neo Geo: 93%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 9 (September 1993), pages 62-63 (published 19 August 1993)</ref> <br /> PS1: 89%<ref name=\"GMasterPS1\">''[[GamesMaster]]'', episode 90 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZdroNphXA&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 10]), November 23, 1995</ref>\n| Play = PS1: 74%<ref>''Play'', issue 2 (December 1995), pages 60-61 (published 16 November 1995)</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Maximum''\n| rev1Score = PS1: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max2\"/>\n| NGen = Genesis: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen3\"/><br />PS1: {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"NGen13\"/>\n| rev3 = ''{{ill|Player One (magazine)|lt=Player One|fr|Player One|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev3Score = Neo Geo: 97%<ref name=\"player1\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Sinclair User]]''\n| rev4Score = Arcade: 96%<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/157/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''{{ill|Video Games (magazine)|lt=Video Games|de|Video Games|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev5Score = Neo Geo: 84%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-12-2634.html |title=Viewpoint (Neo Geo) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> Mega Drive: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-4-746.html |title=Viewpoint (Mega Drive) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> PS1: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-10-1998.html |title=Viewpoint (PlayStation) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = Best Graphics in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award2Pub = ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''\n| award2 = Best Music in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award3Pub = [[GameFan|''GameFan'' Megawards]]\n| award3 = Best Shooter (Genesis)<ref>''GameFan'', volume 3, issue 1 (January 1995), pages 68-75</ref>\n}}\n\nThe Neo Geo version received a positive critical reception.

Japanese buyers had the choice of either a naturally aspirated DOHC V6 and twin-turbocharged DOHC V6.\n\nIn Europe, only the Twin Turbo model was offered. Instead of the TD04-09B turbochargers used on Japanese and US Twin Turbo models, the EU-spec model received the higher capacity TD04-13G turbochargers.

They were unveiled in August 1993 in Japan and gradually made their way to other markets as the first generation cars sold out. Some markets didn't get these models until 1996, such as the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/reviews/mitsubishi/3000gt/buying/|title=Mitsubishi 3000GT (1992 - 2000)|website=Honest John|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref> The caps on the hood were replaced with integrated sheet metal blisters, and revised side air vents and rear bumpers were added. The interior was redesigned with dual air bags, a new audio system, and revised air conditioning refrigerant. The engines in the twin-turbo models received an increase to {{convert|320|hp|0|abbr=on}} and an increase in torque from {{convert|307|to|315|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Japanese models received an increase in torque, but the power rating remained unchanged at {{convert|280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe VR-4 model now included a six-speed [[Getrag]] [[manual transmission]] with revised gear ratios, especially in lower gears like 3rd which went until approximately {{convert|107|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} (vs the first generation 3000GT VR-4's third gear which went until {{convert|120|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}). Larger wheel/tire combinations were provided beginning in 1995. The base and SL model received 16\" wheels in silver or chrome with 225/55 tires, while the VR4 now had 18\" chrome wheels with 245/40 tires (the Spyder had the standard 17\" with higher profile tires from 1994 to handle the additional {{convert|400|lb|abbr=on}} of weight). With subsequent price increases, features were discontinued: the tunable exhaust was phased out after 1994 model year, the ECS after 1995 model year, and the active aerodynamics disappeared after 1996. This was also when Chrysler ceased sales of the Dodge Stealth captive import, and for the remainder of its life only Mitsubishi-badged versions were available.\n\nChrysler and Mitsubishi worked with [[American Sunroof Company|ASC]] to engineer and convert 3000GTs into [[retractable hardtop]]s, marketed as the Spyder VR4 for 1995 and 1996 model years.\n\nIn 1995, Mitsubishi's 3000GT Spyder was available in four color combinations: red with grey leather interior, black with ivory leather interior, white pearl with grey, and martinique yellow with ivory leather interior. In 1996 the 3000GT Spyder was available in red with tan interior, black pearl with tan leather, white pearl with tan leather interior, and green pearl with tan leather. SL Spyders were only available with an automatic transmission while the VR4 Spyder was only available with a 6-speed manual.\n\n===GTO MR===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe GTO MR model appeared in the Japanese market in August 1994. The \u2018Mitsubishi Racing\u2019 or MR moniker, has been used in most performance Mitsubishis such as the [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution|Lancer Evolution]], and usually meant a lighter model. The GTO MR was essentially a lightweight GTO Twin Turbo that deleted 4WS, ABS, ECS and Active Aero, but was mechanically identical to the normal GTO Twin Turbo. Chassis numbers for the MR start with Z15A.\n\n[[Best Motoring]], a Japanese television program about Japanese cars, debuted the 1994 GTO MR in an hour long program where it beat the lighter R32 [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|Skyline GT-R]] over a mile in acceleration.\n\n===Reception===\n\nThe redesign of the second generation 3000GT was well received, especially the loss of pop up headlights and smoother hood. As the years went on, the Tuneable Exhaust System was phased out in 1995 and the Active Aero was phased out in 1996, allowing for less weight, which made the vehicle much quicker. The new 6-speed, while notchy, was geared well and the extra horsepower and torque allowed it to out-accelerate most of its rivals, especially from a standing start to top speed.\n\nRoad tests at the time showed the second generation 3000GT VR-4 to be capable of {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 4.8 - 5.4&nbsp;seconds<ref>{{cite web |title=Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, Porsche 911 Turbo, and Toyota Supra Turbo - Performance Imports |url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/mitsubishi-3000gt-vr4/ |accessdate=21 June 2019 |date=1 May 1997}}</ref> and the quarter mile in 13.5&nbsp;seconds at {{convert|101|to|105|mph|km/h|abbr=}}, making it faster in a straight line than the [[Nissan 300ZX]] Twin Turbo and [[Mazda RX-7]] Twin Turbo.<ref>{{cite web |title=Virtual Velocity - Cover Story - MotorTrend |url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/virtual-velocity/ |website=MotorTrend |accessdate=16 June 2019 |date=1 July 1995}}</ref><ref name=\"ref5\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=1994-1999 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4 / GTO / 3000 GT VR-4 - Modern Racer - Auto Archive |url=https://www.modernracer.com/mitsubishi3000gtvr4.html |website=www.modernracer.com |accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref> Though heavy, it could be taken around a track quickly, with noted under steer and a feeling of nose heaviness.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20em\" | Model name\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Engine\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Peak power\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Peak torque\n|-\n| Dodge Stealth (United States, Canada)\n| SOHC 12v V6\n| {{convert|119|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,500&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|250|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n| Mitsubishi 3000GT, 3000GT SL, 3000GT SL Spyder (United States); Mitsubishi GTO SR (Japan); Stealth R/T (United States, Canada)\n| DOHC 24v V6\n| {{convert|166|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|277|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n| Mitsubishi GTO twin turbo, GTO MR (Japan)\n| DOHC 24v V6 twin turbo\n| {{convert|206|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|427|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n| Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, 3000GT VR-4 Spyder (United States); Dodge Stealth R/T twin-turbo (United States, Canada)\n| DOHC 24v V6 twin turbo\n| {{convert|238.4|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|427|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n|}\n\n==1997\u20132000 Z15AM ==\n[[File:Mitsubishi GTO twin turbo (8979617131).jpg|thumb|The 1999 VR-4 featured a distinguished inverted airfoil spoiler]]\n\nThe [[SOHC]] engine, previously only available in the base model Stealth, was added to the Mitsubishi range after the Dodge version was discontinued.

They resurrected the GTO name, and the car went on to serve as Mitsubishi's flagship for the remainder of the decade. Despite the cachet of the badge at home, it was marketed as the Mitsubishi 3000GT and as the Dodge Stealth outside Japan; the company was concerned that [[connoisseur]]s would object to the evocative nameplate from the highly regarded [[Ferrari 250 GTO]] and [[Pontiac GTO]] being used on a Japanese vehicle.\n\nEach was built on the same production line at Mitsubishi's plant in [[Nagoya]], Japan.<ref>[http://www.stealth316.com/2-production.htm \"3000GT/Stealth Production Numbers\"], Michael Reid & Jeff Lucius, stealth316.com, 2000\u20132004</ref> Its Japanese introduction coincided with the softening Japanese economy, subsequently known as the [[Japanese asset price bubble|\"bubble economy\"]].\n\nJDM GTOs were marketed at Mitsubishi's ''[[Mitsubishi Motors#Japan Sales Channels|Car Plaza]]'' retail chain, with JDM buyers paying additional annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] as well as elevated taxes for being classified as a large car by Japan's [[Vehicle size class#Japan|exterior dimension regulations]].\n\nA Dodge Stealth was scheduled as a 1991 [[Indianapolis 500]] [[pace car]], until the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) rejected it because of its Japanese rather than US-manufacture.

Japanese buyers had the choice of either a naturally aspirated DOHC V6 and twin-turbocharged DOHC V6.\n\nIn Europe, only the Twin Turbo model was offered. Instead of the TD04-09B turbochargers used on Japanese and US Twin Turbo models, the EU-spec model received the higher capacity TD04-13G turbochargers.

They were unveiled in August 1993 in Japan and gradually made their way to other markets as the first generation cars sold out. Some markets didn't get these models until 1996, such as the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/reviews/mitsubishi/3000gt/buying/|title=Mitsubishi 3000GT (1992 - 2000)|website=Honest John|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref> The caps on the hood were replaced with integrated sheet metal blisters, and revised side air vents and rear bumpers were added. The interior was redesigned with dual air bags, a new audio system, and revised air conditioning refrigerant. The engines in the twin-turbo models received an increase to {{convert|320|hp|0|abbr=on}} and an increase in torque from {{convert|307|to|315|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Japanese models received an increase in torque, but the power rating remained unchanged at {{convert|280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe VR-4 model now included a six-speed [[Getrag]] [[manual transmission]] with revised gear ratios, especially in lower gears like 3rd which went until approximately {{convert|107|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} (vs the first generation 3000GT VR-4's third gear which went until {{convert|120|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}). Larger wheel/tire combinations were provided beginning in 1995. The base and SL model received 16\" wheels in silver or chrome with 225/55 tires, while the VR4 now had 18\" chrome wheels with 245/40 tires (the Spyder had the standard 17\" with higher profile tires from 1994 to handle the additional {{convert|400|lb|abbr=on}} of weight). With subsequent price increases, features were discontinued: the tunable exhaust was phased out after 1994 model year, the ECS after 1995 model year, and the active aerodynamics disappeared after 1996. This was also when Chrysler ceased sales of the Dodge Stealth captive import, and for the remainder of its life only Mitsubishi-badged versions were available.\n\nChrysler and Mitsubishi worked with [[American Sunroof Company|ASC]] to engineer and convert 3000GTs into [[retractable hardtop]]s, marketed as the Spyder VR4 for 1995 and 1996 model years.\n\nIn 1995, Mitsubishi's 3000GT Spyder was available in four color combinations: red with grey leather interior, black with ivory leather interior, white pearl with grey, and martinique yellow with ivory leather interior. In 1996 the 3000GT Spyder was available in red with tan interior, black pearl with tan leather, white pearl with tan leather interior, and green pearl with tan leather. SL Spyders were only available with an automatic transmission while the VR4 Spyder was only available with a 6-speed manual.\n\n===GTO MR===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe GTO MR model appeared in the Japanese market in August 1994. The \u2018Mitsubishi Racing\u2019 or MR moniker, has been used in most performance Mitsubishis such as the [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution|Lancer Evolution]], and usually meant a lighter model. The GTO MR was essentially a lightweight GTO Twin Turbo that deleted 4WS, ABS, ECS and Active Aero, but was mechanically identical to the normal GTO Twin Turbo. Chassis numbers for the MR start with Z15A.\n\n[[Best Motoring]], a Japanese television program about Japanese cars, debuted the 1994 GTO MR in an hour long program where it beat the lighter R32 [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|Skyline GT-R]] over a mile in acceleration.\n\n===Reception===\n\nThe redesign of the second generation 3000GT was well received, especially the loss of pop up headlights and smoother hood. As the years went on, the Tuneable Exhaust System was phased out in 1995 and the Active Aero was phased out in 1996, allowing for less weight, which made the vehicle much quicker. The new 6-speed, while notchy, was geared well and the extra horsepower and torque allowed it to out-accelerate most of its rivals from a standing start to top speed or from a rolling start.\n\nRoad tests at the time showed the second generation 3000GT VR-4 to be capable of {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 4.8 - 5.4&nbsp;seconds<ref>{{cite web |title=Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, Porsche 911 Turbo, and Toyota Supra Turbo - Performance Imports |url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/mitsubishi-3000gt-vr4/ |accessdate=21 June 2019 |date=1 May 1997}}</ref> and the quarter mile in 13.5&nbsp;seconds at {{convert|101|to|105|mph|km/h|abbr=}}, making it faster in a straight line than the [[Nissan 300ZX]] Twin Turbo and [[Mazda RX-7]] Twin Turbo.<ref>{{cite web |title=Virtual Velocity - Cover Story - MotorTrend |url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/virtual-velocity/ |website=MotorTrend |accessdate=16 June 2019 |date=1 July 1995}}</ref><ref name=\"ref5\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=1994-1999 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4 / GTO / 3000 GT VR-4 - Modern Racer - Auto Archive |url=https://www.modernracer.com/mitsubishi3000gtvr4.html |website=www.modernracer.com |accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref> Though heavy, it could be taken around a track quickly, with noted under steer and a feeling of nose heaviness.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20em\" | Model name\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Engine\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Peak power\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Peak torque\n|-\n| Dodge Stealth (United States, Canada)\n| SOHC 12v V6\n| {{convert|119|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,500&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|250|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n| Mitsubishi 3000GT, 3000GT SL, 3000GT SL Spyder (United States); Mitsubishi GTO SR (Japan); Stealth R/T (United States, Canada)\n| DOHC 24v V6\n| {{convert|166|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|277|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n| Mitsubishi GTO twin turbo, GTO MR (Japan)\n| DOHC 24v V6 twin turbo\n| {{convert|206|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|427|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n| Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, 3000GT VR-4 Spyder (United States); Dodge Stealth R/T twin-turbo (United States, Canada)\n| DOHC 24v V6 twin turbo\n| {{convert|238.4|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|427|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n|}\n\n==1997\u20132000 Z15AM ==\n[[File:Mitsubishi GTO twin turbo (8979617131).jpg|thumb|The 1999 VR-4 featured a distinguished inverted airfoil spoiler]]\n\nThe [[SOHC]] engine, previously only available in the base model Stealth, was added to the Mitsubishi range after the Dodge version was discontinued. Slower sales in the American sports car market led to a planned facelift for 1997 being abandoned in favor of minor cosmetic adjustments, including a new front bumper and rainbow shaped arched type wing. In 1999, the car received another exterior makeover, including a new aggressive front bumper, headlamps, turn signals, sail panels, and a true inverted airfoil spoiler coined the \"Combat Wing\" for the 1999 VR-4 to distinguish it from previous models. 1999 was the final year the 3000GT was available in the U.S. market. With sales slowing to a trickle and new [[Side collision|side impact]] regulations looming, production for the [[Japanese domestic market]] finally ceased in 2000.<ref name=response>{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160624215657/http://response.jp/article/2000/07/13/3137.html | archivedate = 2016-06-24 | url = http://response.jp/article/2000/07/13/3137.html | title = \u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u30ab\u30fc\u306f\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u3001\u4e09\u83f1\u300eFTO\u300f\u3068\u300eGTO\u300f\u304c\u63c3\u3063\u3066\u5ec3\u6b62 | trans-title = Sports cars unnecessary, Mitsubishi FTO and GTO discontinued | language = ja | date = 2000-07-13 | first = Shinichi | last = Ishida | publisher = IID, Inc. | work = Response.jp }}</ref> A last two cars were sold the following year.<ref>[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/ir/share/pdf/e/fact2005.pdf Fact & Figures 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305232559/http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/ir/share/pdf/e/fact2005.pdf |date=2007-03-05 }}, Mitsubishi Motors website</ref> In a test by [[Popular Mechanics]] the VR-4 ran a 13.44 seconds quarter mile (~402 m) at {{convert|101.7|mph|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=Popular Mechanics |date=July 1999 |publisher=Hearst Magazines |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SGYEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA86&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=18 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20em\" | Model name\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Engine\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Peak power\n! style=\"width:12em\" | Peak torque\n|-\n| Mitsubishi 3000GT (United States)\n| SOHC 12v V6\n| {{convert|119|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,500&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|250|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n| Mitsubishi 3000GT SL (United States); Mitsubishi GTO SR (Japan)\n| DOHC 24v V6\n| {{convert|163|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|277|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n| Mitsubishi GTO twin turbo, Mitsubishi GTO MR (Japan)\n| DOHC 24v V6 twin turbo\n| {{convert|206|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|427|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n| Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 (United States)\n| DOHC 24v V6 twin turbo\n| {{convert|238.4|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm\n| {{convert|427|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,500&nbsp;rpm\n|}\n\n==All years Z11A ==\nThe Z11A chassis code was used for the 3000GT ES and SL, and the base Dodge Stealth. The Mitsubishis lacked the \"twin turbo\" writing on the faux windows. The Dodges had different bumpers than the turbo cars. Otherwise the non-turbo cars looked cosmetically like the turbo cars. These cars were front wheel drive and lacked four-wheel steering and active aero. They came with a 5 speed manual (F5M33) or with automatic transmissions. Both the [[DOHC]] and [[SOHC]] 6G72 V6 was offered in this platform, with the DOHC being the more powerful.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{gallery | width = 200 |title=| height = 130\n|File:Red92VR4rear.jpg|The Active Aero spoiler on a 1992 3000GT VR-4\n|File:Dodge Stealth Indy 500 Officialcar1991.jpg|1991 Dodge Stealth [[Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]] official car\n|File:1991 Dodge Stealth RT front left.jpg|A 1991 Dodge Stealth RT\n|File:White Mitsubishi 3000GT front.jpg|A 1995 base model 3000GT\n}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD LINKS WITHOUT PRIOR DISCUSSION ON THE TALK PAGE.
