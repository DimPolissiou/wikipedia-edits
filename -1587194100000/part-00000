Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign for [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and the fifth for [[Kofi Kingston]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[John Morrison and The Miz]]) on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 19 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] were the inaugural champions. [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at five, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at five. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days). The oldest champion is Shane McMahon, winning the title at 49 years old, while the youngest is [[Jason Jordan]] when he won it at 28.\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|team=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Heath|Slater}} and {{sortname||Rhyno|Rhyno}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|September 11, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 4, 2016}}\n|days2    = {{age in days nts|September 11, 2016|December 3, 2016}}\n|location = [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]\n|event    = [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]]\n|notes    = As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]], the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].

The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign for [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and the fifth for [[Kofi Kingston]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[John Morrison and The Miz]]) on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 19 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy.

[[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at five, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at five. As a team and individually, [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 381 days (380 days as recognized by WWE). [[The Miz]] & [[Shane McMahon]] and [[The Hardy Boyz]] ([[Jeff Hardy]] and [[Matt Hardy]]) are tied with the shortest reign at 21 days (although WWE recognizes The Hardy Boyz as the shortest at 20 days).

It was originally released in 1971 on the album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' but later appeared as the B-side of \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\" in the UK in 1974.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Rebel Rebel\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1974|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=LPB05009}}</ref>\n\nBowie was a great [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] fan and wrote the song in tribute to the band and [[Lou Reed]].<ref name=\"TIME - 02Nov2006 - All-TIME 100 Albums - Hunky Dory\">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2006/11/02/the-all-time-100-albums/#hunky-dory|title=All-TIME 100 Albums - Hunky Dory|last=[[Josh Tyrangiel]]|date=November 2, 2006|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref> He recorded a studio cover of Reed's \"[[I'm Waiting for the Man]]\" in 1967 (which remains unissued), as well as live versions, which may be heard on ''[[Bowie at the Beeb]]'' and on ''Live Nassau Coliseum '76'' (in the 2010 special edition and deluxe edition re-issues of ''[[Station to Station]]'').\n\n\"Queen Bitch\" starts with Bowie counting down to his acoustic guitar before [[Mick Ronson]]'s thrashy guitar riff enters.  The song's arrangement, featuring a melodic bass line, a tight drum pattern, choppy distorted guitar chords, and an understated vocal performance by Bowie, provided the template for the [[glam rock]] style that features prominently on ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', his seminal 1972 follow-up to ''Hunky Dory''. While the main riff is similar to The Velvet Underground's \"[[Sweet Jane]]\", it is actually lifted from [[Eddie Cochran]]'s \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\".<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/gp/music/wma-pop-up/B000000CWK001011 Amazon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (a posthumous number 1 hit single in the UK in 1960).\n\n==Live versions==\n* Bowie played the song on the [[BBC]] radio show ''Sounds of the 70s'' on 18 January 1972.
