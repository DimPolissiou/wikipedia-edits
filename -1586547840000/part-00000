The study focused on 11 diseases which cause relatively few deaths at present and primarily strike the poor. The authors estimated that it would cost between US$2.8 billion and US$3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of the diseases. This should be set against the potential cost of an outbreak. The 2003 SARS outbreak in East Asia cost US$54 billion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scientists have estimated the cost of stopping 11 diseases that could kill millions in a pandemic |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/22/17999676/vaccine-ebola-pandemic-disease-zika-epidemic-sars?platform=hootsuite |accessdate=2 December 2018 |publisher=Vox |date=22 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30346-2/fulltext | title=Estimating the cost of vaccine development against epidemic infectious diseases: a cost minimisation study | journal=The Lancet | year=2018 | volume=6 | issue=12 | pmid=30342925 | last1=Gouglas | first1=D. | last2=Thanh Le | first2=T. | last3=Henderson | first3=K. | last4=Kaloudis | first4=A. | last5=Danielsen | first5=T. | last6=Hammersland | first6=N.

The study focused on 11 diseases which cause relatively few deaths at present and primarily strike the poor. The authors estimated that it would cost between US$2.8 billion and US$3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of the diseases. This should be set against the potential cost of an outbreak.

For example, a duck (or turkey) crosses \"because it was the chicken's day off,\" and a dinosaur crosses \"because chickens didn't exist yet.\" Some variants are both puns and references to the original, such as \"Why did the duck cross the road?\" \"To prove he's no [[cowardice|chicken]]\".\n\nOther variations replace side with another word often to form a pun. Some examples are: \n<blockquote><q> \"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the idiot's house\". Which is then followed by a [[Knock-knock joke|knock knock joke]]: \"Knock knock\", \"Who's there?\" \"The chicken\".</q>\n\"Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide\"\n \n\"Why did the [[chewing gum]] cross the road? It was stuck to the chicken's foot\"\n\n\"Why did the whale cross the ocean? To get to the other tide.\"\n\nA mathematical version asks, \"Why did the chicken cross the [[M\u00f6bius strip]]?\" \"To get to the same side.\"</blockquote>\n\n* [[Gordon Ramsay]] \"Why did the chicken cross the road? \"Because you didn't cook it !\"\n\nAnother class of variations, designed for written rather than oral transmission, employs [[parody]] by pretending to have notable individuals or institutions give characteristic answers to the question posed by the riddle:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boyscouttrail.com/content/joke/joke-851.asp|title=Why Did the Chicken Cross the Road?

For example, an alternate punchline can be used for the riddle, such as \"it was too far to walk around\".<ref name=rlones>{{cite book|last1=Audlin|first1=James David|title=Rats Live on no Evil Star|publisher=lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4716-0809-4|page=192|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=kcPNBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA192|accessdate=5 October 2015}}{{self-published source}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} One class of variations enlists a creature other than the chicken to cross the road, in order to refer back to the original riddle. For example, a duck (or turkey) crosses \"because it was the chicken's day off,\" and a dinosaur crosses \"because chickens didn't exist yet.\" Some variants are both puns and references to the original, such as \"Why did the duck cross the road?\" \"To prove he's no [[cowardice|chicken]]\".\n\nOther variations replace side with another word often to form a pun. Some examples are: \n<blockquote><q> \"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the idiot's house\". Which is then followed by a [[Knock-knock joke|knock knock joke]]: \"Knock knock\", \"Who's there?\" \"The chicken\".</q>\n\"Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide\"\n \n\"Why did the [[chewing gum]] cross the road? It was stuck to the chicken's foot\"\n\n\"Why did the whale cross the ocean? To get to the other tide.\"\n\nA mathematical version asks, \"Why did the chicken cross the [[M\u00f6bius strip]]?\" \"To get to the same side.\"</blockquote>\n\nAnother class of variations, designed for written rather than oral transmission, employs [[parody]] by pretending to have notable individuals or institutions give characteristic answers to the question posed by the riddle:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boyscouttrail.com/content/joke/joke-851.asp|title=Why Did the Chicken Cross the Road? Joke|work=boyscouttrail.com}}</ref>\n<blockquote><q>Why did the chicken cross the road?</q>\n* [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]: <q>It had a dream.</q>\n* [[Colonel Sanders]]: <q>I missed one?</q>\n* [[Isaac Newton]]: <q>Chickens at rest tend to stay at rest. Chickens in motion tend to cross the road.</q></blockquote>\n\nAs with the [[lightbulb joke]], variants on these themes are widespread.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite web|title=Why did the chicken cross the road?

Any general conclusions beyond the study context are considered tentative propositions (informed assertions), since the general propositions are not usually arrived at on the basis of statistical theory.{{cn|date=January 2019}} [[Quantitative methods]] are, therefore, needed to seek mathematical evidence and justification for such hypotheses for further research.\n\nIn contrast, a qualitative researcher might argue that understanding of a phenomenon or situation or event, comes from exploring the totality of the situation (e.g., [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[symbolic interactionism]]), often with access to large amounts of \"hard data\" of a nonnumerical form. It may begin as a [[grounded theory]] approach with the researcher having no previous understanding of the phenomenon; or the study may commence with propositions and proceed in a 'scientific and empirical way' throughout the research process (e.g., Bogdan & Taylor, 1990).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bogdan |first=R. |last2=Taylor |first2=S. |year=1987 |title=Looking at the bright side: A positive approach to qualitative policy and evaluation research |journal=[[Qualitative Sociology]] |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=183\u2013192 |doi=10.1007/BF00989686 }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=\"We can distinguish between those which follow the logic of quantitative methods in their rules and criteria and make generalizations in a numerical sense (i. e. from numerous cases to more numerous cases), and those clearly qualitative methods where interpretations and generalizations are not based on the frequency of occurrence of certain social phenomena but on a logic of generalizing from an individual case, whether this case is a personal biography, an organization or a particular milieu or social setting; this includes making microscopic and thick descriptions (see Geertz 1973) of the phenomena in which we are interested, likewise with the aim of generalizing from an individual case.\"|sign=[[Gabriele Rosenthal]]|source=(2018: 13): Interpretive Social Research.

Becker]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Becker |first=H.

These researchers embraced a qualitative research [[paradigm]], attempting to make qualitative research as \"rigorous\" as quantitative research and creating myriad methods for qualitative research. Such developments were necessary as qualitative researchers won national center awards, in collaboration with their research colleagues at other universities and departments; and university administrations funded Ph.D.s in both arenas through the ensuing decades. Most theoretical constructs involve a process of qualitative analysis and understanding, and construction of these concepts (e.g., Wolfensberger's social role valorization theories).<ref>Wolfensberger, W. (1994). \"A Brief Introduction to Social Role Valorization as High-Order Concept for Structuring Human Services\" (2nd Edition). Syracuse, NY: Training Institute for Human Service Planning, Leadership and Change Agentry, Syracuse University.</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the increasing ubiquity of computers aided in qualitative analyses, several journals with a qualitative focus emerged, and [[postpositivism]] gained recognition in the academy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} In the late 1980s, questions of identity emerged, including issues of race, class, gender, and discourse communities, leading to research and writing becoming more [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]]. Throughout the 1990s, the concept of a passive observer/researcher was rejected, and qualitative research became more participatory and activist-oriented with support from the federal branches, such as the National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation (NIDRR) of the US Department of Education (e.g., Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers for Family and Community Living, 1990). Also, during this time, researchers began to use mixed-method approaches, indicating a shift in thinking of qualitative and quantitative methods as intrinsically incompatible. However, this history is not apolitical, as this has ushered in a politics of \"evidence\" (e.g., evidence-based practices in health and human services) and what can count as \"scientific\" research in scholarship, a current, ongoing debate in the academy.\n\n==Data collection==\nQualitative researchers face many choices for techniques to generate data ranging from [[grounded theory]]<ref>Glaser, B.G. & Strauss, A.I. (1967). \"The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research\". NY, NY: Aldine DeGruyter.</ref> development and practice, [[narratology]], [[Organizational storytelling|storytelling]], [[transcript poetry]], [[Biographical research|biographical narrative interviews]], classical [[ethnography]], [[state or governmental studies]], [[research and service demonstrations]], [[focus groups]], [[case studies]], [[participant observation]], qualitative review of statistics in order to predict future happenings, or [[Job shadowing|shadowing]], surveys (including telephone surveys and consumer satisfaction surveys), among many others. Qualitative methods are used in various methodological approaches, such as [[action research]] which has sociological basis, or [[actor-network theory]].\n\nThe interview (structured, semi-structured or unstructured) is a common source of data on the qualities/categories of interest. Interviewees are often identified through sophisticated and sometimes, elitist, snowballing techniques. In fields that study households, a much debated topic is whether interviews should be conducted individually or collectively (e.g. as [[Couple interview|couple interviews).]]\n\nAnother method of qualitative data collection is the use of [[Focus group|focus groups]]. The focus group technique (e.g., Morgan, 1988) involves a moderator facilitating a small group discussion between selected individuals on a particular topic, with video and written data recorded, and is useful in a coordinated research approach studying phenomenon in diverse ways in different environments with distinct stakeholders often excluded from traditional processes. This method is a particularly popular in [[market research]] and testing new initiatives with users/workers. \n\nOther sources include focus groups, observation (without a predefined theory like [[statistical theory]] in mind for example), reflective field notes, texts, pictures, photographs and other images, interactions and practice captured on audio or video recordings, public (e.g. official) personal documents, historical items, and websites and social media.<ref>{{cite book |last=Savin-Baden |first=M. |last2=Major |first2=C. |title=Qualitative Research: The Essential Guide to Theory and Practice |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=S.

In doing so, the aim is for the researcher to gain a closer insight into the culture's practices, motivations, and emotions. It is argued that the researchers' ability to understand the experiences of the culture may be inhibited if they observe without participating.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Participant observation is a strategy of reflexive learning, not a single method of observing.<ref>Lindlof, T. R., & Taylor, B. C. (2002) ''Qualitative communication research methods: Second edition''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|0-7619-2493-0}}</ref> and has been described as a continuum of between participation and observation. The ways of participating and observing can vary widely from setting to setting as exemplified by Helen Schwartzman's primer on Ethnography in Organizations (1993).<ref>Schwartzman, H.B.

Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.</ref>\n== Coding ==\n{{main|Coding (social sciences)}}\nIn general, coding refers to the act of associating meaningful ideas with the data of interest. In the context of qualitative research, interpretative aspects of the coding process are often explicitly recognized, articulated, and celebrated; producing specific words or short phrases believed to be useful [[Abstraction|abstractions]] over the data.\n\nAs an act of sense making, most coding requires the qualitative analyst to read the data and demarcate segments within it, which may be done at multiple and different times throughout the data analysis process.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saldana|first=Johnny|title=The Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers|publisher=Sage|year=2012|isbn=978-1446247372|location=|pages=}}</ref>   Each segment is labeled with a 'code' \u2013 usually a word or short phrase suggesting how the associated data segments inform the research objectives. In contrast with more quantitative forms of coding, mathematical ideas and forms are usually under-developed in a 'pure' qualitative data analysis. When coding is complete, the analyst may prepare reports via a mix of: summarizing the prevalence of codes, discussing similarities and differences in related codes across distinct original sources/contexts, or comparing the relationship between one or more codes.\n\nSome qualitative data that is highly structured (e.g., open-ended responses from surveys or tightly defined interview questions) is typically coded with minimal additional segmentation of the data. Quantitative analysis based on codes from [[statistical theory]] is typically the capstone analytical step for this type of qualitative data. A common form of coding is open-ended coding, while other more structured techniques such as axial coding or integration have also been described and articulated (Strauss & Corbin, 1990).<ref>Strauss, A. & Corbin, J. (1990). ''Basics of Qualitative Research: Grounded Theory Procedures and Techniques.'' New Delhi: Sage.</ref> Because qualitative analyses are often more [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] than the hypothesis testing nature of most quantitative research, the existing 'theoretical sensitivity' (i.e., familiarity with established theories in the field) of the analyst becomes a more pressing concern in producing an acceptable analysis.\n\n==Data analysis==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\nThe data that is obtained is streamlined (texts of thousands of pages in length) to a definite theme or pattern, or representation of a theory or systemic issue or approach. This step in a theoretical analysis or data analytic technique is further worked on (e.g., gender analysis may be conducted; comparative policy analysis may be developed). An alternative research hypothesis is generated which finally provides the basis of the research statement for continuing work in the fields.\n\nTo analyze qualitative data, the researcher seeks meaning from all of the data that is available. The data may be categorized and sorted into patterns (i.e., pattern or thematic analyses) as the primary basis for organizing and reporting the study findings (e.g., activities in the home; interactions with government).<ref>{{cite book|last=Racino|first=J.|title=Challenges for a Service System in Transition: Ensuring Quality Community Experiences for Persons with Developmental Disabilities|last2=O'Connor|first2=S.|publisher=Paul H.

Whilst this crucial philosophical realization is also held by researchers in other fields, [[antipositivism|interpretivists]] are often the most aggressive in taking this philosophical realization to its logical conclusions. For example, an interpretivist researcher might believe in the existence of an objective reality 'out there', but argue that the social and educational reality we act on the basis of never allows a single human subject to directly access the reality 'out there' in reality (this is a view shared by [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist philosophies]]).\n\nTo researchers outside the qualitative research field, the most common analysis of qualitative data is often perceived to be observer impression. That is, expert or bystander observers examine the data, interpret it via forming an impression and report their impression in a structured and sometimes quantitative form.\n\n== Recursivity ==\nIn qualitative research, the idea of [[Recursion|recursivity]] is expressed in terms of the nature of its research procedures, which may be contrasted with [[Experiment|experimental forms]] of research design. From the experimental perspective, its major stages of research (data collection, data analysis, discussion of the data in context of the literature, and drawing conclusions) should be each undertaken once (or at most a small number of times) in a research study. In qualitative research however, all of the four stages above may be undertaken repeatedly until one or more specific stopping conditions are met, reflecting a nonstatic attitude to the planning and design of research activities. An example of this dynamicism might be when the qualitative researcher unexpectedly changes their research focus or design midway through a research study, based on their 1st interim data analysis, and then makes further unplanned changes again based on a 2nd interim data analysis; this would be a terrible thing to do from the perspective of an (predefined) experimental study of the same thing. Qualitative researchers would argue that their recursivity in developing the relevant evidence and reasoning, enables the researcher to be more open to unexpected results, more open to the potential of building new constructs, and the possibility of integrating them with the explanations developed continuously throughout a study.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite book|title=The Sage Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods.|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=2008|editor=Given, L.

Unknown''.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/21367/|title=A Six Step Guide to Using Recursive Abstraction Applied to the Qualitative Analysis of Interview Data.|access-date=6 April 2018|date=2014-02-10}}</ref> this is a method of qualitative data analysis where qualitative datasets are analyzed without coding. A common method here is recursive abstraction, where datasets are summarized; those summaries are therefore furthered into summary and so on.  The end result is a more compact summary that would have been difficult to accurately discern without the preceding steps of distillation.\n\nA frequent criticism of recursive abstraction is that the final conclusions are several times removed from the underlying data. While it is true that poor initial summaries will certainly yield an inaccurate final report, qualitative analysts can respond to this criticism.  They do so, like those using coding method, by documenting the reasoning behind each summary step, citing examples from the data where statements were included and where statements were excluded from the intermediate summary.\n\n== Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) ==\nContemporary qualitative data analyses are often supported by computer programs (termed [[computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software]]) used with or without the detailed hand coding and labeling of the past decades. These programs do not supplant the interpretive nature of coding, but rather are aimed at enhancing analysts' efficiency at applying, retrieving, and storing the codes generated from reading the data. Many programs enhance efficiency in editing and revision of codes, which allow for more effective work sharing, peer review, recursive examination of data, and analysis of large datasets.\n\nCommon qualitative data analysis software includes:\n\n* [[MAXQDA]] (mixed methods)\n* [[QDA Miner|QDA MINER]]\n* [[Atlas.ti|ATLAS.ti]]\n* [[Dedoose]] (mixed methods)\n* [[NVivo]]\n\nA frequent criticism of quantitative coding approaches is against the transformation of qualitative data into predefined ([[Nomothetic and idiographic|nomothetic]]) data structures, underpinned by [[Objectivity (science)|'objective properties]]'; the variety, richness, and individual characteristics of the qualitative data is argued to be largely omitted from such data coding processes, rendering the original collection of qualitative data somewhat pointless.\n\nTo defend against the criticism of too much [[Subjectivity|subjective variability]] in the categories and relationships identified from data, qualitative analysts respond by thoroughly articulating their definitions of codes and linking those codes soundly to the underlying data, thereby preserving some of the richness that might be absent from a mere list of codes, whilst satisfying the need for repeatable procedure held by [[Scientific experiment|experimentally]] oriented researchers.\n\n===Coding and \"thinking\"===\nSome data analysis techniques rely on using computers to scan and reduce large sets of qualitative data.  At their most basic level, numerical coding relies on counting words, phrases, or coincidences of tokens within the data; other similar techniques are the analyses of phrases and exchanges in conversational analyses.  Often referred to as [[content analysis]], a basic structural building block to conceptual analysis, the technique utilizes mixed methodology to unpack both small and large corpuses. Content analysis is frequently used in sociology to explore relationships, such as the change in perceptions of race over time (Morning 2008), or the lifestyles of temporal contractors (Evans, et al. 2004).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morning|first=Ann|date=2008|title=Reconstructing Race in Science and Society: Biology Textbooks, 1952-2002|url=|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=114 Suppl|pages=S106-37|doi=10.1086/592206|pmid=19569402|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=James |date=2004|title=Beach Time, Bridge Time and Billable Hours: The Temporal Structure of Temporal Contracting.|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201338|doi=|jstor=4131454|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/WTO/cgi-bin/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/pub_old/Evans_2004.pdf}}</ref> Content analysis techniques thus help to provide broader output for a larger, more accurate conceptual analysis.\n\nMechanical techniques are particularly well-suited for a few scenarios.  One such scenario is for datasets that are simply too large for a human to effectively analyze, or where analysis of them would be cost prohibitive relative to the value of information they contain.  Another scenario is when the chief value of a dataset is the extent to which it contains \"red flags\" (e.g., searching for reports of certain adverse events within a lengthy journal dataset from patients in a clinical trial) or \"green flags\" (e.g., searching for mentions of your brand in positive reviews of marketplace products). Many researchers would consider these procedures on their data sets to be misuse of their data collection and purposes.\n\nA frequent criticism of mechanical techniques is the absence of a human interpreter; computer analysis is relatively new having arrived in the late 1980s to the university sectors.  And while masters of these methods are able to write sophisticated software to mimic some human decisions, the bulk of the \"analysis\" is still nonhuman.  Analysts respond by proving the value of their methods relative to either a) hiring and training a human team to analyze the data or b) by letting the data go untouched, leaving any actionable nuggets undiscovered; almost all coding schemes indicate probably studies for further research.\n\nData sets and their analyses must also be written up, reviewed by other researchers, circulated for comments, and finalized for public review. Numerical coding must be available in the published articles, if the methodology and findings are to be compared across research studies in traditional literature review and recommendation formats.\n\n== Specialized uses ==\nThere are several different research approaches, or research designs, that qualitative researchers use.<ref>{{cite book|last=Creswell|first=John|title=Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Approaches|publisher=Sage|year=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Creswell|first=John|title=Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches|publisher=Sage|year=2008}}</ref>  In the academic social sciences, the most frequently used qualitative research approaches include the following points:\n\n# Basic/generic/pragmatic qualitative research, which involves using an eclectic approach taken up to best match the research question at hand. This is often called the mixed-method approach.\n# [[Ethnographic]] research.  An example of applied ethnographic research is the study of a particular culture and their understanding of the role of a particular disease in their cultural framework.\n# [[Grounded theory]] is an inductive type of research, based or \"grounded\" in the observations or data from which it was developed; it uses a variety of data sources, including quantitative data, review of records, interviews, observation and surveys.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=N.|last2=Birks|first2=M.|last3=Chapman|first3=Y.|date=29 September 2014|title=Contextual Positioning: Using Documents as Extant Data in Grounded Theory Research|journal=SAGE Open|volume=4|issue=3|pages=215824401455242|doi=10.1177/2158244014552425}}</ref>\n# [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenology]] describes the \"subjective reality\" of an event, as perceived by the study population; it is the study of a phenomenon.<ref>Gill, M. J. (2014). The Possibilities of Phenomenology for Organizational Research. Organizational Research Methods, 17:2, 118-137.</ref>\n# [[Biographical research]] is aligned to the social interpretive paradigm of research and is concerned with the reconstruction of [[Life history (sociology)|life histories]] and the constitution of meaning based on biographical narratives and documents. The starting point for this approach is the understanding of an individual biography in terms of its social constitution, as influenced by [[symbolic interactionism]], [[Sociology of knowledge|phenomenological sociology of knowledge]] ([[Alfred Sch\u00fctz]], [[Peter L. Berger]], and [[Thomas Luckmann]]), and [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]).\n# Philosophical research is conducted by field experts within the boundaries of a specific field of study or profession, the best qualified individual in any field of study to use an intellectual analysis, in order to clarify definitions, identify ethics, or make a value judgment concerning an issue in their field of study their lives.\n# [[Critical Social Research]], used by a researcher to understand how people communicate and develop symbolic meanings.\n# [[Ethical Inquiry]], an intellectual analysis of ethical problems.  It includes the study of ethics as related to obligation, rights, duty, right and wrong, choice etc.\n# Social science and Governmental Research to understand social services, government operations, and recommendations (or not) regarding future developments and programs, including whether or not government should be involved.\n# Activist research which aims to raise the views of the underprivileged or \"underdogs\" to prominence to the elite or master classes, the latter who often control the public view or positions.\n# Foundational research, examines the foundations for a science, analyzes the beliefs, and develops ways to specify how a knowledge base should change in light of new information.\n# Historical research allows one to discuss past and present events in the context of the present condition, and allows one to reflect and provide possible answers to current issues and problems. Historical research helps us in answering questions such as: Where have we come from, where are we, who are we now and where are we going?\n# Visual ethnography. It uses visual methods of data collection, including photo, voice, photo elicitation, collaging, drawing, and mapping. These techniques have been used extensively as a participatory qualitative technique and to make the familiar strange.<ref>Mannay, D. 2013. \u2018Who put that on there... why why why?:\u2019 Power games and participatory techniques of visual data production.

Survey items are piloted on study participants to test the reliability and validity of the items. This approach is similar to psychological testing using an intelligence test like the WAIS (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Survey) in which the interviewer records \"qualitative\" (i.e., clinical observations) throughout the testing process. Qualitative research is often useful in a sociological lens. Qualitative research can shed light on the intricacies in the functionality of society and human interaction.\n\n==Distinct qualitative paradigms==\nContemporary qualitative research has been conducted using a large number of [[paradigm]]s that influence conceptual and [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] concerns of legitimacy, control, [[data analysis]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], among others.  Qualitative research conducted in the twenty-first century has been characterized by a distinct turn toward more [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretive]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]], and [[critical theory|critical]] practices.<ref name=\"Guba, E. G. 2005 pp. 191-215\">Guba, E. G., & Lincoln, Y. S. (2005). \"Paradigmatic controversies, contradictions, and emerging influences\" In N. K. Denzin & Y. S. Lincoln (Eds.), ''The Sage Handbook of Qualitative Research'' (3rd ed.), pp. 191-215. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|0-7619-2757-3}}</ref>  Guba and Lincoln (2005) identify five main paradigms of contemporary qualitative research: [[positivism]], [[postpositivism]], [[critical theory|critical theories]], [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]], and participatory/cooperative paradigms.<ref name=\"Guba, E. G. 2005 pp. 191-215\"/>  Each of the paradigms listed by Guba and Lincoln are characterized by axiomatic differences in [[axiology]], intended action/impact of research, control of research process/outcomes, relationship to foundations of truth and knowledge, validity and trust (see below), textual representation and voice of the researcher and research participants, and commensurability with other paradigms.  In particular, commensurability involves the extent to which concerns from 2 paradigms e.g., \"can be retrofitted to each other in ways that make the simultaneous practice of both possible\".<ref>Guba, E. G., & Lincoln, Y. S. (2005). \"Paradigmatic controversies, contradictions, and emerging influences\" (p. 200). In N. K. Denzin & Y. S. Lincoln (Eds.), ''The Sage Handbook of Qualitative Research'' (3rd ed.), pp. 191-215. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|0-7619-2757-3}}</ref> Positivist and post positivist paradigms share commensurable assumptions, but are largely incommensurable with critical, constructivist, and [[participatory]]<nowiki/> paradigms of research and knowledge.  Likewise, critical, constructivist, and participatory paradigms are commensurable on certain issues (e.g., the intended action and textual representation of research).\n\nQualitative research in the 2000s has also been characterized by concern with everyday categorization and ordinary storytelling.  This \"narrative turn\" is producing an enormous literature as researchers present sensitizing concepts and perspectives that bear especially on narrative practice, which centers on the circumstances and communicative actions of storytelling.  Catherine Riessman (1993)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Riessman|first=Catherine K.|title=Narrative Analysis|publisher=Sage|year=1993|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=}}</ref> and Gubrium and Holstein (2009)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gubrium, J. F. and Holstein, J. A.|title=Analyzing Narrative Reality|publisher=Sage|year=2009|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}</ref> provide analytic strategies, and Holstein and Gubrium (2012)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holstein, J. A. and Gubrium, J. F., eds.|title=Varieties of Narrative Analysis|publisher=Sage|year=2012|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}</ref> present the variety of approaches in recent comprehensive texts. More recent developments in narrative practice has increasingly taken up the issue of institutional conditioning of such practices (see Gubrium and Holstein 2000).\n\nHowever, not all scholars agree on the usefulness of paradigms. A critical view of understanding qualitative inquiry vis-\u00e0-vis paradigms has been recently put forth by Pernecky (2016),<ref>{{cite book |last=Pernecky |first=T. |year=2016 |title=Epistemology and Metaphysics for Qualitative Research |location=London |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]}}</ref> who has argued that problems arise when paradigms are \"interpreted in a rigid fashion and compartmentalized into static schemata\" (p. 18). It is therefore more fruitful to think in terms of flows and continuums, and even embrace a post-paradigmatic qualitative research. In his words:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The problem with laying down prescriptive rules about what qualitative research is and how it ought to proceed lies in the narrowing of the possibilities of an abundant and constantly devolving body of philosophical thought. When we accept paradigms uncritically as the \u2018givens\u2019, qualitative knowledge becomes habituated, and paradigms grow into hegemonic systems of organization (Pernecky, 2016, p. 194)\".}}\n\n==Trustworthiness==\nA central issue in qualitative research is trustworthiness (also known as credibility, or in quantitative studies, validity). There are many different ways of establishing trustworthiness, including: [[member check]], interviewer corroboration, peer debriefing, prolonged engagement, negative case analysis, auditability, confirmability, bracketing, and balance. Most of these methods are described in Lincoln and Guba (1985).<ref>Lincoln Y and Guba EG (1985) ''Naturalistic Inquiry'', Sage Publications, Newbury Park, CA.</ref> As exemplified by researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg, data triangulation and eliciting examples of interviewee accounts are two of the most commonly used methods of establishing trustworthiness in qualitative studies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Constraining or Enabling Green Capability Development? How Policy Uncertainty Affects Organizational Responses to Flexible Environmental Regulations|journal=British Journal of Management|volume=28|issue=4|pages=649\u2013665|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12188|pmid=|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/93826/1/WRAP-constraining-enabling-green-policy-flexible-Sandberg-2017.pdf}}</ref>\nDependability is equivalent to the notion of reliability in quantitative methods and is the extent to which two or more people are likely to come to the same conclusions by examining the same evidence. Again, Lincoln and Guba (1985) is the salient reference.\n\n==Journals==\nBy the end of the 1970s many leading journals began to publish qualitative research articles<ref name=\"Loseke, Donileen R. 2007 pp. 491-506\">Loseke, Donileen R. & Cahil, Spencer E.

Wundt advocated the strong relation between psychology and philosophy. He believed that there was a gap between psychology and quantitative research that could only be filled by conducting qualitative research.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Qualitative research dove into aspects of human life that could not adequately be covered by quantitative research; aspects such as culture, expression, beliefs, morality and imagination.<ref name=\"Wertz, Charmaz 2011\">Wertz, Charmaz, McMullen. \"Five Ways of Doing Qualitative Analysis: Phenomenological Psychology, Grounded Theory, Discourse Analysis, Narrative Research, and Intuitive Inquiry\". 16-18.

Print.</ref>\n\nThere are records of qualitative research being used in psychology before World War II, but prior to the 1950s, these methods were viewed as invalid. Owing to this, many of the psychologists who practiced qualitative research denied the usage of such methods or apologized for doing so. It was not until the late 20th century when qualitative research was accepted in elements of psychology though it remains controversial.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The excitement about the groundbreaking form of research was short-lived as few novel findings emerged which gained attention.

It may begin as a [[grounded theory]] approach with the researcher having no previous understanding of the phenomenon; or the study may commence with propositions and proceed in a 'scientific and empirical way' throughout the research process (e.g., Bogdan & Taylor, 1990).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bogdan |first=R. |last2=Taylor |first2=S. |year=1987 |title=Looking at the bright side: A positive approach to qualitative policy and evaluation research |journal=[[Qualitative Sociology]] |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=183\u2013192 |doi=10.1007/BF00989686 }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=\"We can distinguish between those which follow the logic of quantitative methods in their rules and criteria and make generalizations in a numerical sense (i. e. from numerous cases to more numerous cases), and those clearly qualitative methods where interpretations and generalizations are not based on the frequency of occurrence of certain social phenomena but on a logic of generalizing from an individual case, whether this case is a personal biography, an organization or a particular milieu or social setting; this includes making microscopic and thick descriptions (see Geertz 1973) of the phenomena in which we are interested, likewise with the aim of generalizing from an individual case.\"|sign=[[Gabriele Rosenthal]]|source=(2018: 13): Interpretive Social Research.

Becker]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Becker |first=H.

These researchers embraced a qualitative research [[paradigm]], attempting to make qualitative research as \"rigorous\" as quantitative research and creating myriad methods for qualitative research. Such developments were necessary as qualitative researchers won national center awards, in collaboration with their research colleagues at other universities and departments; and university administrations funded Ph.D.s in both arenas through the ensuing decades. Most theoretical constructs involve a process of qualitative analysis and understanding, and construction of these concepts (e.g., Wolfensberger's social role valorization theories).<ref>Wolfensberger, W. (1994). \"A Brief Introduction to Social Role Valorization as High-Order Concept for Structuring Human Services\" (2nd Edition). Syracuse, NY: Training Institute for Human Service Planning, Leadership and Change Agentry, Syracuse University.</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the increasing ubiquity of computers aided in qualitative analyses, several journals with a qualitative focus emerged, and [[postpositivism]] gained recognition in the academy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} In the late 1980s, questions of identity emerged, including issues of race, class, gender, and discourse communities, leading to research and writing becoming more [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]]. Throughout the 1990s, the concept of a passive observer/researcher was rejected, and qualitative research became more participatory and activist-oriented with support from the federal branches, such as the National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation (NIDRR) of the US Department of Education (e.g., Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers for Family and Community Living, 1990). Also, during this time, researchers began to use mixed-method approaches, indicating a shift in thinking of qualitative and quantitative methods as intrinsically incompatible. However, this history is not apolitical, as this has ushered in a politics of \"evidence\" (e.g., evidence-based practices in health and human services) and what can count as \"scientific\" research in scholarship, a current, ongoing debate in the academy.\n\n==Data collection==\nQualitative researchers face many choices for techniques to generate data ranging from [[grounded theory]]<ref>Glaser, B.G. & Strauss, A.I. (1967). \"The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research\". NY, NY: Aldine DeGruyter.</ref> development and practice, [[narratology]], [[Organizational storytelling|storytelling]], [[transcript poetry]], [[Biographical research|biographical narrative interviews]], classical [[ethnography]], [[state or governmental studies]], [[research and service demonstrations]], [[focus groups]], [[case studies]], [[participant observation]], qualitative review of statistics in order to predict future happenings, or [[Job shadowing|shadowing]], surveys (including telephone surveys and consumer satisfaction surveys), among many others. Qualitative methods are used in various methodological approaches, such as [[action research]] which has sociological basis, or [[actor-network theory]].\n\nThe interview (structured, semi-structured or unstructured) is a common source of data on the qualities/categories of interest. Interviewees are often identified through sophisticated and sometimes, elitist, snowballing techniques. In fields that study households, a much debated topic is whether interviews should be conducted individually or collectively (e.g. as [[Couple interview|couple interviews).]]\n\nAnother method of qualitative data collection is the use of [[Focus group|focus groups]]. The focus group technique (e.g., Morgan, 1988) involves a moderator facilitating a small group discussion between selected individuals on a particular topic, with video and written data recorded, and is useful in a coordinated research approach studying phenomenon in diverse ways in different environments with distinct stakeholders often excluded from traditional processes. This method is a particularly popular in [[market research]] and testing new initiatives with users/workers. \n\nOther sources include focus groups, observation (without a predefined theory like [[statistical theory]] in mind for example), reflective field notes, texts, pictures, photographs and other images, interactions and practice captured on audio or video recordings, public (e.g. official) personal documents, historical items, and websites and social media.<ref>{{cite book |last=Savin-Baden |first=M. |last2=Major |first2=C. |title=Qualitative Research: The Essential Guide to Theory and Practice |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=London }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=S.

In doing so, the aim is for the researcher to gain a closer insight into the culture's practices, motivations, and emotions. It is argued that the researchers' ability to understand the experiences of the culture may be inhibited if they observe without participating.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Participant observation is a strategy of reflexive learning, not a single method of observing.<ref>Lindlof, T. R., & Taylor, B. C. (2002) ''Qualitative communication research methods: Second edition''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|0-7619-2493-0}}</ref> and has been described as a continuum of between participation and observation. The ways of participating and observing can vary widely from setting to setting as exemplified by Helen Schwartzman's primer on Ethnography in Organizations (1993).<ref>Schwartzman, H.B. (1993). \"Ethnography in Organizations\". Qualitative Research Methods Series 27. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.</ref> or Anne Copeland and Kathleen White's \"Studying Families\" (1991).<ref>Copeland, A.P.

Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.</ref> \n\nThe research then must be \"written up\" into a report, book chapter, journal paper, thesis or dissertation, using descriptions, quotes from participants, charts and tables to demonstrate the trustworthiness of the study findings.\n\n== Coding ==\n{{main|Coding (social sciences)}}\nIn general, coding refers to the act of associating meaningful ideas with the data of interest. In the context of qualitative research, interpretative aspects of the coding process are often explicitly recognized, articulated, and celebrated; producing specific words or short phrases believed to be useful [[Abstraction|abstractions]] over the data.\n\nAs an act of sense making, most coding requires the qualitative analyst to read the data and demarcate segments within it, which may be done at multiple and different times throughout the data analysis process.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saldana|first=Johnny|title=The Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers|publisher=Sage|year=2012|isbn=978-1446247372|location=|pages=}}</ref>   Each segment is labeled with a 'code' \u2013 usually a word or short phrase suggesting how the associated data segments inform the research objectives. In contrast with more quantitative forms of coding, mathematical ideas and forms are usually under-developed in a 'pure' qualitative data analysis. When coding is complete, the analyst may prepare reports via a mix of: summarizing the prevalence of codes, discussing similarities and differences in related codes across distinct original sources/contexts, or comparing the relationship between one or more codes.\n\nSome qualitative data that is highly structured (e.g., open-ended responses from surveys or tightly defined interview questions) is typically coded with minimal additional segmentation of the data. Quantitative analysis based on codes from [[statistical theory]] is typically the capstone analytical step for this type of qualitative data. A common form of coding is open-ended coding, while other more structured techniques such as axial coding or integration have also been described and articulated (Strauss & Corbin, 1990).<ref>Strauss, A. & Corbin, J. (1990). ''Basics of Qualitative Research: Grounded Theory Procedures and Techniques.'' New Delhi: Sage.</ref> Because qualitative analyses are often more [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] than the hypothesis testing nature of most quantitative research, the existing 'theoretical sensitivity' (i.e., familiarity with established theories in the field) of the analyst becomes a more pressing concern in producing an acceptable analysis.\n\n==Data analysis==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\nThe data that is obtained is streamlined (texts of thousands of pages in length) to a definite theme or pattern, or representation of a theory or systemic issue or approach. This step in a theoretical analysis or data analytic technique is further worked on (e.g., gender analysis may be conducted; comparative policy analysis may be developed). An alternative research hypothesis is generated which finally provides the basis of the research statement for continuing work in the fields.\n\nTo analyze qualitative data, the researcher seeks meaning from all of the data that is available. The data may be categorized and sorted into patterns (i.e., pattern or thematic analyses) as the primary basis for organizing and reporting the study findings (e.g., activities in the home; interactions with government).<ref>{{cite book|last=Racino|first=J.|title=Challenges for a Service System in Transition: Ensuring Quality Community Experiences for Persons with Developmental Disabilities|last2=O'Connor|first2=S.|publisher=Paul H.

Whilst this crucial philosophical realization is also held by researchers in other fields, [[antipositivism|interpretivists]] are often the most aggressive in taking this philosophical realization to its logical conclusions. For example, an interpretivist researcher might believe in the existence of an objective reality 'out there', but argue that the social and educational reality we act on the basis of never allows a single human subject to directly access the reality 'out there' in reality (this is a view shared by [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist philosophies]]).\n\nTo researchers outside the qualitative research field, the most common analysis of qualitative data is often perceived to be observer impression. That is, expert or bystander observers examine the data, interpret it via forming an impression and report their impression in a structured and sometimes quantitative form.\n\n== Recursivity ==\nIn qualitative research, the idea of [[Recursion|recursivity]] is expressed in terms of the nature of its research procedures, which may be contrasted with [[Experiment|experimental forms]] of research design. From the experimental perspective, its major stages of research (data collection, data analysis, discussion of the data in context of the literature, and drawing conclusions) should be each undertaken once (or at most a small number of times) in a research study. In qualitative research however, all of the four stages above may be undertaken repeatedly until one or more specific stopping conditions are met, reflecting a nonstatic attitude to the planning and design of research activities. An example of this dynamicism might be when the qualitative researcher unexpectedly changes their research focus or design midway through a research study, based on their 1st interim data analysis, and then makes further unplanned changes again based on a 2nd interim data analysis; this would be a terrible thing to do from the perspective of an (predefined) experimental study of the same thing. Qualitative researchers would argue that their recursivity in developing the relevant evidence and reasoning, enables the researcher to be more open to unexpected results, more open to the potential of building new constructs, and the possibility of integrating them with the explanations developed continuously throughout a study.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite book|title=The Sage Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods.|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=2008|editor=Given, L.

Unknown''.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/21367/|title=A Six Step Guide to Using Recursive Abstraction Applied to the Qualitative Analysis of Interview Data.|access-date=6 April 2018|date=2014-02-10}}</ref> this is a method of qualitative data analysis where qualitative datasets are analyzed without coding. A common method here is recursive abstraction, where datasets are summarized; those summaries are therefore furthered into summary and so on.  The end result is a more compact summary that would have been difficult to accurately discern without the preceding steps of distillation.\n\nA frequent criticism of recursive abstraction is that the final conclusions are several times removed from the underlying data. While it is true that poor initial summaries will certainly yield an inaccurate final report, qualitative analysts can respond to this criticism.  They do so, like those using coding method, by documenting the reasoning behind each summary step, citing examples from the data where statements were included and where statements were excluded from the intermediate summary.\n\n== Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) ==\nContemporary qualitative data analyses are often supported by computer programs (termed [[computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software]]) used with or without the detailed hand coding and labeling of the past decades. These programs do not supplant the interpretive nature of coding, but rather are aimed at enhancing analysts' efficiency at applying, retrieving, and storing the codes generated from reading the data. Many programs enhance efficiency in editing and revision of codes, which allow for more effective work sharing, peer review, recursive examination of data, and analysis of large datasets.\n\nCommon qualitative data analysis software includes:\n\n* [[MAXQDA]] (mixed methods)\n* [[QDA Miner|QDA MINER]]\n* [[Atlas.ti|ATLAS.ti]]\n* [[Dedoose]] (mixed methods)\n* [[NVivo]]\n\nA frequent criticism of quantitative coding approaches is against the transformation of qualitative data into predefined ([[Nomothetic and idiographic|nomothetic]]) data structures, underpinned by [[Objectivity (science)|'objective properties]]'; the variety, richness, and individual characteristics of the qualitative data is argued to be largely omitted from such data coding processes, rendering the original collection of qualitative data somewhat pointless.\n\nTo defend against the criticism of too much [[Subjectivity|subjective variability]] in the categories and relationships identified from data, qualitative analysts respond by thoroughly articulating their definitions of codes and linking those codes soundly to the underlying data, thereby preserving some of the richness that might be absent from a mere list of codes, whilst satisfying the need for repeatable procedure held by [[Scientific experiment|experimentally]] oriented researchers.\n\n===Coding and \"thinking\"===\nSome data analysis techniques rely on using computers to scan and reduce large sets of qualitative data.  At their most basic level, numerical coding relies on counting words, phrases, or coincidences of tokens within the data; other similar techniques are the analyses of phrases and exchanges in conversational analyses.  Often referred to as [[content analysis]], a basic structural building block to conceptual analysis, the technique utilizes mixed methodology to unpack both small and large corpuses. Content analysis is frequently used in sociology to explore relationships, such as the change in perceptions of race over time (Morning 2008), or the lifestyles of temporal contractors (Evans, et al. 2004).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morning|first=Ann|date=2008|title=Reconstructing Race in Science and Society: Biology Textbooks, 1952-2002|url=|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=114 Suppl|pages=S106-37|doi=10.1086/592206|pmid=19569402|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=James |date=2004|title=Beach Time, Bridge Time and Billable Hours: The Temporal Structure of Temporal Contracting.|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201338|doi=|jstor=4131454|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/WTO/cgi-bin/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/pub_old/Evans_2004.pdf}}</ref> Content analysis techniques thus help to provide broader output for a larger, more accurate conceptual analysis.\n\nMechanical techniques are particularly well-suited for a few scenarios.  One such scenario is for datasets that are simply too large for a human to effectively analyze, or where analysis of them would be cost prohibitive relative to the value of information they contain.  Another scenario is when the chief value of a dataset is the extent to which it contains \"red flags\" (e.g., searching for reports of certain adverse events within a lengthy journal dataset from patients in a clinical trial) or \"green flags\" (e.g., searching for mentions of your brand in positive reviews of marketplace products). Many researchers would consider these procedures on their data sets to be misuse of their data collection and purposes.\n\nA frequent criticism of mechanical techniques is the absence of a human interpreter; computer analysis is relatively new having arrived in the late 1980s to the university sectors.  And while masters of these methods are able to write sophisticated software to mimic some human decisions, the bulk of the \"analysis\" is still nonhuman.  Analysts respond by proving the value of their methods relative to either a) hiring and training a human team to analyze the data or b) by letting the data go untouched, leaving any actionable nuggets undiscovered; almost all coding schemes indicate probably studies for further research.\n\nData sets and their analyses must also be written up, reviewed by other researchers, circulated for comments, and finalized for public review. Numerical coding must be available in the published articles, if the methodology and findings are to be compared across research studies in traditional literature review and recommendation formats.\n\n== Specialized uses ==\nThere are several different research approaches, or research designs, that qualitative researchers use.<ref>{{cite book|last=Creswell|first=John|title=Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Approaches|publisher=Sage|year=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Creswell|first=John|title=Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches|publisher=Sage|year=2008}}</ref>  In the academic social sciences, the most frequently used qualitative research approaches include the following points:\n\n# Basic/generic/pragmatic qualitative research, which involves using an eclectic approach taken up to best match the research question at hand. This is often called the mixed-method approach.\n# [[Ethnographic]] research.  An example of applied ethnographic research is the study of a particular culture and their understanding of the role of a particular disease in their cultural framework.\n# [[Grounded theory]] is an inductive type of research, based or \"grounded\" in the observations or data from which it was developed; it uses a variety of data sources, including quantitative data, review of records, interviews, observation and surveys.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=N.|last2=Birks|first2=M.|last3=Chapman|first3=Y.|date=29 September 2014|title=Contextual Positioning: Using Documents as Extant Data in Grounded Theory Research|journal=SAGE Open|volume=4|issue=3|pages=215824401455242|doi=10.1177/2158244014552425}}</ref>\n# [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenology]] describes the \"subjective reality\" of an event, as perceived by the study population; it is the study of a phenomenon.<ref>Gill, M. J. (2014). The Possibilities of Phenomenology for Organizational Research. Organizational Research Methods, 17:2, 118-137.</ref>\n# [[Biographical research]] is aligned to the social interpretive paradigm of research and is concerned with the reconstruction of [[Life history (sociology)|life histories]] and the constitution of meaning based on biographical narratives and documents. The starting point for this approach is the understanding of an individual biography in terms of its social constitution, as influenced by [[symbolic interactionism]], [[Sociology of knowledge|phenomenological sociology of knowledge]] ([[Alfred Sch\u00fctz]], [[Peter L. Berger]], and [[Thomas Luckmann]]), and [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]).\n# Philosophical research is conducted by field experts within the boundaries of a specific field of study or profession, the best qualified individual in any field of study to use an intellectual analysis, in order to clarify definitions, identify ethics, or make a value judgment concerning an issue in their field of study their lives.\n# [[Critical Social Research]], used by a researcher to understand how people communicate and develop symbolic meanings.\n# [[Ethical Inquiry]], an intellectual analysis of ethical problems.  It includes the study of ethics as related to obligation, rights, duty, right and wrong, choice etc.\n# Social science and Governmental Research to understand social services, government operations, and recommendations (or not) regarding future developments and programs, including whether or not government should be involved.\n# Activist research which aims to raise the views of the underprivileged or \"underdogs\" to prominence to the elite or master classes, the latter who often control the public view or positions.\n# Foundational research, examines the foundations for a science, analyzes the beliefs, and develops ways to specify how a knowledge base should change in light of new information.\n# Historical research allows one to discuss past and present events in the context of the present condition, and allows one to reflect and provide possible answers to current issues and problems. Historical research helps us in answering questions such as: Where have we come from, where are we, who are we now and where are we going?\n# Visual ethnography. It uses visual methods of data collection, including photo, voice, photo elicitation, collaging, drawing, and mapping. These techniques have been used extensively as a participatory qualitative technique and to make the familiar strange.<ref>Mannay, D. 2013. \u2018Who put that on there... why why why?:\u2019 Power games and participatory techniques of visual data production.

Survey items are piloted on study participants to test the reliability and validity of the items. This approach is similar to psychological testing using an intelligence test like the WAIS (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Survey) in which the interviewer records \"qualitative\" (i.e., clinical observations) throughout the testing process. Qualitative research is often useful in a sociological lens. Qualitative research can shed light on the intricacies in the functionality of society and human interaction.\n\n==Distinct qualitative paradigms==\nContemporary qualitative research has been conducted using a large number of [[paradigm]]s that influence conceptual and [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] concerns of legitimacy, control, [[data analysis]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], among others.  Qualitative research conducted in the twenty-first century has been characterized by a distinct turn toward more [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretive]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]], and [[critical theory|critical]] practices.<ref name=\"Guba, E. G. 2005 pp. 191-215\">Guba, E. G., & Lincoln, Y. S. (2005). \"Paradigmatic controversies, contradictions, and emerging influences\" In N. K. Denzin & Y. S. Lincoln (Eds.), ''The Sage Handbook of Qualitative Research'' (3rd ed.), pp. 191-215. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|0-7619-2757-3}}</ref>  Guba and Lincoln (2005) identify five main paradigms of contemporary qualitative research: [[positivism]], [[postpositivism]], [[critical theory|critical theories]], [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]], and participatory/cooperative paradigms.<ref name=\"Guba, E. G. 2005 pp. 191-215\"/>  Each of the paradigms listed by Guba and Lincoln are characterized by axiomatic differences in [[axiology]], intended action/impact of research, control of research process/outcomes, relationship to foundations of truth and knowledge, validity and trust (see below), textual representation and voice of the researcher and research participants, and commensurability with other paradigms.  In particular, commensurability involves the extent to which concerns from 2 paradigms e.g., \"can be retrofitted to each other in ways that make the simultaneous practice of both possible\".<ref>Guba, E. G., & Lincoln, Y. S. (2005). \"Paradigmatic controversies, contradictions, and emerging influences\" (p. 200). In N. K. Denzin & Y. S. Lincoln (Eds.), ''The Sage Handbook of Qualitative Research'' (3rd ed.), pp. 191-215. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|0-7619-2757-3}}</ref> Positivist and post positivist paradigms share commensurable assumptions, but are largely incommensurable with critical, constructivist, and [[participatory]]<nowiki/> paradigms of research and knowledge.  Likewise, critical, constructivist, and participatory paradigms are commensurable on certain issues (e.g., the intended action and textual representation of research).\n\nQualitative research in the 2000s has also been characterized by concern with everyday categorization and ordinary storytelling.  This \"narrative turn\" is producing an enormous literature as researchers present sensitizing concepts and perspectives that bear especially on narrative practice, which centers on the circumstances and communicative actions of storytelling.  Catherine Riessman (1993)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Riessman|first=Catherine K.|title=Narrative Analysis|publisher=Sage|year=1993|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=}}</ref> and Gubrium and Holstein (2009)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gubrium, J. F. and Holstein, J. A.|title=Analyzing Narrative Reality|publisher=Sage|year=2009|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}</ref> provide analytic strategies, and Holstein and Gubrium (2012)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holstein, J. A. and Gubrium, J. F., eds.|title=Varieties of Narrative Analysis|publisher=Sage|year=2012|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}</ref> present the variety of approaches in recent comprehensive texts. More recent developments in narrative practice has increasingly taken up the issue of institutional conditioning of such practices (see Gubrium and Holstein 2000).\n\nHowever, not all scholars agree on the usefulness of paradigms. A critical view of understanding qualitative inquiry vis-\u00e0-vis paradigms has been recently put forth by Pernecky (2016),<ref>{{cite book |last=Pernecky |first=T. |year=2016 |title=Epistemology and Metaphysics for Qualitative Research |location=London |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]}}</ref> who has argued that problems arise when paradigms are \"interpreted in a rigid fashion and compartmentalized into static schemata\" (p. 18). It is therefore more fruitful to think in terms of flows and continuums, and even embrace a post-paradigmatic qualitative research. In his words:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The problem with laying down prescriptive rules about what qualitative research is and how it ought to proceed lies in the narrowing of the possibilities of an abundant and constantly devolving body of philosophical thought. When we accept paradigms uncritically as the \u2018givens\u2019, qualitative knowledge becomes habituated, and paradigms grow into hegemonic systems of organization (Pernecky, 2016, p. 194)\".}}\n\n==Trustworthiness==\nA central issue in qualitative research is trustworthiness (also known as credibility, or in quantitative studies, validity). There are many different ways of establishing trustworthiness, including: [[member check]], interviewer corroboration, peer debriefing, prolonged engagement, negative case analysis, auditability, confirmability, bracketing, and balance. Most of these methods are described in Lincoln and Guba (1985).<ref>Lincoln Y and Guba EG (1985) ''Naturalistic Inquiry'', Sage Publications, Newbury Park, CA.</ref> As exemplified by researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg, data triangulation and eliciting examples of interviewee accounts are two of the most commonly used methods of establishing trustworthiness in qualitative studies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Constraining or Enabling Green Capability Development? How Policy Uncertainty Affects Organizational Responses to Flexible Environmental Regulations|journal=British Journal of Management|volume=28|issue=4|pages=649\u2013665|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12188|pmid=|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/93826/1/WRAP-constraining-enabling-green-policy-flexible-Sandberg-2017.pdf}}</ref>\nDependability is equivalent to the notion of reliability in quantitative methods and is the extent to which two or more people are likely to come to the same conclusions by examining the same evidence. Again, Lincoln and Guba (1985) is the salient reference.\n\n==Journals==\nBy the end of the 1970s many leading journals began to publish qualitative research articles<ref name=\"Loseke, Donileen R. 2007 pp. 491-506\">Loseke, Donileen R. & Cahil, Spencer E.

Wundt advocated the strong relation between psychology and philosophy. He believed that there was a gap between psychology and quantitative research that could only be filled by conducting qualitative research.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Qualitative research dove into aspects of human life that could not adequately be covered by quantitative research; aspects such as culture, expression, beliefs, morality and imagination.<ref name=\"Wertz, Charmaz 2011\">Wertz, Charmaz, McMullen. \"Five Ways of Doing Qualitative Analysis: Phenomenological Psychology, Grounded Theory, Discourse Analysis, Narrative Research, and Intuitive Inquiry\". 16-18. The Guilford Press: March 30, 2011. 1st ed. Print.</ref>\n\nThere are records of qualitative research being used in psychology before World War II, but prior to the 1950s, these methods were viewed as invalid. Owing to this, many of the psychologists who practiced qualitative research denied the usage of such methods or apologized for doing so. It was not until the late 20th century when qualitative research was accepted in elements of psychology though it remains controversial.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The excitement about the groundbreaking form of research was short-lived as few novel findings emerged which gained attention. Community psychologists felt they didn't get the recognition they deserved.<ref name=\"Wertz, Charmaz 2011\"/> A selection of autobiographical narratives of community psychologists can be found in \"Six Community Psychologists Tell Their Stories: History, Contexts and Narratives\" (Kelly & Song, 2004), including the well known Julian Rappaport.<ref>Kelly, J.G. & Song, A.V.

They focus on the impact of their work on local communities. This approach recognises that although the number of landmines in an area may be small, the effect on a community can be crippling. Targets are therefore determined locally, in response to liaison with affected communities, and local authorities.\n\nMAG field operations are managed and implemented by nationals of the affected countries, with MAG expatriate staff taking a monitoring and training role. MAG provides work for many members of affected communities, with families of landmine victims taking an active role.\n\nMAG is based in [[Manchester]], United Kingdom, and has a sister organisation, [[MAG America]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. As part of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], MAG was co-laureate of the 1997 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2009}}\nMAG was formed in 1989 by [[Rae McGrath]] in response to [[landmines]] and [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXO) left by the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]].<ref name=\"Maghistory\">{{citation\n | url = http://www.maginternational.org/about/mags-history/\n | title = Mag's history\n | work = MAG international\n | accessdate = 2009-04-08\n}}</ref>  The organisation initially served as an advisory group, publishing reports about the problems in Afghanistan and [[Cambodia]] based on their assessments between 1989 and 1991. Subsequent reports included [[Iraq]], [[Somaliland]] and [[Angola]].<ref name=\"Maghistory\" /> In 1992, MAG, along with other NGOs, formed the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] (ICBL).\n\nBy 1992, MAG had raised sufficient funds to begin its first landmine clearance program in Iraq. Clearance programmes extended to Cambodia the same year, followed by [[Laos]] and Angola in 1994. MAG also introduced mine risk education (MRE) alongside their clearance programs to help minimise the risk to the local populations. MRE operations were extended to [[Rwanda]] and to refugee camps in [[Zaire]] and the former [[Zambia]].<ref name=\"Maghistory\" /> In 1996, Lou McGrath became executive director and MAG established its international headquarters in [[Manchester]], United Kingdom.\n\n== Mine action techniques ==\n\n=== Mine action teams (MATs) ===\nMAG\u2019s delivery of Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) is centred on the use of multi-skilled, highly mobile and flexible teams called MATs. These were developed by MAG in the mid-nineties in response to the varied needs of mine affected communities. Drawing on multi-skilled staff, MATs are able to quickly adapt to the many challenges presented not only by mines and [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXO), but also to changing environments, including weather, geographical and topographical conditions and the wider security and political climate. Drawing on many years of operational experience, MATs have proven highly successful in countries such as [[Iraq]] and [[Cambodia]] in delivering a comprehensive and flexible HMA response, with multi-skilling a central aspect of their success. Team members are trained in Community Liaison (CL), information/data gathering, survey and assessment, mapping, logistics, minefield marking, landmine clearance and ordnance disposal ([[Bomb disposal|EOD]]).\n\n=== Survey and demarcation ===\nMAG has successfully implemented national socio-economic Landmine Impact Surveys (LIS) which have consequently been  published and widely distributed to mine action operators and other relevant stakeholders. MAG conducted its first emergency survey in Afghanistan in 1989 and conducted the first ever surveys in [[Cambodia]] and northern [[Iraq]]. Between 1992 and 1997, MAG Iraq conducted one of the largest minefield demarcation programmes in the world, while in Kosovo, MAG was tasked by the UN Mine Action Coordination Centre (MACC) in October 1999 to conduct a Level 2 survey along the border area with Albania. In 1993, MAG conducted an emergency impact assessment of the landmine problem in Moxico province, [[Angola]], which led to the establishment of a MAG clearance programme later that year.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\nMechanical capacities have formed an important element of MAG\u2019s HMA toolbox for several years. Machines have been used successfully to support manual clearance operations in a number of countries, including [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Vietnam]]. MAG uses a variety of flails, heavy plant and adapted agricultural and quarrying equipment in its programmes.  Current mechanical assets include the Tempest flail, Bozena 4 flail, Armtrac 100 flail, Minecat 230 flail and [[Digger DTR|Digger]] D-2 flail.  These assets can be used for a variety of tasks, including clearance of land, area reduction, and quality assurance tasks in support of manual clearance operations.\n\n=== Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) ===\nThe hazard posed by explosive ordnance is often highly significant in post-conflict situations. A large percentage of ordnance fails to detonate as designed and poses an immediate threat to people trying to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of conflict.  MAG\u2019s [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] response in countries such as [[Laos]] includes categorisation; safe handling/moving of ordnance; and destruction of items such as grenades, mortars, shells, cluster bomb sub-munitions, small arms and light weapons and large air dropped bombs. MAG's flexible and multi-skilled approach to HMA means that it is well equipped to operate successfully in countries such as Laos and Vietnam where the explosive contamination is mainly [[UXO]] as opposed to [[landmines]].\n\n=== Mine detection dogs (MDDs) ===\nMAG has used MDDs in support of its manual and mechanical clearance operations in a number of its programmes, including, northern Iraq, Cambodia and Lebanon. MAG technical staff have extensive experience of managing dog teams and/or integrating MDDs with manual and mechanical clearance operations. In particular, MDDs have proven a highly effective Quality Assurance tool for verification of manual/mechanical clearance sites. Rather than develop its own potentially expensive MDD capacity MAG works with local and international partners, such as CMAC in Cambodia and NPA in Lebanon who have existing dog capacities, to provide the required services.\n\n=== Mine risk education (MRE) ===\nMAG has developed the concept of MRE as a form of public health education. MRE offers people knowledge and alternatives for living and working safely in mine/UXO contaminated areas. MRE comprises a number of components that can be adapted to the needs of the target audience. Considerations include: the degree of impact of mines and UXO; economic pressures on affected communities; age; gender; culture; previous exposure to MRE messages; and the resources available to disseminate messages, such as local media, radio, television broadcasts and national networks such as schools, ministries and other institutions.\n\n=== Community liaison (CL) ===\nMAG pioneered the use of CL to ensure continual linkage with affected communities throughout the process of programme design, implementation and measurement of impact. \nThis inclusive and community focused approach enables a relevant response whilst at the same time fostering high levels of community involvement. MAG\u2019s CL Advisors also interact with relevant agencies, local authorities, HMA coordination bodies and other key stakeholders. CL consists of three main elements:\n* Information/data gathering\u2014to prioritise action according to need and impact and to allow for effective task planning\n* Information sharing, networking, and ongoing contact with all stakeholders\u2014to ensure that negotiation and planning occur regularly, to periodically review programme effectiveness, and to provide information about mine clearance activities\n* Evaluation and impact monitoring\u2014to measure the success of activities, and determine how the programme has impacted on the lives of the local community and what changes have resulted. This learning process enables MAG to improve/refine its approaches and activities at community, national and international levels\n\n=== SALW ===\nA protracted series of armed conflicts have resulted in the presence of large numbers of [[SALW]] in unsafe conditions in many post-conflict countries; and this constitutes a constant risk not only to life and limb for the local population but also to the current peaceful transition process in the country. MAG removes and destroys unsecured and abandoned SALW caches and by doing so removes the threat posed by unsecured SALW. MAG conducts nationwide surveys of arms deposits and warehouses, puts in place specialist equipment and training of national staff to carry out the cache destruction activities, and provides advice for the safe storage and control of remaining items. MAG first became involved in the destruction of SALW by providing technical support to demobilisation programmes in Angola and Cambodia during the 1990s. More recently, the scale of the problem has become more apparent in the course of MAG's mine and UXO clearance activities in countries such as Iraq, Sudan and DRC and items have been removed or destroyed which are outside the limited scope of the Mine Ban Treaty but which qualify for SALW status and contribute to humanitarian impacts and the proliferation of conflict.\n\n=== Local capacity development ===\nAs part of its mission to build local HMA capacities, MAG employs local technical and administrative staff wherever possible. In many of the countries it operates, including Angola, Cambodia and Iraq, MAG employs ex-combatants. A facet of this work contributes to the vital demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants into post-conflict society. Stable employment with MAG allows ex-combatants and their families to adapt, economically and socially, to a productive, civilian life.\n\n== Current operations ==\nMAG has worked in approximately 68 countries since 1989, moving into current and former conflict zones to clear the remnants of those conflicts.\n\n=== Angola ===\nMAG has worked in [[Angola]] since 1994, with the organisation\u2019s current area of operations, [[Moxico (province)|Moxico]] Province, greatly affected by fighting. The region was the birthplace and once the relative stronghold of rebel leader [[Jonas Savimbi]] and his National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]). Though the 27-year civil war ended in April 2002, the legacy of the conflict continues to affect the population.\n\nAngola is generally considered to have about two landmines for every single person, with 2.4 million people affected daily. The Landmine Impact Survey there identified 1,968 communities, in all 18 of the country's provinces, as being impacted by landmines.\n\nMAG\u2019s Angola programme has approximately 180 Angolan staff, six international (non-Angolan) staff, five Mine Action Teams, one Rapid Response Team, one Road Ops Team, three Community Liaison Teams, two Mechanical Operations Units, consisting of five machines, and one Impact Assessment Team.\n\n=== Cambodia ===\n[[File:MAG office Battambang.jpg|thumb|The office of MAG in Battambang]]\nMAG has been operational in [[Cambodia]] since 1992 and now employs approximately 475 staff members, working across six provinces: Battambang, Krong Pailin, Banteay Meanchey, Preah Vihear, Kampong Thom and Kampong Cham. Around 34 per cent are female and 9 per cent are amputees who are provided with metal-free prostheses by the International Committee of the Red Cross. There are currently 21 MATs (Mine Action Teams), 5 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Teams, 8 CL (Community Liaison) Teams, 1 Technical Survey Team; 4 Research and Development Teams (evaluating new technologies), 6 Mapping Teams, 9 Mechanical Support Teams, 3 scrub-cutting teams and 3 Mine Detection Dog Teams (sub-contracted from the Cambodian Mine Action Centre). \n \n;Partnerships and coordination\n\nMAG's operations in Cambodia are conducted in association with The Cambodian Mine Action Authority, provincial mine planning units and other operators. At present, MAG works in partnership with many international bodies including CARE, World Vision, Church World Service (CWS) and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). These partnerships ensure high levels of coordination in developing cleared land in the best way possible for local communities.\n\nMAG Cambodia has developed the locality demining approach; a more efficient and effective way of demining, recruiting deminers from the very communities that are mined. Working alongside development agencies, women and men are recruited from the most vulnerable households and trained in the fundamental skills of demining. Once trained, these teams then work under the supervision of more experienced staff. This approach enables poor families to gain meaningful employment and has resulted in productivity rise whilst still maintaining MAG's excellent safety record.\n\nMAG Cambodia has a well-developed Quality Management system, with the programme being accredited and quality assured by the Cambodian Mine Action Authority (CMAA). In 2003, MAG achieved a 50 per cent increase in output by introducing improved working methods and more mechanical scrub-cutting assets. In 2004 the introduction of small EOD teams in some areas reduced ordnance-related casualties by 50%.\n\n=== Chad ===\nAfter working on landmine, unexploded ordnance and abandoned ordnance clearance, and a project to restore access to safe water from 2004\u20132007, MAG restarted work in [[Chad]] in May 2008 clearing explosive hazards in central, eastern and southern parts of the country. This contamination mainly originates from fighting in recent years between the Chad National Army and various rebel groups. Two mobile destruction teams are conducting technical surveys, identifying clearance requirements and carrying out clearance and demarcation activities. In 2009 MAG also started clearance operations in the north of the country.\n\n====Partnerships and Coordination====\n\nMAG  has a close partnership with the Haut Commission National de D\u00e9minage (HCND), the National Chad Demining Office, and work with them when carrying out activities.\nMAG has established a good cooperation with HCND over the years and has provided substantial training to HCND Demining / EOD staff in order to enable HCND to mount and implement its own clearance activities.\n\n=== Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ===\nMAG has been operational in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC) since July 2004, working to reduce the threat posed by landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO)-clearing dangerous areas and using Mine Risk Education (MRE) to create safe access to water sources, agricultural land, medical facilities and education centres as well as destroying stockpiles of small arms and light weapons and ammunition. In the south eastern province of Katanga province and the north western province of Equateur, MAG has trained national staff in Community Liaison and clearance activities, creating seven teams (3 CL and 4 explosive ordnance disposal-trained). These teams work in contaminated areas where large numbers of returnees are expected over the coming years.\n\nDuring 2007, MAG teams provided Mine Risk Education for more than 263,000 people and cleared more than 243,000 square metres of land, destroying over 83,000 dangerous items in the process.\n\nIn September 2006, a large scale Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) project was implemented, responsible for the safe destruction of surplus munitions and weapons nationwide, and a direct contribution to peace building in DRC and the Great Lakes region. However, the presence of Small Arms and Light Weapons remains high and constitutes an ongoing threat to the stability and development of the country as a whole.\n\nAt present, MAG has four mobile destruction teams operating in the Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Military Regions (Equateur, Kasai Oriental, Katanga and Maniema provinces) and has trained a team of FARDC (Congolese Joint Forces) technicians to operate MAG's Regional Construction Centre at the Central Logistics Base in Kinshasa. \nDestruction activities were completed in the First Military Region (Bandundu) in March 2008, and will be completed in the Secondary Military Region (Bas-Congo) over the coming months. Work will also soon begin in Kasai Occidental. In addition to this, MAG has been asked to intervene urgently in the 8th Military Region (Nord Kivu) to destroy unsafely stored ammunition in order to prevent another accident such as Camp Ngashi.\n\nIn DRC, since May 2007, MAG has destroyed 70,000 weapons and over 150 tons of surplus ammunition previously held in Congolese Military stores.\n\n;Partnerships and Coordination\n\nSince the opening of a liaison office in Kinshasa in January 2005, MAG has become increasingly active in establishing partnerships with the international NGO community, as well as working with the local UN Mine Action Coordination Centre. MAG also cooperates with local NGOs in the field who are able to provide invaluable information regarding local mine/UXO problems. A partnership for organisational and technical capacity building has been signed until 2012 with Humanitas Ubangi, a local organisation working on MRE in the province of Equateur and hoping to extend to the Kasais. Additionally, MAG maintains a regular dialogue with relevant government and military authority and has entered into a partnership agreement through an [[Memorandum of understanding|MOU]] with a national [[NGO]] Humanitas Ubangi to develop its organisational and technical capacity to undertake Humanitarian Mine Action activities.\n\n=== Iraq ===\nMAG has been conducting Humanitarian Mine Action in the heavily mine-affected north of the country since 1992, and since the most recent conflict efforts have concentrated on delivering vital services in northern and central areas of the country. This work significantly reduces the threat to both resident and transient populations, and has supported wider rehabilitation and socio-economic development initiatives. Up to date, MAG has cleared more than one and a half million landmines and items of [[UXO]], freeing several million square metres of land for use by the local population. MAG's Iraq programme has recently also launched a dedicated project to safely remove and destroy small arms and light weapons, acting to support peace keeping initiatives which aim for long-term stability in Iraq.\n\nCurrently, MAG Iraq has more than 750 national staff working in the programme.This capacity consists of 18 Mine Action Teams, which provide a highly responsive and mobile multi-skilled clearance capacity, trained to International Mine Action Standards (IMAS); 10 Community Liaison teams; 2 midi-flail machines and operating teams; and 4 MDD teams. And despite security constraints, MAG remains operational in the North and parts of the centre and continues to implement operations. The programme works with local and regional partners in unstable parts of Iraq to reduce the threat posed by remnants of conflict to vulnerable high-risk communities.\n\n'''Partnerships and Coordination''' MAG works with the National Mine Action Authority (NMAA) located in Baghdad, the Iraqi Kurdistan Mine Action Authority (IKMAA) and the General Directorate of Mine Action (GDMA) in the North. MAG also coordinates with UN agencies, local and regional government authorities and other organisations involved in humanitarian, rehabilitation and reconstruction initiatives throughout Iraq. As part of its commitment to national capacity building, MAG has been working in partnership with the Kurdish Ministries of Education and Health to develop a sustainable and independent Mine Risk Education (MRE) delivery capacity in Northern Iraq.\n\n=== Laos ===\nMAG's [[Laos|Laotian]] programme began in 1994 with the establishment of the first internationally supported [[UXO]] (Unexploded Ordnance) clearance operation in the country. MAG currently works in [[Xiangkhouang Province|XiangKhouang]] and [[Khammouane]] provinces, operating 11 UXO clearance teams (including two all-female teams) and 9 Community Liaison teams. The programme has 211 national staff, of which 35% are female.\n\nMAG continued to pursue an integrated UXO action approach, which was subsequently developed and adopted nationally in 1996 with the creation of the Lao government\u2019s national UXO organisation, UXO Lao. MAG has the distinction of having handed over to UXO Lao, two effective and efficient  operations in the provinces of Xieng Khouang and [[Salavan Province|Saravan]]. Since 2000, MAG has continued to support the activities of UXO Lao, providing operational and technical advice to these provincial operations and MAG is also now providing technical assistance to UXO Lao in a third province: Khammouane. Recent sector reform has enabled international NGOs and Government of Lao (GoL) provincial authorities to ask MAG to assist with clearance linked to specific\ndevelopment projects in XiangKhouang and Khammouane, especially in areas where UXO Lao is unable to respond. In addition, MAG has piloted the use of [[UXO]] detection dogs and Village Assisted Clearance (VAC) to improve productivity and impact.\n\nIn 2007 MAG Lao located and destroyed 6,460 items of UXO, 3,257,638 square metres of land was cleared for agriculture, drainage canals, electricity pylons, water wells, school gardens, roads (to provide access to markets) and for a project to promote tourism at the historic Plain of Jars. From January to June 2008, MAG Lao destroyed 3,537 items of UXO.\n\nThe work of MAG teams in Laos is the focus of the 2007 documentary movie ''[[Bomb Harvest]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombharvest.com|title=\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u9bc9\u306e\u307c\u308a\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601025119/http://bombharvest.com/|archive-date=1 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Community Liaison ====\nAlmost 15 percent of field staff are members of Community Liaison teams, devoted to ensuring that communities are consulted and involved throughout the whole UXO clearance process. The information gained through Community Liaison ensures that UXO clearance is directly linked with poverty alleviation.\n\n=== Lebanon ===\n[[Image:UXO in Rachaf.jpg|thumb|UXO in [[Rachaf]], Lebanon]] \nMAG began its HMA activities in Southern [[Lebanon]] in 2000 and now employs 80 national staff members on new and existing projects. Following the 2006 ceasefire, this figure rose to around 360 nationally recruited employees. In 2003, MAG Lebanon completed a national Landmine Impact Survey (LIS), which was carried out in conjunction with the National Demining Office (NDO). Another team also conducted a technical survey into suspected contaminated areas along the 'Blue Line'.\nDuring the conflict between Hezbollah and Israeli forces from mid-July to mid-August 2006, there was a dramatic change in the mine/unexploded ordnance (UXO) situation. The fighting and artillery bombardments were heaviest in southern Lebanon, and as a result, an estimated 915,000 internally displaced persons ([[IDPs]])  fled this area and scattered throughout communities further north. Over 200,000 refugees left the country entirely. Roads and communities in southern Lebanon were littered with UXO thus making movement throughout South Lebanon both difficult and dangerous. Immediately prior to the conflict situation MAG deployed 4 MATs and 1 Mechanical team who went operational in June 2006. The flexibility of this MAT team meant that immediately after the cessation of violence MAG had a team on the ground responding to the most immediate threats. Since the immediate post-conflict phase, MAG has steadily worked on 'battle area clearance' (BAC), which concentrates on removing cluster submunitions and UXO.\n\nFrom the end of 2006 conflict, MAG Lebanon's capacity grew to 22 Mine Action Teams (MATs), 5 Mechanical Teams, 2 Mine Dog Detection teams, 3 Community Liaison Teams (responsible for gathering information from the community on remnants of conflict), 1 Technical Survey Team, 1 Reconnaissance Team (responsible for surveying battle areas), and 1 Quality Control/ Quality Assurance Team (responsible for training and monitoring operations quality). Since the end of the 2006 conflict, MAG has cleared more than 9.8 million square metres of land, destroyed almost 21 000 remnants of conflict, cleared 294 dangerous areas, and assisted 450,000 people at risk from death or injury from remnants of conflict. The scope of activities carried out by MAG Lebanon's programme includes rapid survey and demarcation of landmine and UXO contaminated areas, clearance of priority routes and land, and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) tasks. Alongside this, integration of MAG Lebanon's activities with those of the NDO (National Demining Office) and other organizations operating in the region remains a priority.\n\nMAG has positive working relationships with key organisations such as the United Nations Mine Action Coordination Centre South Lebanon (MACC SL) and The Lebanese Red Cross.\n\n=== Mali ===\nMAG is delivering Risk Education messages to internally displaced people, returnees and resident populations in northern Mali.\n\n=== Myanmar ===\nMAG began work in Kayah state, Myanmar in 2014, giving lifesaving Mine Risk Education (MRE) to communities dependent for their livelihoods on land that is riddled with mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) from decades of internal conflict.\n\n=== Somalia ===\nFunded by the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement, U.S. Department of State, MAG began its current operations in Somalia in May 2008 with a project to clear conventional weapons and stockpiles in conflict-affected areas in the Puntland region. Work is centred in the administrative capital of the region, Garowe, where a unit of the local police force is receiving Explosive Ordnance Disposal training \u2013 covering munitions recognition, the safe handling of explosive ordnance, conducting safe demolitions, first aid and communications. Once the training is complete, MAG will support and advise the team as they carry out operations around Puntland.\n\nFollowing an accident in July 2008, concerning some children who were playing with a 106mm high explosive anti-tank round that exploded on a school football field (three died and six were injured), MAG held meetings with the elders of the town, made appeals for information, gave Mine Risk Education (MRE) on the local radio and collected other items reported by the community. It is anticipated that further small arms and light weapons (SALW) and UXO clearance of the country is required to remove these threats, to prevent further accidents and to ensure safe access and use of the land.\n\n;Partnerships and Coordination\n\nMAG carries out activities in Somalia in close coordination with the PMAC. MAG has also established a good relationship with UNDP Somalia who provide support to MAG\u2019s current operation in Puntland. MAG is also working in cooperation with Geneva Call.\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\nMAG began emergency MRE, survey and demarcation activities in the [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] region of northern [[Sri Lanka]] in February 2002. The aim of the MAG teams were to address the outstanding problems of landmine and UXO contamination apparent following the ceasefire (Memorandum of Understanding) between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Through deploying Mine Risk Education (MRE), survey and demarcation assets in Northern Sri Lanka, MAG teams sought to protect those most affected by the conflict which had plagued the region since 1983. Later in 2002, clearance assets, including manual, mechanical and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) were introduced to the programme structure. \n  \nIn August 2003, MAG expanded into the eastern district of [[Batticaloa]], where it remains, providing vital conflict recovery assistance. In May 2005, as a result of the December [[tsunami]], MAG established a landmine and UXO response in Ampara district. MAG's capacity in Sri Lanka in its three project locations has grown to include five CL/MRE teams, three emergency EOD teams, nine technical survey/demining teams, one minefield marking/fencing team, two general survey teams\nspecifically tasked to support NGOs and local authorities undertaking development projects, one Battle Area Clearance (BAC) team and two MATs. In addition, MAG runs two Mechanical Support Units utilising Bozena mini flails.\n\nSince the start of operations in 2002, MAG has cleared 15,500,000 square metres through manual, mechanical, and Battle Area Clearance (BAC) techniques.\n\nIn 2006 the security situation worsened between the Government and the TRO, forcing MAG to scale down its operations within Sri Lanka significantly, but restarted in September 2007 when MAG undertook tasking in Trincomalee district, responding to support the Ministry of Resettlements in their resettlement plans. All MAG assets returned to Batticola in October 2007 and since then MAG has concentrated on tasks only in the Batticaloa district due to a lack of access to the Northern region. At present, MAG fields one Community Liaison team, three Manual Mine Clearance Teams, and two Mechanical Ground Preparation Teams\u2014each deploying a 'Bozena 4' mini flails.\n\nMAG has already begun survey in an area of Mannar District in the north where the population had to leave quickly in late 2007 during fighting in the area. Five villages were surveyed in April 2009, and the area has been declared safe for the families to return. MAG now plans to expand its activities in the north throughout the remainder of the year in support of the initiative to return 80 per cent of IDPs back to their home areas by the end of 2009.\n\nMine Action in Sri Lanka is coordinated through the National Steering Committee for Mine Action (NSCMA) which is supported though by UNDP. MAG works in coordination with the NSCMA and also through district Mine Action Committees, where communication with all stakeholders allows contaminated areas to be priorised for clearance and district work plans to be produced.\n\n=== South Sudan ===\nMAG has been operational in [[South Sudan]] since 1998. At present, MAG has teams carrying out landmine clearance, bomb disposal and destruction of abandoned small arms and light weapons (SALW). MAG also have Community Liaison/Mine Risk Educational teams delivering important messages to settled populations, the internally displaced and returnees living in contaminated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maginternational.org/where-mag-works/south-sudan/|title=MAG (Mines Advisory Group) - South Sudan|work=MAG (Mines Advisory Group)|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nAs the largest non-military clearance organisation operating in [[Vietnam]], MAG plays a key role in reducing the risk and impact of mines/UXO on the\nlocal population, and also in facilitating community level post-clearance development and resettlement. MAG first began operating in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]], central Vietnam, in 1999- encompassing the former DMZ ([[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]]), which divided Vietnam and witnessed the majority of flighting and bombing during the 1960s and '70s. In early 2003, MAG's operations were expanded to the adjacent province of [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province|Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh]].\n\nMost of MAG's work is mobile explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations, whereby teams systematically work through every village in a commune, clearing all known items of UXO and suspect items. From 1999 to the end of July 2008, MAG achieved the following outputs in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb and Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh provinces:\n\n*Teams cleared 6,708,715 square metres of land using manual electronic and visual search techniques, removing 22,573 items of UXO and 2,040 mines.\n*Teams also visited 181,125 houses, performing 24,931 EOD tasks and removing 110,663 items of UXO and 439 mines.\n\nSince November 2007, Community Liaison teams have conducted 324 community/partner meetings, visiting 255 villages, conducting 7,253 house to house surveys and documenting 962 mine/UXO reports.\n\nMAG's work is closely linked to the development plans of the provinces, districts and communities in which it operates. The teams have cleared areas for a wide range of development activities and also respond to emergency EOD requests. MAG's current operational capacity in Vietnam consists of 5 MATs in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province and 4 MATs in Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province and 4 recently introduced Community Liaison teams. In addition, MAG provides technical assistance and quality assurance to mine action projects in [[Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf Province|Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf]] and [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province|Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i]] provinces.\n\nMAG Vietnam also respond to emergency EOD requests. Humanitatian mine action is also linked to the development plans of the provinces, districts and communities. MAG Vietnam is committed to forming partnerships with government authorities at both national and local level, NGOs, and other agencies. To date, all projects have been either in partnership with the local authorities or with development organisations. MAG is a regular participant in the Landmine Working Group, a group of NGOs, UN agencies and other organisations concerned with the mine/UXO issue in Vietnam. In addition to this, MAG has developed working partnerships with poverty reduction agencies such as CHF-partners in rural development in order to link MAG Vietnam's clearance work to the Millennium Goal of poverty reduction. These partnerships ensure that land and villages cleared by MAG is used in the most productive and sustainable way, while meeting the needs of the local population.\n\n== Past operations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maginternational.org/countries|title=MAG (Mines Advisory Group) - Countries|work=MAG (Mines Advisory Group)|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> ==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nOngoing since 2002: MAG trained the [[Organisation for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation]] to address new types of UXO found after the coalition activity in the area. Mechanical assistance is also being provided.\n\n=== Azerbaijan ===\nTraining local partners in the [[Fizuli Rayon|Fizuli district]] close to the front line with areas still occupied by Armenian forces.\n\n=== Burundi ===\nIn 2007 MAG began assisting [[Burundi]]'s government after civil war left the country with the burden of small arms and light weapons ([[SALW]]), and unsecured stockpiles.\n\nStrained relations between the government and rebel groups have helped facilitate the spread of SALW throughout the civilian population. The situation has deteriorated further as a result of Burundi\u2019s permeable frontiers and the inadequate enforcement of illegal arms trade legislation.\n\nMAG works with Burundi's government to eliminate the threat of SALW and unsecured stockpiles. Their work in Burundi involves assisting the national army to destroy [[Man-Portable Air Defence Systems]] (MANPADS), and training and equipping members of the army and police force to become Mobile SALW destruction teams. These teams work throughout the country, destroying seized SALW, small arms ammunition (SAA) and explosives. When necessary the teams also respond to identified [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXO) spot tasks.\n\n=== Cyprus ===\nSince October 2004, MAG has been contracted in [[Cyprus]] by the [[United Nations]]. They provide quality management for the work of commercial contractors, who clear minefields between the Greek Cypriot- and Turkish Cypriot-controlled regions of the country. Cyprus\u2019s landmine contamination is estimated to span nine million square metres and consists of 77 minefields or suspected minefields.\n\nMAG's work in Cyprus, based in Nicosia, safeguards the quality of work conducted by other UN contractors, and ensures that their work complies with international standards. Contractors must execute clearance work safely and efficiently, and MAG provides the management and maintenance of a mine detection dog accreditation and testing database.\n\n=== Republic of Congo ===\nMAG started working in the Republic of Congo in late 2007, alongside the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Congo, to try to prevent the risk from any remnants of conflict.\n\nIts aims are to make a material contribution to peace-building initiatives and security efforts in the Republic of Congo through identifying, surveying and destroying small arms and light weapons, MANPADS (Man-Portable Air Defence Systems) and other explosive ordnance, which currently poses a hazard due to their degraded state, storage conditions and proximity to local communities.\n\n=== Rwanda ===\nIn August 2008, MAG, alongside the Regional Centre on Small Arms (RECSA), carried out a survey to determine the status of small arms and light weapons activities that were going on in Rwanda. As a result of this, they managed to get funding off the UK Government Conflict Prevention Pool to start a four-month Conventional Weapons Management and Disposal project. It includes assisting the Rwandan Army and Police, and also provides training, in stockpile management and destruction of surplus weapons, unstable ordnance and small arms ammunition. As a result of this over 10,000 weapons have already been destroyed.\n\nMAG's work is beneficial for communities situated near stockpiles, as it reduces death and injury caused by them. It also benefits the wider population, who before MAG started this project, were threatened by the risk of violent crime that followed looting of the weapons that had been insecurely stored.\n\nMAG have also trained army personnel in stockpile management, weapons destruction and basic Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) skills to make up a Destruction Team, who then started weapons destruction activities which were supervised and supported by the MAG Technical Field Manager. After this a weapons destruction workshop was set up. This project ran up until March 2009, during which time MAG, along with the Rwandan Authorities, established some further priorities and decided what work was to be done from April 2009 onwards.\n\n=== Somaliland ===\nOctober 2001 to July 2002: MAG worked with the [[United Nations Office for Project Services]] (UNOPS). Established and trained an EOD team composed of [[Somaliland]] police personnel and a member of the [[Somaliland Mine Action Centre]] (SMAC).\n\n== Assessments ==\nAssessments have been carried out in the following countries:\n* [[Bosnia Herzegovina]]\n* [[Colombia]]\n* [[Congo-Brazzaville]]\n* [[Eritrea]]\n* [[Guinea-Bissau]]\n* [[Ivory Coast]]\n* [[Kashmir]]\n* [[Namibia]]\n* [[Senegal]]\n* [[Taiwan]]\n* [[Zambia]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.maginternational.org/ MAG website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/v/BSFt8H9PCNc&hl=en&fs=1 Official MAG film - ''Conflict Recovery'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080311153154/http://www.bombharvest.com/synopsis.html ''Bomb Harvest''], a film about MAG\n* [https://archive.is/20130221091641/http://www.abdphoto.net/photographs/mines-advisory-group.html MAG photos from Quang Tri, Vietnam]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=mines+advisory+group&m=text/, MAG photos from current operations worldwide.]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Charities based in Manchester]]\n[[Category:International charities]]\n[[Category:Mine warfare and mine clearance organizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=April 2009}}\n{{Infobox company\n|name             = Mines Advisory Group\n|logo     = [[File:Mines Advisory Group logo.jpg|200px]]\n|type             = [[NGO|Non-Governmental Organisation]]\n|foundation       = 1989\n|location_city    = [[Manchester]]\n|location_country = United Kingdom\n|location         = <!--modifies \"Headquarters\" entry-->\n|locations        = <!--# of locations-->\n|key_people       = \n|area_served      = global\n|industry         = Landmine relief\n|products         = \n|services         = \n|revenue          = \n|operating_income = \n|net_income       = \n|num_employees    = \n|parent           = \n|divisions        =\n|subsid           = \n|homepage         = [http://www.maginternational.org maginternational.org]\n|dissolved        = \n|footnotes        = \n}}\n\nThe '''Mines Advisory Group''' ('''MAG''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] that assists people affected by [[landmines]], [[unexploded ordnance]], and [[small arms and light weapons]].\n\nMAG takes a humanitarian approach to landmine action. They focus on the impact of their work on local communities. This approach recognises that although the number of landmines in an area may be small, the effect on a community can be crippling. Targets are therefore determined locally, in response to liaison with affected communities, and local authorities.\n\nMAG field operations are managed and implemented by nationals of the affected countries, with MAG expatriate staff taking a monitoring and training role. MAG provides work for many members of affected communities, with families of landmine victims taking an active role.\n\nMAG is based in [[Manchester]], United Kingdom, and has a sister organisation, [[MAG America]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. As part of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], MAG was co-laureate of the 1997 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2009}}\nMAG was formed in 1989 by [[Rae McGrath]] in response to [[landmines]] and [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXO) left by the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]].<ref name=\"Maghistory\">{{citation\n | url = http://www.maginternational.org/about/mags-history/\n | title = Mag's history\n | work = MAG international\n | accessdate = 2009-04-08\n}}</ref>  The organisation initially served as an advisory group, publishing reports about the problems in Afghanistan and [[Cambodia]] based on their assessments between 1989 and 1991. Subsequent reports included [[Iraq]], [[Somaliland]] and [[Angola]].<ref name=\"Maghistory\" /> In 1992, MAG, along with other NGOs, formed the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] (ICBL).\n\nBy 1992, MAG had raised sufficient funds to begin its first landmine clearance program in Iraq. Clearance programmes extended to Cambodia the same year, followed by [[Laos]] and Angola in 1994. MAG also introduced mine risk education (MRE) alongside their clearance programs to help minimise the risk to the local populations. MRE operations were extended to [[Rwanda]] and to refugee camps in [[Zaire]] and the former [[Zambia]].<ref name=\"Maghistory\" /> In 1996, Lou McGrath became executive director and MAG established its international headquarters in [[Manchester]], United Kingdom.\n\n== Mine action techniques ==\n\n=== Mine action teams (MATs) ===\nMAG\u2019s delivery of Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) is centred on the use of multi-skilled, highly mobile and flexible teams called MATs. These were developed by MAG in the mid-nineties in response to the varied needs of mine affected communities. Drawing on multi-skilled staff, MATs are able to quickly adapt to the many challenges presented not only by mines and [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXO), but also to changing environments, including weather, geographical and topographical conditions and the wider security and political climate. Drawing on many years of operational experience, MATs have proven highly successful in countries such as [[Iraq]] and [[Cambodia]] in delivering a comprehensive and flexible HMA response, with multi-skilling a central aspect of their success. Team members are trained in Community Liaison (CL), information/data gathering, survey and assessment, mapping, logistics, minefield marking, landmine clearance and ordnance disposal ([[Bomb disposal|EOD]]).\n\n=== Survey and demarcation ===\nMAG has successfully implemented national socio-economic Landmine Impact Surveys (LIS) which have consequently been  published and widely distributed to mine action operators and other relevant stakeholders. MAG conducted its first emergency survey in Afghanistan in 1989 and conducted the first ever surveys in [[Cambodia]] and northern [[Iraq]]. Between 1992 and 1997, MAG Iraq conducted one of the largest minefield demarcation programmes in the world, while in Kosovo, MAG was tasked by the UN Mine Action Coordination Centre (MACC) in October 1999 to conduct a Level 2 survey along the border area with Albania. In 1993, MAG conducted an emergency impact assessment of the landmine problem in Moxico province, [[Angola]], which led to the establishment of a MAG clearance programme later that year.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\nMechanical capacities have formed an important element of MAG\u2019s HMA toolbox for several years. Machines have been used successfully to support manual clearance operations in a number of countries, including [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Vietnam]]. MAG uses a variety of flails, heavy plant and adapted agricultural and quarrying equipment in its programmes.  Current mechanical assets include the Tempest flail, Bozena 4 flail, Armtrac 100 flail, Minecat 230 flail and [[Digger DTR|Digger]] D-2 flail.  These assets can be used for a variety of tasks, including clearance of land, area reduction, and quality assurance tasks in support of manual clearance operations.\n\n=== Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) ===\nThe hazard posed by explosive ordnance is often highly significant in post-conflict situations. A large percentage of ordnance fails to detonate as designed and poses an immediate threat to people trying to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of conflict.  MAG\u2019s [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] response in countries such as [[Laos]] includes categorisation; safe handling/moving of ordnance; and destruction of items such as grenades, mortars, shells, cluster bomb sub-munitions, small arms and light weapons and large air dropped bombs. MAG's flexible and multi-skilled approach to HMA means that it is well equipped to operate successfully in countries such as Laos and Vietnam where the explosive contamination is mainly [[UXO]] as opposed to [[landmines]].\n\n=== Mine detection dogs (MDDs) ===\nMAG has used MDDs in support of its manual and mechanical clearance operations in a number of its programmes, including, northern Iraq, Cambodia and Lebanon. MAG technical staff have extensive experience of managing dog teams and/or integrating MDDs with manual and mechanical clearance operations. In particular, MDDs have proven a highly effective Quality Assurance tool for verification of manual/mechanical clearance sites. Rather than develop its own potentially expensive MDD capacity MAG works with local and international partners, such as CMAC in Cambodia and NPA in Lebanon who have existing dog capacities, to provide the required services.\n\n=== Mine risk education (MRE) ===\nMAG has developed the concept of MRE as a form of public health education. MRE offers people knowledge and alternatives for living and working safely in mine/UXO contaminated areas. MRE comprises a number of components that can be adapted to the needs of the target audience. Considerations include: the degree of impact of mines and UXO; economic pressures on affected communities; age; gender; culture; previous exposure to MRE messages; and the resources available to disseminate messages, such as local media, radio, television broadcasts and national networks such as schools, ministries and other institutions.\n\n=== Community liaison (CL) ===\nMAG pioneered the use of CL to ensure continual linkage with affected communities throughout the process of programme design, implementation and measurement of impact. \nThis inclusive and community focused approach enables a relevant response whilst at the same time fostering high levels of community involvement. MAG\u2019s CL Advisors also interact with relevant agencies, local authorities, HMA coordination bodies and other key stakeholders. CL consists of three main elements:\n* Information/data gathering\u2014to prioritise action according to need and impact and to allow for effective task planning\n* Information sharing, networking, and ongoing contact with all stakeholders\u2014to ensure that negotiation and planning occur regularly, to periodically review programme effectiveness, and to provide information about mine clearance activities\n* Evaluation and impact monitoring\u2014to measure the success of activities, and determine how the programme has impacted on the lives of the local community and what changes have resulted. This learning process enables MAG to improve/refine its approaches and activities at community, national and international levels\n\n=== SALW ===\nA protracted series of armed conflicts have resulted in the presence of large numbers of [[SALW]] in unsafe conditions in many post-conflict countries; and this constitutes a constant risk not only to life and limb for the local population but also to the current peaceful transition process in the country. MAG removes and destroys unsecured and abandoned SALW caches and by doing so removes the threat posed by unsecured SALW. MAG conducts nationwide surveys of arms deposits and warehouses, puts in place specialist equipment and training of national staff to carry out the cache destruction activities, and provides advice for the safe storage and control of remaining items. MAG first became involved in the destruction of SALW by providing technical support to demobilisation programmes in Angola and Cambodia during the 1990s. More recently, the scale of the problem has become more apparent in the course of MAG's mine and UXO clearance activities in countries such as Iraq, Sudan and DRC and items have been removed or destroyed which are outside the limited scope of the Mine Ban Treaty but which qualify for SALW status and contribute to humanitarian impacts and the proliferation of conflict.\n\n=== Local capacity development ===\nAs part of its mission to build local HMA capacities, MAG employs local technical and administrative staff wherever possible. In many of the countries it operates, including Angola, Cambodia and Iraq, MAG employs ex-combatants. A facet of this work contributes to the vital demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants into post-conflict society. Stable employment with MAG allows ex-combatants and their families to adapt, economically and socially, to a productive, civilian life.\n\n== Current operations ==\nMAG has worked in approximately 68 countries since 1989, moving into current and former conflict zones to clear the remnants of those conflicts.\n\n=== Angola ===\nMAG has worked in [[Angola]] since 1994, with the organisation\u2019s current area of operations, [[Moxico (province)|Moxico]] Province, greatly affected by fighting. The region was the birthplace and once the relative stronghold of rebel leader [[Jonas Savimbi]] and his National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]). Though the 27-year civil war ended in April 2002, the legacy of the conflict continues to affect the population.\n\nAngola is generally considered to have about two landmines for every single person, with 2.4 million people affected daily. The Landmine Impact Survey there identified 1,968 communities, in all 18 of the country's provinces, as being impacted by landmines.\n\nMAG\u2019s Angola programme has approximately 180 Angolan staff, six international (non-Angolan) staff, five Mine Action Teams, one Rapid Response Team, one Road Ops Team, three Community Liaison Teams, two Mechanical Operations Units, consisting of five machines, and one Impact Assessment Team.\n\n=== Cambodia ===\n[[File:MAG office Battambang.jpg|thumb|The office of MAG in Battambang]]\nMAG has been operational in [[Cambodia]] since 1992 and now employs approximately 475 staff members, working across six provinces: Battambang, Krong Pailin, Banteay Meanchey, Preah Vihear, Kampong Thom and Kampong Cham. Around 34 per cent are female and 9 per cent are amputees who are provided with metal-free prostheses by the International Committee of the Red Cross. There are currently 21 MATs (Mine Action Teams), 5 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Teams, 8 CL (Community Liaison) Teams, 1 Technical Survey Team; 4 Research and Development Teams (evaluating new technologies), 6 Mapping Teams, 9 Mechanical Support Teams, 3 scrub-cutting teams and 3 Mine Detection Dog Teams (sub-contracted from the Cambodian Mine Action Centre). \n \n;Partnerships and coordination\n\nMAG's operations in Cambodia are conducted in association with The Cambodian Mine Action Authority, provincial mine planning units and other operators. At present, MAG works in partnership with many international bodies including CARE, World Vision, Church World Service (CWS) and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). These partnerships ensure high levels of coordination in developing cleared land in the best way possible for local communities.\n\nMAG Cambodia has developed the locality demining approach; a more efficient and effective way of demining, recruiting deminers from the very communities that are mined. Working alongside development agencies, women and men are recruited from the most vulnerable households and trained in the fundamental skills of demining. Once trained, these teams then work under the supervision of more experienced staff. This approach enables poor families to gain meaningful employment and has resulted in productivity rise whilst still maintaining MAG's excellent safety record.\n\nMAG Cambodia has a well-developed Quality Management system, with the programme being accredited and quality assured by the Cambodian Mine Action Authority (CMAA). In 2003, MAG achieved a 50 per cent increase in output by introducing improved working methods and more mechanical scrub-cutting assets. In 2004 the introduction of small EOD teams in some areas reduced ordnance-related casualties by 50%.\n\n=== Chad ===\nAfter working on landmine, unexploded ordnance and abandoned ordnance clearance, and a project to restore access to safe water from 2004\u20132007, MAG restarted work in [[Chad]] in May 2008 clearing explosive hazards in central, eastern and southern parts of the country. This contamination mainly originates from fighting in recent years between the Chad National Army and various rebel groups. Two mobile destruction teams are conducting technical surveys, identifying clearance requirements and carrying out clearance and demarcation activities. In 2009 MAG also started clearance operations in the north of the country.\n\n====Partnerships and Coordination====\n\nMAG  has a close partnership with the Haut Commission National de D\u00e9minage (HCND), the National Chad Demining Office, and work with them when carrying out activities.\nMAG has established a good cooperation with HCND over the years and has provided substantial training to HCND Demining / EOD staff in order to enable HCND to mount and implement its own clearance activities.\n\n=== Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ===\nMAG has been operational in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC) since July 2004, working to reduce the threat posed by landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO)-clearing dangerous areas and using Mine Risk Education (MRE) to create safe access to water sources, agricultural land, medical facilities and education centres as well as destroying stockpiles of small arms and light weapons and ammunition. In the south eastern province of Katanga province and the north western province of Equateur, MAG has trained national staff in Community Liaison and clearance activities, creating seven teams (3 CL and 4 explosive ordnance disposal-trained). These teams work in contaminated areas where large numbers of returnees are expected over the coming years.\n\nDuring 2007, MAG teams provided Mine Risk Education for more than 263,000 people and cleared more than 243,000 square metres of land, destroying over 83,000 dangerous items in the process.\n\nIn September 2006, a large scale Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) project was implemented, responsible for the safe destruction of surplus munitions and weapons nationwide, and a direct contribution to peace building in DRC and the Great Lakes region. However, the presence of Small Arms and Light Weapons remains high and constitutes an ongoing threat to the stability and development of the country as a whole.\n\nAt present, MAG has four mobile destruction teams operating in the Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Military Regions (Equateur, Kasai Oriental, Katanga and Maniema provinces) and has trained a team of FARDC (Congolese Joint Forces) technicians to operate MAG's Regional Construction Centre at the Central Logistics Base in Kinshasa. \nDestruction activities were completed in the First Military Region (Bandundu) in March 2008, and will be completed in the Secondary Military Region (Bas-Congo) over the coming months. Work will also soon begin in Kasai Occidental. In addition to this, MAG has been asked to intervene urgently in the 8th Military Region (Nord Kivu) to destroy unsafely stored ammunition in order to prevent another accident such as Camp Ngashi.\n\nIn DRC, since May 2007, MAG has destroyed 70,000 weapons and over 150 tons of surplus ammunition previously held in Congolese Military stores.\n\n;Partnerships and Coordination\n\nSince the opening of a liaison office in Kinshasa in January 2005, MAG has become increasingly active in establishing partnerships with the international NGO community, as well as working with the local UN Mine Action Coordination Centre. MAG also cooperates with local NGOs in the field who are able to provide invaluable information regarding local mine/UXO problems. A partnership for organisational and technical capacity building has been signed until 2012 with Humanitas Ubangi, a local organisation working on MRE in the province of Equateur and hoping to extend to the Kasais. Additionally, MAG maintains a regular dialogue with relevant government and military authority and has entered into a partnership agreement through an [[Memorandum of understanding|MOU]] with a national [[NGO]] Humanitas Ubangi to develop its organisational and technical capacity to undertake Humanitarian Mine Action activities.\n\n=== Iraq ===\nMAG has been conducting Humanitarian Mine Action in the heavily mine-affected north of the country since 1992, and since the most recent conflict efforts have concentrated on delivering vital services in northern and central areas of the country. This work significantly reduces the threat to both resident and transient populations, and has supported wider rehabilitation and socio-economic development initiatives. Up to date, MAG has cleared more than one and a half million landmines and items of [[UXO]], freeing several million square metres of land for use by the local population. MAG's Iraq programme has recently also launched a dedicated project to safely remove and destroy small arms and light weapons, acting to support peace keeping initiatives which aim for long-term stability in Iraq.\n\nCurrently, MAG Iraq has more than 750 national staff working in the programme.This capacity consists of 18 Mine Action Teams, which provide a highly responsive and mobile multi-skilled clearance capacity, trained to International Mine Action Standards (IMAS); 10 Community Liaison teams; 2 midi-flail machines and operating teams; and 4 MDD teams. And despite security constraints, MAG remains operational in the North and parts of the centre and continues to implement operations. The programme works with local and regional partners in unstable parts of Iraq to reduce the threat posed by remnants of conflict to vulnerable high-risk communities.\n\n'''Partnerships and Coordination''' MAG works with the National Mine Action Authority (NMAA) located in Baghdad, the Iraqi Kurdistan Mine Action Authority (IKMAA) and the General Directorate of Mine Action (GDMA) in the North. MAG also coordinates with UN agencies, local and regional government authorities and other organisations involved in humanitarian, rehabilitation and reconstruction initiatives throughout Iraq. As part of its commitment to national capacity building, MAG has been working in partnership with the Kurdish Ministries of Education and Health to develop a sustainable and independent Mine Risk Education (MRE) delivery capacity in Northern Iraq.\n\n=== Laos ===\nMAG's [[Laos|Laotian]] programme began in 1994 with the establishment of the first internationally supported [[UXO]] (Unexploded Ordnance) clearance operation in the country. MAG currently works in [[Xiangkhouang Province|XiangKhouang]] and [[Khammouane]] provinces, operating 11 UXO clearance teams (including two all-female teams) and 9 Community Liaison teams. The programme has 211 national staff, of which 35% are female.\n\nMAG continued to pursue an integrated UXO action approach, which was subsequently developed and adopted nationally in 1996 with the creation of the Lao government\u2019s national UXO organisation, UXO Lao. MAG has the distinction of having handed over to UXO Lao, two effective and efficient  operations in the provinces of Xieng Khouang and [[Salavan Province|Saravan]]. Since 2000, MAG has continued to support the activities of UXO Lao, providing operational and technical advice to these provincial operations and MAG is also now providing technical assistance to UXO Lao in a third province: Khammouane. Recent sector reform has enabled international NGOs and Government of Lao (GoL) provincial authorities to ask MAG to assist with clearance linked to specific\ndevelopment projects in XiangKhouang and Khammouane, especially in areas where UXO Lao is unable to respond. In addition, MAG has piloted the use of [[UXO]] detection dogs and Village Assisted Clearance (VAC) to improve productivity and impact.\n\nIn 2007 MAG Lao located and destroyed 6,460 items of UXO, 3,257,638 square metres of land was cleared for agriculture, drainage canals, electricity pylons, water wells, school gardens, roads (to provide access to markets) and for a project to promote tourism at the historic Plain of Jars. From January to June 2008, MAG Lao destroyed 3,537 items of UXO.\n\nThe work of MAG teams in Laos is the focus of the 2007 documentary movie ''[[Bomb Harvest]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombharvest.com|title=\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u9bc9\u306e\u307c\u308a\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601025119/http://bombharvest.com/|archive-date=1 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Community Liaison ====\nAlmost 15 percent of field staff are members of Community Liaison teams, devoted to ensuring that communities are consulted and involved throughout the whole UXO clearance process. The information gained though Community Liaison ensures that UXO clearance is directly linked with poverty alleviation.\n\n=== Lebanon ===\n[[Image:UXO in Rachaf.jpg|thumb|UXO in [[Rachaf]], Lebanon]] \nMAG began its HMA activities in Southern [[Lebanon]] in 2000 and now employs 80 national staff members on new and existing projects. Following the 2006 ceasefire, this figure rose to around 360 nationally recruited employees. In 2003, MAG Lebanon completed a national Landmine Impact Survey (LIS), which was carried out in conjunction with the National Demining Office (NDO). Another team also conducted a technical survey into suspected contaminated areas along the 'Blue Line'.\nDuring the conflict between Hezbollah and Israeli forces from mid-July to mid-August 2006, there was a dramatic change in the mine/unexploded ordnance (UXO) situation. The fighting and artillery bombardments were heaviest in southern Lebanon, and as a result, an estimated 915,000 internally displaced persons ([[IDPs]])  fled this area and scattered throughout communities further north. Over 200,000 refugees left the country entirely. Roads and communities in southern Lebanon were littered with UXO thus making movement throughout South Lebanon both difficult and dangerous. Immediately prior to the conflict situation MAG deployed 4 MATs and 1 Mechanical team who went operational in June 2006. The flexibility of this MAT team meant that immediately after the cessation of violence MAG had a team on the ground responding to the most immediate threats. Since the immediate post-conflict phase, MAG has steadily worked on 'battle area clearance' (BAC), which concentrates on removing cluster submunitions and UXO.\n\nFrom the end of 2006 conflict, MAG Lebanon's capacity grew to 22 Mine Action Teams (MATs), 5 Mechanical Teams, 2 Mine Dog Detection teams, 3 Community Liaison Teams (responsible for gathering information from the community on remnants of conflict), 1 Technical Survey Team, 1 Reconnaissance Team (responsible for surveying battle areas), and 1 Quality Control/ Quality Assurance Team (responsible for training and monitoring operations quality). Since the end of the 2006 conflict, MAG has cleared more than 9.8 million square metres of land, destroyed almost 21 000 remnants of conflict, cleared 294 dangerous areas, and assisted 450,000 people at risk from death or injury from remnants of conflict. The scope of activities carried out by MAG Lebanon's programme includes rapid survey and demarcation of landmine and UXO contaminated areas, clearance of priority routes and land, and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) tasks. Alongside this, integration of MAG Lebanon's activities with those of the NDO (National Demining Office) and other organizations operating in the region remains a priority.\n\nMAG has positive working relationships with key organisations such as the United Nations Mine Action Coordination Centre South Lebanon (MACC SL) and The Lebanese Red Cross.\n\n=== Mali ===\nMAG is delivering Risk Education messages to internally displaced people, returnees and resident populations in northern Mali.\n\n=== Myanmar ===\nMAG began work in Kayah state, Myanmar in 2014, giving lifesaving Mine Risk Education (MRE) to communities dependent for their livelihoods on land that is riddled with mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) from decades of internal conflict.\n\n=== Somalia ===\nFunded by the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement, U.S. Department of State, MAG began its current operations in Somalia in May 2008 with a project to clear conventional weapons and stockpiles in conflict-affected areas in the Puntland region. Work is centred in the administrative capital of the region, Garowe, where a unit of the local police force is receiving Explosive Ordnance Disposal training \u2013 covering munitions recognition, the safe handling of explosive ordnance, conducting safe demolitions, first aid and communications. Once the training is complete, MAG will support and advise the team as they carry out operations around Puntland.\n\nFollowing an accident in July 2008, concerning some children who were playing with a 106mm high explosive anti-tank round that exploded on a school football field (three died and six were injured), MAG held meetings with the elders of the town, made appeals for information, gave Mine Risk Education (MRE) on the local radio and collected other items reported by the community. It is anticipated that further small arms and light weapons (SALW) and UXO clearance of the country is required to remove these threats, to prevent further accidents and to ensure safe access and use of the land.\n\n;Partnerships and Coordination\n\nMAG carries out activities in Somalia in close coordination with the PMAC. MAG has also established a good relationship with UNDP Somalia who provide support to MAG\u2019s current operation in Puntland. MAG is also working in cooperation with Geneva Call.\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\nMAG began emergency MRE, survey and demarcation activities in the [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] region of northern [[Sri Lanka]] in February 2002. The aim of the MAG teams were to address the outstanding problems of landmine and UXO contamination apparent following the ceasefire (Memorandum of Understanding) between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Through deploying Mine Risk Education (MRE), survey and demarcation assets in Northern Sri Lanka, MAG teams sought to protect those most affected by the conflict which had plagued the region since 1983. Later in 2002, clearance assets, including manual, mechanical and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) were introduced to the programme structure. \n  \nIn August 2003, MAG expanded into the eastern district of [[Batticaloa]], where it remains, providing vital conflict recovery assistance. In May 2005, as a result of the December [[tsunami]], MAG established a landmine and UXO response in Ampara district. MAG's capacity in Sri Lanka in its three project locations has grown to include five CL/MRE teams, three emergency EOD teams, nine technical survey/demining teams, one minefield marking/fencing team, two general survey teams\nspecifically tasked to support NGOs and local authorities undertaking development projects, one Battle Area Clearance (BAC) team and two MATs. In addition, MAG runs two Mechanical Support Units utilising Bozena mini flails.\n\nSince the start of operations in 2002, MAG has cleared 15,500,000 square metres through manual, mechanical, and Battle Area Clearance (BAC) techniques.\n\nIn 2006 the security situation worsened between the Government and the TRO, forcing MAG to scale down its operations within Sri Lanka significantly, but restarted in September 2007 when MAG undertook tasking in Trincomalee district, responding to support the Ministry of Resettlements in their resettlement plans. All MAG assets returned to Batticola in October 2007 and since then MAG has concentrated on tasks only in the Batticaloa district due to a lack of access to the Northern region. At present, MAG fields one Community Liaison team, three Manual Mine Clearance Teams, and two Mechanical Ground Preparation Teams\u2014each deploying a 'Bozena 4' mini flails.\n\nMAG has already begun survey in an area of Mannar District in the north where the population had to leave quickly in late 2007 during fighting in the area. Five villages were surveyed in April 2009, and the area has been declared safe for the families to return. MAG now plans to expand its activities in the north throughout the remainder of the year in support of the initiative to return 80 per cent of IDPs back to their home areas by the end of 2009.\n\nMine Action in Sri Lanka is coordinated through the National Steering Committee for Mine Action (NSCMA) which is supported though by UNDP. MAG works in coordination with the NSCMA and also through district Mine Action Committees, where communication with all stakeholders allows contaminated areas to be priorised for clearance and district work plans to be produced.\n\n=== South Sudan ===\nMAG has been operational in [[South Sudan]] since 1998. At present, MAG has teams carrying out landmine clearance, bomb disposal and destruction of abandoned small arms and light weapons (SALW). MAG also have Community Liaison/Mine Risk Educational teams delivering important messages to settled populations, the internally displaced and returnees living in contaminated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maginternational.org/where-mag-works/south-sudan/|title=MAG (Mines Advisory Group) - South Sudan|work=MAG (Mines Advisory Group)|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nAs the largest non-military clearance organisation operating in [[Vietnam]], MAG plays a key role in reducing the risk and impact of mines/UXO on the\nlocal population, and also in facilitating community level post-clearance development and resettlement. MAG first began operating in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]], central Vietnam, in 1999- encompassing the former DMZ ([[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]]), which divided Vietnam and witnessed the majority of flighting and bombing during the 1960s and '70s. In early 2003, MAG's operations were expanded to the adjacent province of [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province|Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh]].\n\nMost of MAG's work is mobile explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations, whereby teams systematically work through every village in a commune, clearing all known items of UXO and suspect items. From 1999 to the end of July 2008, MAG achieved the following outputs in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb and Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh provinces:\n\n*Teams cleared 6,708,715 square metres of land using manual electronic and visual search techniques, removing 22,573 items of UXO and 2,040 mines.\n*Teams also visited 181,125 houses, performing 24,931 EOD tasks and removing 110,663 items of UXO and 439 mines.\n\nSince November 2007, Community Liaison teams have conducted 324 community/partner meetings, visiting 255 villages, conducting 7,253 house to house surveys and documenting 962 mine/UXO reports.\n\nMAG's work is closely linked to the development plans of the provinces, districts and communities in which it operates. The teams have cleared areas for a wide range of development activities and also respond to emergency EOD requests. MAG's current operational capacity in Vietnam consists of 5 MATs in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province and 4 MATs in Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province and 4 recently introduced Community Liaison teams. In addition, MAG provides technical assistance and quality assurance to mine action projects in [[Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf Province|Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf]] and [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province|Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i]] provinces.\n\nMAG Vietnam also respond to emergency EOD requests. Humanitatian mine action is also linked to the development plans of the provinces, districts and communities. MAG Vietnam is committed to forming partnerships with government authorities at both national and local level, NGOs, and other agencies. To date, all projects have been either in partnership with the local authorities or with development organisations. MAG is a regular participant in the Landmine Working Group, a group of NGOs, UN agencies and other organisations concerned with the mine/UXO issue in Vietnam. In addition to this, MAG has developed working partnerships with poverty reduction agencies such as CHF-partners in rural development in order to link MAG Vietnam's clearance work to the Millennium Goal of poverty reduction. These partnerships ensure that land and villages cleared by MAG is used in the most productive and sustainable way, while meeting the needs of the local population.\n\n== Past operations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maginternational.org/countries|title=MAG (Mines Advisory Group) - Countries|work=MAG (Mines Advisory Group)|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> ==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nOngoing since 2002: MAG trained the [[Organisation for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation]] to address new types of UXO found after the coalition activity in the area. Mechanical assistance is also being provided.\n\n=== Azerbaijan ===\nTraining local partners in the [[Fizuli Rayon|Fizuli district]] close to the front line with areas still occupied by Armenian forces.\n\n=== Burundi ===\nIn 2007 MAG began assisting [[Burundi]]'s government after civil war left the country with the burden of small arms and light weapons ([[SALW]]), and unsecured stockpiles.\n\nStrained relations between the government and rebel groups have helped facilitate the spread of SALW throughout the civilian population. The situation has deteriorated further as a result of Burundi\u2019s permeable frontiers and the inadequate enforcement of illegal arms trade legislation.\n\nMAG works with Burundi's government to eliminate the threat of SALW and unsecured stockpiles. Their work in Burundi involves assisting the national army to destroy [[Man-Portable Air Defence Systems]] (MANPADS), and training and equipping members of the army and police force to become Mobile SALW destruction teams. These teams work throughout the country, destroying seized SALW, small arms ammunition (SAA) and explosives. When necessary the teams also respond to identified [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXO) spot tasks.\n\n=== Cyprus ===\nSince October 2004, MAG has been contracted in [[Cyprus]] by the [[United Nations]]. They provide quality management for the work of commercial contractors, who clear minefields between the Greek Cypriot- and Turkish Cypriot-controlled regions of the country. Cyprus\u2019s landmine contamination is estimated to span nine million square metres and consists of 77 minefields or suspected minefields.\n\nMAG's work in Cyprus, based in Nicosia, safeguards the quality of work conducted by other UN contractors, and ensures that their work complies with international standards. Contractors must execute clearance work safely and efficiently, and MAG provides the management and maintenance of a mine detection dog accreditation and testing database.\n\n=== Republic of Congo ===\nMAG started working in the Republic of Congo in late 2007, alongside the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Congo, to try to prevent the risk from any remnants of conflict.\n\nIts aims are to make a material contribution to peace-building initiatives and security efforts in the Republic of Congo through identifying, surveying and destroying small arms and light weapons, MANPADS (Man-Portable Air Defence Systems) and other explosive ordnance, which currently poses a hazard due to their degraded state, storage conditions and proximity to local communities.\n\n=== Rwanda ===\nIn August 2008, MAG, alongside the Regional Centre on Small Arms (RECSA), carried out a survey to determine the status of small arms and light weapons activities that were going on in Rwanda. As a result of this, they managed to get funding off the UK Government Conflict Prevention Pool to start a four-month Conventional Weapons Management and Disposal project. It includes assisting the Rwandan Army and Police, and also provides training, in stockpile management and destruction of surplus weapons, unstable ordnance and small arms ammunition. As a result of this over 10,000 weapons have already been destroyed.\n\nMAG's work is beneficial for communities situated near stockpiles, as it reduces death and injury caused by them. It also benefits the wider population, who before MAG started this project, were threatened by the risk of violent crime that followed looting of the weapons that had been insecurely stored.\n\nMAG have also trained army personnel in stockpile management, weapons destruction and basic Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) skills to make up a Destruction Team, who then started weapons destruction activities which were supervised and supported by the MAG Technical Field Manager. After this a weapons destruction workshop was set up. This project ran up until March 2009, during which time MAG, along with the Rwandan Authorities, established some further priorities and decided what work was to be done from April 2009 onwards.\n\n=== Somaliland ===\nOctober 2001 to July 2002: MAG worked with the [[United Nations Office for Project Services]] (UNOPS). Established and trained an EOD team composed of [[Somaliland]] police personnel and a member of the [[Somaliland Mine Action Centre]] (SMAC).\n\n== Assessments ==\nAssessments have been carried out in the following countries:\n* [[Bosnia Herzegovina]]\n* [[Colombia]]\n* [[Congo-Brazzaville]]\n* [[Eritrea]]\n* [[Guinea-Bissau]]\n* [[Ivory Coast]]\n* [[Kashmir]]\n* [[Namibia]]\n* [[Senegal]]\n* [[Taiwan]]\n* [[Zambia]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.maginternational.org/ MAG website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/v/BSFt8H9PCNc&hl=en&fs=1 Official MAG film - ''Conflict Recovery'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080311153154/http://www.bombharvest.com/synopsis.html ''Bomb Harvest''], a film about MAG\n* [https://archive.is/20130221091641/http://www.abdphoto.net/photographs/mines-advisory-group.html MAG photos from Quang Tri, Vietnam]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=mines+advisory+group&m=text/, MAG photos from current operations worldwide.]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Charities based in Manchester]]\n[[Category:International charities]]\n[[Category:Mine warfare and mine clearance organizations]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mines_Advisory_Group"}
