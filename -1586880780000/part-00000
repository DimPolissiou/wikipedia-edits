Originally available on [[Compact Cassette (data)|Compact Cassette]] for the Apple I in 1976, then included in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] on the Apple II from its release in 1977, it was the first version of BASIC used by many early [[home computer]] owners.{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001}}\n\nThe language supported mathematics using [[integers]], lacking [[floating point|floating-point]] support. Using integers allowed numbers to be stored in a much more compact 16-bit format that could be more rapidly read and processed than the 32- or 40-bit floating-point formats found in most BASICs of the era. However, this limited its applicability as a general-purpose language.{{efn|Or as [[Bill Gates]] put it, \"more powerful BASIC... using floating point\".<ref>{{cite magazine\n|first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman\n|title=BASIC timing comparisons\u2026 revised and updated\n|magazine=Kilobaud\n|date=October 1977\n|pages=20\u201325\n|url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-10\n}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother difference with other BASICs of the era is that Integer BASIC treated strings as arrays of characters, similar to the system in [[C programming language|C]] or [[Fortran 77]]. Substrings were accessed using [[array slicing]] rather than string functions. This style was introduced in [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]], and could also be found in other contemporary BASICs patterned on HP, like [[North Star BASIC]] and [[Atari BASIC]]. It contrasted with the style found in BASICs derived from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], including [[Microsoft BASIC]].\n\nThe language was initially developed under the name '''GAME BASIC''' and referred to simply as '''Apple BASIC''' when it was introduced on the Apple I. It became Integer BASIC when it was ported to the Apple II and shipped alongside [[Applesoft BASIC]], a port of [[Microsoft BASIC]] which included floating-point support. Integer BASIC was phased out in favor of Applesoft BASIC starting with the [[Apple II Plus]] in 1979.\n\n==History==\nAs a senior in [[high school]], [[Steve Wozniak]]'s electronics teacher arranged for the leading students in the class to have placements at local electronics companies. Wozniak was sent to [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] where he programmed in [[FORTRAN]] on an IBM machine. That same year, [[General Electric]] placed a terminal in the high school that was connected to one of their mainframes running their [[timesharing]] BASIC service, which they were heavily promoting at the time. After having three days of access, the students were asked to write letters on why the school should receive a terminal permanently, but their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nSome years later, Wozniak was working at [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) running simulations of chip designs and logic layout for calculators.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} HP made major inroads in the [[minicomputer]] market with their [[HP 2100]] series machines running a custom timesharing version of BASIC. For approximately $100,000, one could build up a reasonably equipped machine that could support between 16 and 32 users running BASIC programs.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://hpmemoryproject.org/news/tenyears_comp/measure_page_00.htm |title= Passing the 10-year mark |magazine= MEASURE Magazine |date= October 1976 |publisher= Hewlett Packard}}</ref> While expensive, it was still a fraction of the cost of the [[mainframe]] machines{{efn|An IBM 370/155 cost over $2 million in 1970 ({{Inflation|US|2000000|1970|fmt=eq}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arnnet.com.au/slideshow/541873/pictures-mostly-cool-history-ibm-mainframe/ |title=The (mostly) cool history of the IBM mainframe |first=Michael |last=Cooney |website=ARN}}</ref>}} and, for heavy users, less than the timesharing services.{{efn|Tymshare charged about $10 per hour ({{Inflation|US|10|1970|fmt=eq}}) for accessing their systems,<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Online Information Services, 1963\u20131976 |first1= Charles |last1=Bourne |first2=Trudi Bellardo |last2=Hahn |page=387 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=LTTvmUU8rskC&pg=PA387|isbn= 9780262261753 |date= August 2003 }}</ref> while smaller services could be found for about $5.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=InfoWorld |date=27 April 1981 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DT4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7 |title=Back to BASIC |first=Tim |last=Barry |page=7}}</ref>}} HP followed this with the [[HP 9830]], a desktop-sized machine for $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1970|fmt=eq}}) that also ran BASIC, which Wozniak had access to.{{sfn|Williams|Moore|1984|p=A71}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |quote=I sniffed the wind and knew that the key to making my computer good (popular) was to include a high-level language and that it had to be BASIC. |author=Steve Wozniak{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}}}\n\nIn January 1975 the [[Altair 8800]] was announced and sparked off the [[microcomputer]] revolution. In March, Wozniak attended the first meeting of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] and began formulating the design of his own computer. One of the most important pieces of software for the Altair, and one of the most heavily [[Copyright infringement|pirated]], was [[Altair BASIC]] from the recently formed [[Microsoft]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Understanding Online Piracy |first= Nathan |last=Fisk |page=14 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |date= 2009 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZZJxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14}}</ref> Wozniak concluded that his machine would have to have a BASIC of its own, which would, hopefully, be the first for the [[MOS Technology 6502]] processor. As the language needed 4&nbsp;kB RAM, he made that the minimum memory for the design.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak's references for BASIC were a copy of ''[[101 BASIC Computer Games]]'' and an HP BASIC manual.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} Unknown to him at the time, HP's BASIC was significantly different than the [[BASIC-PLUS|DEC BASIC]] variety used in ''101 Games'', which was also the pattern for MS's BASIC for the Altair. Based on these sources, be began sketching out a [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] chart for the language. The design initially included floating-point support, but still hoping he might publish the first BASIC on the 6502 and become \"a star\", he decided to abandon floating-point and write a separate integer math system to save a few weeks programming time.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak would later describe his language as \"intended primarily for games and educational uses\".{{sfn|Wozniak|1977}}  Referring to it throughout development as \"GAME BASIC\", Wozniak wrote the code by hand, translating the [[assembler code]] instructions into their [[machine code]] equivalents and then uploading the result to his computer.{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001|loc=The [Integer] BASIC, which we shipped with the first Apple II's, was never assembled &mdash; ever. There was one handwritten copy, all handwritten, all hand-assembled.}} Without any training on how to write a computer language, he used his HP calculator experience to implement a [[stack machine]] to interpret expressions.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} Once the basic routines were up and running, he worked on the other commands one-by-one in a modular fashion. With every visit to the Homebrew club, he would demonstrate a few more features that had been added in the last month.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |quote=It was the most satisfying day of my life... I demonstrated Breakout [at Homebrew]-totally written in BASIC... After designing hardware arcade games, I knew that being able to program them in BASIC was going to change the world. |author=Steve Wozniak{{sfn|Williams|Moore|1984|p=A71}}}}\n\nAs he built out his computer and BASIC, Wozniak was also working for [[Atari]] designing [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]. At some point, he decided to see whether one could write the game in BASIC. He added commands to read [[paddle controller]]s and over a series of quick edits had a version of the game up and running. To improve its playability, he added a speaker to make clicks when the ball hit things. While showing it to [[Steve Jobs]], Wozniak demonstrated that he could quickly change the colors that his game used, just by altering the [[source code]]. Wozniak later wrote that he had proved that \"software was much more flexible than hardware\", and that he and Jobs realized that \"now, anyone could create arcade games without having to design it in hardware.\"{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak did complete a floating-point library for the 6502 and published it in the April 1976 edition of [[Dr. Dobbs]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_01/page/n207/mode/2up |first1=Roy |last1=Raskin |first2=Steven |last2=Wozniak |title=Floating Point Routines for the 6502 |magazine=Dr. Dobbs |date=August 1976 |pages=17\u201319}}</ref> This library was later made part of the ROMs for the [[Apple II]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Apple II Reference Manual |date= January 1978 |publisher=Apple Computer |pages=94-95}}</ref> Wozniak began work on back-porting the floating-point code into Apple BASIC, but got sidetracked in the task of designing a [[floppy disk]] controller for what became the [[Disk II]]. [[Mike Markkula]] said the company would go to the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]] if the disk system was ready in time, so Wozniak and [[Randy Wigginton]] worked on it non-stop through the 1977 holidays.{{sfn|Wozniak|2018}}\n\nWhen he returned to the topic of floating-point in BASIC, Jobs complained it was taking too long. Without Wozniak being aware, the company arranged a license with Microsoft to receive their recently completed 6502 version of the Altair code. Examining the code, Wozniak decided that it was easier to add graphics support to MS's code than add floating-point his own BASIC, as the later required hand-patching of the original machine code while MS's was written in assembler and more easily modified. The development of Apple's BASIC ended in favor of what became Applesoft. Wozniak later noted, \"My biggest disappointment was going to the awful string functions like LEFT$(VAR, 5) and MID$(VAR2,5,3) instead of my own\".{{sfn|Wozniak|2018}}{{efn|The string handling was not \"his own\", but the same system used by HP BASIC.}}\n\nWhen the Apple II shipped in the summer of 1977, Integer BASIC was supplied in ROM, while Applesoft BASIC shipped on cassette. This changed with the introduction of the [[Apple II Plus]] in 1979, when Applesoft was put in the ROM.{{sfn|Hertzfeld|1985}}\n\n==Description==\n===Program editing===\nLike most BASIC implementations of the era, Integer BASIC was both the language interpreter as well as the line editing environment. When BASIC was running, a {{code|>}} [[command prompt]] was displayed where the user could enter statements.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=11}}{{efn|To make it clear which BASIC was running, Applesoft used the {{code|]}} prompt.}} Unlike later [[home computer]] platforms, BASIC was not the default environment when the computer started, it normally started in the [[machine code monitor|monitor]]. BASIC was started by pressing {{key press|Ctrl|B}}{{key press|Return}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=12}}\n\nStatements that were entered with leading numbers are entered into the program storage for \"deferred execution\",{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=46}} either as new lines or replacing any that might have had the same number previously.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=49-55}} Statements that were entered without a line number were referred to as commands, and ran immediately.{{efn|In what MS referred to more descriptively as \"[[Direct mode|immediate mode]]\".}} Line numbers could be from 0 to 32767,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=48}}{{efn|Helmers says the lowest line number is 1.{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=24}}}} and lines could contain up to 128 characters.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=118}}\n\nInteger BASIC also included the {{code|AUTO}} command to automatically enter line numbers at a given starting number like {{code|AUTO 100}}, adding 10 to the last number with every new line. {{code|AUTO 300,5}} would begin numbering at line 300 by fives; 300, 305, etc. Automatic numbering was turned off by entering {{code|MAN}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=65-67}}\n\nOne interesting feature of the editor was that a section of the screen could be set aside as the \"window\", where live updates took place. This was normally the entire screen, but it could be limited to a smaller area by {{code|POKE}}ing values into memory locations 32 through 35.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=124}} This feature could be used to create an editable text area while the rest of the screen was in graphics mode.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|loc=\"This mixed mode provides a 40 by 40 color graphics grid plus four lines of scrolling text at the bottom of the screen.\"}}\n\n===Debugging===\nAs in most BASICs, programs were started with the {{code|RUN}} command, and as was common, could be directed at a particular line number like {{code|RUN 300}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=100}} Execution could be stopped at any time using {{key press|Ctrl|C}}{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=15}} and then restarted with {{code|CON}}tinue, as opposed to the more typical {{code|CONT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=52}}\n\nFor step-by-step execution, the {{code|TRACE}} instruction could be used at the command prompt or placed within the program itself. When it was turned on, line numbers were printed out for each line the program visited. The feature could be turned off again with {{code|NOTRACE}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=107}}\n\nA somewhat unusual feature was the {{code|DSP}} (for \"display\") command. When encountered in a program, from that point on any ''changes'' to a variable's value would be displayed. For instance, {{code|DSP X}} would display the value of X every time it changed, along with the line number where the change occurred.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=100,101}} As with TRACE, DSP was turned off with {{code|NODSP}}.{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=24}}\n\n===Mathematics===\nInteger BASIC, as its name implies, uses integers as the basis for its math package. These were stored internally as a 16-bit number, little-endian (as is the 6502). This allowed a maximum value for any calculation between -32767 and 32767; although the format could also store the value -32768, BASIC could not display that number. Calculations that resulted in values outside that range produced a {{code|>32767 ERR}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=27}}\n\nInfix operators included {{code|+}} (addition), {{code|-}} (subraction), {{code|*}} (multiplication), {{code|/}} (division), [[Modulo operation|MOD]] (remainder) and exponent using the {{code|^}} character. Binary operators included {{code|AND}}, {{code|OR}} and {{code|NOT}}. Binary comparisons included the standard set of {{code|{{=}}}}, {{code|>}}, {{code|<}}, {{code|>{{=}}}}, {{code|<{{=}}}}, {{code|<>}} and the HP-inspired {{code|#}}, which was equivalent to <>.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=61}}\n\nOnly single-dimension arrays were allowed, limited in size only by the available memory.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=94}} Mathematical functions were sparse; only {{code|ABS}} (absolute value), {{code|SGN}} (sign) and {{code|RND}} (random number) were supported.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=40,120}} In contrast to MS-derived versions, where the parameter was ignored and {{code|RND}} always returned a value 0..<1, Integer BASIC used the parameter; {{code|RND(6)}} returned an integer from 0 to 5.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=40}}\n\n===Strings===\nInteger BASIC's string handling was based on the system in HP BASIC. This treated string variables as arrays of characters, which had to be {{code|DIM}}ed prior to use. This is similar to the model in [[C programming language|C]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.learn-c.org/en/Strings |title= Strings |website=learn-c.org}}</ref> or [[Fortran 77]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Brooks |url=http://math.hawaii.edu/~dale/190/characters_formats.pdf |website=University of Hawaii |title=Characters & Strings in Fortran}}</ref> This is in contrast to MS-like BASICs, where strings are an intrinsic variable-length type.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2020/commodore-basic-variables |title=C64 Programmer's Manual |website=commodore.ca |loc=\nInteger, Floating Point and String Variables}}</ref> Before MS-derived BASICs became the ''de facto'' standard, this style was not uncommon; [[North Star BASIC]]<ref>{{cite book |title=North Star BASIC version 6 |url=http://itelsoft.com.au/north_star_manuals/North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf |publisher=North Star Corporation |date=1977}}</ref> and [[Atari BASIC]]<ref>{{{cite book |title=The ATARI BASIC Reference Manual |publisher=Atari Inc |year=1980 |url=http://www.strotmann.de/twiki/bin/view/Infothek/AtBasicReferenceMa}}</ref> used the same concept, as did others.\n \nStrings in Integer used a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the number of characters used within them to a maximum of 255 characters.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=89}} This had the advantage of avoiding the need for the [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of the [[Heap (data structure)|heap]] that was notoriously slow in MS BASIC{{efn|And completely broken in some versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pagetable.com/?p=46 |title=Create your own Version of Microsoft BASIC}}</ref>}} but meant that strings that were shorter than the declared length was wasted.\n\nSubstring access was provided through [[array slicing]] syntax. For instance, {{code|PRINT A$(0,5)}} prints the first six characters of A$, characters 0 through 5.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=88}}{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=88}}{{efn|HP also allowed [ and ] in place of ( and ).}} Concatenation was provided using the same system, {{code|A$(5){{=}}\"ABC\"}} replaced any characters starting at position 5 with the string \"ABC\".{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=92}} This contrasts with the DEC/MS-style string handling, which uses string functions like {{code|MID$}} to access substrings, and {{code|+}} for concatenation.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://chiclassiccomp.org/docs/content/computing/MITS/MITS_Altair8800Basic4.1Reference_April1977.pdf |title=altair 8080 basic manual |date=April 1977 |publisher=MITS |page=30}}</ref>{{efn|It also contrasts with [[Dartmouth BASIC]], which used the {{code|CONVERT}} command to convert a string into an array of ASCII values, which the user then manipulated and converted back to string format with a second {{code|CONVERT}}.}}\n\nAs many of the features that would be provided by string functions were instead provided by array slicing, the selection of string functions was reduced. {{code|LEN$}} returned the length of a string,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=89}} and {{code|ASC}} returned the ASCII numeric code for the first letter in a string.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}} It lacked an equivalent of the {{code|CHR$}} that returned the ASCII character with a given numeric code.{{sfn|Mini|1977|p=17}}\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nWhen launched, the only [[game controller]] for the Apple was the [[paddle controller]], which had two controllers on a single connector. The position of the controller could be read using the {{code|PDL}} function, passing in the controller number, 0 or 1, like {{code|A{{=}}PDL(0):PRINT A}}, returning a value between 0 and 255.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=36}}{{efn|The manual suggests, but does not outright state, that the actual range of values is less than 0 to 255.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=36}}}}\n\nThe Apple machines did not include dedicated sound hardware, only a simple \"beeper\". Producing sounds was accomplished by {{code|PEEK}}ing the memory-mapped location of the speaker, -16336.{{efn|The negative number is a side-effect of the integers being stored in signed format, so any memory location over 32767 appeared as a negative value in BASIC.{{sfn|Mini|1977|p=18}}}} Repeatedly PEEKing that value produced tones, and the manual suggested using a mathematical expression to do this, like {{code|S{{=}}PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=84}}\n\nSupport for graphics was more detailed. Graphics mode was turned on with the {{code|GR}} statement and off with {{code|TEXT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=31}} Drawing was modal and normally started by issuing a command to change the color, which was accomplished by setting a pseudo-variable; {{code|COLOR{{=}}12}} would set the drawing color to 12, light green. One could then {{code|PLOT 10,10}} to produce a single spot of that color,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=32}} {{code|HLIN 0,39 AT 20}} to draw a horizontal line at row 20 that spanned the screen, or {{code|VLIN 5,15 AT 7}} to draw a shorter vertical line down column 7.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=33}} {{code|A{{=}}SCRN X,Y}} returned the color of the screen at X,Y.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}}{{efn|Note the odd syntax of the SCRN, which is technically a function because it returns a value, but does not use function-like syntax which would be {{code|A{{=}}SCRN(X,Y)}}.}}\n\n===Input/Output===\nInteger BASIC lacked any custom input/output commands, and also lacked the {{code|DATA}} statement and the associated {{code|READ}}. To get data into and out of a program, the input/output functionality was redirected to a selected [[Expansion card|card slot]] with the {{code|PR#x}} and {{code|IN#x}}, which redirected output or input (respectively) to the numbered slot. From then on, data could be sent to the card using conventional {{code|PRINT}} commands and read from it using {{code|INPUT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}}\n\n===Other notes===\nInteger BASIC included a {{code|TAB}} feature, which positioned the cursor on a given column from 0 to 39. It differed from the versions found in most BASICs in that it was a command with a following number, as opposed to a function with the value in parenthesis; one would move the cursor to column 10 using {{code|TAB 10}} in Integer BASIC{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=73}} whereas in MS this would be {{code|PRINT TAB(10)}}. Additionally, the {{code|VTAB}} command worked similar to {{code|TAB}} but added vertical spaces instead of horizontal. For unexplained reasons, in this case the coordinates were from 1 to 24 rather than 0 to 23.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=74}}\n\nInteger BASIC included a {{code|POP}} command to exit from loops.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}} This popped the topmost item off the FOR stack. Atari BASIC also supported the same command,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.atarimania.com/documents/Atari-Basic-Reference-Manual-Rev-C.pdf |title=Atari BASIC Reference Manual |publisher=Atari |date=1983 |page=25}}</ref> while [[North Star BASIC]] used {{code|EXIT}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=North Star BASIC version 6 |url=http://itelsoft.com.au/north_star_manuals/North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf |publisher=North Star Corporation |date=1977 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe Integer BASIC ROMs also included a [[machine code monitor]], \"mini-[[assembler (computing)|assembler]]\", and disassembler to create and debug [[assembly language]] programs. Wozniak hand-assembled the monitor as the Apple II's first program, then used it to write Integer BASIC.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=18}}{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Tokenizer===\nInteger BASIC read the lines typed in by the user from a buffer and ran them through a [[Parsing|parser]] which output a series of [[Lexical token|tokens]]. As part of this process, simple [[syntax error]]s are detected and listed. If the parsing is successful, the line number (if present) is converted from [[ASCII]] decimal format into a 16-bit integer, and any keywords into a 7-bit integer token.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\nNumeric literals, like the value 500, were converted into their 16-bit (two-byte) binary representation, in this case, $01F4 [[hexidecimal]]. To indicate this was a value and not a keyword, a single byte between $B0 and $B9 was inserted in front of the two-byte value.{{efn|The first digit of the original value is used to select a value from 0 to 9, so in this example, the token would be $B5 for the first digit of 500.}} String literals, like \"HELLO WORLD\" were instead converted by setting the high bit of each character, so that {{code|A}} was stored as $C1. Variable names were converted in the same fashion, with the letters converted to have their high-bit turned on, and any digits in the name represented by the corresponding $B0 through $B9, so that the variable {{code|A5}} would be tokenized as $C1B5.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\nIf the line was entered without a line number, the code was then executed directly from the buffer. If it had a line number, it was copied from the buffer into the program storage area.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}} The line in the buffer was first prefixed with a single byte containing the line length and postfixed with a $01 to indicate the end of the line (null was not used).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe runtime interpreter used two stacks for execution, one for statement keywords and the other for evaluating the parameters. Each statement was given two priorities, one that stated where it should occur in a multi-step operation, like a string of mathematical operations to provide [[order of operations]], and another that suggested when evaluation should occur, for instance, calculating internal values of a parenthesis formula. When variables are encountered, their name is parsed and then looked up in the variable storage area. The address of the variable's storage, perhaps freshly created, is then placed on the evaluation stack.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\n===SWEET16===\n{{main|SWEET16}}\nInteger BASIC is partially implemented in a custom [[assembler language]] known as [[SWEET16]]. SWEET16 is based on [[bytecode]]s that run within a simple 16-bit [[virtual machine]]. This model was used so memory could be addressed via indirect 16-bit pointers and 16-bit math functions calculated without the need to translate those to the underlying multi-instruction 8-bit 6502 code. The entire virtual machine was written in only 300 bytes. Code can call SWEET16 by issuing a [[subroutine]] call, and then return to normal 6502 code when the 16-bit operations are complete.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=43}}\n\n==Performance==\nBecause Integer BASIC processed more of the original [[source code]] into tokens, the runtime was faster than versions that required additional runtime parsing. For comparison, [[Tiny BASIC]] tokenized only the line number,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Build Your Own BASIC |first=Dennis |last=Allison |magazine=Dr. Dobb's Journal |volume=1 |number=1 |date=1976 |url=https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_01/page/n11 |page=11}}</ref> while MS BASICs tokenized only the keywords. So for instance, while Integer BASIC would convert the line {{code|100 GOTO 200}} entirely into tokens that could be immediately read and performed, in MS BASIC only the line number and GOTO would be tokenized, the \"100\" was left in its original format and had to be re-parsed every time.<ref name=altair>{{cite web |url=http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/4k/int_dis_11.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011105014524/http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/4k/int_dis_11.htm |archive-date=19 November 2001 |title=Altair BASIC 3.2 (4K) - Annotated Disassembly |first=Roger |last=Hardiman |page=1.11}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, working solely with integer math provides another major boost in speed. This is due both to the smaller 16-bit format requiring fewer memory accesses, as well as removing the need to move the floating-point decimal after calculations. As many [[computer benchmark]]s of the era were small and often performed simple math that did not require floating-point, Integer BASIC trounced most other BASICs.{{efn|[[Bill Gates]] complained about this, stating that it was unfair to compare Integer BASIC to a \"real\" BASIC like MS.<ref name=rugg2>{{cite magazine |first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman |title=BASIC timing comparisons\u2026 revised and updated |magazine=Kilobaud |date=October 1977 |pages=20\u201325 |url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-10}}</ref>}}\n\nOn one of the earliest known microcomputer benchmarks, the [[Rugg/Feldman benchmarks]], Integer BASIC was well over twice as fast as Applesoft BASIC on the same machine.<ref name=rugg>{{cite magazine |first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman |title=BASIC Timing Comparisons\u2026 information for speed freaks |magazine=Kilobaud |date=June 1977 |pages=66\u201370 |url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-06}}</ref> In the [[Byte Sieve]], where math was less important but array access and looping performance dominated, Integer BASIC took 166 seconds while Applesoft took 200.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=A High-Level Language Benchmark |first=Jim |last=Gilbreath |magazine=Byte |date=September 1981 |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-09/page/n181 |page=192}}</ref> It did not appear in the [[Creative Computing Benchmark]], which was first published in 1983, by which time Integer BASIC was no longer supplied by default.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Creative Computing |date=November 1983 |first=David |last=Ahl |title=Benchmark Comparison Test |url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1983-11/page/n271/mode/2up |page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe following test series, taken from both of the original Rugg/Feldman articles,<ref name=rugg/><ref name=rugg2/> indicates several interesting points. Test 1 was simply a {{code|FOR...NEXT}} loop from 1 to 1000. In this test, Applesoft turns in a time identical to Integer. Both BASICs cache the location of the {{code|FOR}} so it can quickly return to that line when it reaches the {{code|NEXT}}. No math or line-lookups are performed, so the two are similar in speed. Test 2 is another loop from 1 to 1000, but differs in that it uses a {{code|IF...THEN}} with an implicit GOTO to perform the loop instead of a FOR/NEXT. In this case, Integer is almost three times as fast as Applesoft, which illustrates the gains of having pre-parsed the target line number. Test 3 adds simple arithmetic calculations to Test 2, taking an additional 4.1 seconds in Integer and 7.5 in MS. Test 4 replaces variables with numeric constants, this does not change the time needed for Integer as the constants are already parsed to 16-bit values, whereas it takes MS another 1.8 seconds as it repeatedly re-parses the numbers from ASCII to the 40-bit internal format. The remaining tests add {{code|GOSUB}} and array access, the former benefiting as in the case of THEN/GOTO, the later by performing the index lookup in the array using a 16-bit variable value rather than having to convert it from 40-bit floating-point variable.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Originally available on [[Compact Cassette (data)|Compact Cassette]] for the Apple I in 1976, then included in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] on the Apple II from its release in 1977, it was the first version of BASIC used by many early [[home computer]] owners.{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001}}\n\nThe language supported mathematics using [[integers]], lacking [[floating point|floating-point]] support. Using integers allowed numbers to be stored in a much more compact 16-bit format that could be more rapidly read and processed than the 32- or 40-bit floating-point formats found in most BASICs of the era. However, this limited its applicability as a general-purpose language.{{efn|Or as [[Bill Gates]] put it, \"more powerful BASIC... using floating point\".<ref>{{cite magazine\n|first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman\n|title=BASIC timing comparisons\u2026 revised and updated\n|magazine=Kilobaud\n|date=October 1977\n|pages=20\u201325\n|url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-10\n}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother difference with other BASICs of the era is that Integer BASIC treated strings as arrays of characters, similar to the system in [[C programming language|C]] or [[Fortran 77]]. Substrings were accessed using [[array slicing]] rather than string functions. This style was introduced in [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]], and could also be found in other contemporary BASICs patterned on HP, like [[North Star BASIC]] and [[Atari BASIC]]. It contrasted with the style found in BASICs derived from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], including [[Microsoft BASIC]].\n\nThe language was initially developed under the name '''GAME BASIC''' and referred to simply as '''Apple BASIC''' when it was introduced on the Apple I. It became Integer BASIC when it was ported to the Apple II and shipped alongside [[Applesoft BASIC]], a port of [[Microsoft BASIC]] which included floating-point support. Integer BASIC was phased out in favor of Applesoft BASIC starting with the [[Apple II Plus]] in 1979.\n\n==History==\nAs a senior in [[high school]], [[Steve Wozniak]]'s electronics teacher arranged for the leading students in the class to have placements at local electronics companies. Wozniak was sent to [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] where he programmed in [[FORTRAN]] on an IBM machine. That same year, [[General Electric]] placed a terminal in the high school that was connected to one of their mainframes running their [[timesharing]] BASIC service, which they were heavily promoting at the time. After having three days of access, the students were asked to write letters on why the school should receive a terminal permanently, but their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nSome years later, Wozniak was working at [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) running simulations of chip designs and logic layout for calculators.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} HP made major inroads in the [[minicomputer]] market with their [[HP 2100]] series machines running a custom timesharing version of BASIC. For approximately $100,000, one could build up a reasonably equipped machine that could support between 16 and 32 users running BASIC programs.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://hpmemoryproject.org/news/tenyears_comp/measure_page_00.htm |title= Passing the 10-year mark |magazine= MEASURE Magazine |date= October 1976 |publisher= Hewlett Packard}}</ref> While expensive, it was still a fraction of the cost of the [[mainframe]] machines{{efn|An IBM 370/155 cost over $2 million in 1970 ({{Inflation|US|2000000|1970|fmt=eq}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arnnet.com.au/slideshow/541873/pictures-mostly-cool-history-ibm-mainframe/ |title=The (mostly) cool history of the IBM mainframe |first=Michael |last=Cooney |website=ARN}}</ref>}} and, for heavy users, less than the timesharing services.{{efn|Tymshare charged about $10 per hour ({{Inflation|US|10|1970|fmt=eq}}) for accessing their systems,<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Online Information Services, 1963\u20131976 |first1= Charles |last1=Bourne |first2=Trudi Bellardo |last2=Hahn |page=387 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=LTTvmUU8rskC&pg=PA387|isbn= 9780262261753 |date= August 2003 }}</ref> while smaller services could be found for about $5.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=InfoWorld |date=27 April 1981 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DT4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7 |title=Back to BASIC |first=Tim |last=Barry |page=7}}</ref>}} HP followed this with the [[HP 9830]], a desktop-sized machine for $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1970|fmt=eq}}) that also ran BASIC, which Wozniak had access to.{{sfn|Williams|Moore|1984|p=A71}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |quote=I sniffed the wind and knew that the key to making my computer good (popular) was to include a high-level language and that it had to be BASIC. |author=Steve Wozniak{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}}}\n\nIn January 1975 the [[Altair 8800]] was announced and sparked off the [[microcomputer]] revolution. In March, Wozniak attended the first meeting of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] and began formulating the design of his own computer. One of the most important pieces of software for the Altair, and one of the most heavily [[Copyright infringement|pirated]], was [[Altair BASIC]] from the recently formed [[Microsoft]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Understanding Online Piracy |first= Nathan |last=Fisk |page=14 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |date= 2009 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZZJxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14}}</ref> Wozniak concluded that his machine would have to have a BASIC of its own, which would, hopefully, be the first for the [[MOS Technology 6502]] processor. As the language needed 4&nbsp;kB RAM, he made that the minimum memory for the design.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak's references for BASIC were a copy of ''[[101 BASIC Computer Games]]'' and an HP BASIC manual.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} Unknown to him at the time, HP's BASIC was significantly different than the [[BASIC-PLUS|DEC BASIC]] variety used in ''101 Games'', which was also the pattern for MS's BASIC for the Altair. Based on these sources, be began sketching out a [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] chart for the language. The design initially included floating-point support, but still hoping he might publish the first BASIC on the 6502 and become \"a star\", he decided to abandon floating-point and write a separate integer math system to save a few weeks programming time.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak would later describe his language as \"intended primarily for games and educational uses\".{{sfn|Wozniak|1977}}  Referring to it throughout development as \"GAME BASIC\", Wozniak wrote the code by hand, translating the [[assembler code]] instructions into their [[machine code]] equivalents and then uploading the result to his computer.{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001|loc=The [Integer] BASIC, which we shipped with the first Apple II's, was never assembled &mdash; ever. There was one handwritten copy, all handwritten, all hand-assembled.}} Without any training on how to write a computer language, he used his HP calculator experience to implement a [[stack machine]] to interpret expressions.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} Once the basic routines were up and running, he worked on the other commands one-by-one in a modular fashion. With every visit to the Homebrew club, he would demonstrate a few more features that had been added in the last month.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |quote=It was the most satisfying day of my life... I demonstrated Breakout [at Homebrew]-totally written in BASIC... After designing hardware arcade games, I knew that being able to program them in BASIC was going to change the world. |author=Steve Wozniak{{sfn|Williams|Moore|1984|p=A71}}}}\n\nAs he built out his computer and BASIC, Wozniak was also working for [[Atari]] designing [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]. At some point, he decided to see whether one could write the game in BASIC. He added commands to read [[paddle controller]]s and over a series of quick edits had a version of the game up and running. To improve its playability, he added a speaker to make clicks when the ball hit things. While showing it to [[Steve Jobs]], Wozniak demonstrated that he could quickly change the colors that his game used, just by altering the [[source code]]. Wozniak later wrote that he had proved that \"software was much more flexible than hardware\", and that he and Jobs realized that \"now, anyone could create arcade games without having to design it in hardware.\"{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak did complete a floating-point library for the 6502 and published it in the April 1976 edition of [[Dr. Dobbs]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_01/page/n207/mode/2up |first1=Roy |last1=Raskin |first2=Steven |last2=Wozniak |title=Floating Point Routines for the 6502 |magazine=Dr. Dobbs |date=August 1976 |pages=17\u201319}}</ref> This library was later made part of the ROMs for the [[Apple II]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Apple II Reference Manual |date= January 1978 |publisher=Apple Computer |pages=94-95}}</ref> Wozniak began work on back-porting the floating-point code into Apple BASIC, but got sidetracked in the task of designing a [[floppy disk]] controller for what became the [[Disk II]]. [[Mike Markkula]] said the company would go to the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]] if the disk system was ready in time, so Wozniak and [[Randy Wigginton]] worked on it non-stop through the 1977 holidays.{{sfn|Wozniak|2018}}\n\nWhen he returned to the topic of floating-point in BASIC, Jobs complained it was taking too long. Without Wozniak being aware, the company arranged a license with Microsoft to receive their recently completed 6502 version of the Altair code. Examining the code, Wozniak decided that it was easier to add graphics support to MS's code than add floating-point his own BASIC, as the later required hand-patching of the original machine code while MS's was written in assembler and more easily modified. The development of Apple's BASIC ended in favor of what became Applesoft. Wozniak later noted, \"My biggest disappointment was going to the awful string functions like LEFT$(VAR, 5) and MID$(VAR2,5,3) instead of my own\".{{sfn|Wozniak|2018}}{{efn|The string handling was not \"his own\", but the same system used by HP BASIC.}}\n\nWhen the Apple II shipped in the summer of 1977, Integer BASIC was supplied in ROM, while Applesoft BASIC shipped on cassette. This changed with the introduction of the [[Apple II Plus]] in 1979, when Applesoft was put in the ROM.{{sfn|Hertzfeld|1985}}\n\n==Description==\n===Program editing===\nLike most BASIC implementations of the era, Integer BASIC was both the language interpreter as well as the line editing environment. When BASIC was running, a {{code|>}} [[command prompt]] was displayed where the user could enter statements.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=11}}{{efn|To make it clear which BASIC was running, Applesoft used the {{code|]}} prompt.}} Unlike later [[home computer]] platforms, BASIC was not the default environment when the computer started, it normally started in the [[machine code monitor|monitor]]. BASIC was started by pressing {{key press|Ctrl|B}}{{key press|Return}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=12}}\n\nStatements that were entered with leading numbers are entered into the program storage for \"deferred execution\",{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=46}} either as new lines or replacing any that might have had the same number previously.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=49-55}} Statements that were entered without a line number were referred to as commands, and ran immediately.{{efn|In what MS referred to more descriptively as \"[[Direct mode|immediate mode]]\".}} Line numbers could be from 0 to 32767,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=48}}{{efn|Helmers says the lowest line number is 1.{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=24}}}} and lines could contain up to 128 characters.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=118}}\n\nInteger BASIC also included the {{code|AUTO}} command to automatically enter line numbers at a given starting number like {{code|AUTO 100}}, adding 10 to the last number with every new line. {{code|AUTO 300,5}} would begin numbering at line 300 by fives; 300, 305, etc. Automatic numbering was turned off by entering {{code|MAN}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=65-67}}\n\nOne interesting feature of the editor was that a section of the screen could be set aside as the \"window\", where live updates took place. This was normally the entire screen, but it could be limited to a smaller area by {{code|POKE}}ing values into memory locations 32 through 35.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=124}} This feature could be used to create an editable text area while the rest of the screen was in graphics mode.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|loc=\"This mixed mode provides a 40 by 40 color graphics grid plus four lines of scrolling text at the bottom of the screen.\"}}\n\n===Debugging===\nAs in most BASICs, programs were started with the {{code|RUN}} command, and as was common, could be directed at a particular line number like {{code|RUN 300}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=100}} Execution could be stopped at any time using {{key press|Ctrl|C}}{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=15}} and then restarted with {{code|CON}}tinue, as opposed to the more typical {{code|CONT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=52}}\n\nFor step-by-step execution, the {{code|TRACE}} instruction could be used at the command prompt or placed within the program itself. When it was turned on, line numbers were printed out for each line the program visited. The feature could be turned off again with {{code|NOTRACE}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=107}}\n\nA somewhat unusual feature was the {{code|DSP}} (for \"display\") command. When encountered in a program, from that point on any ''changes'' to a variable's value would be displayed. For instance, {{code|DSP X}} would display the value of X every time it changed, along with the line number where the change occurred.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=100,101}} As with TRACE, DSP was turned off with {{code|NODSP}}.{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=24}}\n\n===Mathematics===\nInteger BASIC, as its name implies, uses integers as the basis for its math package. These were stored internally as a 16-bit number, little-endian (as is the 6502). This allowed a maximum value for any calculation between -32767 and 32767; although the format could also store the value -32768, BASIC could not display that number. Calculations that resulted in values outside that range produced a {{code|>32767 ERR}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=27}}\n\nInfix operators included {{code|+}} (addition), {{code|-}} (subraction), {{code|*}} (multiplication), {{code|/}} (division), [[Modulo operation|MOD]] (remainder) and exponent using the {{code|^}} character. Binary operators included {{code|AND}}, {{code|OR}} and {{code|NOT}}. Binary comparisons included the standard set of {{code|{{=}}}}, {{code|>}}, {{code|<}}, {{code|>{{=}}}}, {{code|<{{=}}}}, {{code|<>}} and the HP-inspired {{code|#}}, which was equivalent to <>.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=61}}\n\nOnly single-dimension arrays were allowed, limited in size only by the available memory.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=94}} Mathematical functions were sparse; only {{code|ABS}} (absolute value), {{code|SGN}} (sign) and {{code|RND}} (random number) were supported.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=40,120}} In contrast to MS-derived versions, where the parameter was ignored and {{code|RND}} always returned a value 0..<1, Integer BASIC used the parameter; {{code|RND(6)}} returned an integer from 0 to 5.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=40}}\n\n===Strings===\nInteger BASIC's string handling was based on the system in HP BASIC. This treated string variables as arrays of characters, which had to be {{code|DIM}}ed prior to use. This is similar to the model in [[C programming language|C]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.learn-c.org/en/Strings |title= Strings |website=learn-c.org}}</ref> or [[Fortran 77]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Brooks |website=University of Hawaii |title=Characters & Strings in Fortran}}</ref> This is in contrast to MS-like BASICs, where strings are an intrinsic variable-length type.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2020/commodore-basic-variables |title=C64 Programmer's Manual |website=commodore.ca |loc=\nInteger, Floating Point and String Variables}}</ref> Before MS-derived BASICs became the ''de facto'' standard, this style was not uncommon; [[North Star BASIC]]<ref>{{cite book |title=North Star BASIC version 6 |url=http://itelsoft.com.au/north_star_manuals/North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf |publisher=North Star Corporation |date=1977}}</ref> and [[Atari BASIC]]<ref>{{{cite book |title=The ATARI BASIC Reference Manual |publisher=Atari Inc |year=1980 |url=http://www.strotmann.de/twiki/bin/view/Infothek/AtBasicReferenceMa}}</ref> used the same concept, as did others.\n \nStrings in Integer used a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the number of characters used within them to a maximum of 255 characters.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=89}} This had the advantage of avoiding the need for the [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of the [[Heap (data structure)|heap]] that was notoriously slow in MS BASIC{{efn|And completely broken in some versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pagetable.com/?p=46 |title=Create your own Version of Microsoft BASIC}}</ref>}} but meant that strings that were shorter than the declared length was wasted.\n\nSubstring access was provided through [[array slicing]] syntax. For instance, {{code|PRINT A$(0,5)}} prints the first six characters of A$, characters 0 through 5.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=88}}{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=88}}{{efn|HP also allowed [ and ] in place of ( and ).}} Concatenation was provided using the same system, {{code|A$(5){{=}}\"ABC\"}} replaced any characters starting at position 5 with the string \"ABC\".{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=92}} This contrasts with the DEC/MS-style string handling, which uses string functions like {{code|MID$}} to access substrings, and {{code|+}} for concatenation.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://chiclassiccomp.org/docs/content/computing/MITS/MITS_Altair8800Basic4.1Reference_April1977.pdf |title=altair 8080 basic manual |date=April 1977 |publisher=MITS |page=30}}</ref>{{efn|It also contrasts with [[Dartmouth BASIC]], which used the {{code|CONVERT}} command to convert a string into an array of ASCII values, which the user then manipulated and converted back to string format with a second {{code|CONVERT}}.}}\n\nAs many of the features that would be provided by string functions were instead provided by array slicing, the selection of string functions was reduced. {{code|LEN$}} returned the length of a string,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=89}} and {{code|ASC}} returned the ASCII numeric code for the first letter in a string.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}} It lacked an equivalent of the {{code|CHR$}} that returned the ASCII character with a given numeric code.{{sfn|Mini|1977|p=17}}\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nWhen launched, the only [[game controller]] for the Apple was the [[paddle controller]], which had two controllers on a single connector. The position of the controller could be read using the {{code|PDL}} function, passing in the controller number, 0 or 1, like {{code|A{{=}}PDL(0):PRINT A}}, returning a value between 0 and 255.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=36}}{{efn|The manual suggests, but does not outright state, that the actual range of values is less than 0 to 255.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=36}}}}\n\nThe Apple machines did not include dedicated sound hardware, only a simple \"beeper\". Producing sounds was accomplished by {{code|PEEK}}ing the memory-mapped location of the speaker, -16336.{{efn|The negative number is a side-effect of the integers being stored in signed format, so any memory location over 32767 appeared as a negative value in BASIC.{{sfn|Mini|1977|p=18}}}} Repeatedly PEEKing that value produced tones, and the manual suggested using a mathematical expression to do this, like {{code|S{{=}}PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=84}}\n\nSupport for graphics was more detailed. Graphics mode was turned on with the {{code|GR}} statement and off with {{code|TEXT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=31}} Drawing was modal and normally started by issuing a command to change the color, which was accomplished by setting a pseudo-variable; {{code|COLOR{{=}}12}} would set the drawing color to 12, light green. One could then {{code|PLOT 10,10}} to produce a single spot of that color,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=32}} {{code|HLIN 0,39 AT 20}} to draw a horizontal line at row 20 that spanned the screen, or {{code|VLIN 5,15 AT 7}} to draw a shorter vertical line down column 7.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=33}} {{code|A{{=}}SCRN X,Y}} returned the color of the screen at X,Y.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}}{{efn|Note the odd syntax of the SCRN, which is technically a function because it returns a value, but does not use function-like syntax which would be {{code|A{{=}}SCRN(X,Y)}}.}}\n\n===Input/Output===\nInteger BASIC lacked any custom input/output commands, and also lacked the {{code|DATA}} statement and the associated {{code|READ}}. To get data into and out of a program, the input/output functionality was redirected to a selected [[Expansion card|card slot]] with the {{code|PR#x}} and {{code|IN#x}}, which redirected output or input (respectively) to the numbered slot. From then on, data could be sent to the card using conventional {{code|PRINT}} commands and read from it using {{code|INPUT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}}\n\n===Other notes===\nInteger BASIC included a {{code|TAB}} feature, which positioned the cursor on a given column from 0 to 39. It differed from the versions found in most BASICs in that it was a command with a following number, as opposed to a function with the value in parenthesis; one would move the cursor to column 10 using {{code|TAB 10}} in Integer BASIC{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=73}} whereas in MS this would be {{code|PRINT TAB(10)}}. Additionally, the {{code|VTAB}} command worked similar to {{code|TAB}} but added vertical spaces instead of horizontal. For unexplained reasons, in this case the coordinates were from 1 to 24 rather than 0 to 23.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=74}}\n\nInteger BASIC included a {{code|POP}} command to exit from loops.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}} This popped the topmost item off the FOR stack. Atari BASIC also supported the same command,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.atarimania.com/documents/Atari-Basic-Reference-Manual-Rev-C.pdf |title=Atari BASIC Reference Manual |publisher=Atari |date=1983 |page=25}}</ref> while [[North Star BASIC]] used {{code|EXIT}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=North Star BASIC version 6 |url=http://itelsoft.com.au/north_star_manuals/North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf |publisher=North Star Corporation |date=1977 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe Integer BASIC ROMs also included a [[machine code monitor]], \"mini-[[assembler (computing)|assembler]]\", and disassembler to create and debug [[assembly language]] programs. Wozniak hand-assembled the monitor as the Apple II's first program, then used it to write Integer BASIC.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=18}}{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Tokenizer===\nInteger BASIC read the lines typed in by the user from a buffer and ran them through a [[Parsing|parser]] which output a series of [[Lexical token|tokens]]. As part of this process, simple [[syntax error]]s are detected and listed. If the parsing is successful, the line number (if present) is converted from [[ASCII]] decimal format into a 16-bit integer, and any keywords into a 7-bit integer token.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\nNumeric literals, like the value 500, were converted into their 16-bit (two-byte) binary representation, in this case, $01F4 [[hexidecimal]]. To indicate this was a value and not a keyword, a single byte between $B0 and $B9 was inserted in front of the two-byte value.{{efn|The first digit of the original value is used to select a value from 0 to 9, so in this example, the token would be $B5 for the first digit of 500.}} String literals, like \"HELLO WORLD\" were instead converted by setting the high bit of each character, so that {{code|A}} was stored as $C1. Variable names were converted in the same fashion, with the letters converted to have their high-bit turned on, and any digits in the name represented by the corresponding $B0 through $B9, so that the variable {{code|A5}} would be tokenized as $C1B5.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\nIf the line was entered without a line number, the code was then executed directly from the buffer. If it had a line number, it was copied from the buffer into the program storage area.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}} The line in the buffer was first prefixed with a single byte containing the line length and postfixed with a $01 to indicate the end of the line (null was not used).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe runtime interpreter used two stacks for execution, one for statement keywords and the other for evaluating the parameters. Each statement was given two priorities, one that stated where it should occur in a multi-step operation, like a string of mathematical operations to provide [[order of operations]], and another that suggested when evaluation should occur, for instance, calculating internal values of a parenthesis formula. When variables are encountered, their name is parsed and then looked up in the variable storage area. The address of the variable's storage, perhaps freshly created, is then placed on the evaluation stack.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\n===SWEET16===\n{{main|SWEET16}}\nInteger BASIC is partially implemented in a custom [[assembler language]] known as [[SWEET16]]. SWEET16 is based on [[bytecode]]s that run within a simple 16-bit [[virtual machine]]. This model was used so memory could be addressed via indirect 16-bit pointers and 16-bit math functions calculated without the need to translate those to the underlying multi-instruction 8-bit 6502 code. The entire virtual machine was written in only 300 bytes. Code can call SWEET16 by issuing a [[subroutine]] call, and then return to normal 6502 code when the 16-bit operations are complete.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=43}}\n\n==Performance==\nBecause Integer BASIC processed more of the original [[source code]] into tokens, the runtime was faster than versions that required additional runtime parsing. For comparison, [[Tiny BASIC]] tokenized only the line number,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Build Your Own BASIC |first=Dennis |last=Allison |magazine=Dr. Dobb's Journal |volume=1 |number=1 |date=1976 |url=https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_01/page/n11 |page=11}}</ref> while MS BASICs tokenized only the keywords. So for instance, while Integer BASIC would convert the line {{code|100 GOTO 200}} entirely into tokens that could be immediately read and performed, in MS BASIC only the line number and GOTO would be tokenized, the \"100\" was left in its original format and had to be re-parsed every time.<ref name=altair>{{cite web |url=http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/4k/int_dis_11.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011105014524/http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/4k/int_dis_11.htm |archive-date=19 November 2001 |title=Altair BASIC 3.2 (4K) - Annotated Disassembly |first=Roger |last=Hardiman |page=1.11}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, working solely with integer math provides another major boost in speed. This is due both to the smaller 16-bit format requiring fewer memory accesses, as well as removing the need to move the floating-point decimal after calculations. As many [[computer benchmark]]s of the era were small and often performed simple math that did not require floating-point, Integer BASIC trounced most other BASICs.{{efn|[[Bill Gates]] complained about this, stating that it was unfair to compare Integer BASIC to a \"real\" BASIC like MS.<ref name=rugg2>{{cite magazine |first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman |title=BASIC timing comparisons\u2026 revised and updated |magazine=Kilobaud |date=October 1977 |pages=20\u201325 |url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-10}}</ref>}}\n\nOn one of the earliest known microcomputer benchmarks, the [[Rugg/Feldman benchmarks]], Integer BASIC was well over twice as fast as Applesoft BASIC on the same machine.<ref name=rugg>{{cite magazine |first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman |title=BASIC Timing Comparisons\u2026 information for speed freaks |magazine=Kilobaud |date=June 1977 |pages=66\u201370 |url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-06}}</ref> In the [[Byte Sieve]], where math was less important but array access and looping performance dominated, Integer BASIC took 166 seconds while Applesoft took 200.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=A High-Level Language Benchmark |first=Jim |last=Gilbreath |magazine=Byte |date=September 1981 |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-09/page/n181 |page=192}}</ref> It did not appear in the [[Creative Computing Benchmark]], which was first published in 1983, by which time Integer BASIC was no longer supplied by default.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Creative Computing |date=November 1983 |first=David |last=Ahl |title=Benchmark Comparison Test |url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1983-11/page/n271/mode/2up |page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe following test series, taken from both of the original Rugg/Feldman articles,<ref name=rugg/><ref name=rugg2/> indicates several interesting points. Test 1 was simply a {{code|FOR...NEXT}} loop from 1 to 1000. In this test, Applesoft turns in a time identical to Integer. Both BASICs cache the location of the {{code|FOR}} so it can quickly return to that line when it reaches the {{code|NEXT}}. No math or line-lookups are performed, so the two are similar in speed. Test 2 is another loop from 1 to 1000, but differs in that it uses a {{code|IF...THEN}} with an implicit GOTO to perform the loop instead of a FOR/NEXT. In this case, Integer is almost three times as fast as Applesoft, which illustrates the gains of having pre-parsed the target line number. Test 3 adds simple arithmetic calculations to Test 2, taking an additional 4.1 seconds in Integer and 7.5 in MS. Test 4 replaces variables with numeric constants, this does not change the time needed for Integer as the constants are already parsed to 16-bit values, whereas it takes MS another 1.8 seconds as it repeatedly re-parses the numbers from ASCII to the 40-bit internal format. The remaining tests add {{code|GOSUB}} and array access, the former benefiting as in the case of THEN/GOTO, the later by performing the index lookup in the array using a 16-bit variable value rather than having to convert it from 40-bit floating-point variable.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Club night]]s ran regularly on Thursdays from 1993 until 1996, being the focus of much of the Zippie movement. The club and its related activities also helped to popularise ideas such as [[cyberculture]] and the Internet between those years.\n\n==History and venues==\nThe club first started at [[The Marquee]] in London when it was at 105 [[Charing Cross Road]]. Promoted by evolution / dream, and at first as a collaboration with Tribal Energy on Thursday nights in June 1993. The club hosted a lecture by [[Terence McKenna]] on its opening night. with DJ's, Sequenci, Mark Sinclair, Tribal Energy (Jez Turner), Solar Quest and Mixmaster Morris and featured an \"ambient space\" in the foyer and a \"smart bar\" on the terrace which sold various herbal drinks. With techno music playing, about 250 people attended.\n\nThe club ran weekly. After eight weeks, a disagreement between the Tribal Energy and Evolution / dream crews led to a split. Tribal Energy then continued at the Marquee with a club on the same night, called 'Metropolis', which ran for seven weeks before closing. The Evolution / dream crew consolidated and grew at the so-called Stansted Tree Party in September 1993 \u2013 a protest event to prevent woods near [[Stansted Airport]] in Essex being cleared to make way for housing development.\n\nOn 21 October 1993, the [[Heaven nightclub]] under [[Charing Cross railway station]] became home to the club. 4,000 people attended for the free opening night. Heaven was London's original gay-only nightclub, but had run non-gay (known as Pyramid) nights for many years, including clubs such as Rage, Earth, Spectrum and Land of Oz. The club had the distinction of being full or almost full for every night of its 155-week run at Heaven.\n\nThe Megatripolis 'Festival in a box' on Thursday nights attracted a diverse audience from a wide age range, many of whom would not otherwise have considered going clubbing.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} By early 1994, it had also taken over the adjoining Sound Shaft nightclub and turned it into an ambient space with frequent all-night sets by [[Mixmaster Morris]] on the club's fourth separate sound stage. The club had many resident DJ's from across the broad spectrum of London's underground music scene. Megatripolis also promoted several large parties at Bagley's in [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] and escalated its political agenda by renting an armoured car for the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill]] protest rally in July 1994.\n\nA three-CD album representing the club's music was released in July 1996 on Funky Peace Productions 2000 featuring mixes by DJ regulars and packaged in [[hemp]] (tree-free) paper (re-released in 2013 as the 'mega-t' album). All production equipment owned by the club was distributed to members of the club's crew. The rented premises under St.Pancras station were handed over to what was to become \"Escape from Samsara\", a club formed by some of the original  Megatripolis crew which went on to run weekly Friday nights for 7 years at The Fridge in Brixton.\n\nA Megatripolis event was also staged at the Hacienda in Manchester, and several times at The Rocket in North London with Energique.\n\n==Culture and Events==\nMegatripolis proved popular, although some reporting of it suggested a conflict between an avowed downplay of psychedelic drugs and an enthusiasm for substance use by some club-goers.<ref>[[BBC Two]] \"yoof\" [[DEF II]] news programme [[Reportage]], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nPTWOCUqsY Reportage on Megatripolis]</ref> In any event, the club provided a meeting place of like-minded people and served as a platform for social awareness and activism as well as more traditional nightclub fare.\n\nTypical evenings combined lectures and workshops with live musical performances accompanied by live video mixing and theatre. Musical styles were diverse, and included [[progressive house]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[deep house]], [[minimal techno]] and [[Dub (music)|dub]]. The club played a seminal role in promoting [[trance music]]. Visits from speakers such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[George Monbiot]], [[Howard Marks]] and [[Ram Dass]] were common. Ginsberg's 1995 appearance was made into the film ''[[Allen Ginsberg Live in London]]''.\n\nGuest DJs included James Munroe, [[Colin Faver]], Colin Dale, [[Alex Paterson]], [[Andrew Weatherall]], [[Mr. C]], Tsuyoshi Suzuki, Youth, and many others, but also featured nights when Dragonfly T.I.P or Flying Rhino records took over the main dance floor which was the birth of Psychedelic Trance, the upgrade of Goa Trance. The club's resident DJ's were Darius Akashic, Sequenci, Richard Grey, and Marco Arnaldi. at least one of them was on the main dance floor every week. Marcus Pennell was resident VJ. Atmospheric music combined with sound effects was played along to films in the \"chill-out rooms\" set apart from the dance floors.\n\nNew-age stalls occupied the central hallway selling non-alcoholic energy (or \"smart\") drinks, body jewellery, alternative \"small press\" comics and magazines (such as the short-lived, but influential Head Magazine), as well as T-shirts and other clothing. The club also encouraged face and body painters, massage therapists, healers and magicians.\n\nAlso notable were early demonstrations of the [[World Wide Web]] at a time when most patrons were just beginning to be aware of what was then termed [[cyberculture]], something seen as an important, if not defining, part of the Zippie future. Underground bulletin boards such as London's pHreak hosted live \"cyber events\" from the club. In what was seen as very progressive at the time, a live video interview with [[Arthur C Clarke]] was conducted from his home in Sri Lanka<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXWgGfY7fGc Video clip Sir Arthur C Clarke from Sri Lanka \u2013 as above]</ref> on a portable satellite phone system. Similarly, Timothy Leary was transmitted into the club via ISDN giving a video interview from his home in the Los Angeles hills, [[ISDN]] having been installed at his house for the link. Leary had been banned from entering the UK in person by the British government in the 1960s, a ban that was still in force at the time. The Dalai Lama also gave a lecture at the club from the Barbican via ISDN on Thursday 18 July 1996.\n\nEnvironmental issues were an important part of the club's remit and another part of the Zippie agenda. Anti-road protests were advertised on its internal noticeboards, hemp fashion shows were staged, environmental lectures and debates took place in the talk room called \"The Well\", and bicycle-powered sound-systems played on several occasions in various rooms.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/women/story/0,,268300,00.html Disco divas turn the tables, Guardian, 24 August 1999]</ref> megatripolis was a key mover in climate change promotion from this time.\n\nA UK tour took place in the spring / summer of 1996 including venues such as the Hacienda, Manchester, Junction, Cambridge, and others. Two gigs were also held at the Mad club in Athens, Greece in 1996.\n\n==Megatripolis West==\nAn offshoot of the club was started by Fraser Clark and others, in San Francisco in late 1994. It ran for five consecutive weeks before closing.\n\nThe sixth and final night of the club was a \"launch rave\" hosted by [[Ronin Publishing]] for [[Timothy Leary]]'s book ''Chaos And Cyber Culture''. In true \"illegal UK rave\" tradition, patrons were given the event's location at a nearby burger joint. Leary jammed and performed jazz skat with famous Bay Area musician ''Maruga''. He was later kidnapped by the Zippie Soundsystem and forced to release a statement condemning the UK Prime Minister [[John Major]] and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which famously banned outdoor parties with music that included an \"emission of a succession of repetitive beats\".\n\nLeary exerted a powerful influence over the philosophy of the club and the [[Zippie]] movement overall. An indication of this can be found in the introduction to his posthumous book ''The Fugitive Philosopher'' (''Ronin Press'', September 2007) written by Fraser Clark. The original title of the piece, published in Clark's online magazine the ''UP!''[http://www.parallel-youniversity.com], was ''Timothy Leary Was A Saint Who Will Be Remembered & Celebrated Long After Jesus, Mohamed and Elvis Are Forgotten''\n\n==Megatripolis in popular culture==\nMegatripolis is referenced in the BBC TV comedy '[[Absolutely Fabulous]]', and on the Red Hot Chili Peppers album '[[Stadium Arcadium]]'.\nWell-known people who attended the club as visitors included [[Malcolm Mclaren]], [[Lynne Franks]], [[The Pet Shop Boys]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Heather Small]], and Sir [[Richard Branson]].\n\n==Megatripolis Reunion Benefit for Fraser Clark==\nIn 2008 Fraser Clark announced that he had inoperable liver cancer. In farewell to him, a final Megatripolis was held at Heaven on 13 November.

They were part of the Phayre Family, of which Lt Col [[Robert Phayre]], who served the British administration in Ireland in the 17th-century, also had the death warrant of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] addressed to him and two other Colonels. Robert Phayre was educated at [[Shrewsbury School]] and commissioned as Ensign in the [[East India Company]]'s service on 26 January 1839, being posted to the [[125th Napier's Rifles|25th Bombay Native Infantry]], and became lieutenant on 1 December 1840. He served in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] with his regiment, was engaged with the [[Baloch people|Baluchis]] under Nasir Khan at Kotra and Gandava in December 1840, and was [[mentioned in despatches]]. He took part in the Sindh War of 1843, and was severely wounded at the [[Battle of Miani]].

In 1856-7 he carried out the departmental arrangements connected with the [[Anglo-Persian War]]. In March 1857 he was appointed [[Quartermaster general#United Kingdom|Quartermaster-General]] to the [[Bombay Army]], and acted in this capacity throughout the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]], his services being warmly commended by [[Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn|Sir Hugh Rose]] (later [[Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn|Lord Strathnairn]]) on 15 May 1860.

He made strong representations of the gross tyranny and cruelty of the [[Gaekwad dynasty|Maharaja Gaikwar]], [[Malhar Rao Gaekwad|Malhar Rao]] which precipitated [[the Baroda Crisis]], and a commission which investigated his charges found that they were substantially proved. The Gaikwar received a warning and was advised to change his minister, but matters did not improve. The friction between Phayre and Malhar Rao increased, and at the instigation of the latter an attempt was made on 9 November 1874 to poison Phayre, by putting arsenic and diamond dust in his sherbet. The Baroda trial followed, and by order of the [[Secretary of State for India]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], Malhar Rao was deposed on 10 April 1875 and exiled to [[Madras]], where he died in obscurity in 1882.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Mulhar Rao Gaekwar Maharaja of Baroda, defendant | title=The trial and deposition of Mulhar Rao Gaekwar of Baroda | publication-date=1875 | publisher=Compiled and printed at the Bombay Gazette Steam Press | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/27756007 | accessdate=15 December 2018 }}</ref> He was succeeded by the moderniser [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]].

They were part of the Phayre Family, of which Lt Col [[Robert Phayre]], who served the British administration in Ireland in the 17th-century, also had the death warrant of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] addressed to him and two other Colonels. Robert Phayre was educated at [[Shrewsbury School]] and commissioned as Ensign in the [[East India Company]]'s service on 26 January 1839, being posted to the [[125th Napier's Rifles|25th Bombay Native Infantry]], and became lieutenant on 1 December 1840. He served in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] with his regiment, was engaged with the [[Baloch people|Baluchis]] under Nasir Khan at [[Kotra]] and Gandava in December 1840, and was [[mentioned in despatches]].

The Gaikwar received a warning and was advised to change his minister, but matters did not improve. The friction between Phayre and Malhar Rao increased, and at the instigation of the latter an attempt was made on 9 November 1874 to poison Phayre, by putting arsenic and diamond dust in his sherbet.

He was educated at St. Mary's College. As a newspaperman, he worked for the ''[[The Chronicle Herald|Halifax Chronicle]]'' before serving as editor of the ''Daily Star''.\n\nHe was first elected to the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] in a 1936 by-election as a [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Liberal]] in [[Halifax North]] after [[Gordon Benjamin Isnor]] was elected to the House of Commons. He was appointed to cabinet in 1941 as Minister of Industry and Publicity. He served as Minister of Industry and Trade from 1945 to 1950, when he became Minister of Public Health. When Premier [[Angus Lewis Macdonald|Angus L. Macdonald]] died in 1954, Connolly became the province's premier and the Liberal party's [[Interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]]. A [[Catholic]], he was defeated by [[Henry Hicks (Nova Scotia politician)|Henry Hicks]] at the party's [[leadership convention]] when [[Protestant]] delegates formed a united front against a Catholic leader, a move that caused a severe religious split within the party that contributed to its defeat two years later at the hands of [[Robert Stanfield]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservatives]].\n\nConnolly retired from provincial politics in 1955 when he was elevated to the [[Senate of Canada]] for the Halifax North, Nova Scotia division on 28 July 1955 following nomination by Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]]. He served until his resignation on 14 May 1979.\n\nConnolly was a lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps and the Canadian Officers' Training Corps from 1940 to 1945.\n\nHe married Catherine Burns in 1928; with whom he had 1 daughter, Catherine. He married Vivian Martel after the death of his first wife. He had five more children, Maureen, Dennis, David, Sharon and Patricia. Connolly's daughter [[Sharon Carstairs]] has gone on to have a prominent political career as leader of the Manitoba Liberal party and, subsequently, a Liberal Senator before retiring from politics in 2011.\n\n== References ==\n* ''Canadian Parliamentary Guide, 1948'', PG Normandin\n* {{Canadian Parliament links|ID=9084}}\n* [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/harold-connolly/ Entry from the Canadian Encyclopedia]\n\n{{NSPremiers}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Connolly, Harold}}\n[[Category:1901 births]]\n[[Category:1980 deaths]]\n[[Category:Canadian Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party of Canada senators]]\n[[Category:Nova Scotia Liberal Party MLAs]]\n[[Category:People from Sydney, Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Premiers of Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Canadian senators from Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Canadian newspaper editors]]\n[[Category:Canadian male journalists]]\n[[Category:Nova Scotia Ministers of Health]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the American athlete|Hal Connolly}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox CanadianMP\n| name             = Harold Connolly\n| birthname        = Harold&nbsp;Joseph&nbsp;Connolly\n| image            =\n| birth_date       = {{Birth date|df=yes|1901|9|8}}\n| birth_place      = [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]]\n| death_date       = {{death date and age|1980|5|17|1901|9|8|df=yes}}\n| death_place      =\n| spouse           = {{hlist|Catherine&nbsp;Burns&nbsp;(m.&nbsp;1928)|Vivian Martel}}\n| residence        =\n| office1          = [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly|MLA]] for [[Halifax North]]\n| predecessor1     = [[Gordon Benjamin Isnor]]\n| successor1       = [[John E.
