{"title_page": "Desert Fathers", "text_new": "{{short description|Early Christian hermits, ascetics, subscib to puerprogs and monks who lived mainly in the Scetes desert of Egypt beginning around the third century AD}}\n[[Image:StAnthony.jpg|thumb|[[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] icon of [[Anthony the Great]]]]\nThe '''Desert Fathers''' (along with [[Desert Mothers]]) were early Christian [[hermit]]s, [[ascetics]], and [[monk]]s who lived mainly in the [[Scetes]] desert of Egypt beginning around the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|third century AD]]. The ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' is a collection of the wisdom of some of the early desert monks and nuns, in print as ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''. The most well known was [[Anthony the Great]], who moved to the desert in AD&nbsp;270\u2013271 and became known as both the father and founder of desert monasticism. By the time Anthony died in AD&nbsp;356, thousands of monks and nuns had been drawn to living in the desert following Anthony's example\u2014his biographer, [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], wrote that \"the desert had become a city.\"{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}} The Desert Fathers had a major influence on the development of Christianity.\n\nThe desert monastic communities that grew out of the informal gathering of hermit monks became the model for [[Christian monasticism]]. The eastern monastic tradition at [[Mount Athos]] and the western [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] both were strongly influenced by the traditions that began in the desert. All of the monastic revivals of the Middle Ages looked to the desert for inspiration and guidance. Much of [[Eastern Christian]] spirituality, including the [[Hesychast]] movement, had its roots in the practices of the Desert Fathers. Even religious renewals such as the German evangelicals and [[Pietists]] in Pennsylvania, the ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' movement, and the [[Methodist Revival]] in England are seen by modern scholars as being influenced by the Desert Fathers.{{sfn|Burton-Christie|1993|pp=7\u20139}}\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:St Macarius the Great with Cherub.jpg|thumb|\"Saint [[Macarius of Egypt|Macarius]] and a Cherub\" from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], Sinai, Egypt]]\n[[Paul of Thebes]] is often credited with being the first hermit monk to go to the desert, but it was [[Anthony the Great]] who launched the movement that became the Desert Fathers.{{sfn|Waddell|1957|p=30}} Sometime around AD&nbsp;270, Anthony heard a Sunday sermon stating that perfection could be achieved by selling all of one's possessions, giving the proceeds to the poor, and following Christ (Matt. 19:21). He followed the advice and made the further step of moving deep into the desert to seek complete solitude.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}\n\nAnthony lived in a time of transition for Christianity\u2014the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] in AD&nbsp;303 was the last great formal persecution of Christians in the [[Roman Empire]]. Only ten years later, [[Christianity]] was made legal in Egypt by [[Diocletian]]'s successor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]]. Those who left for the desert formed an alternate Christian society, at a time when it was no longer a risk to be a Christian. The solitude, austerity, and sacrifice of the desert was seen by Anthony as an alternative to martyrdom, which was formerly seen by many Christians as the highest form of sacrifice.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=16}} Anthony quickly gained followers eager to live their lives in accordance with this solidarity and separation from material goods. From these prohibitions it is recorded by Athanasius that Anthony received special privileges from God, such as the ability to heal the sick, inspire others to have faith in healing through God, and even converse with God on occasion.{{sfn|Athanasius|1892}} Around this time, desert monasticism appeared nearly simultaneously in several areas, including Egypt and Syria.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}\n\nOver time, the model of Anthony and other hermits attracted many followers, who lived alone in the desert or in small groups. They chose a life of extreme [[asceticism]], renouncing all the pleasures of the senses, rich food, baths, rest, and anything that made them comfortable.{{sfn|Riddle|2008|p=43}} They instead focused their energies on praying, singing psalms, fasting, giving alms to the needy, and preserving love and harmony with one another while keeping their thoughts and desires for God alone.{{sfn|Athanasius|1892}} Thousands joined them in the desert, mostly men but also a handful of women. Religious seekers also began going to the desert seeking advice and counsel from the early Desert Fathers. By the time of Anthony's death, there were so many men and women living in the desert that it was described as \"a city\" by Anthony's biographer.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}\n\nThe Desert Fathers advocated three main approaches to monasticism. One was the austere life of the hermit, as practiced by Anthony and his followers in lower Egypt. Another was the [[Cenobite|cenobitic]] life, communities of monks and nuns in upper Egypt formed by [[Pachomius]]. The third was a semi-hermitic lifestyle seen mostly in [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]], [[Kellia]] and [[Scetis]], west of the Nile, begun by [[Saint Amun]]. The latter were small groups (two to six) of monks and nuns with a common spiritual elder\u2014these separate groups would join together in larger gatherings to worship on Saturdays and Sundays. This third form of monasticism was responsible for most of the sayings that were compiled as the ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'').{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}\n\n==Development of monastic communities==\n[[File:StPakhom.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Pachomius]]]]\nThe small communities founded by the Desert Fathers were the beginning of [[Christian monasticism]]. Initially Anthony and others lived as hermits, sometimes forming groups of two or three. Small informal communities began developing, until the monk [[Pachomius]], seeing the need for a more formal structure, established a monastery with rules and organization. His regulations included discipline, obedience, manual labour, silence, fasting, and long periods of prayer\u2014some historians view the rules as being inspired by Pachomius' experiences as a Roman soldier.{{sfn|Riddle|2008|p=43}}\n\nThe first fully organized monastery under Pachomius included men and women living in separate quarters, up to three in a room. They supported themselves by weaving cloth and baskets, along with other tasks. Each new monk or nun had a three-year probationary period, concluding with admittance in full standing to the monastery. All property was held communally, meals were eaten together and in silence, twice a week they fasted, and they wore simple peasant clothing with a hood. Several times a day they came together for prayer and readings, and each person was expected to spend time alone meditating on the scriptures. Programs were created for educating those who came to the monastery unable to read.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210\u2013212}}\n\nPachomius also formalized the establishment of an ''abba'' (father) or ''amma'' (mother) in charge of the spiritual welfare of their monks and nuns, with the implication that those joining the monastery were also joining a new family. Members also formed smaller groups, with different tasks in the community and the responsibility of looking after each other's welfare. The new approach grew to the point that there were tens of thousands of monks and nuns in these organized communities within decades of Pachomius' death.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210\u2013212}} One of the early pilgrims to the desert was [[Basil of Caesarea]], who took the Rule of Pachomius into the eastern church. Basil expanded the idea of community by integrating the monks and nuns into the wider public community, with the monks and nuns under the authority of a bishop and serving the poor and needy.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210\u2013212}}\n\nAs more pilgrims began visiting the monks in the desert, influence from the monastic communities began spreading. Latin versions of the original Greek stories and sayings of the Desert Fathers, along with the earliest monastic rules coming out of the desert, guided the early monastic development in the Byzantine world and eventually in the western Christian world.{{sfn|Wilfong|1998|p=193}} [[John Cassian]] played an important role in mediating the influence of the Desert Fathers to the West.{{sfn|Gregory|Kazhdan|1991|pp=387\u2013388}} This can be seen, for example, in the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], where [[Benedict of Nursia]] urged his monks to read the writings of [[John Cassian]] on the Desert Fathers. The ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' was also widely read in the early Benedictine monasteries.{{sfn|Burton-Christie|1993|p=6}}\n\n==Notable Desert Fathers and Mothers==\n[[File:Arsenius the Great.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Arsenius the Great]], notable Desert Father]]\nMany of the monks and nuns developed a reputation for holiness and wisdom, with the small communities following a particularly holy or wise elder, who was their spiritual father (''[[Abbot|abba]]'') or mother (''amma''). The individual Desert Fathers and [[Desert Mothers]] are mostly known through ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers'', which included 1,202 sayings attributed to twenty-seven ''abbas'' and three ''ammas''.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=4}} The greatest number of sayings are attributed to Abba \"Poemen\", Greek for \"shepherd\". Because of the wide disparity of dates for the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen, some scholars believe that \"Poemen\" was a generic name for a combination of different unnamed Abbas.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=6}} Others conclude that the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen are accurate, based on a notable and historical Abba Poemen.{{sfn|Harmless|2000}} Among the notable Desert Fathers and Mothers with sayings in the book, in addition to [[Anthony the Great]], were [[Arsenius the Great]], [[Poemen]], [[Macarius of Egypt]], [[Moses the Black]], and [[Syncletica of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|pp=19\u201329}}\n\nOther notable Desert Fathers include [[Pachomius]] and [[Shenouda the Archimandrite]], and many individuals who spent part of their lives in the Egyptian desert, including [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Evagrius Ponticus]], [[Hilarion]] and [[John Cassian]]. Cassian's works brought the wisdom of the Desert Fathers into a wider arena.\n\n==Practices==\n{{Christian mysticism}}\n\n===Withdrawal from society===\nThe legalization of Christianity by the Roman Empire in 313 gave Anthony a greater resolve to go out into the desert. Nostalgic for the tradition of martyrdom, he saw withdrawal and asceticism as an alternative. He insisted on selling all his material possessions\u2014he left his younger sister a small amount of money to live her life in a convent, and donated the rest to the poor.{{sfn|Athanasius|1892}} When members of the church began finding ways to work with the Roman state, the Desert Fathers saw that as a compromise between \"the things of God and the things of Caesar.\" The monastic communities were essentially an alternate Christian society.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=16}} The hermits doubted that religion and politics could ever produce a truly Christian society. For them, the only Christian society was spiritual and not mundane.{{sfn|Merton|1960|p=4}}\n\n===Hesychasm===\n''[[Hesychasm]]'' (from the Greek for \"stillness, rest, quiet, silence\"){{sfn|Parry|Melling|Brady|Griffith|1999|p=91}} is a mystical tradition and movement that originated with the Desert Fathers and was central to their practice of prayer.{{sfnm |1a1=Binns |1y=2006 |1p=588 |2a1=Meyendorff |2y=1974 |2p=1 |3a1=Ward |3y=1984 |3p=250}} ''Hesychasm'' for the Desert Fathers was primarily the practice of \"interior silence and continual prayer.\" It did not become a formal movement of specific practices until the fourteenth century Byzantine meditative prayer techniques, when it was more closely identified with the [[Prayer of the Heart]], or \"Jesus Prayer\".{{sfnm |1a1=Nes |1y=2007 |1p=97<!-- \"The spirituality of Hesychasm can be traced back to the Desert Fathers, but the method itself was presented in a more systematic form at the turn of the thirteenth century.\" --> |2a1=Rock |2y=2006 |2p=262<!-- \"...'hesychasm' primarily describes the monastic practice of interior silence and continual prayer first established by the Desert Fathers and was not used to indicate a distinct spiritual movement until the fourteenth century Byzantine revival of meditative prayer techniques.\"-->}} That prayer's origin is also traced back to the Desert Fathers\u2014the Prayer of the Heart was found inscribed in the ruins of a cell from that period in the Egyptian desert.{{sfn|Guillaumont|1979}} The earliest written reference to the practice of the Prayer of the Heart may be in a discourse collected in the ''[[Philokalia]]'' on Abba Philimon, a Desert Father.{{sfn|McGinn|2006|p=125}} ''Hesychast'' prayer was a meditative practice that was traditionally done in silence and with eyes closed\u2014\"empty of mental pictures\" and visual concepts, but with the intense consciousness of God's presence.{{sfn|Ware|2000|p=101}}\n\nThe words ''hesychast'' and ''hesychia'' were frequently used in 4th and 5th century writings of Desert Fathers such as [[Macarius of Egypt]], [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and [[Gregory of Nyssa]].{{sfn|Peterson|2008|p=304}} The title ''hesychast'' was used in early times synonymously with ''hermit'', as compared to a [[cenobite]] who lived in community.{{sfn|Nes|2007|p=97}} ''Hesychasm'' can refer to inner or outer stillness, though in ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' it referred to inner tranquility.{{sfn|Egan|1996|p=71}}\n\n===Charity and forgiveness===\nThe Desert Fathers gave a great deal of emphasis to living and practicing the teachings of Christ, much more than theoretical knowledge. Their efforts to live the commandments were not seen as being easy\u2014many of the stories from that time recount the struggle to overcome negative emotions such as anger and judgment of others. Helping a brother monk who was ill or struggling was seen as taking priority over any other consideration. Hermits were frequently seen to break a long fast when hosting visitors, as hospitality and kindness were more important than keeping the ascetic practices that were so dominant in the Desert Fathers' lives.{{sfn|Burton-Christie|1993|pp=161\u2013163}}\n\n===Recitation of scripture===\nThe lives of the Desert Fathers that were organized into communities included frequent recitation of the scriptures\u2014during the week they chanted psalms while performing manual labour and during the weekends they held liturgies and group services. The monk's experience in the cell occurred in a variety of ways, including meditation on scripture.{{sfnm |1a1=Harmless |1y=2004 |1p=244 |2a1=Keller |2y=2005 |2p=55}} Group practices were more prominent in the organized communities formed by Pachomius.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210\u2013212}} The purpose of these practices were explained by [[John Cassian]], a Desert Father, who described the goal of psalmody (the outward recitation of scripture) and asceticism as the ascent to  deep mystical prayer and mystical contemplation.{{sfn|Egan|1996|p=71}}\n\n==Excerpts from ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers''==\n*\"A hermit said, 'Take care to be silent. Empty your mind. Attend to your meditation in the fear of God, whether you are resting or at work. If you do this, you will not fear the attacks of the demons.\"\n*Abba Moses, \"Sit in thy cell and thy cell will teach thee all.\"\n*\"Somebody asked Anthony, 'What shall I do in order to please God?' He replied, 'Do what I tell you, which is this: wherever you go, keep God in mind; whatever you do, follow the example of Holy Scripture; wherever you are, stay there and do not move away in a hurry. If you keep to these guide-lines, you will be saved.'\"\n*\"He (Evagrius) also said, 'A monk was told that his father had died. He said to the messenger, 'Do not blaspheme. My Father cannot die.'\"\n*Abbot Pastor, \"If someone does evil to you, you should do good to him, so that by your good work you may drive out his malice.\"\n*An Elder, \"A man who keeps death before his eyes will at all times overcome his cowardliness.\"\n*Blessed Macarius said, \"This is the truth, if a monk regards contempt as praise, poverty as riches, and hunger as a feast, he will never die.\"\n*\"It happened that as Abba Arsenius was sitting in his cell that he was harassed by demons. His servants, on their return, stood outside his cell and heard him praying to God in these words, 'O God, do not leave me. I have done nothing good in your sight, but according to your goodness, let me now make a beginning of good.'\"\n* When one desert father told another of his plans to \u201c shut himself into his cell and refuse the face of men, that he might perfect himself,\u201d the second monk replied, \u201c Unless thou first amend thy life going to and fro amongst men, thou shall not avail to amend it dwelling alone.\u201d\n*\"[[Anthony the Great|Abba Anthony]] said, 'Whoever hammers a lump of iron, first decides what he is going to make of it, a scythe, a sword, or an axe. Even so we ought to make up our minds what kind of virtue we want to forge or we labour in vain.'\n*He also said, 'Obedience with abstinence gives men power over wild beasts.'\"{{sfn|Ward|1984|p=8}}\n*It  was  said  of  [[John the Dwarf|Abba John the Dwarf]],  that  one  day  he  said  to his  elder  brother,  'I  should  like  to  be  free  of  all  care,  like  the  angels, who  do  not  work,  but  ceaselessly  offer  worship  to  God.'  So  he  took off  his  cloak  and  went  away  into  the  desert.  After  a  week  he  came back  to  his  brother.  When  he  knocked  on  the  door,  he  heard  his brother  say,  before  he  opened  it  'Who  are  you?'  He  said,  'I  am  John, your  brother.'  But  he  replied,  'John  has  become  an  angel,  and  henceforth  he  is  no  longer  among  men.'  Then  the  other  begged  him saying,  'It  is  I.'  However,  his  brother  did  not  let  him  in,  but  left  him there  in  distress  until  morning.  Then,  opening  the  door,  he  said  to him,  'You  are  a  man  and  you  must  once  again  work  in  order  to  eat.' Then  John  made  a  prostration  before  him,  saying,  'Forgive  me.'\"{{sfn|Ward|1984|p=86}}\n\n==Essential texts==\nThere are many different collections of sayings of the Desert Fathers. The earliest writings were simply ordered by the initial letter of the Abba's name in the order of the Greek alphabet. So the editors started with Anthony the Great, Arsenius and Agathon and concluded with Cheremon, Psenthaisius and Or. It was those first editors who used the word ''apophthegms'' (meaning: saying, maxim or aphorism)\u2014this is why this collection is now known as''[Apophthegmata Patrum Alphabetica'' (The Sayings of the Desert Fathers: The Alphabetic Collection). This collection contains about a thousand items.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe same editors knew there were also a lot of anonymous sayings and tales of the Desert Fathers and Mothers circulating. This material was gathered into a collection now known as ''[Anonymous Patrum Apophthegmata'' (Anonymous Sayings of the Desert Fathers). These sayings were placed in order of more or less similar subjects (for instance: humility, charity etc.). This collection contains about eight hundred items.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe collection now known as the Systematic Collection began to emerge a century later (AD&nbsp;500). It has sayings from the Alphabetic Collection and the Anonymous Sayings, combined and systematically ordered under twenty-one chapters. This collection contains about 1200 items and therefore does not completely combine the two older collections.{{sfn|Wortley|2012|pp=xvi\u2013xviii}}\n\n* ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' (''Apophthegmata Patrum'')\n* ''The Lives of the Desert Fathers'' (''Historia Monachorum in Aegypte'')\n* ''[[Ethiopic Collectio Monastica]],'' includes many sayings of the Desert Fathers not included in the ''Apophthegmata Patrum''\n* ''The [[Lausiac History]]'' by [[Palladius of Galatia]]\n* ''The Life of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Antony]]'' by [[Athanasius|St. Athanasius]]\n* ''The Anonymous Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' (''Anonymous Apophthegmata'')\n* ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers: The Systematic Collection''\n* [[Philokalia]] collection of texts\n* ''The Conferences'' and ''The Institutes'' by [[John Cassian]]\n* ''The [[Evergetinos]]''\n* ''Paradise of the Desert Fathers,'' also known as ''Bustan al-Rohbaan''\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|History}}\n* [[Cappadocian Fathers]]\n* [[Christian monasticism before 451]]\n* [[Christian contemplation#Theoria|Christian contemplation \u00a7&nbsp;''Theoria'']]\n* [[Church Fathers]]\n* [[Coptic monasticism]]\n* [[Early Christianity]]\n* [[Eastern Christian monasticism]]\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book\n|author=Athanasius of Alexandria\n|author-link=Athanasius of Alexandria\n|year=1892\n|chapter=[[wikisource:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume IV/Life of Antony/Vita Antoni|Life of St. Anthony]]\n|editor1-last=Schaff\n|editor1-first=Philip\n|editor1-link=Philip Schaff\n|editor2-last=Wace\n|editor2-first=Henry\n|editor2-link=Henry Wace (priest)\n|title=A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, Second Series\n|volume=4\n|location=Buffalo, New York\n|publisher=Christian Literature Publishing Company\n|ref={{sfnref|Athanasius|1892}}\n|title-link=Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Binns\n|first=John\n|year=2006\n|chapter=Modern Spirituality and the Orthodox Church\n|editor-last=Angold\n|editor-first=Michael\n|editor-link=Michael Angold\n|title=The Cambridge History of Christianity.

The ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' is a collection of the wisdom of some of the early desert monks and nuns, in print as ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''. The most well known was [[Anthony the Great]], who moved to the desert in AD&nbsp;270\u2013271 and became known as both the father and founder of desert monasticism. By the time Anthony died in AD&nbsp;356, thousands of monks and nuns had been drawn to living in the desert following Anthony's example\u2014his biographer, [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], wrote that \"the desert had become a city.\"{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}} The Desert Fathers had a major influence on the development of Christianity.\n\nThe desert monastic communities that grew out of the informal gathering of hermit monks became the model for [[Christian monasticism]]. The eastern monastic tradition at [[Mount Athos]] and the western [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] both were strongly influenced by the traditions that began in the desert. All of the monastic revivals of the Middle Ages looked to the desert for inspiration and guidance. Much of [[Eastern Christian]] spirituality, including the [[Hesychast]] movement, had its roots in the practices of the Desert Fathers. Even religious renewals such as the German evangelicals and [[Pietists]] in Pennsylvania, the ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' movement, and the [[Methodist Revival]] in England are seen by modern scholars as being influenced by the Desert Fathers.{{sfn|Burton-Christie|1993|pp=7\u20139}}\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:St Macarius the Great with Cherub.jpg|thumb|\"Saint [[Macarius of Egypt|Macarius]] and a Cherub\" from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], Sinai, Egypt]]\n[[Paul of Thebes]] is often credited with being the first hermit monk to go to the desert, but it was [[Anthony the Great]] who launched the movement that became the Desert Fathers.{{sfn|Waddell|1957|p=30}} Sometime around AD&nbsp;270, Anthony heard a Sunday sermon stating that perfection could be achieved by selling all of one's possessions, giving the proceeds to the poor, and following Christ (Matt. 19:21). He followed the advice and made the further step of moving deep into the desert to seek complete solitude.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}\n\nAnthony lived in a time of transition for Christianity\u2014the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] in AD&nbsp;303 was the last great formal persecution of Christians in the [[Roman Empire]]. Only ten years later, [[Christianity]] was made legal in Egypt by [[Diocletian]]'s successor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]]. Those who left for the desert formed an alternate Christian society, at a time when it was no longer a risk to be a Christian. The solitude, austerity, and sacrifice of the desert was seen by Anthony as an alternative to martyrdom, which was formerly seen by many Christians as the highest form of sacrifice.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=16}} Anthony quickly gained followers eager to live their lives in accordance with this solidarity and separation from material goods. From these prohibitions it is recorded by Athanasius that Anthony received special privileges from God, such as the ability to heal the sick, inspire others to have faith in healing through God, and even converse with God on occasion.{{sfn|Athanasius|1892}} Around this time, desert monasticism appeared nearly simultaneously in several areas, including Egypt and Syria.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}\n\nOver time, the model of Anthony and other hermits attracted many followers, who lived alone in the desert or in small groups. They chose a life of extreme [[asceticism]], renouncing all the pleasures of the senses, rich food, baths, rest, and anything that made them comfortable.{{sfn|Riddle|2008|p=43}} They instead focused their energies on praying, singing psalms, fasting, giving alms to the needy, and preserving love and harmony with one another while keeping their thoughts and desires for God alone.{{sfn|Athanasius|1892}} Thousands joined them in the desert, mostly men but also a handful of women. Religious seekers also began going to the desert seeking advice and counsel from the early Desert Fathers. By the time of Anthony's death, there were so many men and women living in the desert that it was described as \"a city\" by Anthony's biographer.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}\n\nThe Desert Fathers advocated three main approaches to monasticism. One was the austere life of the hermit, as practiced by Anthony and his followers in lower Egypt. Another was the [[Cenobite|cenobitic]] life, communities of monks and nuns in upper Egypt formed by [[Pachomius]]. The third was a semi-hermitic lifestyle seen mostly in [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]], [[Kellia]] and [[Scetis]], west of the Nile, begun by [[Saint Amun]]. The latter were small groups (two to six) of monks and nuns with a common spiritual elder\u2014these separate groups would join together in larger gatherings to worship on Saturdays and Sundays. This third form of monasticism was responsible for most of the sayings that were compiled as the ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'').{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=15}}\n\n==Development of monastic communities==\n[[File:StPakhom.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Pachomius]]]]\nThe small communities founded by the Desert Fathers were the beginning of [[Christian monasticism]]. Initially Anthony and others lived as hermits, sometimes forming groups of two or three. Small informal communities began developing, until the monk [[Pachomius]], seeing the need for a more formal structure, established a monastery with rules and organization. His regulations included discipline, obedience, manual labour, silence, fasting, and long periods of prayer\u2014some historians view the rules as being inspired by Pachomius' experiences as a Roman soldier.{{sfn|Riddle|2008|p=43}}\n\nThe first fully organized monastery under Pachomius included men and women living in separate quarters, up to three in a room. They supported themselves by weaving cloth and baskets, along with other tasks. Each new monk or nun had a three-year probationary period, concluding with admittance in full standing to the monastery. All property was held communally, meals were eaten together and in silence, twice a week they fasted, and they wore simple peasant clothing with a hood. Several times a day they came together for prayer and readings, and each person was expected to spend time alone meditating on the scriptures. Programs were created for educating those who came to the monastery unable to read.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210\u2013212}}\n\nPachomius also formalized the establishment of an ''abba'' (father) or ''amma'' (mother) in charge of the spiritual welfare of their monks and nuns, with the implication that those joining the monastery were also joining a new family. Members also formed smaller groups, with different tasks in the community and the responsibility of looking after each other's welfare. The new approach grew to the point that there were tens of thousands of monks and nuns in these organized communities within decades of Pachomius' death.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210\u2013212}} One of the early pilgrims to the desert was [[Basil of Caesarea]], who took the Rule of Pachomius into the eastern church. Basil expanded the idea of community by integrating the monks and nuns into the wider public community, with the monks and nuns under the authority of a bishop and serving the poor and needy.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210\u2013212}}\n\nAs more pilgrims began visiting the monks in the desert, influence from the monastic communities began spreading. Latin versions of the original Greek stories and sayings of the Desert Fathers, along with the earliest monastic rules coming out of the desert, guided the early monastic development in the Byzantine world and eventually in the western Christian world.{{sfn|Wilfong|1998|p=193}} [[John Cassian]] played an important role in mediating the influence of the Desert Fathers to the West.{{sfn|Gregory|Kazhdan|1991|pp=387\u2013388}} This can be seen, for example, in the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], where [[Benedict of Nursia]] urged his monks to read the writings of [[John Cassian]] on the Desert Fathers. The ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' was also widely read in the early Benedictine monasteries.{{sfn|Burton-Christie|1993|p=6}}\n\n==Notable Desert Fathers and Mothers==\n[[File:Arsenius the Great.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Arsenius the Great]], notable Desert Father]]\nMany of the monks and nuns developed a reputation for holiness and wisdom, with the small communities following a particularly holy or wise elder, who was their spiritual father (''[[Abbot|abba]]'') or mother (''amma''). The individual Desert Fathers and [[Desert Mothers]] are mostly known through ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers'', which included 1,202 sayings attributed to twenty-seven ''abbas'' and three ''ammas''.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=4}} The greatest number of sayings are attributed to Abba \"Poemen\", Greek for \"shepherd\". Because of the wide disparity of dates for the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen, some scholars believe that \"Poemen\" was a generic name for a combination of different unnamed Abbas.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=6}} Others conclude that the sayings attributed to Abba Poemen are accurate, based on a notable and historical Abba Poemen.{{sfn|Harmless|2000}} Among the notable Desert Fathers and Mothers with sayings in the book, in addition to [[Anthony the Great]], were [[Arsenius the Great]], [[Poemen]], [[Macarius of Egypt]], [[Moses the Black]], and [[Syncletica of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|pp=19\u201329}}\n\nOther notable Desert Fathers include [[Pachomius]] and [[Shenouda the Archimandrite]], and many individuals who spent part of their lives in the Egyptian desert, including [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Evagrius Ponticus]], [[Hilarion]] and [[John Cassian]]. Cassian's works brought the wisdom of the Desert Fathers into a wider arena.\n\n==Practices==\n{{Christian mysticism}}\n\n===Withdrawal from society===\nThe legalization of Christianity by the Roman Empire in 313 gave Anthony a greater resolve to go out into the desert. Nostalgic for the tradition of martyrdom, he saw withdrawal and asceticism as an alternative. He insisted on selling all his material possessions\u2014he left his younger sister a small amount of money to live her life in a convent, and donated the rest to the poor.{{sfn|Athanasius|1892}} When members of the church began finding ways to work with the Roman state, the Desert Fathers saw that as a compromise between \"the things of God and the things of Caesar.\" The monastic communities were essentially an alternate Christian society.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=16}} The hermits doubted that religion and politics could ever produce a truly Christian society. For them, the only Christian society was spiritual and not mundane.{{sfn|Merton|1960|p=4}}\n\n===Hesychasm===\n''[[Hesychasm]]'' (from the Greek for \"stillness, rest, quiet, silence\"){{sfn|Parry|Melling|Brady|Griffith|1999|p=91}} is a mystical tradition and movement that originated with the Desert Fathers and was central to their practice of prayer.{{sfnm |1a1=Binns |1y=2006 |1p=588 |2a1=Meyendorff |2y=1974 |2p=1 |3a1=Ward |3y=1984 |3p=250}} ''Hesychasm'' for the Desert Fathers was primarily the practice of \"interior silence and continual prayer.\" It did not become a formal movement of specific practices until the fourteenth century Byzantine meditative prayer techniques, when it was more closely identified with the [[Prayer of the Heart]], or \"Jesus Prayer\".{{sfnm |1a1=Nes |1y=2007 |1p=97<!-- \"The spirituality of Hesychasm can be traced back to the Desert Fathers, but the method itself was presented in a more systematic form at the turn of the thirteenth century.\" --> |2a1=Rock |2y=2006 |2p=262<!-- \"...'hesychasm' primarily describes the monastic practice of interior silence and continual prayer first established by the Desert Fathers and was not used to indicate a distinct spiritual movement until the fourteenth century Byzantine revival of meditative prayer techniques.\"-->}} That prayer's origin is also traced back to the Desert Fathers\u2014the Prayer of the Heart was found inscribed in the ruins of a cell from that period in the Egyptian desert.{{sfn|Guillaumont|1979}} The earliest written reference to the practice of the Prayer of the Heart may be in a discourse collected in the ''[[Philokalia]]'' on Abba Philimon, a Desert Father.{{sfn|McGinn|2006|p=125}} ''Hesychast'' prayer was a meditative practice that was traditionally done in silence and with eyes closed\u2014\"empty of mental pictures\" and visual concepts, but with the intense consciousness of God's presence.{{sfn|Ware|2000|p=101}}\n\nThe words ''hesychast'' and ''hesychia'' were frequently used in 4th and 5th century writings of Desert Fathers such as [[Macarius of Egypt]], [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and [[Gregory of Nyssa]].{{sfn|Peterson|2008|p=304}} The title ''hesychast'' was used in early times synonymously with ''hermit'', as compared to a [[cenobite]] who lived in community.{{sfn|Nes|2007|p=97}} ''Hesychasm'' can refer to inner or outer stillness, though in ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers'' it referred to inner tranquility.{{sfn|Egan|1996|p=71}}\n\n===Charity and forgiveness===\nThe Desert Fathers gave a great deal of emphasis to living and practicing the teachings of Christ, much more than theoretical knowledge. Their efforts to live the commandments were not seen as being easy\u2014many of the stories from that time recount the struggle to overcome negative emotions such as anger and judgment of others. Helping a brother monk who was ill or struggling was seen as taking priority over any other consideration. Hermits were frequently seen to break a long fast when hosting visitors, as hospitality and kindness were more important than keeping the ascetic practices that were so dominant in the Desert Fathers' lives.{{sfn|Burton-Christie|1993|pp=161\u2013163}}\n\n===Recitation of scripture===\nThe lives of the Desert Fathers that were organized into communities included frequent recitation of the scriptures\u2014during the week they chanted psalms while performing manual labour and during the weekends they held liturgies and group services. The monk's experience in the cell occurred in a variety of ways, including meditation on scripture.{{sfnm |1a1=Harmless |1y=2004 |1p=244 |2a1=Keller |2y=2005 |2p=55}} Group practices were more prominent in the organized communities formed by Pachomius.{{sfn|Irvin|Sundquist|2001|pp=210\u2013212}} The purpose of these practices were explained by [[John Cassian]], a Desert Father, who described the goal of psalmody (the outward recitation of scripture) and asceticism as the ascent to  deep mystical prayer and mystical contemplation.{{sfn|Egan|1996|p=71}}\n\n==Excerpts from ''The Sayings of the Desert Fathers''==\n*\"A hermit said, 'Take care to be silent. Empty your mind. Attend to your meditation in the fear of God, whether you are resting or at work. If you do this, you will not fear the attacks of the demons.\"\n*Abba Moses, \"Sit in thy cell and thy cell will teach thee all.\"\n*\"Somebody asked Anthony, 'What shall I do in order to please God?' He replied, 'Do what I tell you, which is this: wherever you go, keep God in mind; whatever you do, follow the example of Holy Scripture; wherever you are, stay there and do not move away in a hurry. If you keep to these guide-lines, you will be saved.'\"\n*\"He (Evagrius) also said, 'A monk was told that his father had died. He said to the messenger, 'Do not blaspheme. My Father cannot die.'\"\n*Abbot Pastor, \"If someone does evil to you, you should do good to him, so that by your good work you may drive out his malice.\"\n*An Elder, \"A man who keeps death before his eyes will at all times overcome his cowardliness.\"\n*Blessed Macarius said, \"This is the truth, if a monk regards contempt as praise, poverty as riches, and hunger as a feast, he will never die.\"\n*\"It happened that as Abba Arsenius was sitting in his cell that he was harassed by demons. His servants, on their return, stood outside his cell and heard him praying to God in these words, 'O God, do not leave me. I have done nothing good in your sight, but according to your goodness, let me now make a beginning of good.'\"\n* When one desert father told another of his plans to \u201c shut himself into his cell and refuse the face of men, that he might perfect himself,\u201d the second monk replied, \u201c Unless thou first amend thy life going to and fro amongst men, thou shall not avail to amend it dwelling alone.\u201d\n*\"[[Anthony the Great|Abba Anthony]] said, 'Whoever hammers a lump of iron, first decides what he is going to make of it, a scythe, a sword, or an axe. Even so we ought to make up our minds what kind of virtue we want to forge or we labour in vain.'\n*He also said, 'Obedience with abstinence gives men power over wild beasts.'\"{{sfn|Ward|1984|p=8}}\n*It  was  said  of  [[John the Dwarf|Abba John the Dwarf]],  that  one  day  he  said  to his  elder  brother,  'I  should  like  to  be  free  of  all  care,  like  the  angels, who  do  not  work,  but  ceaselessly  offer  worship  to  God.'  So  he  took off  his  cloak  and  went  away  into  the  desert.  After  a  week  he  came back  to  his  brother.  When  he  knocked  on  the  door,  he  heard  his brother  say,  before  he  opened  it  'Who  are  you?'  He  said,  'I  am  John, your  brother.'  But  he  replied,  'John  has  become  an  angel,  and  henceforth  he  is  no  longer  among  men.'  Then  the  other  begged  him saying,  'It  is  I.'  However,  his  brother  did  not  let  him  in,  but  left  him there  in  distress  until  morning.  Then,  opening  the  door,  he  said  to him,  'You  are  a  man  and  you  must  once  again  work  in  order  to  eat.' Then  John  made  a  prostration  before  him,  saying,  'Forgive  me.'\"{{sfn|Ward|1984|p=86}}\n\n==Essential texts==\nThere are many different collections of sayings of the Desert Fathers. The earliest writings were simply ordered by the initial letter of the Abba's name in the order of the Greek alphabet. So the editors started with Anthony the Great, Arsenius and Agathon and concluded with Cheremon, Psenthaisius and Or. It was those first editors who used the word ''apophthegms'' (meaning: saying, maxim or aphorism)\u2014this is why this collection is now known as''[Apophthegmata Patrum Alphabetica'' (The Sayings of the Desert Fathers: The Alphabetic Collection). This collection contains about a thousand items.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe same editors knew there were also a lot of anonymous sayings and tales of the Desert Fathers and Mothers circulating. This material was gathered into a collection now known as ''[Anonymous Patrum Apophthegmata'' (Anonymous Sayings of the Desert Fathers). These sayings were placed in order of more or less similar subjects (for instance: humility, charity etc.). This collection contains about eight hundred items.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe collection now known as the Systematic Collection began to emerge a century later (AD&nbsp;500). It has sayings from the Alphabetic Collection and the Anonymous Sayings, combined and systematically ordered under twenty-one chapters.

Accessed September 2010 from [http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/070615.oldpersian.shtml]</ref>\n\n==Origin and overview==\nAs a [[written language]], Old Persian is attested in royal [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] inscriptions. It is an [[Iranian language]] and as such a member of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. The oldest known text written in Old Persian is from the [[Behistun Inscription]]s.<ref name=s2008-80-1/> Old Persian is one of the oldest Indo-European languages which are attested in original texts.<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(2)>{{harv|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2006|loc=vi(2). Documentation. Old Persian.}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest date of use of Old Persian as a spoken language is not precisely known. According to certain historical assumptions about the early history and origin of ancient Persians in [[Fars province|southwestern Iran]] (where Achaemenids hailed from), Old Persian was originally spoken by a tribe called ''Parsuwash'', who arrived in the Iranian Plateau early in the 1st millennium BCE and finally migrated down into the area of present-day F\u0101rs province. Their language, Old Persian, became the official language of the Achaemenid kings.<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(2)/> Assyrian records, which in fact appear to provide the earliest evidence for ancient Iranian (Persian and Median) presence on the Iranian Plateau, give a good chronology but only an approximate geographical indication of what seem to be ancient Persians. In these records of the 9th century BCE, ''Parsuwash'' (along with ''Matai'', presumably Medians) are first mentioned in the area of [[Lake Urmia]] in the records of [[Shalmaneser III]].<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(1)>{{harv|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2006|loc=vi(1). Earliest Evidence}}</ref> The exact identity of the Parsuwash is not known for certain, but from a linguistic viewpoint the word matches Old Persian ''p\u0101rsa'' itself coming directly from the older word ''*p\u0101r\u0107wa''.<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(1)/> Also, as Old Persian contains many words from another extinct Iranian language, [[Median language|Median]], according to [[Prods Oktor Skjaervo|P. O. Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8]] it is probable that Old Persian had already been spoken before formation of the Achaemenid Empire and was spoken during most of the first half of the first millennium BCE.<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(2)/> [[Xenophon]], a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions, describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BCE, which is when Old Persian was still spoken and extensively used. He relates that the [[Armenian people]] spoke [[Armenian language|a language]] that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians.<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Xenophon]]|title=Anabasis|pages=IV.v.2\u20139|title-link=Anabasis (Xenophon)}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n{{Main|Iranian languages#Proto-Iranian and Old Iranian_languages|l1=Old Iranian languages}}\nOld Persian belongs to the [[Iranian languages|Iranian language family]] which is a branch of the [[Indo-Iranian language]] family, itself within the large family of [[Indo-European languages]]. The common [[Proto-Indo-Iranians|ancestors of Indo-Iranians]] came from Central Asia sometime in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. The extinct and unattested [[Median language]] is another Old Iranian language related to Old Persian (for example, both are classified as [[Western Iranian languages]] and many Median names appeared in Old Persian texts)<ref name=s2008-76>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|p=76}}</ref> The group of Old Iranian languages was presumably a large group; however knowledge of it is restricted mainly to Old Persian, Avestan and Median.

Unlike the other languages and dialects, ancient and modern, of the Iranian group such as [[Avestan]], [[Parthia]]n, [[Soghdian]], [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], etc., Old, [[Middle Persian|Middle]] and [[Persian language|New Persian]] represent one and the same language at three states of its history. It had its origin in [[Fars Province|Fars]] and is differentiated by dialectical features, still easily recognizable from the dialect prevailing in north-western and eastern Iran''.</blockquote>\n\nMiddle Persian, also sometimes called Pahlavi, is a direct continuation of Old Persian and was used as the written official language of the country.<ref name=\"Ulrich\">Ulrich Ammon, Norbert Dittmar, Klaus J.

Accessed September 2010 from [http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/070615.oldpersian.shtml]</ref>\n\n==Origin and overview==\nAs a [[written language]], Old Persian is attested in royal [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] inscriptions. It is an [[Iranian language]] and as such a member of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. The oldest known text written in Old Persian is from the [[Behistun Inscription]]s.<ref name=s2008-80-1/> Old Persian is one of the oldest Indo-European languages which are attested in original texts.<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(2)>{{harv|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2006|loc=vi(2). Documentation. Old Persian.}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest date of use of Old Persian as a spoken language is not precisely known. According to certain historical assumptions about the early history and origin of ancient Persians in [[Fars province|southwestern Iran]] (where Achaemenids hailed from), Old Persian was originally spoken by a tribe called ''Parsuwash'', who arrived in the Iranian Plateau early in the 1st millennium BCE and finally migrated down into the area of present-day F\u0101rs province. Their language, Old Persian, became the official language of the Achaemenid kings.<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(2)/> Assyrian records, which in fact appear to provide the earliest evidence for ancient Iranian (Persian and Median) presence on the Iranian Plateau, give a good chronology but only an approximate geographical indication of what seem to be ancient Persians. In these records of the 9th century BCE, ''Parsuwash'' (along with ''Matai'', presumably Medians) are first mentioned in the area of [[Lake Urmia]] in the records of [[Shalmaneser III]].<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(1)>{{harv|Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8|2006|loc=vi(1). Earliest Evidence}}</ref> The exact identity of the Parsuwash is not known for certain, but from a linguistic viewpoint the word matches Old Persian ''p\u0101rsa'' itself coming directly from the older word ''*p\u0101r\u0107wa''.<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(1)/> Also, as Old Persian contains many words from another extinct Iranian language, [[Median language|Median]], according to [[Prods Oktor Skjaervo|P. O. Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8]] it is probable that Old Persian had already been spoken before formation of the Achaemenid Empire and was spoken during most of the first half of the first millennium BCE.<ref name=EI-IL-vi-vi(2)/> [[Xenophon]], a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions, describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BCE, which is when Old Persian was still spoken and extensively used. He relates that the [[Armenian people]] spoke [[Armenian language|a language]] that to his ear sounded like the language of the Persians.<ref>{{cite book |last=[[Xenophon]]|title=Anabasis|pages=IV.v.2\u20139|title-link=Anabasis (Xenophon)}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n{{Main|Iranian languages#Proto-Iranian and Old Iranian_languages|l1=Old Iranian languages}}\nOld Persian belongs to the [[Iranian languages|Iranian language family]] which is a branch of the [[Indo-Iranian language]] family, itself within the large family of [[Indo-European languages]]. The common [[Proto-Indo-Iranians|ancestors of Indo-Iranians]] came from Central Asia sometime in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. The extinct and unattested [[Median language]] is another Old Iranian language related to Old Persian (for example, both are classified as [[Western Iranian languages]] and many Median names appeared in Old Persian texts)<ref name=s2008-76>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|p=76}}</ref> The group of Old Iranian languages was presumably a large group; however knowledge of it is restricted mainly to Old Persian, Avestan and Median.

Unlike the other languages and dialects, ancient and modern, of the Iranian group such as [[Avestan]], [[Parthia]]n, [[Soghdian]], [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], etc., Old, [[Middle Persian|Middle]] and [[Persian language|New Persian]] represent one and the same language at three states of its history. It had its origin in [[Fars Province|Fars]] and is differentiated by dialectical features, still easily recognizable from the dialect prevailing in north-western and eastern Iran''.</blockquote>\n\nMiddle Persian, also sometimes called Pahlavi, is a direct continuation of Old Persian and was used as the written official language of the country.<ref name=\"Ulrich\">Ulrich Ammon, Norbert Dittmar, Klaus J.

Still, the Middle Persian language that appeared in the third century AD may be seen as a continuation of Old Persian</ref>\nComparison of the evolution at each stage of the language shows great simplification in grammar and syntax.

The factors making the consensus difficult are, among others, the difficult passage [[Behistun Inscription|DB]] (IV lines 88\u201392) from [[Darius the Great]] who speaks of a new \"form of writing\" being made by himself which is said to be \"in [[Iranian Languages|Aryan]]\":\n\n{{quote|King Darius says: By the grace of Ahuramazda this is the inscription which I have made.

Although it is true that the oldest attested Old Persian inscriptions are from Behistun monument from Darius, the creation of this \"new type of writing\" seems, according to Schmitt, \"to have begun already under [[Cyrus the Great]]\".<ref name=s2008-80-1>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|pp=80\u20131}}</ref>\n\nThe script shows a few changes in the shape of characters during the period it was used.

He is the second Marvel character to use the name '''[[Ghost Rider]]''', following [[Carter Slade]] (the [[Western comics]] hero later known as the Phantom Rider) and preceding [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Daniel Ketch]], [[Ghost Rider (Alejandra Jones)|Alejandra Jones]], and [[Robbie Reyes]]. The character's story begins when motorcycle [[stuntman]] Johnny Blaze becomes bound to the Spirit of Vengeance [[Zarathos]] after making a deal with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to spare his surrogate father. With his supernatural powers, Johnny seeks vengeance as the \"Ghost Rider\".\n\nThe character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as [[feature films]], [[television series]] and [[video games]]I stinkyedwas portrayed by actor [[Nicolas Cage]] in the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' and its 2011 sequel, ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]''.\n\n== Publication history ==\nFollowing the [[Phantom Rider|western comics character]] who originally used the name, the first superhero Ghost Rider, '''Johnny Blaze''', debuted in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (August [[1972 in comics|1972]]), created by Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]],<ref>Sanderson \"1970s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 156: \"Co-created by editor Roy Thomas, writer Gary Friedrich, and artist Mike Ploog, the new Ghost Rider was Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stunt performer.\"</ref> writer [[Gary Friedrich]] and artist [[Mike Ploog]]. After a seven-issue tryout run in ''Marvel Spotlight'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buttery|first=Jarrod|title=Ready for the Spotlight|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#71|page=7 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> the character received a self-titled ''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' series in 1973, with [[penciller]] [[Jim Mooney]] handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller [[Don Perlin]] began a long stint with issue #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through issue #58.\n\nThomas, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, described the character's genesis:\n\n{{quote|text=I had made up a character as a villain in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''\u2014a very lackluster character\u2014called [[Stunt-Master]]... a motorcyclist. Anyway, when Gary Friedrich started writing ''Daredevil'', he said, \"Instead of Stunt-Master, I'd like to make the villain a really weird motorcycle-riding character called Ghost Rider.\" He didn't describe him. I said, \"Yeah, Gary, there's only one thing wrong with it,\" and he kind of looked at me weird, because we were old friends from [[Missouri]], and I said, \"That's too good an idea to be just a villain in ''Daredevil''. He should start out right away in his own book.\" When Gary wasn't there the day we were going to design it, Mike Ploog, who was going to be the artist, and I designed the character. I had this idea for the skull-head, something like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' ''1968 Special'' jumpsuit, and so forth, and Ploog put the fire on the head, just because he thought it looked nice. Gary liked it, so they went off and did it.<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13thomas.html Roy Thomas interview], ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #13, May 2001.

I threatened on more than one occasion that if Marvel gets in a position where they are gonna make a movie or make a lot of money off of it, I'm gonna sue them, and I probably will. ...It was my idea. It was always my idea from the first time we talked about it, it turned out to be a guy with a flaming skull and rode a motorcycle. Ploog seems to think the flaming skull was his idea. But, to tell you the truth, it was ''my'' idea.<ref>Gary Friedrich interview, ''Comic Book Artist'', May 2001, p. 84.</ref>}}\n\nPloog recalled, in a 2008 interview:\n\n{{blockquote|Now, there's been all kinds of dialog about who was the creator of Ghost Rider. Gary Friedrich was the writer on it. ... The flaming skull: That was the big area of dispute. Who thought of the flaming skull? To be honest with you I can't remember. What else were you going to do with him? You couldn't put a helmet on him, so it had to be a flaming skull. As far as his costume went, it was part of the [[Phantom Rider|old [Western] Ghost Rider]]'s costume, with the Western panel front. The stripes down the arms and the legs were there merely so I could make the character['s costume] as black as I possibly could and still keep track of his body. It was the easiest way to design him.<ref>Mike Ploog interview, in ''Modern Masters Volume Nineteen: Mike Ploog'' ([[TwoMorrows Publishing]], 2008), pp. 24\u201325. {{ISBN|978-1-60549-007-6}}.</ref>}}\n\n[[Tony Isabella]] wrote a two-year story arc in which Blaze occasionally encountered an unnamed character referred to as \"the Friend\" who helped Blaze stay protected from Satan.

He spent his early years in the Quentin Carnival where his parents starred in a stunt show with Craig \"Crash\" Simpson. Johnny's mother walked out on Barton and Johnny and took the family's remaining two children, Barbara and Danny, with her.\n\nLosing his mother caused Johnny to repress many of his memories of her and his siblings. When his father died in a stunt, Johnny was adopted by Crash and Mona Simpson. The Simpsons helped Johnny by fabricating his past with the hope that it would be less painful than the truth. Now believing that his real mother was Clara Blaze, who had died, Johnny became an enthusiastic member of the Simpson clan, growing closer to their daughter, [[Roxanne Simpson|Roxanne]]. The two soon became inseparable and, as they grew older, their fondness for one another moved beyond familial.\n\nBlaze would eventually join the Simpsons in their own traveling stunt show, the Crash Simpson Stunt Cycle Extravaganza. Crash had become a father figure for Blaze and, on learning of Crash's life-threatening cancer, Blaze turned to the occult. His studies led him to a spell which supposedly could summon Satan himself. Johnny was unaware that he had, in fact, summoned [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Desperate to save Crash, Blaze sold his soul to Mephisto in return for Crash's cancer to be cured.<ref name=\"mspot05\">''Marvel Spotlight'' #5 (cover date Aug. 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCrash Simpson's cancer was cured, but he was subsequently killed in a stunt trying to jump over 22 cars. Mephisto, when confronted by Blaze over Crash's death, declared that he had kept his end of the bargain. Johnny's exact words in the bargain had been for Crash to be spared the cancer which was killing him, not for him to live. Blaze was saved by Roxanne when she proclaimed her love for Blaze, driving Mephisto away with the purity of her emotion.<ref name=\"mspot05\" />\n\nBlaze was unaware that Mephisto had bonded him with the demon Zarathos as an act of revenge, and was transformed into a Ghost Rider, a leather-clad skeleton with a flaming head. While Johnny still had his soul, he was forced to punish the wicked and evil upon Mephisto's demands whenever needed.<ref name=\"mspot05\" /> Whenever he was in the presence of evil he would transform into the Ghost Rider, to exact the devil's revenge, returning the evil to Hell. Blaze was not completely lost in the transformation however, and would also help the innocent when they were in danger.<ref>Various scenes in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #5\u201311 and early issues of the 1973-83 ''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) series.

Johnny himself was becoming stronger as well, and the conflicting personalities led to a battle over Blaze's physical body.<ref>As evidenced since ''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) #25 (cover date Aug. 1977) and resolved in ''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) #81 (cover date June 1983).

Zarathos followed him into the crystal, freeing Blaze from the curse, restoring his soul and ending his time as the Ghost Rider.<ref name=\"Ghost Rider Vol. 2 #81\">''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) #81.

Despite it being staffed with many powerful entities, it was nearly destroyed in a demonic attack led by the creature [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]]. The dead, friend and foe alike, were taken by government forces to be dissected. Blaze, with the help of friends, living and dead, breaks into the facility and destroys all the bodies.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nA later confrontation with the forces of evil would lead to Roxanne's death.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Blaze would later become a demon hunter, hunt down the demons responsible for her death and kill them all.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Roxanne was later discovered to have been resurrected as, or simply transformed into, the being named the Black Rose.{{issue|date=November 2010}} She was later returned to Johnny, despite memory loss, in the final issue of the Dan Ketch series of ''Ghost Rider''.{{issue|date=November 2010}}\n\nStarting over, Blaze eventually found a new job as an accountant and a new girlfriend, Chloe, in the 2001 [[Marvel Knights]] series \"The Hammer Lane\". Though at first it seemed he was free from the curse, Johnny would eventually transform back into Ghost Rider, since Zarathos had reconstituted himself in Johnny Blaze, despite being turned into a stone statue after his battle with the Midnight Sons.<ref>\"The Hammer Lane\" miniseries, under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint{{issue|date=July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis Ghost Rider entity spoke only a singular line and was much more savage than Noble Kale.{{issue|date=July 2013}} At first, there was no indication as to who or what this creature was.{{issue|date=July 2013}} However, this entity would appear to be Zarathos, as it is stated in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' Volume 4 (TPB).\n\nJohnny Blaze soon found himself constantly pursued by the demons of Hell, intent on forcing him to make good on the demonic pact that he had made to Mephisto. It was all that the Ghost Rider could do to outrun the evil, but it was not enough. Eventually, Johnny was captured and taken to Hell.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe \"[[Ghost Rider: Road to Damnation|Road to Damnation]]\" series, by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Clayton Crain]], finds Johnny Blaze trapped in an endless cycle of torture and escape in the Pit. It is here that the angel [[Malachi]] appears to the Ghost Rider, offering to free him from Hell with his soul intact, in exchange for hunting down the demon [[Kazann]] who has been unleashed upon the Earth.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nMalachi tells Blaze that the only way he will be freed from Hell permanently is to beat the [[Archangel]] Ruth to Kazann, in order to stave off the destruction that she will cause should she fight him. Along the way, Blaze meets a demon, Hoss, who is also in pursuit of Kazann, and offers to help the Ghost Rider since they share the same goal.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nHoss and Blaze fight with Ruth and she steals his bike; they pursue her in Hoss' Cadillac. When they arrive to where Ruth is Kazann is already free, thanks to the efforts of a corrupt paraplegic business owner named Earl Gustav. Hoss and Ruth fight while Blaze battles Kazann, who lets Johnny know that he has been duped by Malachi. As this happens Gustav's secretary, Jemima Catmint, makes her boss recite an incantation that sends Kazaan back to Hell. Johnny thinks that he is free, but gets shot in the head by a dying priest (whom he had blasted with hellfire earlier) with a holy bullet and is sent back to Hell. He confronts Malachi, who reveals that he tricked Johnny. Johnny threatens to kill him, but is prevented from doing so by Ruth, who kills him herself. Hoss appears and reveals that Kazann and Malachi were actually brothers, who passed information to each other about Heaven and Hell. Once Kazann escaped from Hell, Malachi needed to find someone (the Ghost Rider) to get him back before Ruth, in order to prevent Kazann from spilling the beans about Malachi exchanging secrets of Heaven with him while he was being tortured by angels.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn July, 2006, a new ongoing monthly series began with a story titled \"Vicious Cycle\", which was written by [[Daniel Way]], with art by [[Mark Texeira]] and Javier Saltares (the same artistic team from the 1990s series). The storyline takes place after the Ennis miniseries and features Johnny Blaze finally escaping from Hell.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nBlaze's escape is a plot engineered by Lucifer himself, as when Johnny escapes from Hell the devil comes with him. During a battle at a gas station, Blaze defeats the corpse of a recently deceased father that has been animated by the devil. Detecting the magical disturbance caused by Ghost Rider's escape, [[Doctor Strange]] investigates the situation, but, believing Doctor Strange to be Lucifer in disguise, Blaze attacks him and for the first time he uses the Penance Stare, debilitating Doctor Strange. It is then that the celestial being Numecet appears and reveals the intent of Lucifer to Blaze.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nHaving healed Doctor Strange, Numecet tells Johnny Blaze that he is stronger than he can comprehend and is a vital part of Lucifer's plans, as he intends for the Ghost Rider to kill each of the bodies that he has possessed. It is revealed that when Lucifer traveled to the mortal realm his essence shattered and spread to 666 recently deceased people, each one of them resurrected and imbued with a portion of the devil's strength. In order to reform his body each one of the human hosts has to die, but they cannot die from suicide as that is a sin and would send the devil back to hell, requiring them to provoke others into killing them. As each one falls the remaining will become even stronger and Ghost Rider must kill them because, although others can kill the bodies at first, eventually the remaining hosts will become so powerful that no other being could kill them. Numecet attempts to dissuade Blaze but to no avail, Blaze vowing that he will force the devil into a single corporeal form and then drag him back to Hell once and for all.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nDuring the \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" storyline, Johnny ends up in Sleepy Hollow, Illinois where a serial killer is decapitating local children and soon learns his identity: the supervillain known as [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. Killed by the [[Punisher]], Stevie Levins' body is occupied by one of the several aspects of Lucifer. The local sheriff thinks Blaze is to blame but soon realizes the truth. Ghost Rider and the sheriff confront Levins/Lucifer at the door of a preacher's house, and after a short fight Ghost Rider tears out Levins/Lucifer's heart and smashes his head.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #8\u201311. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[World War Hulk]]\" storyline, Johnny Blaze angers the Ghost Rider when he tries to save several people and allows the Lucifer fragment they were currently fighting to escape. Later after watching a broadcast on TV, Blaze decides to go to New York and fight the [[Hulk]], against the Ghost Rider's will. The issue ends with Ghost Rider coming to a halt on his motorcycle in front of the Hulk.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> After attempting to urge the Hulk to stop, Ghost Rider engages the Hulk. Their battle is monitored by Doctor Strange and [[Mister Fantastic]]. Doctor Strange believes that the entity that supplies Ghost Rider's mystic power is possibly capable of defeating the Hulk, stating that his powers are limitless, and only inhibited by the human side of the Ghost Rider, even going as far as to call his powers \"godlike\". However, as it is Johnny Blaze, not the fully powered demon Zarathos who is engaging the Hulk, the Hulk easily defeats Ghost Rider. After Johnny is knocked out, Zarathos himself emerges and rides off because, as Doctor Strange says in the end of the issue, Ghost Rider only protects the innocent, which none of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] are.<ref name=\"gr13\">''Ghost Rider'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nJohnny eventually manages to defeat Lucifer by 'killing' one host by shoving a truck's gear-stick through its head and breaking its spine, leaving the host biologically alive but incapacitated. While the host is kept alive by Dixie, a trucker Johnny had encountered, Blaze tracks down what Lucifer believes is his final host and defeats it, exploiting the fact that Lucifer is only at half-strength. As soon as Johnny kills this host, Dixie and a group of local police are able to kill the brain-damaged Lucifer fragment \u2013 who now possesses the full soul of the devil but is in no condition to use that power \u2013 and send him back to Hell.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSeven Riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat. Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, one of which he needs the powers of the Riders for: to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on Heaven. The story begins in Tibet with Chinese soldiers harassing a village, questioning them about weapons that killed two of his garrison patrols. During the harassment a peasant enters on a donkey. After a few exchange of words and an order to kill given by the General, the peasant changes and kills the General's men while his back is turned. When the General turns back he sees the Ghost Rider and gets a Penance Stare for his trouble. After the attack the Rider goes back to his sanctuary where he is visited by Danny Ketch. A short while later Sister Sara and Johnny Blaze arrive at the sanctuary to find out how to get back at Zadkiel. After entering, they find the peasant and donkey burnt to husks.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThat night, the two are visited by Ketch and begins a battle with a show of power. When Blaze does the Penance Stare to his brother, he sees exactly what has transpired. Ketch has murdered the hosts of numerous Riders for their powers. During a show of pity for the fallen, Ketch is able to return the Stare on Blaze and sends Blaze into temporary insanity. Before Ketch is able to take the power of Zarathos, he is stopped by the new Caretaker Sister Sara. She rescues Blaze and they go to a safehouse. At the safehouse, during Blaze's self-pity and Sara's trying to pick him back up, they are visited by two more Ghost Riders, the Arabic Molek and the Chinese Bai Gu Jing, whom they follow to Japan.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #29. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Blaze's team arrives in Japan, they learn Ketch has already taken the power of the Rider Yoshio Kannabe. After the conquest, Ketch has another talk with Zadkiel via communications link. During the conversation, Zadkiel massacres the squad of the Asura who guard the gates of Heaven. Zadkiel tells Ketch to wait to attack the Riders until the last ones are together. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, former cop Kowalski follows a contact to get a hellfire shotgun for his revenge on Blaze.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter acquiring the item he is then driven to the middle of a desert to sit and wait for his chance. After leaving Japan, Blaze's team journeys to the City of the Skulls in the Congo where the last stand would be made. There they meet the Lords of the Congo, the Ghost Riders Baron Skullfire and Marinette Bwachech, and their Phantom Riders. During the day Sara tells Molek about her new experience becoming a Caretaker, and her wonders about religion, with which she is given secret information that Molek knows about both. As the Ghost Riders and their forces ready for battle, Blaze has his eyes opened by two children who go to participate in the fight. He quickly snaps out of his depression and joins the others for the final battle.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the battle, Baron Skullfire dies and the spirit is transferred to one of the Phantom Riders, after which Ketch creates hellfire duplicates of himself to take the on the warriors. A wager is then made by Blaze and Ketch on a race between the brothers around the world for the fates of the powers. During the race, Blaze is critically injured by Kowalski's shotgun and Ketch takes the Rider from him as his duplicates overpower the others. Moments later, Ketch relinquishes the power of the Spirits of Vengeance to Heaven, with Zadkiel now able to storm it. The sound of the gates falling is enough to be felt by Spider-Man's spider-sense and loud enough to be heard even in Hell and Asgard. When an injured Blaze returns to the City of the Skulls, Ketch falls from the sky, revealing that the battle for Heaven has already been decided. As more energies fall from the heavens, one strikes Kowalski and changes him into a new Rider that looks a lot like Vengeance.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the battle with Zadkiel and his Black Host, Johnny Blaze parts ways with Ketch and Sara. He eventually wanders to a Japanese village, living in the nearby temple. The villagers are suddenly invaded by demons and their flesh is transformed into heinous forms by a creature called the Skinbender. Blaze's attempt to fight back result in her trying to morph his flesh, but finds his skin burns to the touch due to his power, prompting her to demand that he transform into the Ghost Rider. When he does, she breaks down crying, claiming that he is the most beautiful thing she had ever seen and begs for him to speak. He simply responds with \"Burn\", leading a storm of fire to rain onto the village, incinerating the demons and restoring the villagers to their normal states. At the same time, Sara arrives in the village to reunite with Blaze to continue their quest against Zadkiel. She finds him in the process of grinding up the Skinbender, before tossing her into the sea. Sara then consoles Blaze, asking him to think of his family and asks where they are. He replies, saying that they are in Heaven. They then depart from the village to continue their journey.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Antichrist, Kid Blackheart, after being hunted down by Zadkiel's agents on Earth, is saved by occult terrorist Jaine Cutter, despite Daimon Hellstorm's efforts to slay him. Eventually, the three encounter Johnny, Danny and Sara, and are forced to join forces in a desperate attempt to defeat Zadkiel in Paradise. Eventually, after reaching Heaven with Danny, he and Danny both attack Zadkiel, but are quickly overwhelmed; however, the spirits of Blaze's deceased wife and children encourage him to rise and continue to fight Zadkiel, rallying the combined forces of the Spirits of Vengeance (whom Ketch had been tricked into returning to Heaven by Zadkiel) against the renegade Archangel. After Zadkiel realizes that he was not, and never would be, the one true [[God]], as Blaze tells him, ''\"Only God can make a Ghost Rider, Zadkiel. You should know that. And only God can destroy one. You may have been able to shift that power around, to even leech it from its hosts. But you were never really able to control it. And you certainly couldn't kill it. You're not God, Zadkiel. You're just another power-mad wannabe who desperately needs his ass kicked. And that's exactly what the Ghost Riders are for\"'', he is defeated and banished to Hell, with God, revealed to have never perished at all, reclaiming Heaven and thanking Blaze for all he did for Paradise and its billions of souls.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire'' #6.

Freed from the curse, Blaze rides off into the distance on his motorcycle.<ref>''Shadowland: Ghost Rider'' #1.

Johnny frees Mephisto from his prison and drags him in chains behind him.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 9 #1-4</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nAs a primal agent of Heaven, empowered by the Spirits of Vengeance, created by the power of [[One-Above-All|God]] Himself ages past to enact vengeance upon the sinners of mankind, Johnny Blaze is one of the most powerful entities within the mortal and immortal realms. The common theme of the Ghost Rider is a human host who transforms into a flaming-headed skeleton with a vehicle and supernatural powers. When riding their vehicles, they can travel faster than conventional vehicles and can maneuver impossible feats such as riding straight up a vertical surface or across water.\n\nInitially when transformed, Blaze's motorcycle would simply catch fire. Later, he could create a cycle made of pure flame (hellfire). Hellfire is a supernatural flame which typically burns the soul and not the body, but also could be used as regular flame. Projecting hellfire as a weapon is his main form of attack. He also possesses heightened reflexes and superhuman strength, as well as almost total invulnerability to physical damage. Any damage he does take is quickly recovered, as Ghost Rider is made of pure hellfire, which he can use to immediately regenerate any lost limbs or holes in his body.\n\nFor a time, when Daniel Ketch was the Ghost Rider, Johnny did not have his typical powers. Instead, he wielded a shotgun that fired mystical force-blasts and rode a mystic motorcycle (both somehow empowered by exposure to Ketch's hellfire).\n\nIn the newest incarnation of Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider, another main weapon in his arsenal has been his chain, which was first used by the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. The chain, much like the rest of Ghost Rider, is made of hellfire given a solid physical substance. Ghost Rider can control the exact movement of the chain with his mind, allowing it to do things normal chains cannot, such as reach vast distances and wrap around enemies without fail. The chain is seemingly unbreakable.\n\nThis incarnation's most powerful weapon is the Penance Stare. When he locks eyes with his victim, he can make them experience all the emotional pain and suffering that they have inflicted on everyone in their lifetime, permanently damaging their soul in the process. The only person known to have recovered from the Penance Stare is Doctor Strange, but this was under exceptional circumstances and required the aid of an angelic being to restore him to normal.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) #4 (December 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> The  Punisher was able to resist the Penance Stare because he regretted nothing, which momentarily stunned the Ghost Rider.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #29 \"Punisher vs. Thunderbolts Part 3\". Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe demonic entity Zarathos, which is the current source of Ghost Rider's power, has been described by Doctor Strange (the Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, whom the Rider overpowered once in direct combat) to possess sufficient mystical power to challenge the Green Scar incarnation of the Hulk, as shown in [[World War Hulk]].<ref name=\"gr13\" /> Zarathos is also able to re-manifest himself within Blaze when seemingly destroyed or exorcised, unless placed within a new host.\n\n== Other versions ==\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, Ghost Rider made his debut in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' (vol. 2) #2 (July 2010).<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22449 CCC09: Ultimate Marvel Panel Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102225909/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22449 |date=2010-01-02 }}, [[Comic Book Resources]], August 7, 2009</ref> Ultimate Ghost Rider's origin is explained in ''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' (vol. 2) #4 (Sept. 2010). Young twenty-something couple Johnny Blaze and Roxanne Simpson decided on a cross-country trip across the United States. One day they came across a bar where they befriended a biker gang, who kept buying them beer. The friendship was a ruse, as they killed an intoxicated Blaze as part of a Satanic ritual. During the ritual they bartered their souls with [[Mephisto (comics)|Satan]] in exchange for wealth and power. Satan granted their request, but kept the upper hand. The deceased Blaze also made a deal; Satan will get his soul in exchange for the assured safety of Roxanne. For 20 years Blaze was trained to become the Ghost Rider and was sent into the world to get his revenge. He tracks down and kills the members of the motorcycle gang\u2014now rich and in positions of power\u2014individually. Due to these deaths, an executive order comes down from the White House: kill the Ghost Rider. The Avengers are recruited into the mission with no knowledge of the Ghost Rider except that he is seven feet tall and has the strength of Thor.<ref name=\"UCA3\">''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' (vol. 2) #3 (Aug. 2010).

He was later seen in a park with Satan watching Roxanne, who was brought back to life with no memory of what was done for her. Satan agrees to let her live her life if Johnny continues to be his Ghost Rider. He accepts, content with Roxanne being happy.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers 2'' #6 (Sept. 2010).

He is the second Marvel character to use the name '''[[Ghost Rider]]''', following [[Carter Slade]] (the [[Western comics]] hero later known as the Phantom Rider) and preceding [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Daniel Ketch]], [[Ghost Rider (Alejandra Jones)|Alejandra Jones]], and [[Robbie Reyes]]. The character's story begins when motorcycle [[stuntman]] Johnny Blaze becomes bound to the Spirit of Vengeance [[Zarathos]] after making a deal with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to spare his surrogate father. With his supernatural powers, Johnny seeks vengeance as the \"Ghost Rider\".\n\nThe character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as [[feature films]], [[television series]] and [[video games]]. Johnny Blaze was portrayed by actor [[Nicolas Cage]] in the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' and its 2011 sequel, ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]''.\n\n== Publication history ==\nFollowing the [[Phantom Rider|western comics character]] who originally used the name, the first superhero Ghost Rider, '''Johnny Blaze''', debuted in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (August [[1972 in comics|1972]]), created by Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]],<ref>Sanderson \"1970s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 156: \"Co-created by editor Roy Thomas, writer Gary Friedrich, and artist Mike Ploog, the new Ghost Rider was Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stunt performer.\"</ref> writer [[Gary Friedrich]] and artist [[Mike Ploog]].

Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller [[Don Perlin]] began a long stint with issue #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through issue #58.\n\nThomas, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, described the character's genesis:\n\n{{quote|text=I had made up a character as a villain in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''\u2014a very lackluster character\u2014called [[Stunt-Master]]... a motorcyclist. Anyway, when Gary Friedrich started writing ''Daredevil'', he said, \"Instead of Stunt-Master, I'd like to make the villain a really weird motorcycle-riding character called Ghost Rider.\" He didn't describe him. I said, \"Yeah, Gary, there's only one thing wrong with it,\" and he kind of looked at me weird, because we were old friends from [[Missouri]], and I said, \"That's too good an idea to be just a villain in ''Daredevil''. He should start out right away in his own book.\" When Gary wasn't there the day we were going to design it, Mike Ploog, who was going to be the artist, and I designed the character. I had this idea for the skull-head, something like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' ''1968 Special'' jumpsuit, and so forth, and Ploog put the fire on the head, just because he thought it looked nice. Gary liked it, so they went off and did it.<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13thomas.html Roy Thomas interview], ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #13, May 2001.

I threatened on more than one occasion that if Marvel gets in a position where they are gonna make a movie or make a lot of money off of it, I'm gonna sue them, and I probably will. ...It was my idea. It was always my idea from the first time we talked about it, it turned out to be a guy with a flaming skull and rode a motorcycle. Ploog seems to think the flaming skull was his idea. But, to tell you the truth, it was ''my'' idea.<ref>Gary Friedrich interview, ''Comic Book Artist'', May 2001, p. 84.</ref>}}\n\nPloog recalled, in a 2008 interview:\n\n{{blockquote|Now, there's been all kinds of dialog about who was the creator of Ghost Rider. Gary Friedrich was the writer on it. ... The flaming skull: That was the big area of dispute. Who thought of the flaming skull? To be honest with you I can't remember. What else were you going to do with him? You couldn't put a helmet on him, so it had to be a flaming skull. As far as his costume went, it was part of the [[Phantom Rider|old [Western] Ghost Rider]]'s costume, with the Western panel front. The stripes down the arms and the legs were there merely so I could make the character['s costume] as black as I possibly could and still keep track of his body.

He spent his early years in the Quentin Carnival where his parents starred in a stunt show with Craig \"Crash\" Simpson. Johnny's mother walked out on Barton and Johnny and took the family's remaining two children, Barbara and Danny, with her.\n\nLosing his mother caused Johnny to repress many of his memories of her and his siblings. When his father died in a stunt, Johnny was adopted by Crash and Mona Simpson. The Simpsons helped Johnny by fabricating his past with the hope that it would be less painful than the truth. Now believing that his real mother was Clara Blaze, who had died, Johnny became an enthusiastic member of the Simpson clan, growing closer to their daughter, [[Roxanne Simpson|Roxanne]]. The two soon became inseparable and, as they grew older, their fondness for one another moved beyond familial.\n\nBlaze would eventually join the Simpsons in their own traveling stunt show, the Crash Simpson Stunt Cycle Extravaganza. Crash had become a father figure for Blaze and, on learning of Crash's life-threatening cancer, Blaze turned to the occult. His studies led him to a spell which supposedly could summon Satan himself. Johnny was unaware that he had, in fact, summoned [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Desperate to save Crash, Blaze sold his soul to Mephisto in return for Crash's cancer to be cured.<ref name=\"mspot05\">''Marvel Spotlight'' #5 (cover date Aug. 1972). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCrash Simpson's cancer was cured, but he was subsequently killed in a stunt trying to jump over 22 cars. Mephisto, when confronted by Blaze over Crash's death, declared that he had kept his end of the bargain. Johnny's exact words in the bargain had been for Crash to be spared the cancer which was killing him, not for him to live. Blaze was saved by Roxanne when she proclaimed her love for Blaze, driving Mephisto away with the purity of her emotion.<ref name=\"mspot05\" />\n\nBlaze was unaware that Mephisto had bonded him with the demon Zarathos as an act of revenge, and was transformed into a Ghost Rider, a leather-clad skeleton with a flaming head. While Johnny still had his soul, he was forced to punish the wicked and evil upon Mephisto's demands whenever needed.<ref name=\"mspot05\" /> Whenever he was in the presence of evil he would transform into the Ghost Rider, to exact the devil's revenge, returning the evil to Hell. Blaze was not completely lost in the transformation however, and would also help the innocent when they were in danger.<ref>Various scenes in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #5\u201311 and early issues of the 1973-83 ''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) series.

Despite it being staffed with many powerful entities, it was nearly destroyed in a demonic attack led by the creature [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]]. The dead, friend and foe alike, were taken by government forces to be dissected. Blaze, with the help of friends, living and dead, breaks into the facility and destroys all the bodies.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nA later confrontation with the forces of evil would lead to Roxanne's death.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Blaze would later become a demon hunter, hunt down the demons responsible for her death and kill them all.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Roxanne was later discovered to have been resurrected as, or simply transformed into, the being named the Black Rose.{{issue|date=November 2010}} She was later returned to Johnny, despite memory loss, in the final issue of the Dan Ketch series of ''Ghost Rider''.{{issue|date=November 2010}}\n\nStarting over, Blaze eventually found a new job as an accountant and a new girlfriend, Chloe, in the 2001 [[Marvel Knights]] series \"The Hammer Lane\". Though at first it seemed he was free from the curse, Johnny would eventually transform back into Ghost Rider, since Zarathos had reconstituted himself in Johnny Blaze, despite being turned into a stone statue after his battle with the Midnight Sons.<ref>\"The Hammer Lane\" miniseries, under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint{{issue|date=July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis Ghost Rider entity spoke only a singular line and was much more savage than Noble Kale.{{issue|date=July 2013}} At first, there was no indication as to who or what this creature was.{{issue|date=July 2013}} However, this entity would appear to be Zarathos, as it is stated in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' Volume 4 (TPB).\n\nJohnny Blaze soon found himself constantly pursued by the demons of Hell, intent on forcing him to make good on the demonic pact that he had made to Mephisto. It was all that the Ghost Rider could do to outrun the evil, but it was not enough. Eventually, Johnny was captured and taken to Hell.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe \"[[Ghost Rider: Road to Damnation|Road to Damnation]]\" series, by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Clayton Crain]], finds Johnny Blaze trapped in an endless cycle of torture and escape in the Pit. It is here that the angel [[Malachi]] appears to the Ghost Rider, offering to free him from Hell with his soul intact, in exchange for hunting down the demon [[Kazann]] who has been unleashed upon the Earth.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nMalachi tells Blaze that the only way he will be freed from Hell permanently is to beat the [[Archangel]] Ruth to Kazann, in order to stave off the destruction that she will cause should she fight him. Along the way, Blaze meets a demon, Hoss, who is also in pursuit of Kazann, and offers to help the Ghost Rider since they share the same goal.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nHoss and Blaze fight with Ruth and she steals his bike; they pursue her in Hoss' Cadillac. When they arrive to where Ruth is Kazann is already free, thanks to the efforts of a corrupt paraplegic business owner named Earl Gustav. Hoss and Ruth fight while Blaze battles Kazann, who lets Johnny know that he has been duped by Malachi. As this happens Gustav's secretary, Jemima Catmint, makes her boss recite an incantation that sends Kazaan back to Hell. Johnny thinks that he is free, but gets shot in the head by a dying priest (whom he had blasted with hellfire earlier) with a holy bullet and is sent back to Hell. He confronts Malachi, who reveals that he tricked Johnny. Johnny threatens to kill him, but is prevented from doing so by Ruth, who kills him herself. Hoss appears and reveals that Kazann and Malachi were actually brothers, who passed information to each other about Heaven and Hell. Once Kazann escaped from Hell, Malachi needed to find someone (the Ghost Rider) to get him back before Ruth, in order to prevent Kazann from spilling the beans about Malachi exchanging secrets of Heaven with him while he was being tortured by angels.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn July, 2006, a new ongoing monthly series began with a story titled \"Vicious Cycle\", which was written by [[Daniel Way]], with art by [[Mark Texeira]] and Javier Saltares (the same artistic team from the 1990s series). The storyline takes place after the Ennis miniseries and features Johnny Blaze finally escaping from Hell.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nBlaze's escape is a plot engineered by Lucifer himself, as when Johnny escapes from Hell the devil comes with him. During a battle at a gas station, Blaze defeats the corpse of a recently deceased father that has been animated by the devil. Detecting the magical disturbance caused by Ghost Rider's escape, [[Doctor Strange]] investigates the situation, but, believing Doctor Strange to be Lucifer in disguise, Blaze attacks him and for the first time he uses the Penance Stare, debilitating Doctor Strange. It is then that the celestial being Numecet appears and reveals the intent of Lucifer to Blaze.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nHaving healed Doctor Strange, Numecet tells Johnny Blaze that he is stronger than he can comprehend and is a vital part of Lucifer's plans, as he intends for the Ghost Rider to kill each of the bodies that he has possessed. It is revealed that when Lucifer traveled to the mortal realm his essence shattered and spread to 666 recently deceased people, each one of them resurrected and imbued with a portion of the devil's strength. In order to reform his body each one of the human hosts has to die, but they cannot die from suicide as that is a sin and would send the devil back to hell, requiring them to provoke others into killing them. As each one falls the remaining will become even stronger and Ghost Rider must kill them because, although others can kill the bodies at first, eventually the remaining hosts will become so powerful that no other being could kill them. Numecet attempts to dissuade Blaze but to no avail, Blaze vowing that he will force the devil into a single corporeal form and then drag him back to Hell once and for all.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nDuring the \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" storyline, Johnny ends up in Sleepy Hollow, Illinois where a serial killer is decapitating local children and soon learns his identity: the supervillain known as [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. Killed by the [[Punisher]], Stevie Levins' body is occupied by one of the several aspects of Lucifer. The local sheriff thinks Blaze is to blame but soon realizes the truth. Ghost Rider and the sheriff confront Levins/Lucifer at the door of a preacher's house, and after a short fight Ghost Rider tears out Levins/Lucifer's heart and smashes his head.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #8\u201311. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[World War Hulk]]\" storyline, Johnny Blaze angers the Ghost Rider when he tries to save several people and allows the Lucifer fragment they were currently fighting to escape. Later after watching a broadcast on TV, Blaze decides to go to New York and fight the [[Hulk]], against the Ghost Rider's will. The issue ends with Ghost Rider coming to a halt on his motorcycle in front of the Hulk.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> After attempting to urge the Hulk to stop, Ghost Rider engages the Hulk. Their battle is monitored by Doctor Strange and [[Mister Fantastic]]. Doctor Strange believes that the entity that supplies Ghost Rider's mystic power is possibly capable of defeating the Hulk, stating that his powers are limitless, and only inhibited by the human side of the Ghost Rider, even going as far as to call his powers \"godlike\". However, as it is Johnny Blaze, not the fully powered demon Zarathos who is engaging the Hulk, the Hulk easily defeats Ghost Rider. After Johnny is knocked out, Zarathos himself emerges and rides off because, as Doctor Strange says in the end of the issue, Ghost Rider only protects the innocent, which none of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] are.<ref name=\"gr13\">''Ghost Rider'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nJohnny eventually manages to defeat Lucifer by 'killing' one host by shoving a truck's gear-stick through its head and breaking its spine, leaving the host biologically alive but incapacitated. While the host is kept alive by Dixie, a trucker Johnny had encountered, Blaze tracks down what Lucifer believes is his final host and defeats it, exploiting the fact that Lucifer is only at half-strength. As soon as Johnny kills this host, Dixie and a group of local police are able to kill the brain-damaged Lucifer fragment \u2013 who now possesses the full soul of the devil but is in no condition to use that power \u2013 and send him back to Hell.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSeven Riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat. Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, one of which he needs the powers of the Riders for: to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on Heaven. The story begins in Tibet with Chinese soldiers harassing a village, questioning them about weapons that killed two of his garrison patrols. During the harassment a peasant enters on a donkey. After a few exchange of words and an order to kill given by the General, the peasant changes and kills the General's men while his back is turned. When the General turns back he sees the Ghost Rider and gets a Penance Stare for his trouble. After the attack the Rider goes back to his sanctuary where he is visited by Danny Ketch. A short while later Sister Sara and Johnny Blaze arrive at the sanctuary to find out how to get back at Zadkiel. After entering, they find the peasant and donkey burnt to husks.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThat night, the two are visited by Ketch and begins a battle with a show of power. When Blaze does the Penance Stare to his brother, he sees exactly what has transpired. Ketch has murdered the hosts of numerous Riders for their powers. During a show of pity for the fallen, Ketch is able to return the Stare on Blaze and sends Blaze into temporary insanity. Before Ketch is able to take the power of Zarathos, he is stopped by the new Caretaker Sister Sara. She rescues Blaze and they go to a safehouse. At the safehouse, during Blaze's self-pity and Sara's trying to pick him back up, they are visited by two more Ghost Riders, the Arabic Molek and the Chinese Bai Gu Jing, whom they follow to Japan.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #29. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Blaze's team arrives in Japan, they learn Ketch has already taken the power of the Rider Yoshio Kannabe. After the conquest, Ketch has another talk with Zadkiel via communications link. During the conversation, Zadkiel massacres the squad of the Asura who guard the gates of Heaven. Zadkiel tells Ketch to wait to attack the Riders until the last ones are together. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, former cop Kowalski follows a contact to get a hellfire shotgun for his revenge on Blaze.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter acquiring the item he is then driven to the middle of a desert to sit and wait for his chance. After leaving Japan, Blaze's team journeys to the City of the Skulls in the Congo where the last stand would be made. There they meet the Lords of the Congo, the Ghost Riders Baron Skullfire and Marinette Bwachech, and their Phantom Riders. During the day Sara tells Molek about her new experience becoming a Caretaker, and her wonders about religion, with which she is given secret information that Molek knows about both. As the Ghost Riders and their forces ready for battle, Blaze has his eyes opened by two children who go to participate in the fight. He quickly snaps out of his depression and joins the others for the final battle.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the battle, Baron Skullfire dies and the spirit is transferred to one of the Phantom Riders, after which Ketch creates hellfire duplicates of himself to take the on the warriors. A wager is then made by Blaze and Ketch on a race between the brothers around the world for the fates of the powers. During the race, Blaze is critically injured by Kowalski's shotgun and Ketch takes the Rider from him as his duplicates overpower the others. Moments later, Ketch relinquishes the power of the Spirits of Vengeance to Heaven, with Zadkiel now able to storm it. The sound of the gates falling is enough to be felt by Spider-Man's spider-sense and loud enough to be heard even in Hell and Asgard. When an injured Blaze returns to the City of the Skulls, Ketch falls from the sky, revealing that the battle for Heaven has already been decided. As more energies fall from the heavens, one strikes Kowalski and changes him into a new Rider that looks a lot like Vengeance.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the battle with Zadkiel and his Black Host, Johnny Blaze parts ways with Ketch and Sara. He eventually wanders to a Japanese village, living in the nearby temple. The villagers are suddenly invaded by demons and their flesh is transformed into heinous forms by a creature called the Skinbender. Blaze's attempt to fight back result in her trying to morph his flesh, but finds his skin burns to the touch due to his power, prompting her to demand that he transform into the Ghost Rider. When he does, she breaks down crying, claiming that he is the most beautiful thing she had ever seen and begs for him to speak. He simply responds with \"Burn\", leading a storm of fire to rain onto the village, incinerating the demons and restoring the villagers to their normal states. At the same time, Sara arrives in the village to reunite with Blaze to continue their quest against Zadkiel. She finds him in the process of grinding up the Skinbender, before tossing her into the sea. Sara then consoles Blaze, asking him to think of his family and asks where they are. He replies, saying that they are in Heaven. They then depart from the village to continue their journey.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Antichrist, Kid Blackheart, after being hunted down by Zadkiel's agents on Earth, is saved by occult terrorist Jaine Cutter, despite Daimon Hellstorm's efforts to slay him. Eventually, the three encounter Johnny, Danny and Sara, and are forced to join forces in a desperate attempt to defeat Zadkiel in Paradise. Eventually, after reaching Heaven with Danny, he and Danny both attack Zadkiel, but are quickly overwhelmed; however, the spirits of Blaze's deceased wife and children encourage him to rise and continue to fight Zadkiel, rallying the combined forces of the Spirits of Vengeance (whom Ketch had been tricked into returning to Heaven by Zadkiel) against the renegade Archangel. After Zadkiel realizes that he was not, and never would be, the one true [[God]], as Blaze tells him, ''\"Only God can make a Ghost Rider, Zadkiel. You should know that. And only God can destroy one. You may have been able to shift that power around, to even leech it from its hosts. But you were never really able to control it. And you certainly couldn't kill it. You're not God, Zadkiel. You're just another power-mad wannabe who desperately needs his ass kicked. And that's exactly what the Ghost Riders are for\"'', he is defeated and banished to Hell, with God, revealed to have never perished at all, reclaiming Heaven and thanking Blaze for all he did for Paradise and its billions of souls.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heaven's On Fire'' #6.

Freed from the curse, Blaze rides off into the distance on his motorcycle.<ref>''Shadowland: Ghost Rider'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\" storyline, Johnny Blaze becomes more agitated about his curse and is then approached by a mysterious figure known as Adam who claims he can help Blaze be rid of the Ghost Rider once and for all. Blaze was ambivalent to the man's gesture, thinking there was a catch to his offer, but Adam simply put that the curse will be passed to someone he never met. Blaze accepts the offer and was told to drive the Rider out of his soul. Blaze was finally rid of the Rider for good from then on while Adam went about his way to find a new host for the Ghost Rider.

The common theme of the Ghost Rider is a human host who transforms into a flaming-headed skeleton with a vehicle and supernatural powers. When riding their vehicles, they can travel faster than conventional vehicles and can maneuver impossible feats such as riding straight up a vertical surface or across water.\n\nInitially when transformed, Blaze's motorcycle would simply catch fire. Later, he could create a cycle made of pure flame (hellfire). Hellfire is a supernatural flame which typically burns the soul and not the body, but also could be used as regular flame. Projecting hellfire as a weapon is his main form of attack. He also possesses heightened reflexes and superhuman strength, as well as almost total invulnerability to physical damage. Any damage he does take is quickly recovered, as Ghost Rider is made of pure hellfire, which he can use to immediately regenerate any lost limbs or holes in his body.\n\nFor a time, when Daniel Ketch was the Ghost Rider, Johnny did not have his typical powers. Instead, he wielded a shotgun that fired mystical force-blasts and rode a mystic motorcycle (both somehow empowered by exposure to Ketch's hellfire).\n\nIn the newest incarnation of Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider, another main weapon in his arsenal has been his chain, which was first used by the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. The chain, much like the rest of Ghost Rider, is made of hellfire given a solid physical substance. Ghost Rider can control the exact movement of the chain with his mind, allowing it to do things normal chains cannot, such as reach vast distances and wrap around enemies without fail. The chain is seemingly unbreakable.\n\nThis incarnation's most powerful weapon is the Penance Stare. When he locks eyes with his victim, he can make them experience all the emotional pain and suffering that they have inflicted on everyone in their lifetime, permanently damaging their soul in the process. The only person known to have recovered from the Penance Stare is Doctor Strange, but this was under exceptional circumstances and required the aid of an angelic being to restore him to normal.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) #4 (December 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> The  Punisher was able to resist the Penance Stare because he regretted nothing, which momentarily stunned the Ghost Rider.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #29 \"Punisher vs. Thunderbolts Part 3\". Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe demonic entity Zarathos, which is the current source of Ghost Rider's power, has been described by Doctor Strange (the Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, whom the Rider overpowered once in direct combat) to possess sufficient mystical power to challenge the Green Scar incarnation of the Hulk, as shown in [[World War Hulk]].<ref name=\"gr13\" /> Zarathos is also able to re-manifest himself within Blaze when seemingly destroyed or exorcised, unless placed within a new host.\n\n== Other versions ==\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, Ghost Rider made his debut in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' (vol. 2) #2 (July 2010).<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22449 CCC09: Ultimate Marvel Panel Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102225909/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22449 |date=2010-01-02 }}, [[Comic Book Resources]], August 7, 2009</ref> Ultimate Ghost Rider's origin is explained in ''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' (vol. 2) #4 (Sept. 2010). Young twenty-something couple Johnny Blaze and Roxanne Simpson decided on a cross-country trip across the United States. One day they came across a bar where they befriended a biker gang, who kept buying them beer. The friendship was a ruse, as they killed an intoxicated Blaze as part of a Satanic ritual. During the ritual they bartered their souls with [[Mephisto (comics)|Satan]] in exchange for wealth and power. Satan granted their request, but kept the upper hand. The deceased Blaze also made a deal; Satan will get his soul in exchange for the assured safety of Roxanne. For 20 years Blaze was trained to become the Ghost Rider and was sent into the world to get his revenge. He tracks down and kills the members of the motorcycle gang\u2014now rich and in positions of power\u2014individually. Due to these deaths, an executive order comes down from the White House: kill the Ghost Rider.

These rebel soldiers, on their way to reach Manipur, pitched their tents at Malegarh. A force of 160 company soldiers under Major Byng, initially reached Protaphgarh (now in India) and then Malegarh on December 19, 1857. In that battle, Major Byng and four other company soldiers lost their lives. The mutineers retreated leaving behind twenty-six rebels including Major Sher Khan and Captain Shamsher Khan.

The major sources of water are the Juri, Sonai Bardhal and Kushiyara rivers, which traverse the wetland and drain through a single outlet, the Kushiyara River. While the haor itself is a seasonal water body formed during the monsoon, the beels are low-lying depressions of the haor system retaining water even during the dry months of the season. Thus, the haor system is a complex of both lacustrine wetlands (with open water) and palustrine wetlands (marshy \u2013 with vegetation), depending on the hydraulic behaviour in different seasons. In rainy season it takes the shape of a sea. Hakaluki Haor has a wide variety of waterfowl as well as wintering migratory birds.<ref>http://umanitoba.ca/outreach/begcb/pub/presentations/27739254-Environmental-governance-in-Hakaluki-Haor-Bangladesh.pdf</ref> Every winter, tens of thousands of guest birds of about 150 species from Siberia and other cold regions flock to the haors. They include Bright and Rose King-duck, Pati-duck, Bali Hash, Lenja, Chity, Sorali, Boikal, Nilshir Piyan, Pantamukhi, Pankouri, Buti-duck, China, Rangamuri, Black-duck, Peributhi, Chokachoki, Giria, Khonjona, Patari, Dolpipi, Water-hen, North-Giria, Dahuk, Patibatan, Common-chill, Cotton-Chill, Gergini, Cottontail, Pintail, Toughed Duck.\n\nHakaluki Haor presents a unique type of ecosystem as well as a new set of management issues. Most of the local inhabitants are in some way dependent on the wetland for their livelihood. Hakaluki Haor supports one of the largest inland fisheries in Bangladesh. It is one of the so-called \u2018mother fishery areas\u2019, i.e. areas where brood, young and juvenile fish aggregate and take refuge during the dry season when the rest of the haor area becomes dry. While the area was once known as a \"fishmine\", its fish stocks are now increasingly threatened. Hakaluki Haor is on a global level a very important wetland for a wide variety of waterfowl, particularly Anatidae ducks.  In the 1960s, the wintering population of ducks was estimated at between 40,000 and 60,000.Every year a lot of birds making their nest in the house of Late Haji Monuhor Ali Master's house. This house became very well known as ''Masterer Pakir Bari'' which is a popular tourist attraction to the naturalist. Everyday a lot of local and international tourists visit ''Masterer Pakir Bari''. In Hakaluki Haor threatened species such as Pallas\u2019 Fish Eagle also occurs at the wetland, which is furthermore an important area for reptiles such as freshwater turtles, and for amphibians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doe-bd.org/cwbmp/project_background.htm|title=Welcome to CWBMP|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://en.bdfish.org/2010/11/hakaluki-haor-plenteous-beauty-pompous-biodiversity/[[BdFISH]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnbd.org/projects/semp_haor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417090621/http://www.iucnbd.org/projects/semp_haor.html |archivedate=2010-04-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nAdministratively, Barlekha Upazila consists of 9 Unions and 1 Pouroshova[Municipality]/Ward that encompasses 109 [[Mouza|Mauzas or Mahallas]] and 253 villages.<ref name=\"Banglapedia\" />\nThe Unions are:<ref name=\"Banglapedia\" />\n* Barlekha\n* Barni\n* Daser Bazar\n* Nij Bahadurpur\n* Talimpur\n* North Dakshinbhag\n* South Dakshinbhag\n* North Shahbazpur\n* [[Dakshin Shahbazpur Union|South Shahbazpur]]\n* Shujanagar\n\n==Education==\n*Barlekha City School.\n*Shingho Gram Govt Primary School was established 1886.\n*Siddique Ali High School was established at 1927.\n*Patharia Chotolekha (P.

The major sources of water are the Juri, Sonai Bardhal and Kushiyara rivers, which traverse the wetland and drain through a single outlet, the Kushiyara River. While the haor itself is a seasonal water body formed during the monsoon, the beels are low-lying depressions of the haor system retaining water even during the dry months of the season. Thus, the haor system is a complex of both lacustrine wetlands (with open water) and palustrine wetlands (marshy \u2013 with vegetation), depending on the hydraulic behaviour in different seasons. In rainy season it takes the shape of a sea. Hakaluki Haor has a wide variety of waterfowl as well as wintering migratory birds.<ref>http://umanitoba.ca/outreach/begcb/pub/presentations/27739254-Environmental-governance-in-Hakaluki-Haor-Bangladesh.pdf</ref> Every winter, tens of thousands of guest birds of about 150 species from Siberia and other cold regions flock to the haors. They include Bright and Rose King-duck, Pati-duck, Bali Hash, Lenja, Chity, Sorali, Boikal, Nilshir Piyan, Pantamukhi, Pankouri, Buti-duck, China, Rangamuri, Black-duck, Peributhi, Chokachoki, Giria, Khonjona, Patari, Dolpipi, Water-hen, North-Giria, Dahuk, Patibatan, Common-chill, Cotton-Chill, Gergini, Cottontail, Pintail, Toughed Duck.\n\nHakaluki Haor presents a unique type of ecosystem as well as a new set of management issues. Most of the local inhabitants are in some way dependent on the wetland for their livelihood. Hakaluki Haor supports one of the largest inland fisheries in Bangladesh. It is one of the so-called \u2018mother fishery areas\u2019, i.e. areas where brood, young and juvenile fish aggregate and take refuge during the dry season when the rest of the haor area becomes dry. While the area was once known as a \"fishmine\", its fish stocks are now increasingly threatened. Hakaluki Haor is on a global level a very important wetland for a wide variety of waterfowl, particularly Anatidae ducks.  In the 1960s, the wintering population of ducks was estimated at between 40,000 and 60,000.Every year a lot of birds making their nest in the house of Late Haji Monuhor Ali Master's house. This house became very well known as ''Masterer Pakir Bari'' which is a popular tourist attraction to the naturalist. Everyday a lot of local and international tourists visit ''Masterer Pakir Bari''. In Hakaluki Haor threatened species such as Pallas\u2019 Fish Eagle also occurs at the wetland, which is furthermore an important area for reptiles such as freshwater turtles, and for amphibians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doe-bd.org/cwbmp/project_background.htm|title=Welcome to CWBMP|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://en.bdfish.org/2010/11/hakaluki-haor-plenteous-beauty-pompous-biodiversity/[[BdFISH]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnbd.org/projects/semp_haor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417090621/http://www.iucnbd.org/projects/semp_haor.html |archivedate=2010-04-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nAdministratively, Barlekha Upazila consists of 9 Unions and 1 Pouroshova[Municipality]/Ward that encompasses 109 [[Mouza|Mauzas or Mahallas]] and 253 villages.<ref name=\"Banglapedia\" />\nThe Unions are:<ref name=\"Banglapedia\" />\n* Barlekha\n* Barni\n* Daser Bazar\n* Nij Bahadurpur\n* Talimpur\n* North Dakshinbhag\n* South Dakshinbhag\n* North Shahbazpur\n* [[Dakshin Shahbazpur Union|South Shahbazpur]]\n* Shujanagar\n\n==Education==\n*Barlekha City School.\n*Shingho Gram Govt Primary School was established 1886.\n*Siddique Ali High School was established at 1927.\n*Patharia Chotolekha (P.
