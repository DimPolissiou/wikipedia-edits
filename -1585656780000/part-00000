Harper was the first prime minister to come from the modern [[Conservative Party of Canada]], though older centre-right conservative parties have been active since [[Canadian Confederation|Canada's founding]].\n\nHarper was one of the founding members of the [[Reform Party of Canada]] and under that banner was first elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in 1993 in [[Calgary West]]. He did not seek re-election in the [[1997 Canadian federal election|1997 federal election]].

In 2003, Harper reached an agreement with the leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]], [[Peter MacKay]], for the merger of their two parties to form the Conservative Party of Canada. Harper was subsequently elected as the party's first leader in March 2004.  As party leader, Leader of the Opposition, and then Prime Minister Harper represented the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Calgary Southwest]] in [[Alberta]] from 2002 to 2015.

In the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal election]], the Conservative Party outperformed and won a stronger minority, showing a moderate increase in the percentage of the [[Representative democracy|popular vote]] and increased representation in the House of Commons of Canada, with 143 of 308 seats.

Harper was elected the first leader of the Conservative Party, with a first ballot majority against [[Belinda Stronach]] and Tony Clement on March 20, 2004. Harper's victory included strong showings in Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada.\n\n===2004 federal election===\n{{main|2004 Canadian federal election}}\nHarper led the Conservatives into the 2004 federal election. Initially, new Prime Minister Paul Martin held a large lead in polls, but this eroded because of infighting, [[Sponsorship scandal|Adscam]] (a [[scandal]] that came as a result of a [[Government of Canada]] \"[[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] program\" in the province of Quebec and involving the Liberal Party of Canada) and other scandals surrounding his government. The Liberals attempted to counter this with an early election call, as this would give the Conservatives less time to consolidate their merger.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nMartin's weak performance in the leader's debate, along with an unpopular provincial budget by Liberal Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] in Ontario, moved the Conservatives into a lead for a time. However, comments by Conservative MPs, leaked press releases slandering the then prime minister, as well as controversial TV [[attack ad]]s suggesting that the Conservatives would make Canada more like the United States, caused Harper's party to lose some momentum.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nHarper made an effort to appeal to voters in Quebec, a province where the Reform/Alliance side of the merged party had not done well.  He was featured in several of the Tories' French-language campaign ads.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe Liberals were re-elected to power with a minority government, with the Conservatives coming in second place. The Conservatives managed to make inroads into the Liberals' Ontario stronghold, primarily in the province's socially conservative central region.  However, they were shut out of Quebec, marking the first time that a centre-right party did not win any seats in that province.  Harper, after some personal deliberation, decided to stay on as the party leader. Many credited him with bringing the Progressive Conservative Party and Canadian Alliance together in a short time to fight a close election.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n====Agreement with the BQ and the NDP====\nTwo months after the federal election, Stephen Harper privately met [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] and New Democratic Party leader [[Jack Layton]] in a Montreal hotel.<ref name=gazetteCo-Opposition/> On September 9, 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to then-[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]], stating,\n{{Quote|We respectfully point out that the opposition parties, who together constitute a majority in the House, have been in close consultation.

Harper had been rumoured to be shifting his ideology closer to that of a [[Blue Tory]], and many thought he'd wanted to move the party's policies closer to the centre.  Any opposition to abortion or bilingualism was dropped from the Conservative platform. Harper received an 84% endorsement from delegates in the [[leadership review]].\n\nDespite the party's move to the centre, the party began a concerted drive against same-sex marriage.  Harper was criticized by a group of law professors for arguing that the government could override the provincial court rulings on same-sex marriage without using  the \"[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]\", a provision of [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. He also argued, in general, for lower taxes, an elected [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], a tougher stance on crime, and closer relations with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nFollowing the April 2005 release of [[Jean Brault]]'s damaging testimony at the [[Gomery Commission]], implicating the Liberals in the scandal, opinion polls placed the Conservatives ahead of Liberals. The Conservatives had earlier abstained from the vote on the [[Canadian federal budget, 2005|2005 budget]] to avoid forcing an election. With the collapse in Liberal support and a controversial NDP amendment to the budget, the party exerted significant pressure on Harper to bring down the government. In May, Harper announced that the government had lost the \"moral authority to govern\". Shortly thereafter, the Conservatives and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois united to defeat the government on a vote that some considered to be either a [[confidence motion]] or else a motion requiring an immediate test of the confidence of the House.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The Martin government did not accept this interpretation and argued that vote had been on a procedural motion, although they also indicated that they would bring forward their revised budget for a confidence vote the following week.

The Conservatives increased their standing in parliament to 166, up from 143 at the dissolution of the previous parliament. This resulted in the first centre-right majority government since the Progressive Conservatives won what would be their last majority in 1988. The Conservatives also received a greater number of total votes than in 2008.  Notably, the Conservatives had a significant breakthrough in southern Ontario, a region where neither they nor the Reform/Alliance side of the merger had done well in the previous two decades. They managed to win several seats in Toronto itself; no centre-right party had won seats in the former [[Metro Toronto]] since 1988.\n\nThe election ended five years of minority governments, made the New Democratic Party the Official Opposition for the first time, relegated the Liberals to third place for the first time, brought Canada's first Green Party Member of Parliament, and reduced the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois from 47 to 4 seats.\n\nAfter the election, the Conservatives were accused of cheating in the [[Robocall scandal]], mainly suppressing votes by directing voters to bogus polling stations.<ref name=MaherFeb27>{{cite news |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Elections+Canada+investigating+robocalls+that+misled+voters/6194990/story.html |title=Elections Canada investigating 'robocalls' that misled voters |accessdate=March 18, 2012 |last1=Maher |first1=Stephen |last2=McGregor |first2=Glen |date=February 27, 2012 |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> There were complaints in 247 of Canada's 308 ridings, but only one person was charged; Conservative staffer [[Michael Sona]] was convicted and jailed.\n\n===2015 election===\n{{main|2015 Canadian federal election}}\nUnder the [[Canada Elections Act]], a general election had to take place no later than October 19, 2015.

In that election, Harper's Conservative Party was defeated by Justin Trudeau's Liberals, and became the Official Opposition, dropping to only 99 seats out of 338. This was mainly because of a collapse of Conservative support in southern Ontario, a region that swung heavily to them in 2011.  They lost all of their seats in Toronto, and won only three seats in the Greater Toronto Area.  They were also shut out of Atlantic Canada\u2014the first time in decades that there will be no centre-right MPs from that region.

Harper was the first prime minister to come from the modern [[Conservative Party of Canada]], though older centre-right conservative parties have been active since [[Canadian Confederation|Canada's founding]].\n\nHarper was one of the founding members of the [[Reform Party of Canada]] and under that banner was first elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in 1993 in [[Calgary West]]. He did not seek re-election in the [[1997 Canadian federal election|1997 federal election]]. Harper instead joined and later led the [[National Citizens Coalition]], a conservative lobbyist group.<ref>[http://www.harperindex.ca/ViewArticle.cfm?Ref=0010 National Citizens Coalition (NCC)&nbsp;\u2013 Harper's presidency was a critical period] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192928/http://www.harperindex.ca/ViewArticle.cfm?Ref=0010 |date=March 3, 2016 }}.

In 2003, Harper reached an agreement with the leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]], [[Peter MacKay]], for the merger of their two parties to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. Harper was subsequently elected as the party's first leader in March 2004.  As party leader, [[Leader of the Opposition]], and then Prime Minister Harper represented the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Calgary Southwest]] in [[Alberta]] from 2002 to 2015.

Harper was elected the first leader of the Conservative Party, with a first ballot majority against [[Belinda Stronach]] and Tony Clement on March 20, 2004. Harper's victory included strong showings in Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada.\n\n===2004 federal election===\n{{main|2004 Canadian federal election}}\nHarper led the Conservatives into the 2004 federal election. Initially, new Prime Minister Paul Martin held a large lead in polls, but this eroded because of infighting, [[Sponsorship scandal|Adscam]] (a [[scandal]] that came as a result of a [[Government of Canada]] \"[[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] program\" in the province of Quebec and involving the Liberal Party of Canada) and other scandals surrounding his government. The Liberals attempted to counter this with an early election call, as this would give the Conservatives less time to consolidate their merger.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nMartin's weak performance in the leader's debate, along with an unpopular provincial budget by Liberal Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] in Ontario, moved the Conservatives into a lead for a time. However, comments by Conservative MPs, leaked press releases slandering the then prime minister, as well as controversial TV [[attack ad]]s suggesting that the Conservatives would make Canada more like the United States, caused Harper's party to lose some momentum.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nHarper made an effort to appeal to voters in Quebec, a province where the Reform/Alliance side of the merged party had not done well.  He was featured in several of the Tories' French-language campaign ads.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe Liberals were re-elected to power with a minority government, with the Conservatives coming in second place. The Conservatives managed to make inroads into the Liberals' Ontario stronghold, primarily in the province's socially conservative central region.  However, they were shut out of Quebec, marking the first time that a centre-right party did not win any seats in that province.  Harper, after some personal deliberation, decided to stay on as the party leader. Many credited him with bringing the Progressive Conservative Party and Canadian Alliance together in a short time to fight a close election.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n====Agreement with the BQ and the NDP====\nTwo months after the federal election, Stephen Harper privately met [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] and New Democratic Party leader [[Jack Layton]] in a Montreal hotel.<ref name=gazetteCo-Opposition/> On September 9, 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to then-[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]], stating,\n{{Quote|We respectfully point out that the opposition parties, who together constitute a majority in the House, have been in close consultation.

Harper had been rumoured to be shifting his ideology closer to that of a [[Blue Tory]], and many thought he'd wanted to move the party's policies closer to the centre.  Any opposition to abortion or bilingualism was dropped from the Conservative platform. Harper received an 84% endorsement from delegates in the [[leadership review]].\n\nDespite the party's move to the centre, the party began a concerted drive against same-sex marriage.  Harper was criticized by a group of law professors for arguing that the government could override the provincial court rulings on same-sex marriage without using  the \"[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]\", a provision of [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. He also argued, in general, for lower taxes, an elected [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], a tougher stance on crime, and closer relations with the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nFollowing the April 2005 release of [[Jean Brault]]'s damaging testimony at the [[Gomery Commission]], implicating the Liberals in the scandal, opinion polls placed the Conservatives ahead of Liberals. The Conservatives had earlier abstained from the vote on the [[Canadian federal budget, 2005|2005 budget]] to avoid forcing an election. With the collapse in Liberal support and a controversial NDP amendment to the budget, the party exerted significant pressure on Harper to bring down the government. In May, Harper announced that the government had lost the \"moral authority to govern\". Shortly thereafter, the Conservatives and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois united to defeat the government on a vote that some considered to be either a [[confidence motion]] or else a motion requiring an immediate test of the confidence of the House.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The Martin government did not accept this interpretation and argued that vote had been on a procedural motion, although they also indicated that they would bring forward their revised budget for a confidence vote the following week.

The Conservatives increased their standing in parliament to 166, up from 143 at the dissolution of the previous parliament. This resulted in the first centre-right majority government since the Progressive Conservatives won what would be their last majority in 1988. The Conservatives also received a greater number of total votes than in 2008.  Notably, the Conservatives had a significant breakthrough in southern Ontario, a region where neither they nor the Reform/Alliance side of the merger had done well in the previous two decades. They managed to win several seats in Toronto itself; no centre-right party had won seats in the former [[Metro Toronto]] since 1988.\n\nThe election ended five years of minority governments, made the New Democratic Party the Official Opposition for the first time, relegated the Liberals to third place for the first time, brought Canada's first Green Party Member of Parliament, and reduced the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois from 47 to 4 seats.\n\nAfter the election, the Conservatives were accused of cheating in the [[Robocall scandal]], mainly suppressing votes by directing voters to bogus polling stations.<ref name=MaherFeb27>{{cite news |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Elections+Canada+investigating+robocalls+that+misled+voters/6194990/story.html |title=Elections Canada investigating 'robocalls' that misled voters |accessdate=March 18, 2012 |last1=Maher |first1=Stephen |last2=McGregor |first2=Glen |date=February 27, 2012 |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> There were complaints in 247 of Canada's 308 ridings, but only one person was charged; Conservative staffer [[Michael Sona]] was convicted and jailed.\n\n===2015 election===\n{{main|2015 Canadian federal election}}\nUnder the [[Canada Elections Act]], a general election had to take place no later than October 19, 2015.

In that election, Harper's Conservative Party was defeated by Justin Trudeau's Liberals, and became the Official Opposition, dropping to only 99 seats out of 338. This was mainly because of a collapse of Conservative support in southern Ontario, a region that swung heavily to them in 2011.  They lost all of their seats in Toronto, and won only three seats in the Greater Toronto Area.  They were also shut out of Atlantic Canada\u2014the first time in decades that there will be no centre-right MPs from that region.

{"title_page": "Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln", "text_new": "{{Factual accuracy disputed|date=February 2020}}\n\n'''The [[homosexuality]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]]''' (1809\u20131865), the [[List of Presidents of the United States|16th President of the United States]], has been questioned by some activists. Lincoln was married to [[John Todd Lincoln|John Todd]] from November 4, 1842, until his death on April 15, 1865, and fathered four children with her.\n\n==Historical scholarship and debate==\n===Marriage with Mary Todd Lincoln===\n[[Image:John Todd Lincoln.jpg |thumb|left|Mary Todd Lincoln in 1846]]\n\nLincoln and [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] met in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] in 1839 and became engaged in 1840.<ref>[http://marriage.about.com/od/presidentialmarriages/a/abelincoln.htm \"Abe Lincoln's Marriage\"], About.com</ref> In what historian Allen Guelzo calls \"one of the murkiest episodes in Lincoln's life\", Lincoln called off his engagement to Mary Todd. It was at the same time as the collapse of a legislative program he had supported for years, the permanent departure of his best friend Joshua Speed from Springfield, and the proposal by John Stuart, Lincoln's law partner, to end their law practice.<ref name=Guelzo>Allen C. Guelzo, ''Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President,'' (1999) pg.&nbsp;97-98.</ref> Lincoln is believed to have suffered something approaching [[clinical depression]]. In ''Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years,'' [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]] has a chapter covering the period, which Lincoln later referred to as \"The Fatal First\", or January 1, 1841. That was \"the date on which Lincoln asked to be released from his engagement to Mary Todd\".<ref name=\"simon\"/> Simon explains that the various reasons given for the engagement being broken contradict one another. The incident was not fully documented, but Lincoln did become unusually depressed, which showed in his appearance, and Simon wrote that \"it was traceable to Mary Todd\".<ref name=\"simon\">Paul Simon, ''Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years''</ref> During this time, he avoided seeing Mary, causing her to comment that he \"deems me unworthy of notice\".<ref name=\"simon\"/>\n\n[[Jean H. Baker]], historian and biographer of Mary Todd Lincoln, describes the relationship between Lincoln and his wife as \"bound together by three strong bonds\u2014sex, parenting and politics\".<ref name=Baker>Jean H. Baker, \"Mary and Abraham: A Marriage\" in ''The Lincoln Enigma'', edited by Gabor Boritt, pgs. 49-55</ref> In addition to the anti\u2013Mary Todd bias of many historians, engendered by William Herndon's (Lincoln's law partner and early biographer) personal hatred of Mrs. Lincoln, Baker discounts historic criticism of the marriage. She says that contemporary historians have a basic misunderstanding of the changing nature of marriage and courtship in the mid-19th century, and attempt to judge the Lincoln marriage by modern standards.\n\nBaker notes that \"most observers of the Lincoln marriage have been impressed with their sexuality\". Some \"male historians\" suggest that the Lincolns' sex life ended either in 1853 after their son Tad's difficult birth or in 1856 when they moved into a bigger house, but have no evidence for their speculations. Baker writes that there are \"almost no gynecological conditions resulting from childbirth\" other than a [[Uterine prolapse|prolapsed uterus]] (which would have produced other noticeable effects on Mrs. Lincoln) that would have prevented intercourse, and in the 1850s, \"many middle-class couples slept in separate bedrooms\" as a matter of custom adopted from the English.<ref name=Baker/>\n\nFar from abstaining from sex, Baker suggests that the Lincolns were part of a new development in America of smaller families; the birth rate declined from seven births to a family in 1800 to around 4 per family by 1850. As Americans separated sexuality from child bearing, forms of birth control such as [[coitus interruptus]], long-term breast feeding, and crude forms of condoms and [[womb veil]]s, available through mail order, were available and used. The spacing of the Lincoln children (Robert in 1843, Eddie in 1846, Willie in 1850, and Tad in 1853) is consistent with some type of planning and would have required \"an intimacy about sexual relations that for aspiring couples meant shared companionate power over reproduction\".<ref>Baker pg.&nbsp;50. Baker relies on (page 286, footnote 36) Linda Gordon's ''Woman's Body, Woman's Right: A Social History of Birth Control'' (1976) and Janet Brodie's ''Contraception and Abortion in 19th Century America'' (1994).</ref>\n\nHerndon, Lincoln's law partner and biographer, attests to the depth of Lincoln's love for [[Ann Rutledge]].

Attention to the sexuality of public figures has been heightened since the gay rights movement of the later 20th century. In his 1926 biography of Lincoln, [[Carl Sandburg]] alluded to the early relationship of Lincoln and his friend [[Joshua Fry Speed]] as having \"a streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets\". \"Streak of [[Lavender (color)#Sexuality|lavender]]\" was slang in the period for an [[effeminate]] man, and later connoted homosexuality.<ref name=Pollock1935>A.

Lincoln, who had just moved to a new town when he met Speed, was also at least initially unable to afford his own bed and bedding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keneally|first1=Thomas|title=Abraham Lincoln: A Life|date=2002|publisher=Penguin|at=Chapter 4|isbn=978-0670031757}}</ref> A tabulation of historical sources shows that Lincoln slept in the same bed with at least 11 boys and men during his youth and adulthood.<ref name=Sotos2008>{{cite book|author=Sotos, JG|title=The Physical Lincoln Sourcebook|location=[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia|VA]]|publisher=Mt.

There are no known instances in which Lincoln tried to suppress knowledge or discussion of such arrangements, and in some conversations, raised the subject himself. Tripp discusses three men at length and possible sustained relationships: [[Joshua Fry Speed|Joshua Speed]], William Greene, and Charles Derickson. However, in 19th-century America, it was not necessarily uncommon for men to bunk-up with other men, briefly, if no other arrangement were available. For example, when other lawyers and judges travelled \"[[Riding circuit|the circuit]]\" with Lincoln, the lawyers often slept \"two in a bed and eight in a room\".<ref>Randall, Ruth Painter. Mary Lincoln: Biography of a Marriage. Boston: Little, Brown, 1953. pp 70-71.</ref> [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William H. Herndon]] recalled for example, \"I have slept with 20 men in the same room\".<ref name=\"DHD1948\">Donald, D.H. Lincoln's Herndon. New York: A.A. Knopf, 1948, pg.&nbsp;46</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century, most men were probably not conscious of any erotic possibility in bed-sharing, since it was in public. Speed's immediate, casual offer, and his later report of it, suggests that men's public bed sharing was not then often explicitly understood as conducive to forbidden sexual experiments.<ref name=Katz/> In such public arrangements, they would not be alone.\n\nNevertheless, Katz does indicate that such sleeping arrangements \"did provide an important site (probably the major site) of erotic opportunity\" if they could keep others from noticing. Katz notes that referring to present day concepts of \"homo, hetero, and bi distorts our present understanding of Lincoln and Speed's experiences.\"<ref name=Katz/> He notes that, rather than there being \"an unchanging essence of homosexuality and heterosexuality,\" people throughout history \"continually reconfigure their affectionate and erotic feelings and acts\".<ref name=Katz/> He suggests that the Lincoln-Speed relationship fell within the 19th-century category of intense, even romantic man-to-man friendships with erotic overtones that may have been \"a world apart in that era's consciousness from the sensual universe of mutual masturbation and the legal universe of 'sodomy,' 'buggery,' and 'the crime against nature'\".<ref name=Katz/>\n\nSome correspondence of the period, such as that between [[Thomas Jefferson Withers]] and [[James Henry Hammond]], may provide evidence of a sexual dimension to some secret same-sex bed sharing.<ref name=Duberman1826>Martin Duberman, \"Writhing Bedfellows: 1826 Two Young Men from Antebellum South Carolina's Ruling Elite Share 'Extravagant Delight{{'\"}}, in Salvatore Licata and Robert Petersen, eds., ''Historical Perspectives on Homosexuality'' (New York: Haworth Press & Stein & Day, 1981), pages 85-99.</ref> The fact that Lincoln was open about sharing a bed with Speed is seen by some historians as an indication that their relationship was not romantic.<ref>Donald, pg.&nbsp;38. In speaking of an incident when Lincoln openly referred to the four years he \"slept with Joshua\", Donald wrote, \"I simply cannot believe that, if the early relationship between Joshua Speed and Lincoln had been sexual, the President of the United States would so freely and publicly speak of it.\"</ref> None of Lincoln's enemies hinted at any homosexual implication.<ref>Donald, pg.&nbsp;36. Donald notes, \"Though nearly every other possible charge against Lincoln was raised during his long public career \u2013 from his alleged illegitimacy to his possible romance with Ann Rutledge, to the breakup of his engagement to Mary Todd, to some turbulent aspects of their marriage \u2013 no one ever suggested that he and Speed were sexual partners.\"</ref>\n\nJoshua Speed married Fanny Hennings on February 15, 1842. He and Lincoln seem to have consulted each other about married life. Despite having some political differences over [[slavery]]<ref>[http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/speed.htm Letter] from Lincoln to Speed in August 1855.</ref> they corresponded for the rest of their lives, and Lincoln appointed Joshua's brother, [[James Speed]], to his cabinet as [[Attorney General]].\n\n====Relationship with David Derickson====\nCaptain David Derickson of the [[150th Pennsylvania Infantry]] was Lincoln's bodyguard and companion between September 1862 and April 1863. They shared a bed during the absences of Lincoln's wife, until Derickson was promoted in 1863.<ref name=Trip>Tripp, C.A. : Intimate World, Ibid.</ref> Derickson was twice married and fathered ten children. Tripp recounts that, whatever the level of intimacy of the relationship, it was the subject of gossip. Elizabeth Woodbury Fox, the wife of Lincoln's naval aide, wrote in her diary for November 16, 1862, \"Tish says, 'Oh, there is a Bucktail soldier here devoted to the president, drives with him, and when Mrs. L. is not home, sleeps with him.' What stuff!\"<ref name=Tripp/> This sleeping arrangement was also noted by a fellow officer in Derickson's regiment, Thomas Chamberlin, in the book ''History of the One Hundred and Fiftieth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, Second Regiment, Bucktail Brigade''. Historian Martin P. Johnson notes that the strong similarity in style and content of the Fox and Chamberlin accounts suggests that, rather than being two independent accounts of the same events as Tripp claims, both were based on the same report from a single source.<ref name=Johnson>Martin P.

Lincoln was married to [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] from November 4, 1842, until his death on April 15, 1865, and fathered four children with her.\n\n==Historical scholarship and debate==\n===Marriage with Mary Todd Lincoln===\n[[Image:Mary Todd Lincoln.jpg |thumb|left|Mary Todd Lincoln in 1846]]\n\nLincoln and [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] met in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] in 1839 and became engaged in 1840.<ref>[http://marriage.about.com/od/presidentialmarriages/a/abelincoln.htm \"Abe Lincoln's Marriage\"], About.com</ref> In what historian Allen Guelzo calls \"one of the murkiest episodes in Lincoln's life\", Lincoln called off his engagement to Mary Todd. It was at the same time as the collapse of a legislative program he had supported for years, the permanent departure of his best friend Joshua Speed from Springfield, and the proposal by John Stuart, Lincoln's law partner, to end their law practice.<ref name=Guelzo>Allen C. Guelzo, ''Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President,'' (1999) pg.&nbsp;97-98.</ref> Lincoln is believed to have suffered something approaching [[clinical depression]]. In ''Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years,'' [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]] has a chapter covering the period, which Lincoln later referred to as \"The Fatal First\", or January 1, 1841. That was \"the date on which Lincoln asked to be released from his engagement to Mary Todd\".<ref name=\"simon\"/> Simon explains that the various reasons given for the engagement being broken contradict one another. The incident was not fully documented, but Lincoln did become unusually depressed, which showed in his appearance, and Simon wrote that \"it was traceable to Mary Todd\".<ref name=\"simon\">Paul Simon, ''Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years''</ref> During this time, he avoided seeing Mary, causing her to comment that he \"deems me unworthy of notice\".<ref name=\"simon\"/>\n\n[[Jean H. Baker]], historian and biographer of Mary Todd Lincoln, describes the relationship between Lincoln and his wife as \"bound together by three strong bonds\u2014sex, parenting and politics\".<ref name=Baker>Jean H. Baker, \"Mary and Abraham: A Marriage\" in ''The Lincoln Enigma'', edited by Gabor Boritt, pgs. 49-55</ref> In addition to the anti\u2013Mary Todd bias of many historians, engendered by William Herndon's (Lincoln's law partner and early biographer) personal hatred of Mrs. Lincoln, Baker discounts historic criticism of the marriage. She says that contemporary historians have a basic misunderstanding of the changing nature of marriage and courtship in the mid-19th century, and attempt to judge the Lincoln marriage by modern standards.\n\nBaker notes that \"most observers of the Lincoln marriage have been impressed with their sexuality\". Some \"male historians\" suggest that the Lincolns' sex life ended either in 1853 after their son Tad's difficult birth or in 1856 when they moved into a bigger house, but have no evidence for their speculations. Baker writes that there are \"almost no gynecological conditions resulting from childbirth\" other than a [[Uterine prolapse|prolapsed uterus]] (which would have produced other noticeable effects on Mrs. Lincoln) that would have prevented intercourse, and in the 1850s, \"many middle-class couples slept in separate bedrooms\" as a matter of custom adopted from the English.<ref name=Baker/>\n\nFar from abstaining from sex, Baker suggests that the Lincolns were part of a new development in America of smaller families; the birth rate declined from seven births to a family in 1800 to around 4 per family by 1850. As Americans separated sexuality from child bearing, forms of birth control such as [[coitus interruptus]], long-term breast feeding, and crude forms of condoms and [[womb veil]]s, available through mail order, were available and used. The spacing of the Lincoln children (Robert in 1843, Eddie in 1846, Willie in 1850, and Tad in 1853) is consistent with some type of planning and would have required \"an intimacy about sexual relations that for aspiring couples meant shared companionate power over reproduction\".<ref>Baker pg.&nbsp;50. Baker relies on (page 286, footnote 36) Linda Gordon's ''Woman's Body, Woman's Right: A Social History of Birth Control'' (1976) and Janet Brodie's ''Contraception and Abortion in 19th Century America'' (1994).</ref>\n\nHerndon, Lincoln's law partner and biographer, attests to the depth of Lincoln's love for [[Ann Rutledge]].

Attention to the sexuality of public figures has been heightened since the gay rights movement of the later 20th century. In his 1926 biography of Lincoln, [[Carl Sandburg]] alluded to the early relationship of Lincoln and his friend [[Joshua Fry Speed]] as having \"a streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets\". \"Streak of [[Lavender (color)#Sexuality|lavender]]\" was slang in the period for an [[effeminate]] man, and later connoted homosexuality.<ref name=Pollock1935>A.

Lincoln, who had just moved to a new town when he met Speed, was also at least initially unable to afford his own bed and bedding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keneally|first1=Thomas|title=Abraham Lincoln: A Life|date=2002|publisher=Penguin|at=Chapter 4|isbn=978-0670031757}}</ref> A tabulation of historical sources shows that Lincoln slept in the same bed with at least 11 boys and men during his youth and adulthood.<ref name=Sotos2008>{{cite book|author=Sotos, JG|title=The Physical Lincoln Sourcebook|location=[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia|VA]]|publisher=Mt.

There are no known instances in which Lincoln tried to suppress knowledge or discussion of such arrangements, and in some conversations, raised the subject himself. Tripp discusses three men at length and possible sustained relationships: [[Joshua Fry Speed|Joshua Speed]], William Greene, and Charles Derickson. However, in 19th-century America, it was not necessarily uncommon for men to bunk-up with other men, briefly, if no other arrangement were available. For example, when other lawyers and judges travelled \"[[Riding circuit|the circuit]]\" with Lincoln, the lawyers often slept \"two in a bed and eight in a room\".<ref>Randall, Ruth Painter. Mary Lincoln: Biography of a Marriage. Boston: Little, Brown, 1953. pp 70-71.</ref> [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William H. Herndon]] recalled for example, \"I have slept with 20 men in the same room\".<ref name=\"DHD1948\">Donald, D.H. Lincoln's Herndon. New York: A.A. Knopf, 1948, pg.&nbsp;46</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century, most men were probably not conscious of any erotic possibility in bed-sharing, since it was in public. Speed's immediate, casual offer, and his later report of it, suggests that men's public bed sharing was not then often explicitly understood as conducive to forbidden sexual experiments.<ref name=Katz/> In such public arrangements, they would not be alone.\n\nNevertheless, Katz does indicate that such sleeping arrangements \"did provide an important site (probably the major site) of erotic opportunity\" if they could keep others from noticing. Katz notes that referring to present day concepts of \"homo, hetero, and bi distorts our present understanding of Lincoln and Speed's experiences.\"<ref name=Katz/> He notes that, rather than there being \"an unchanging essence of homosexuality and heterosexuality,\" people throughout history \"continually reconfigure their affectionate and erotic feelings and acts\".<ref name=Katz/> He suggests that the Lincoln-Speed relationship fell within the 19th-century category of intense, even romantic man-to-man friendships with erotic overtones that may have been \"a world apart in that era's consciousness from the sensual universe of mutual masturbation and the legal universe of 'sodomy,' 'buggery,' and 'the crime against nature'\".<ref name=Katz/>\n\nSome correspondence of the period, such as that between [[Thomas Jefferson Withers]] and [[James Henry Hammond]], may provide evidence of a sexual dimension to some secret same-sex bed sharing.<ref name=Duberman1826>Martin Duberman, \"Writhing Bedfellows: 1826 Two Young Men from Antebellum South Carolina's Ruling Elite Share 'Extravagant Delight{{'\"}}, in Salvatore Licata and Robert Petersen, eds., ''Historical Perspectives on Homosexuality'' (New York: Haworth Press & Stein & Day, 1981), pages 85-99.</ref> The fact that Lincoln was open about sharing a bed with Speed is seen by some historians as an indication that their relationship was not romantic.<ref>Donald, pg.&nbsp;38. In speaking of an incident when Lincoln openly referred to the four years he \"slept with Joshua\", Donald wrote, \"I simply cannot believe that, if the early relationship between Joshua Speed and Lincoln had been sexual, the President of the United States would so freely and publicly speak of it.\"</ref> None of Lincoln's enemies hinted at any homosexual implication.<ref>Donald, pg.&nbsp;36. Donald notes, \"Though nearly every other possible charge against Lincoln was raised during his long public career \u2013 from his alleged illegitimacy to his possible romance with Ann Rutledge, to the breakup of his engagement to Mary Todd, to some turbulent aspects of their marriage \u2013 no one ever suggested that he and Speed were sexual partners.\"</ref>\n\nJoshua Speed married Fanny Hennings on February 15, 1842. He and Lincoln seem to have consulted each other about married life. Despite having some political differences over [[slavery]]<ref>[http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/speed.htm Letter] from Lincoln to Speed in August 1855.</ref> they corresponded for the rest of their lives, and Lincoln appointed Joshua's brother, [[James Speed]], to his cabinet as [[Attorney General]].\n\n====Relationship with David Derickson====\nCaptain David Derickson of the [[150th Pennsylvania Infantry]] was Lincoln's bodyguard and companion between September 1862 and April 1863. They shared a bed during the absences of Lincoln's wife, until Derickson was promoted in 1863.<ref name=Trip>Tripp, C.A. : Intimate World, Ibid.</ref> Derickson was twice married and fathered ten children. Tripp recounts that, whatever the level of intimacy of the relationship, it was the subject of gossip. Elizabeth Woodbury Fox, the wife of Lincoln's naval aide, wrote in her diary for November 16, 1862, \"Tish says, 'Oh, there is a Bucktail soldier here devoted to the president, drives with him, and when Mrs. L. is not home, sleeps with him.' What stuff!\"<ref name=Tripp/> This sleeping arrangement was also noted by a fellow officer in Derickson's regiment, Thomas Chamberlin, in the book ''History of the One Hundred and Fiftieth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, Second Regiment, Bucktail Brigade''. Historian Martin P. Johnson notes that the strong similarity in style and content of the Fox and Chamberlin accounts suggests that, rather than being two independent accounts of the same events as Tripp claims, both were based on the same report from a single source.<ref name=Johnson>Martin P.

In September 1903, within a group of 150 men, Aram Manukian tried to cross the Russian-Turkish border to transfer weaponry to the ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' in [[Sasun]]; however, he returned to Kars due to illness.{{sfn|Asryan|2005|p=42}}\n\n==Activities in Van==\nManukian settled in the city of [[Van, Turkey|Van]] in February 1905.{{sfn|Asryan|2005|p=42}} Because he spent most of his political career, except the last few years, in Van Aram became associated with the city and came to be known as \"Aram of Van\".<ref>{{cite book|first1=Hagop|last1=Arshagouni|first2=Marilyn|last2=Arshagouni|title=Armenian history timeline|year=1998|location=Los Angeles|publisher=Ararat Home|p=39|quote=In the fall of 1904, he went to Van, where he became Aram of Van.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mouradian|first=George|title=Armenian infotext|year=1995|publisher=Bookshelf Publishers|location=Southgate, Michigan|isbn=9780963450920|page=16}}</ref> He soon became the head of the local party branch and sought to strengthen its influence in Van.

In 1906 alone more weapons were transferred to Van than in the previous 15 years. Prior to the Young Turk Revolution, the party branch in Van had around a thousand members.{{sfn|Virabyan|2009|p=6}} He also sought to minimize the Ottoman government interference in internal Armenian matters.{{sfn|Virabyan|2009|p=6}} The ARF effectively established unofficial courts for Armenians, who were mistreated by the Turkish judiciary.{{sfn|Virabyan|2009|pp=6\u20137}} In 1907, during the ARF Congress in [[Vienna]], where he was the delegate from Van, Aram expressed skepticism about the declared goals of the Turkish emigre political movements in Europe that the ARF was cooperating with, particularly the [[Young Turks]]. He said that they are \"for the most part, palace revolutionaries who in one sense or another have dynastic interests.\" Manukian claimed that if they \"begin with them, we are going to encounter a great many problems.\"{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|p=40}} A year later the [[Young Turk Revolution|Young Turks ousted]] Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] from power and restored the constitution. Ottoman Armenians reacted positively to the overthrow of the sultan.\n\n[[File:Van 1915.png|thumb|left|235px|The ARF leaders in Van.

However, Manukian continued to work with local Ottoman officials and other Armenian parties, especially the [[Armenakan Party]], to improve the condition of the Armenians. He became the leader of the ARF in the Van region along with [[Nikoghayos Mikaelian|Ishkhan]] and [[Arshak Vramian]]. He took an active role in the Armenian community by teaching at schools, communicating with the press and promoting Armenian youth circles.{{sfn|Asryan|2005|p=43}}\n\nIn December 1912, Aram Manukian became a suspect in the murder of the mayor of Van, [[Bedros Kapamajian]], an Armenian loyalist to the Ottoman government.

In the spring of 1915 Van became the only location where Armenians organized a major [[Armenian resistance during the Armenian Genocide|resistance]]. Aram Manukian played a key role in this resistance,{{sfn|Asryan|2005|p=42}} widely seen as self-defence.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=209|ps=: \"Their five-week battle with the Turks was not a rebellion, but legitimate self-defence, a reaction to the terrorism of the government's representative, Djevdet, which he had directed against the entire Armenian community.\"}}\n\nIn late 1914, during the first months of the war, tensions in the [[Van Vilayet]] had been kept low by the cooperation of the Dashnak leaders Manukian, [[Ishkhan (fedayi)|Ishkhan]], Ottoman parliament deputy [[Arshak Vramian]] and local Young Turk officials and Van governor [[Tahsin Bey]], who was considered a moderate.{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|p=227}} In early August, a general mobilization took place, during which some problems arose that were solved by the cooperation of these parties. An important event occurred in September, when Cevdet, the radical brother-in-law of Minister of War [[Enver Pasha]], was appointed governor.{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|pp=228\u2013229}} According to [[Raymond K\u00e9vorkian]], Cevdet's appointment \"was probably calculated to make it easier to implement a policy of provocation.\"{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|p=231}} \"Several more or less serious incidents occurred in the vilayet of Van between December 1914 and March 1915. Each time, the Armenian leaders had to step in to pour oil on troubled waters.\"{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|p=229}} In Van city, local prominent Armenians, such as Aram Manukian (Sergei Hovhannisian, 1879-1919), one of the principal Dashnakist leaders there, sought to calm the public\u2014Armenian and Turk alike\u2014through negotiations with the governor.{{sfn|Payaslian|2007|p=130}}\n\n[[File:Van1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Armenian defense in Van]]\n\nClashes between Armenians and Turks in the Van Vilayet became more frequent in March and April 1915. In late March and early April, Cevdet, Aram Manukian, Vramian and other major figures met to discuss the tensions.{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|p=229}} In mid-April, an incident took place in [[\u00c7atak|Shatakh]]. On the night of 16 April, Ishkhan, who was assigned a mediator's role, was killed by a group of [[Circassians]] while staying in a Kurdish friend's house in a nearby village. According to K\u00e9vorkian, \"There is every reason to believe that none other than Cevdet, the superior of these \u00c7erkez [Circassians], had ordered these killings. He had probably come to the conclusion that he could accomplish nothing in a city with an Armenian majority unless he first got rid of the three Dashnak leaders. His behavior the following day tends to confirm this suspicion.\" The next morning, Cevdet invited both Aram and Vramian to his [[Konak (residence)|konak]]. Aram did not go upon Vramian's advice. Vramian was subsequently murdered in a location near [[Bitlis]]. \"The news shocked and dismayed the [Armenian] population. The American missionaries in Van, Dr. [[Clarence Ussher]] and Miss Grace Knapp, who were eyewitnesses to these events, provide us details that leave little doubt as to the vali's [Cevdet] intentions.\"{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|pp=232\u2013233}}\n\n[[File:Western Armenia September 1917.png|370px|thumb|The greatest extent of the [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|Russian occupation of Turkish Armenia]] during World War  I, September 1917. The area was reoccupied by the Turks between February and April 1918.]]\n\nOn 18 April, Cevdet demanded all Armenians turn in their arms. K\u00e9vorkian suggests, \n<blockquote>[Armenians] knew that they were doomed if they obeyed; yet, if they failed to, they would provide the vali with the pretext he needed to attack the city's Christian quarters and the rural areas. In other words, the Armenian leaders' strategy of temporization had become obsolete. The murder of Ishkhan on the night of 16 April and the arrest of Arshag Vramian \u2013 Van still did not know that he had been murdered \u2013 probably convinced the last Armenian leader left alive, Aram Manukian, to reject the authorities' injunctions and prepare the city for an attack that was now certain to come.{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|p=319}}</blockquote> \nWith Ishkhan and Vramian assassinated, Manukian remained only major Armenian leader in Van. Turkish forces attacked Aygestan, the old city of Van with a mixed Armenian-Turkish population, on 20 April. Aram \"had already made preparations to ward off an attack and was able to prevent the Turkish troops from entering the quarter.\" In the following days, around 15,000 Armenian villagers poured into the old city quarter.{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|p=234}}\n\nWith the Russian-Armenian forces reaching Van, the Muslim population and Ottoman forces began to evacuate Van on 14 May, with the last troops leaving on 16 May after burning down their barracks.

On the night of 16 April, Ishkhan, who was assigned a mediator's role, was killed by a group of [[Circassians]] while staying in a Kurdish friend's house in a nearby village. According to K\u00e9vorkian, \"There is every reason to believe that none other than Cevdet, the superior of these \u00c7erkez [Circassians], had ordered these killings. He had probably come to the conclusion that he could accomplish nothing in a city with an Armenian majority unless he first got rid of the three Dashnak leaders. His behavior the following day tends to confirm this suspicion.\" The next morning, Cevdet invited both Aram and Vramian to his [[Konak (residence)|konak]]. Aram did not go upon Vramian's advice. Vramian was subsequently murdered in a location near [[Bitlis]]. \"The news shocked and dismayed the [Armenian] population.

K\u00e9vorkian suggests, \n<blockquote>[Armenians] knew that they were doomed if they obeyed; yet, if they failed to, they would provide the vali with the pretext he needed to attack the city's Christian quarters and the rural areas. In other words, the Armenian leaders' strategy of temporization had become obsolete. The murder of Ishkhan on the night of 16 April and the arrest of Arshag Vramian \u2013 Van still did not know that he had been murdered \u2013 probably convinced the last Armenian leader left alive, Aram Manukian, to reject the authorities' injunctions and prepare the city for an attack that was now certain to come.{{sfn|K\u00e9vorkian|2011|p=319}}</blockquote> \nWith Ishkhan and Vramian assassinated, Manukian remained only major Armenian leader in Van. Turkish forces attacked Aygestan, the old city of Van with a mixed Armenian-Turkish population, on 20 April.

The word 'Tara' is derived from the Sanskrit root 't\u1e5b', meaning to cross.<ref>David Gordon White ''The Alchemical Body: Siddha Traditions in Medieval India'', (Kindle Locations 1613\u20131615). University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition. \"This coastal location reminds us of what may have been T\u0101r\u0101\u2019s original role: she was a goddess of navigation, of sea crossings\u2014 t\u0101r\u0101 is generated from the verb t\u1e5b, to cross over the sea.\"</ref> In many other contemporary Indian languages, the word 'tara' also means star.\n\n==Origin==\nAccording to the [[Adbhuta Ramayana]], when [[Sita]] in the form of [[Kali]] slew the demon [[Ravana]], [[Brahma]] and other deities propitiated her with hymns. Appeased, the goddess assumed the calmer form of Tara. Holding her sword in her right hand, she accepted a tiger skin loincloth from Brahma, removed her golden crown, piled her hair into a single [[dreadlock|jata]] atop her head and bound it with the serpent [[Akshobhya]]. [[Shiva|Rudra]] laid on the ground and requested the boon of Brahmavidya (knowledge) from her, to which she responded by placing her left foot on his chest and enlightening him. As thanks, Shiva offered Her a [[Nymphaea nouchali|blue lotus]] and a skull cup.\n\nA variant version speaks of Tara's demon-slaying form; a [[Asura|demon]] called Hayagriva wrought havoc everywhere, banishing the [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s from [[Amaravati]] and robbing them of their possessions. The devas approached Brahma, who in turn lead them to Kali. Kali created another goddess, Tara, from her third eye and sent her to defeat Hayagriva. In the ensuing battle, Tara slew Hayagriva.\n\nA version from the [[Kalika Purana]] associates Tara with [[Matangi]]. According to this version, when the devas were defeated by the demons [[Sumbha and Nisumbha]], they sought refuge in the Himalayas and began to propitiate Devi. At that time, Shiva's wife (in her dark-skinned form, Matangi) saw the devas and asked whom they were propitiating. Before the devas could answer, the fair-complexioned [[Mahasaraswati]] emerged from Matangi's body and replied that the devas were propitiating her. Since Mahasaraswati manifested from Matangi's body, the fair-complexioned, eight-armed goddess came to be known as [[Kaushiki]] (meaning \"sheath\"). In turn, Matangi's dark complexion caused her to be known as [[Kali]] and Ugratara. \n\nAnother non-popular version is when the firm landmass on Earth was created using fragments of Madhu and Kaitabh's bodies, that did not cause the birth of life because there was nothing other than water and firm landmass on Earth. Hence, creation was still incomplete. After water and Earth, the Sun was required to provide life force. To create the same, Mahashakti had taken the form of Tara and Mahadev had taken the form of Lord dakhineshar. He and Goddess Tara were the reasons they had brought the sun into existence. Without the eternal sun, the Earth was just a mere orb covered in ice on which life could not have survived. That is why Devi Tara had appeared from whom the sun had to arise and supply light and energy to Earth. Tara has the capability to produce light, energy and heat. When the power met with the power of Akshobhya, their combined power became the source of the sun. When the combined powers of Lord Akshobhya and Devi Tara got integrated in the sea, many pulsating energy orbs were created, in which it led to the expansion of energy. Goddess Tara created a tremendous air flow from her breath which hit the energy bodies and led to their union.\n\nThen the increasing source of energy inside the water started assuming the appearance of the eternal sun. Thus, the eternal sun appeared by the combined powers of Goddess Tara and Lord Akshobhya. Surya pays his thanks to Akshobhya and Taradevi for giving birth to him. Tara tells him that he has been born to give his life-giving sun rays to the world and give life to all beings. She requests Lord Surya to stay at his place and provide heat, light and life sustaining energy to the Earth. He will lead to the creation of day and night and will lead to the circle of seasons on Earth. She advises him to leave and carry out his duties of giving life to everyone. Lord Surya assured both that he will fulfill his purpose as given by them both to keep balance in the universe according to the laws of nature and not go against any law as he knows from the knowledge that they both have implanted inside him, which may put the universe in a catastrophe.\n\nNext, Tara had assumed the form of Goddess Shodashi to provide all forms of greenery and plants to the world. Devi Shodashi then placed a bamboo inside the earth and poured one drop of water from her waterpot, this gave birth to all plant life and then all forests, trees, plants and nature grew.\n\n==Iconography==\n[[Kali]] and Tara are similar in appearance. They both are described as standing upon a supine [[Shiva]] in an inert or corpse-like form. However, while Kali is described as black, Tara is described as blue. Both wear minimal clothing, however Tara wears a tiger-skin skirt, while Kali wears only a girdle of severed human arms. Both wear a [[Mundamala|garland of severed human heads]]. Both have a lolling tongue, and blood oozes from their mouths. Their appearances are so strikingly similar that it is easy to mistake one for the other. Tara is shown standing in '''Pratyalidha posture''' (in which the left foot is forward). Her [[Bhairava]] (consort) is [[Akshobhya]], a [[Bodhisattva]] who is in the form of a cobra coiled around Tara's matted hair. She wears a crown made of skulls of five meditating [[Buddhas]]. Tara has eight forms called Ashta Tara and the names are [[Ekajata]], Ugratara, Mahogra, Kameshwari, [[Chamunda]], [[Neela Saraswati]], Vajra, and [[Bhadrakali]]. Tara is said to be more approachable to the devotee (Bhakta) or [[Tantra|Tantrika]] because of her maternal instincts.\n\nLike Kali, furthermore, Tara in her Hindu context enjoys blood. In her hymn of a hundred names from the Mundamala-tantra, she is called \"She Who Likes Blood\", \"She Who Is Smeared with Blood\" and \"She Who Enjoys Blood Sacrifice\".\n\nTara can be distinguished visually from Kali primarily via her implements. Four armed, she carries a sacrificial [[sword]], a severed head or skull cup, a [[Nymphaea nouchali|blue lotus]] and a [[flaying knife]]. Kali never holds a lotus or a flaying knife.\n\n==Tarapith temple==\n{{Main|Tarapith}}\n[[File:Maa_Tara_Temple.jpg|thumb|Maa Tara Temple]]\nThe [[murti]] at the Tara Ma [[mandir]] in the village of [[Tarapith]], a highly important Tantric site for Bengali [[Shaktas]] (and highly contested as to whether or not it is truly a [[Shakti Peeth|Shakti Pitha]]; scholarly evidence points towards yes), is mostly covered by Garlands of flowers. Some people believe that eyeball of Sati fell here thus this pith is called tara pith because Bengali people named eyeball as chokher moni and another name of moni is chokher tara. There are two Tara images in the sanctum. The stone image of Tara depicted as a mother suckling Shiva \u2013 the \"primordial image\" (seen in the inset of the fierce form of the image of Tara) is camouflaged by a three feet metal image, that the devotee normally sees. It represents Tara in her fiery form with four arms, wearing a [[garland of skulls]] and a protruding tongue. Crowned with a silver crown and with flowing hair, the outer image wrapped in a ''[[sari]]'' and decked in marigold garlands with a silver umbrella over its head. The forehead of the metal image is adorned with red [[Sindur]] (vermilion). Most devotees will not have a chance to see the actual stone image, as there are only 15 or so minutes of [[Dar\u015bana|Darshan]] or viewing of the stone at 4:30&nbsp;am when the temple opens and only the first lucky few will be admitted into the adytum (the [[Garbhagriha]]) to see the stone.\n[[File:WLA lacma Buddhist Goddess Shyama Tara.jpg|thumb|Goddess Tara, Bihar c. 9th century.]]\nUnlike most Indian villages and towns, the [[smashan]] or cremation ground is not situated on the periphery of the village. As cremation grounds are seen to be polluting, most Indian smashans are located far from the center of town. Both the Tarapith mandir and smashan are very close (within 100 yards or so) to the center of the town and near [[Dwarka River]]. It is said that Tara Ma's footprints are preserved in the smashan; this is a common theme in Hinduism, where deities or their especially holy followers are said to leave their footprints in rocks. Many [[Sadhus]] and Tantrikas live in the smashan, some with permanent huts as residences. The smashan is filled with dogs, traditionally polluting animals who were said to share food with the [[Vamamarga]] saint [[Bamakhepa]], whose [[Sam\u0101dhi#Samadhi as mausoleum|sam\u0101dhi]] or tomb is located next door to the main Tarapith temple.\n\n==Tara in Buddhism==\n'''Tara''' ({{lang-sa|\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e}}) in [[Buddhism]], is a female [[Bodhisattva]] in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism who appears as a female [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. She is known as the \"mother of liberation\", and represents the virtues of success in work and achievements.\n\nSome researchers believe [[Paranasabari]] is another name for [[Hindu]] Goddess Tara.<ref name=a>{{cite book|title=Reflections on the Tantras|publisher=S\u0304udhakar Chattopadhyaya|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmaewdodLZQC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=Paranasabari&source=bl&ots=BLE3Jqwsrs&sig=_X5dWvMO_9HczMVRdxyuLQb6Vjs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2WkKT6rXOs7KrAen4OjbDw&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Paranasabari&f=false}}</ref><ref name=c>{{cite book|title=The social function of art by Radhakamal Mukerjee|year=1954|publisher=Philosophical Library|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vh4sAQAAIAAJ&q=paranasavari&dq=paranasavari&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k3MKT6D_JYfZrQfWgcXWDw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hinduism}}\n*Adoption into other religions and cultures\n**[[Tara (Buddhism)]]\n**[[Tala (goddess)]], adoption into Filipino faith\n\n*Related\n**[[Bamakhepa]]\n**[[Golden Tara]], Hindu deity's statue discovered in Philippines\n**[[Maa Taratarini Temple]]\n**[[Maa Tarini]]\n**[[Maa Ugra Tara]]\n**[[Shaktism]]\n**[[Tarapith]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Banerjee |first=Sumanta |authorlink= |author2= |title= Logic in a Popular Form: Essays on Popular Religion in Bengal|year=2002 |publisher=[[Seagull Books]] |location= |isbn= 81-7046-162-6 }}\n*{{Cite book |last= Kinsley | first=David R. |authorlink= |author2= |title= Hindu Goddesses:Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzldwMHeS6IC&dq=%22hindu+goddesses%22+kinsley&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 |year=1988 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-520-06339-2 }}\n*{{Cite book | last= Kinsley | first=David R. | title= Tantric Visions of the Divine Feminine: The Ten Mah\u0101vidy\u0101s | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMW8WTrotKsC&pg=PP1&dq=Tantric+Visions+of+the+Divine+Feminine | year=1997 | publisher= [[Motilal Banarsidass]] | location= New Delhi | isbn= 978-0-520-20499-7 }}\n*{{Cite book |last= MacDaniel |first=June |authorlink= |author2= |title= Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions |year=2004 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-516790-2 }}\n*{{Cite book |last= MacDaniel |first=June |authorlink= |author2= |title= The Madness of the Saints: Ecstatic Religion in Bengal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZxE__t1rlEC&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 |year=1989 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location= |isbn=0-226-55723-5 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Shankaranarayanan |first=Sri |authorlink= |author2= |title=The Ten Great Cosmic Powers |year=1972 |publisher=Dipti Publications |location= |isbn= 81-85208-38-7 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Svoboda |first=Robert E |authorlink= |author2= |title=Aghora: at the Left Hand of God |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-914732-21-8 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Svoboda |first=Robert E |authorlink= |author2= |title=Aghora II: Kundalini |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-914732-31-5 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Svoboda |first=Robert E |authorlink= |author2= |title=Aghora III: The Law of Karma |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-914732-37-4 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Tara (mahavidya)}} \n* [http://tarapith.com/ Official Tarapith Website]\n* [http://www.om-guru.com/html/saints/vama.html A Short Biography of Vamaksepa]\n\n{{Mahavidya}}\n{{Hindu Deities and Texts}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu goddesses]]\n[[Category:Forms of Parvati]]\n[[Category:Mahavidyas]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Hindu goddess, a form of Durga or Parvati}}\n{{about|the Hindu goddess|the Buddhist bodhisattva|Tara (Buddhism)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2017}} \n{{Infobox deity<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Hindu mythology-->\n| type        = Hindu\n| image       = The Hindu Goddess Ugratara (Violent Tara) LACMA M.81.206.8.jpg\n| caption     = Tara in a form of Ugra-Tara (Violent Tara). \n| name        = Tara\n| Devanagari  = \u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\n| Sanskrit_transliteration = T\u0101r\u0101\n| planet      = [[Jupiter]] \n| affiliation = [[Parvati]], [[Mahavidyas]], [[Devi]], [[Parvati|Shivasakthi]]\n| consort     =  [[Shiva|Tarakeshwarnath]] ( [[Shiva]])\n| god_of      = Goddess of Protection\n| abode       =  Cremation grounds\n| weapon      = Khadga, flaying knife \n|member_of=The Ten [[Mahavidyas]]}}\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], the [[Hindu goddess|goddess]] '''Tara''' ({{lang-sa|\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e}}, {{IAST|t\u0101r\u0101}}) is the second of the Dasa (ten) [[Mahavidyas]] or \"''Great Wisdom goddesses''\", and is a form of [[Shakti]], the [[Tantra|tantric]] manifestations of the goddess.

Kindle Edition. \"This coastal location reminds us of what may have been T\u0101r\u0101\u2019s original role: she was a goddess of navigation, of sea crossings\u2014 t\u0101r\u0101 is generated from the verb t\u1e5b, to cross over the sea.\"</ref> In many other contemporary Indian languages, the word 'tara' also means star.\n\n==Origin==\nAccording to the [[Adbhuta Ramayana]], when [[Sita]] in the form of [[Kali]] slew the demon [[Ravana]], [[Brahma]] and other deities propitiated her with hymns. Appeased, the goddess assumed the calmer form of Tara. Holding her sword in her right hand, she accepted a tiger skin loincloth from Brahma, removed her golden crown, piled her hair into a single [[dreadlock|jata]] atop her head and bound it with the serpent [[Akshobhya]]. [[Shiva|Rudra]] laid on the ground and requested the boon of Brahmavidya (knowledge) from her, to which she responded by placing her left foot on his chest and enlightening him. As thanks, Shiva offered Her a [[Nymphaea nouchali|blue lotus]] and a skull cup.\n\nA variant version speaks of Tara's demon-slaying form; a [[Asura|demon]] called Hayagriva wrought havoc everywhere, banishing the [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s from [[Amaravati]] and robbing them of their possessions. The devas approached Brahma, who in turn lead them to Kali. Kali created another goddess, Tara, from her third eye and sent her to defeat Hayagriva. In the ensuing battle, Tara slew Hayagriva.\n\nA version from the [[Kalika Purana]] associates Tara with [[Matangi]]. According to this version, when the devas were defeated by the demons [[Sumbha and Nisumbha]], they sought refuge in the Himalayas and began to propitiate Devi. At that time, Shiva's wife (in her dark-skinned form, Matangi) saw the devas and asked whom they were propitiating. Before the devas could answer, the fair-complexioned [[Mahasaraswati]] emerged from Matangi's body and replied that the devas were propitiating her. Since Mahasaraswati manifested from Matangi's body, the fair-complexioned, eight-armed goddess came to be known as [[Kaushiki]] (meaning \"sheath\"). In turn, Matangi's dark complexion caused her to be known as [[Kali]] and Ugratara. \n\nAnother non-popular version is when the firm landmass on Earth was created using fragments of Madhu and Kaitabh's bodies, that did not cause the birth of life because there was nothing other than water and firm landmass on Earth. Hence, creation was still incomplete. After water and Earth, the Sun was required to provide life force. To create the same, Mahashakti had taken the form of Tara and Mahadev had taken the form of Lord dakhineshar He and Goddess Tara were the reasons they had brought the sun into existence. Without the eternal sun, the Earth was just a mere orb covered in ice on which life could not have survived. That is why Devi Tara had appeared from whom the sun had to arise and supply light and energy to Earth. Tara has the capability to produce light, energy and heat. When the power met with the power of Akshobhya, their combined power became the source of the sun. When the combined powers of Lord Akshohya and Devi Tara got integrated in the sea, many pulsating energy orbs were created, in which it led to the expansion of energy. Goddess Tara created a tremendous air flow from her breath which hit the energy bodies and led to their union.\n\nThen the increasing source of energy inside the water started assuming the appearance of the eternal sun. Thus, the eternal sun appeared by the combined powers of Goddess Tara and Lord Akshobhya. Surya pays his thanks to Akshobhya and Taradevi for giving birth to him. Tara tells him that he has been born to give his life-giving sun rays to the world and give life to all beings. She requests Lord Surya to stay at his place and provide heat, light and life sustaining energy to the Earth. He will lead to the creation of day and night and will lead to the circle of seasons on Earth. She advises him to leave and carry out his duties of giving life to everyone. Lord Surya assured both that he will fulfill his purpose as given by them both to keep balance in the universe according to the laws of nature and not go against any law as he knows from the knowledge that they both have implanted inside him, which may put the universe in a catastrophe.\n\nNext, Tara had assumed the form of Goddess Shodashi to provide all forms of greenery and plants to the world. Devi Shodashi then placed a bamboo inside the earth and poured one drop of water from her waterpot, this gave birth to all plant life and then all forests, trees, plants and nature grew.\n\n==Iconography==\n[[Kali]] and Tara are similar in appearance. They both are described as standing upon a supine [[Shiva]] in an inert or corpse-like form. However, while Kali is described as black, Tara is described as blue. Both wear minimal clothing, however Tara wears a tiger-skin skirt, while Kali wears only a girdle of severed human arms. Both wear a [[Mundamala|garland of severed human heads]]. Both have a lolling tongue, and blood oozes from their mouths. Their appearances are so strikingly similar that it is easy to mistake one for the other. Tara is shown standing in '''Pratyalidha posture''' (in which the left foot is forward). Her [[Bhairava]] (consort) is [[Akshobhya]], a [[Bodhisattva]] who is in the form of a cobra coiled around Tara's matted hair. She wears a crown made of skulls of five meditating [[Buddhas]]. Tara has eight forms called Ashta Tara and the names are [[Ekajata]], Ugratara, Mahogra, Kameshwari, [[Chamunda]], [[Neela Saraswati]], Vajra, and [[Bhadrakali]]. Tara is said to be more approachable to the devotee (Bhakta) or [[Tantra|Tantrika]] because of her maternal instincts.\n\nLike Kali, furthermore, Tara in her Hindu context enjoys blood. In her hymn of a hundred names from the Mundamala-tantra, she is called \"She Who Likes Blood\", \"She Who Is Smeared with Blood\" and \"She Who Enjoys Blood Sacrifice\".\n\nTara can be distinguished visually from Kali primarily via her implements. Four armed, she carries a sacrificial [[sword]], a severed head or skull cup, a [[Nymphaea nouchali|blue lotus]] and a [[flaying knife]]. Kali never holds a lotus or a flaying knife.\n\n==Tarapith temple==\n{{Main|Tarapith}}\n[[File:Maa_Tara_Temple.jpg|thumb|Maa Tara Temple]]\nThe [[murti]] at the Tara Ma [[mandir]] in the village of [[Tarapith]], a highly important Tantric site for Bengali [[Shaktas]] (and highly contested as to whether or not it is truly a [[Shakti Peeth|Shakti Pitha]]; scholarly evidence points towards yes), is mostly covered by Garlands of flowers. Some people believe that eyeball of Sati fell here thus this pith is called tara pith because Bengali people named eyeball as chokher moni and another name of moni is chokher tara. There are two Tara images in the sanctum. The stone image of Tara depicted as a mother suckling Shiva \u2013 the \"primordial image\" (seen in the inset of the fierce form of the image of Tara) is camouflaged by a three feet metal image, that the devotee normally sees. It represents Tara in her fiery form with four arms, wearing a [[garland of skulls]] and a protruding tongue. Crowned with a silver crown and with flowing hair, the outer image wrapped in a ''[[sari]]'' and decked in marigold garlands with a silver umbrella over its head. The forehead of the metal image is adorned with red [[Sindur]] (vermilion). Most devotees will not have a chance to see the actual stone image, as there are only 15 or so minutes of [[Dar\u015bana|Darshan]] or viewing of the stone at 4:30&nbsp;am when the temple opens and only the first lucky few will be admitted into the adytum (the [[Garbhagriha]]) to see the stone.\n[[File:WLA lacma Buddhist Goddess Shyama Tara.jpg|thumb|Goddess Tara, Bihar c. 9th century.]]\nUnlike most Indian villages and towns, the [[smashan]] or cremation ground is not situated on the periphery of the village. As cremation grounds are seen to be polluting, most Indian smashans are located far from the center of town. Both the Tarapith mandir and smashan are very close (within 100 yards or so) to the center of the town and near [[Dwarka River]]. It is said that Tara Ma's footprints are preserved in the smashan; this is a common theme in Hinduism, where deities or their especially holy followers are said to leave their footprints in rocks. Many [[Sadhus]] and Tantrikas live in the smashan, some with permanent huts as residences. The smashan is filled with dogs, traditionally polluting animals who were said to share food with the [[Vamamarga]] saint [[Bamakhepa]], whose [[Sam\u0101dhi#Samadhi as mausoleum|sam\u0101dhi]] or tomb is located next door to the main Tarapith temple.\n\n==Tara in Buddhism==\n'''Tara''' ({{lang-sa|\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e}}) in [[Buddhism]], is a female [[Bodhisattva]] in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism who appears as a female [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. She is known as the \"mother of liberation\", and represents the virtues of success in work and achievements.\n\nSome researchers believe [[Paranasabari]] is another name for [[Hindu]] Goddess Tara.<ref name=a>{{cite book|title=Reflections on the Tantras|publisher=S\u0304udhakar Chattopadhyaya|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmaewdodLZQC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=Paranasabari&source=bl&ots=BLE3Jqwsrs&sig=_X5dWvMO_9HczMVRdxyuLQb6Vjs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2WkKT6rXOs7KrAen4OjbDw&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Paranasabari&f=false}}</ref><ref name=c>{{cite book|title=The social function of art by Radhakamal Mukerjee|year=1954|publisher=Philosophical Library|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vh4sAQAAIAAJ&q=paranasavari&dq=paranasavari&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k3MKT6D_JYfZrQfWgcXWDw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hinduism}}\n*Adoption into other religions and cultures\n**[[Tara (Buddhism)]]\n**[[Tala (goddess)]], adoption into Filipino faith\n\n*Related\n**[[Bamakhepa]]\n**[[Golden Tara]], Hindu deity's statue discovered in Philippines\n**[[Maa Taratarini Temple]]\n**[[Maa Tarini]]\n**[[Maa Ugra Tara]]\n**[[Shaktism]]\n**[[Tarapith]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Banerjee |first=Sumanta |authorlink= |author2= |title= Logic in a Popular Form: Essays on Popular Religion in Bengal|year=2002 |publisher=[[Seagull Books]] |location= |isbn= 81-7046-162-6 }}\n*{{Cite book |last= Kinsley | first=David R. |authorlink= |author2= |title= Hindu Goddesses:Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzldwMHeS6IC&dq=%22hindu+goddesses%22+kinsley&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 |year=1988 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-520-06339-2 }}\n*{{Cite book | last= Kinsley | first=David R. | title= Tantric Visions of the Divine Feminine: The Ten Mah\u0101vidy\u0101s | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMW8WTrotKsC&pg=PP1&dq=Tantric+Visions+of+the+Divine+Feminine | year=1997 | publisher= [[Motilal Banarsidass]] | location= New Delhi | isbn= 978-0-520-20499-7 }}\n*{{Cite book |last= MacDaniel |first=June |authorlink= |author2= |title= Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions |year=2004 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-516790-2 }}\n*{{Cite book |last= MacDaniel |first=June |authorlink= |author2= |title= The Madness of the Saints: Ecstatic Religion in Bengal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZxE__t1rlEC&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 |year=1989 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location= |isbn=0-226-55723-5 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Shankaranarayanan |first=Sri |authorlink= |author2= |title=The Ten Great Cosmic Powers |year=1972 |publisher=Dipti Publications |location= |isbn= 81-85208-38-7 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Svoboda |first=Robert E |authorlink= |author2= |title=Aghora: at the Left Hand of God |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-914732-21-8 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Svoboda |first=Robert E |authorlink= |author2= |title=Aghora II: Kundalini |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-914732-31-5 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Svoboda |first=Robert E |authorlink= |author2= |title=Aghora III: The Law of Karma |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-914732-37-4 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Tara (mahavidya)}} \n* [http://tarapith.com/ Official Tarapith Website]\n* [http://www.om-guru.com/html/saints/vama.html A Short Biography of Vamaksepa]\n\n{{Mahavidya}}\n{{Hindu Deities and Texts}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu goddesses]]\n[[Category:Forms of Parvati]]\n[[Category:Mahavidyas]]\n", "name_user": "InfographicsProvider1", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling mistake and grammatical error corrected", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_(Devi)"}

Following his first commercial video game release, ''[[ZZT]]'' (1991), the company became '''Epic MegaGames, Inc.''' in early 1992 and brought on [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who is the company's [[vice president]] to date. Moving their headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio's name was simplified to Epic Games.\n\nEpic Games develops the [[Unreal Engine]], a commercially available [[game engine]] which also powers their internally developed video games, such as ''[[Fortnite]]'' and the ''[[Unreal (video game series)|Unreal]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'' and ''[[Infinity Blade]]'' series.

The company was founded by [[Tim Sweeney (game developer)|Tim Sweeney]] as '''Potomac Computer Systems''' in 1991, originally located in his parents' house in [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]], [[Maryland]]. Following his first commercial video game release, ''[[ZZT]]'' (1991), the company became '''Epic MegaGames, Inc.''' in early 1992 and brought on [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who is the company's [[vice president]] to date. Moving their headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio's name was simplified to Epic Games.\n\nEpic Games develops the [[Unreal Engine]], a commercially available [[game engine]] which also powers their internally developed video games, such as ''[[Fortnite]]'' and the ''[[Unreal (video game series)|Unreal]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'' and ''[[Infinity Blade]]'' series. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the \"most successful videogame engine\" by [[Guinness World Records]].<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |title=Most successful videogame engine |website=[[Guinness World Records]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151655/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-game-engine |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEpic Games owns video game developers [[Chair Entertainment]] and [[Psyonix]], as well as cloud-based software developer [[Cloudgine]], and operates eponymous sub-studios in [[Seattle]], [[England]], [[Berlin]], [[Yokohama]] and [[Seoul]]. While Sweeney remains the majority shareholder, [[Tencent]] acquired a 48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic towards a [[games as a service]] model. Following the release of the popular ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in 2017, the company gained additional investments that enabled to expand its Unreal Engine offerings, establish [[esport]] events around ''Fortnite'', and launch the [[Epic Games Store]]. As of 2018, the company has an estimated {{USD|15 billion}} valuation.\n\n== History ==\n=== Potomac Computer Systems (1991\u20131992) ===\nPotomac Computer Systems was founded by [[Tim Sweeney (game developer)|Tim Sweeney]] in 1991.<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web |url=https://gamasutra.com/view/feature/132426/from_the_past_to_the_future_tim_.php |title=From The Past To The Future: Tim Sweeney Talks |last=Edwards |first=Benj |date=May 25, 2009 |website=[[Gamasutra]] |access-date=June 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204115638/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132426/from_the_past_to_the_future_tim_.php |archive-date=February 4, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> At the time, Sweeney was studying [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Maryland]].

Many of the characters possess supernatural abilities gained by eating so-called \"Devil Fruits\". The series' storyline follows the adventures of a group of pirates as they search for the \"One Piece\" treasure. \n\n[[#Luffy|Monkey D.

The series takes place in a fictional universe where vast numbers of pirates, soldiers, revolutionaries, and other adventurers fight each other, using various [[superhuman]] and [[supernatural]] abilities. The majority of the characters are human, but the cast also includes [[giant]]s, [[Merman|mermen]] and [[mermaid]]s, [[List of piscine and amphibian humanoids|Fishmen]]{{efn|Fishmen are humanoids in ''One Piece'' whose upper body resembles that of sea creatures.

Many of the characters possess supernatural abilities gained by eating so-called \"Devil Fruits\". The series' storyline follows the adventures of a group of pirates as they search for the \"One Piece\" treasure. \n\n[[#Luffy|Monkey D. Luffy]] is the series' main protagonist, a young pirate who wishes to succeed [[#Roger|Gol D. Roger]], the deceased King of the Pirates, by finding his treasure, the \"One Piece\".

He created several versions of Morgan before settling on the final design. After an editor told him that Morgan, in Oda's words, \"looked lame\", he changed the design to its final style.{{gnr|vol|1|:p. 144 (en)}}\n\n==Straw Hat Pirates==\n[[File:Strawhat crew jolly roger.svg|thumb|Jolly roger of the Straw Hat Pirates]]\nThe protagonists <!-- There is more than one protagonist in the series, so please don't change to main characters without first discussing it on the talk page. --> of the ''One Piece'' series are all the members of the {{nihongo|Straw Hat Pirates|\u9ea6\u308f\u3089\u306e\u4e00\u5473|Mugiwara no Ichimi}}, a crew of ten pirates captained by Monkey D.

Once Usopp joins the Straw Hat Pirates, they gain their own ship, the ''Going Merry'', which is later destroyed and replaced by a larger and more powerful vessel, the ''Thousand Sunny'' created by their shipwright Franky. Two years later, the Straw Hats gain a new fleet, called the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of 5,640 pirates from seven different crews; Luffy objects to the idea of being a fleet commander, and organizes his new army in a way that they may act independently, but when one crew is in trouble, the others must do what they can to help them.\n\n===<span id=\"Luffy\"></span>Monkey D.

He also states that \"Colleen Clinkenbeard's Luffy is more a generic spunky kid than a personality in his own right, really coming to life only during the action scenes during which she does a fine job of being darned cool.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/one-piece-the-desert-princess-and-the-pirates-movie-no-8/dvd|first=Carl|last=Kimlinger|date=February 18, 2008|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|title=One Piece: The Desert Princess and the Pirates (Movie No. 8)|accessdate=March 31, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329022330/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/one-piece-the-desert-princess-and-the-pirates-movie-no-8/dvd|archive-date=March 29, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDustin Somner of ''Blu-ray.com'' comments that the Japanese and Funimation voice-acting is \"fairly good, but not exceptional\" and sometimes \"overly zany\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?id=1281&show=review|title=One Piece Movie 8 Blu-ray Review|first=Dustin|last=Somner|date=March 1, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2009|publisher=Blu-ray.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418163301/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?id=1281&show=review|archive-date=April 18, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk notes \"the daunting cast of characters, both good and bad\" as \"one of the appealing factors\" of the anime, but also comments that \"Some of the voices [of the 4Kids dub] were pretty irritating ... with a lot of high-pitches and over exaggerated speech.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/21195/one-piece-vol-2|title=One Piece Vol 2|last=Douglass|first=Todd, Jr.|date=April 16, 2006|accessdate=April 26, 2009|publisher=[[DVD talk]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504034515/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/21195/one-piece-vol-2/|archive-date=May 4, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Brigitte Sch\u00f6nhense of Splashcomics comments that the \"brilliant\" ({{lang-de|\"genial\"}}) flashbacks into the characters' pasts make them so \"likeable and lovable\" (German: ''\"sympathisch und liebenswert\"'') and that they are the manga's real strength.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.splashcomics.de/php/rezensionen/rezension/69|first=Brigitte|last=Sch\u00f6nhense|language=German|publisher=Splashpages|title=Comic-Besprechung&nbsp;\u2013 One Piece 16|date=January 16, 2003|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.splashcomics.de/php/rezensionen/rezension/70|first=Brigitte|last=Sch\u00f6nhense|language=German|publisher=Splashpages|title=Comic-Besprechung&nbsp;\u2013 One Piece 17|date=March 13, 2003|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that Oda's characters are \"whacky\" and that his \"bizarre\" character designs create \"wonderful characterizations and personalities\".

[[Performance improvement]] is any effort targeted at closing the gap between Actual Results and Desired Results.\n\nOther organizational development definitions are slightly different.  The [[United States Office of Personnel Management|U.S. Office of Personnel Management]] (OPM) indicates that Performance Management consists of a system or process whereby:\n# Work is planned and expectations are set\n# Performance of work is monitored\n# Staff ability to perform is developed and enhanced\n# Performance is rated or measured and the ratings summarized\n# Top performance is rewarded<ref>A Handbook for Measuring Employee Performance, by the US Office of Personnel Management</ref>\n\n==In companies==\nMany people equate performance management with [[Performance appraisal|performance appraisal]]. This is a common misconception. Performance management is the term used to refer to activities, tools, processes, and programs that companies create or apply to manage the performance of individual employees, teams, departments, and other organizational units within their organizational influence. In contrast, performance appraisal refers to the act of appraising or evaluating performance during a given performance period to determine how well an employee, a vendor or an organizational unit has performed relative to agreed objectives or goals, and this is only one of many important activities within the overall concept of performance management.\n\nAt the workplace, performance management is implemented by employees with supervisory roles. Normally, the goal of managing performance is to allow individual employees to find out how well they had performed relative to performance targets or key performance indicators during a specific performance period from their supervisors and managers. \n\nAn organization wide 360 process that is integrated into its culture can be a powerful tool for communicating and instituting change, rapidly touching all members of the organization when new markets, strategies, values and structures are introduced into the system<ref>Bracken,D., & Rose,D.\u201d When does 360-degree feedback create behavior change? And how would we know it when it does? Journal of Business and Psychology\u201d,26(2), 183-192</ref>\n\nOrganizations and companies typically manage employee performance over a formal 12-month period (otherwise known as the formal company performance period).\n\nThe results of performance management exercises are used in:\n* Employee development planning to select the most appropriate and suitable development intervention to improve employees' knowledge, skills and behavior\n* Factual basis for compensation and rewards (pay raise & bonuses being the most common)\n* Factual basis in consideration with other factors for mobility (Example: transfers and promotions)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Behavioral systems analysis]]\n* [[Operational performance management]]\n* [[Organizational behavior management]]\n* [[PDCA]]\n* [[Performance measurement]]\n* [[Vitality curve|Stack ranking]]\n* [[Strategy Markup Language]] and particularly StratML Part 2, Performance Plans and Reports\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Business Intelligence and Performance Management: Theory, Systems, and Industrial Applications'', P.

The [[United States Office of Personnel Management|U.S. Office of Personnel Management]] (OPM) indicates that Performance Management consists of a system or process whereby:\n# Work is planned and expectations are set\n# Performance of work is monitored\n# Staff ability to perform is developed and enhanced\n# Performance is rated or measured and the ratings summarized\n# Top performance is rewarded<ref>A Handbook for Measuring Employee Performance, by the US Office of Personnel Management</ref>\n\n==In companies==\nMany people equate performance management with [[Performance appraisal|performance appraisal]]. This is a common misconception. Performance management is the term used to refer to activities, tools, processes, and programs that companies create or apply to manage the performance of individual employees, teams, departments, and other organizational units within their organizational influence. In contrast, performance appraisal refers to the act of appraising or evaluating performance during a given performance period to determine how well an employee, a vendor or an organizational unit has performed relative to agreed objectives or goals, and this is only one of many important activities within the overall concept of performance management.\n\nAt the workplace, performance management is implemented by employees with supervisory roles. Normally, the goal of managing performance is to allow individual employees to find out how well they had performed relative to performance targets or key performance indicators during a specific performance period from their supervisors and managers. \n\nAn organization wide 360 process that is integrated into its culture can be a powerful tool for communicating and instituting change, rapidly touching all members of the organization when new markets, strategies, values and structures are introduced into the system<ref>Bracken,D., & Rose,D.\u201d When does 360-degree feedback create behavior change? And how would we know it when it does? Journal of Business and Psychology\u201d,26(2), 183-192</ref>\n\nOrganizations and companies typically manage employee performance over a formal 12-month period (otherwise known as the formal company performance period).\n\nThe results of performance management exercises are used in:\n* Employee development planning to select the most appropriate and suitable development intervention to improve employees' knowledge, skills and behavior\n* Factual basis for compensation and rewards (pay raise & bonuses being the most common)\n* Factual basis in consideration with other factors for mobility (Example: transfers and promotions)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Behavioral systems analysis]]\n* [[Operational performance management]]\n* [[Organizational behavior management]]\n* [[PDCA]]\n* [[Performance measurement]]\n* [[Vitality curve|Stack ranking]]\n* [[Strategy Markup Language]] and particularly StratML Part 2, Performance Plans and Reports\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Business Intelligence and Performance Management: Theory, Systems, and Industrial Applications'', P.
