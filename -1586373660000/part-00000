The surrender of Japan led to the [[division of Korea]] at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], with the [[Soviet Union]] occupying the north, and the [[United States]] occupying the south. The Soviet Union and the United States failed to agree on a way to unify the country, and in 1948 they established two separate governments &ndash; the [[Soviet Bloc|Soviet]]-aligned [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and the [[Western world#Modern political definition|Western]]-aligned [[Republic of Korea]] &ndash; each claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Korea. \n\nIn 1950 the [[Korean War]] broke out. After much destruction, the war ended with a stalemate. The division at the 38th parallel was replaced by the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Tension between the two sides continued. Out of the rubble North Korea built an industrialized command economy.\n\n[[Kim Il-sung]] led North Korea until his death in 1994. He developed a pervasive [[personality cult]] and steered the country on an independent course in accordance with the principle of ''[[Juche]]'' (self-reliance). However, with natural disasters and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 1991, North Korea went into a [[North Korean famine|severe economic crisis]]. Kim Il-sung's son, [[Kim Jong-il]], succeeded him, and was in turn succeeded by his son, [[Kim Jong-un]]. Amid international alarm, North Korea developed nuclear missiles. In 2018, Kim Jong-un made a sudden peace overture towards South Korea and the United States.\n\n==Before the division==\n\nFrom 1910 to the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, Korea was [[Korea under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]].

After three years of consolidating his power, Kim Jong-il became Chairman of the NDC on October 8, 1997, a position described by the NDC as the nation's \"highest administrative authority\", and thus North Korea's ''de facto'' head of state.

The Soviet Union and the United States failed to agree on a way to unify the country, and in 1948 they established two separate governments &ndash; the [[Soviet Bloc|Soviet]]-aligned [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and the [[Western world#Modern political definition|Western]]-aligned [[Republic of Korea]] &ndash; each claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Korea. \n\nIn 1950 the [[Korean War]] broke out. After much destruction, the war ended with a stalemate. The division at the 38th parallel was replaced by the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Tension between the two sides continued. Out of the rubble North Korea built an industrialized command economy.\n\n[[Kim Il-sung]] led North Korea until his death in 1994. He developed a pervasive [[personality cult]] and steered the country on an independent course in accordance with the principle of ''[[Juche]]'' (self-reliance). However, with natural disasters and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 1991, North Korea went into a [[North Korean famine|severe economic crisis]]. Kim Il-sung's son, [[Kim Jong-il]], succeeded him, and was in turn succeeded by his son, [[Kim Jong-un]]. Amid international alarm, North Korea developed nuclear missiles.

Although a new constitution appeared to end the wartime political system, it did not completely terminate the transitional military rule. Rather it legitimized and institutionalized military rule by making the [[National Defence Commission of North Korea|National Defense Commission (NDC)]] the most important state organization and its chairman the highest authority. After three years of consolidating his power, Kim Jong-il became Chairman of the NDC on October 8, 1997, a position described by the NDC as the nation's \"highest administrative authority\", and thus North Korea's ''de facto'' head of state. His succession had been foreshadowed in 1980, when he was introduced to the public at the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|Sixth Party Congress]].<ref>{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=127}}</ref> In 1982, Kim Jong-il had established himself as a leading theoretician with the publication of ''[[On the Juche Idea]]''.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |p=146}}</ref> In 1984, he had been officially confirmed as his father's successor.<ref>{{cite book | title = Korea since 1850 | last1 = Lone |  first1 = Stewart| last2 = McCormack | first2 = Gavan | authorlink2 = Gavan McCormack | publisher = Longman Cheshire | location = Melbourne | year = 1993 | p=193 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the succession of Kim Jong-il coincided with much societal upheaval, and the succession is conventionally seen as a turning point of North Korean history, the change in leadership hardly had direct consequences. The politics in the last years of Kim Il-sung closely resemble those of the beginning of the Kim Jong-il era.<ref name=\"Lankov2015\">{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-939003-8|page=78}}</ref> The economy was in steep decline. In 1990\u20131995, foreign trade was cut in half, with the loss of subsidized Soviet oil being particularly keenly felt.

Indeed, a great many of the North Koreans fleeing to China because of famine still showed significant support for the government as well as pride in their homeland. Many of these people reportedly returned to North Korea after earning sufficient money.<ref>Kim Hong-min, \"I'm not brave.
