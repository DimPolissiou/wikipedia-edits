Surowiecki pursued [[Ph.D.]] studies in American History on a [[Mellon Fellowship]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} at [[Yale University]] from 1988 to 1995, but did not complete his studies and did not receive a doctoral degree. In 1995, he founded the now-defunct [[e-magazine]] ''Rogue'' and began a career in journalism. He lives in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and is married to ''Slate'' culture editor [[Meghan O'Rourke]].\n\n==Career==\nSurowiecki's writing has appeared in a wide range of publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Motley Fool]]'', ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', ''[[Artforum]]'', ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'', ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'', and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.\n\nBefore joining ''The New Yorker'', he wrote \u201cThe Bottom Line\u201d column for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine and was a contributing editor at ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''.\n\nHe got his start on the Internet when he was hired from graduate school by Motley Fool co-founder [[David Gardner (The Motley Fool)|David Gardner]], to be the Fool's editor-in-chief of its culture site on America Online, entitled \"Rogue\" (1995\u20131996). As The Motley Fool closed that site down and focused on finance, Surowiecki made the switch over to become a finance writer, which he did over the succeeding three years, including being assigned to write the Fool's column on ''Slate'' from 1997 to 2000.\n\nIn 2002, Surowiecki edited an anthology, ''Best Business Crime Writing of the Year'', a collection of articles from different business news sources that chronicle the fall from grace of various [[CEO]]s. In 2004, he published ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]'', in which he argued that in some circumstances, large groups exhibit more intelligence than smaller, more elite groups, and that [[collective intelligence]] shapes business, economies, societies and nations. In an article in the [[Huffington Post]] in November 2013, Internet entrepreneur and researcher Neil Seeman drew on [[social media]] trends over the time since the publication of ''The Wisdom of Crowds'' to observe that Mr. Surowiecki wrote his observations about collective intelligence \"prior to the proliferation of [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] and 'social filtering'; today, online, we increasingly do not reach any wisdom of any independently-minded crowds.

Surowiecki pursued [[Ph.D.]] studies in American History on a [[Mellon Fellowship]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} at [[Yale University]] from 1988 to 1995, but did not complete his studies and did not receive a doctoral degree. In 1995, he founded the now-defunct [[e-magazine]] ''Rogue'' and began a career in journalism. He lives in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and is married to ''Slate'' culture editor [[Meghan O'Rourke]].\n\n==Career==\nSurowiecki's writing has appeared in a wide range of publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Motley Fool]]'', ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', ''[[Artforum]]'', ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'', ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'', and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.\n\nBefore joining ''The New Yorker'', he wrote \u201cThe Bottom Line\u201d column for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine and was a contributing editor at ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''.\n\nHe got his start on the Internet when he was hired from graduate school by Motley Fool co-founder [[David Gardner (The Motley Fool)|David Gardner]], to be the Fool's editor-in-chief of its culture site on America Online, entitled \"Rogue\" (1995\u20131996). As The Motley Fool closed that site down and focused on finance, Surowiecki made the switch over to become a finance writer, which he did over the succeeding three years, including being assigned to write the Fool's column on ''Slate'' from 1997 to 2000.\n\nIn 2002, Surowiecki edited an anthology, ''Best Business Crime Writing of the Year'', a collection of articles from different business news sources that chronicle the fall from grace of various [[CEO]]s. In 2004, he published ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]'', in which he argued that in some circumstances, large groups exhibit more intelligence than smaller, more elite groups, and that [[collective intelligence]] shapes business, economies, societies and nations. In an article in the [[Huffington Post]] in November 2013, Internet entrepreneur and researcher Neil Seeman drew on [[social media]] trends over the time since the publication of ''The Wisdom of Crowds'' to observe that Mr. Surowiecki wrote his observations about collective intelligence \"prior to the proliferation of [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] and 'social filtering'; today, online, we increasingly do not reach any wisdom of any independently-minded crowds. We speak to our friends.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/neil-seeman/wisdom-of-crowds_b_4297913.html |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |title=Don't Mistake 'Likes' on Facebook For Real Social Change |author=Neil Seeman |publisher=Huffington Post |year=2013}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |author=Surowiecki, James |authormask= |title=The wisdom of crowds : why the many are smarter than the few and how collective wisdom shapes business, economies, societies, and nations |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=2004 |<!--isbn=0385503865-->}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Contemporary Authors Online.
