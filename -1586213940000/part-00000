The last extant trilobites finally disappeared in [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event|the mass extinction]] at the end of the [[Permian]] about 252 million years ago.

Despite morphological complexity and an unclear position within higher classifications, there are a number of characteristics which distinguish the trilobites from other arthropods: a generally sub-elliptical, [[dorsum (biology)|dorsal]], [[chitin]]ous exoskeleton divided longitudinally into three distinct lobes (from which the group gets its name); having a distinct, relatively large head shield (cephalon) articulating axially with a [[thorax]] comprising articulated transverse segments, the hindmost of which are almost invariably fused to form a tail shield ([[pygidium]]). When describing differences between trilobite [[taxon|taxa]], the presence, size, and shape of the [[cephalic]] features are often mentioned.\n\nDuring [[ecdysis|moulting]], the exoskeleton generally splits between the head and thorax, which is why so many trilobite fossils are missing one or the other. In most groups [[facial sutures]] on the cephalon helped facilitate moulting. Similar to [[lobster]]s and [[crab]]s, trilobites would have physically \"grown\" between the moult stage and the hardening of the new exoskeleton.\n\n===Cephalon===\n{{See also|Cephalon (arthropod anatomy)}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| header = Morphology of the trilobite cephalon\n| header_align = center\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 218\n| image2 = Trilobite cephalon areas numbered.svg|alt2 Labeled diagram of cephalon areas of a trilobite\n| caption2 = The subdivisions can be further broken down into different areas used in describing trilobite cephalic morphology. 1 \u2013 preocular area; 2 \u2013 palpebral area; 3 \u2013 postocular area; 4 \u2013 posterolateral projection; 5 \u2013 occipital ring; 6 \u2013 glabella; 7 \u2013 posterior area; 8 \u2013 lateral border; 9 \u2013 librigenal area; 10 \u2013 preglabellar area\n| image1 = Trilobite cranidium-en.svg\n| alt1 = Labeled diagram of major parts of the cephalon\n| caption1 = The major subdivisions of the cephalon\n}}\n\nA trilobite's cephalon, or head section, is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The [[Glabella (trilobite anatomy)|glabella]] forms a dome underneath which sat the \"crop\" or \"stomach\". Generally the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features, but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the [[hypostome (trilobite)|hypostome]], a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods. A toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backward at the rear edge of the hypostome.\n\nHypostome morphology is highly variable; sometimes supported by an un-mineralised membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent).

One of the more pronounced states is that the front of the facial sutures do not cut the lateral or frontal border on its own, but coincide in front of the glabella, and cut the frontal border at the midline. This is, inter alia, the case in the Asaphida. Even more pronounced is the situation that the frontal branches of the facial sutures end in each other, resulting in yoked free cheeks.

Holochroal eyes are the ancestral eye of trilobites, and are by far the most common, found in all orders except the Agnostida, and through the entirety of the Trilobites' existence.<ref name=Clarkson79 /> Little is known of the early history of holochroal eyes; Lower and Middle Cambrian trilobites rarely preserve the visual surface.<ref name=Clarkson79 /> The spatial resolving power of grated eyes (such as holochroal eyes) is dependent on [[irradiance|light intensity]], [[circular motion]], receptor density, registered light angle, and the extent to which the signal of individual [[Ommatidium|rhabdoms]] are neurally combined. This implies that lenses need to be larger under low light conditions (such as for ''[[Pricyclopyge]]'', when comparing it to ''[[Carolinites]]''), and for fast moving predators and prey. As the circular velocity caused by the forward speed of an animal itself is much higher for the [[Ommatidium|ommatidia]] directed perpendicular to the movement, fast-moving trilobites (such as ''Carolinites'') have eyes flattened from the side and more curved were ommatia are directed to the front or back.

This was followed by the epimorphic developmental phase, in which the animal continued to grow and moult, but no new trunk segments were expressed in the exoskeleton.

Segments are added at the posterior part of the pygidium, but all segments remain fused together.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97/><ref name=LeroseyWeb />\n\nThe \"meraspid\" stages (anamorphic phase) are marked by the appearance of an articulation between the head and the fused trunk. Prior to the onset of the first meraspid stage the animal had a two-part structure\u2014the head and the plate of fused trunk segments, the pygidium. During the meraspid stages, new segments appeared near the rear of the pygidium as well as additional articulations developing at the front of the pygidium, releasing freely articulating segments into the thorax. Segments are generally added one per moult (although two per moult and one every alternate moult are also recorded), with number of stages equal to the number of thoracic segments. A substantial amount of growth, from less than 25% up to 30%\u201340%, probably took place in the meraspid stages.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97 />\n\nThe \"holaspid\" stages (epimorphic phase) commence when a stable, mature number of segments has been released into the thorax. Moulting continued during the holaspid stages, with no changes in thoracic segment number.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97 /> Some trilobites are suggested to have continued moulting and growing throughout the life of the individual, albeit at a slower rate on reaching maturity.\n\nSome trilobites showed a marked transition in morphology at one particular instar, which has been called \"trilobite metamorphosis\".

In 1754, Manuel Mendez da Costa proclaimed that the Dudley locust was not an insect, but instead belonged to \"the crustaceous tribe of animals.\" He proposed to call the Dudley specimens ''Pediculus marinus major trilobos'' (large trilobed marine louse), a name which lasted well into the 1800s. German naturalist [[Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch | Johann Walch]], who executed the first inclusive study of this group, proposed the use of the name \"trilobite\".

Despite morphological complexity and an unclear position within higher classifications, there are a number of characteristics which distinguish the trilobites from other arthropods: a generally sub-elliptical, [[dorsum (biology)|dorsal]], [[chitin]]ous exoskeleton divided longitudinally into three distinct lobes (from which the group gets its name); having a distinct, relatively large head shield (cephalon) articulating axially with a [[thorax]] comprising articulated transverse segments, the hindmost of which are almost invariably fused to form a tail shield ([[pygidium]]). When describing differences between trilobite [[taxon|taxa]], the presence, size, and shape of the [[cephalic]] features are often mentioned.\n\nDuring [[ecdysis|moulting]], the exoskeleton generally splits between the head and thorax, which is why so many trilobite fossils are missing one or the other. In most groups [[facial sutures]] on the cephalon helped facilitate moulting. Similar to [[lobster]]s and [[crab]]s, trilobites would have physically \"grown\" between the moult stage and the hardening of the new exoskeleton.\n\n===Cephalon===\n{{See also|Cephalon (arthropod anatomy)}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| header = Morphology of the trilobite cephalon\n| header_align = center\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 218\n| image2 = Trilobite cephalon areas numbered.svg|alt2 Labeled diagram of cephalon areas of a trilobite\n| caption2 = The subdivisions can be further broken down into different areas used in describing trilobite cephalic morphology. 1 \u2013 preocular area; 2 \u2013 palpebral area; 3 \u2013 postocular area; 4 \u2013 posterolateral projection; 5 \u2013 occipital ring; 6 \u2013 glabella; 7 \u2013 posterior area; 8 \u2013 lateral border; 9 \u2013 librigenal area; 10 \u2013 preglabellar area\n| image1 = Trilobite cranidium-en.svg\n| alt1 = Labeled diagram of major parts of the cephalon\n| caption1 = The major subdivisions of the cephalon\n}}\n\nA trilobite's cephalon, or head section, is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The [[Glabella (trilobite anatomy)|glabella]] forms a dome underneath which sat the \"crop\" or \"stomach\". Generally the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features, but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the [[hypostome (trilobite)|hypostome]], a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods. A toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backward at the rear edge of the hypostome.\n\nHypostome morphology is highly variable; sometimes supported by an un-mineralised membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent). Many variations in shape and placement of the hypostome have been described.<ref name=Fortey1990/> The size of the glabella and the lateral fringe of the cephalon, together with hypostome variation, have been linked to different lifestyles, diets and specific [[ecological niche]]s.<ref name=Fortey04/>\n\nThe anterior and lateral fringe of the cephalon is greatly enlarged in the [[Harpetida]], in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch.<ref name=\"Fortey98\"/> Highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon.\n\n====Facial sutures====\nFacial or cephalic sutures are the natural fracture lines in the [[Cephalon (arthropod head)|cephalon]] of trilobites.

One of the more pronounced states is that the front of the facial sutures do not cut the lateral or frontal border on its own, but coincide in front of the glabella, and cut the frontal border at the midline. This is, inter alia, the case in the Asaphida. Even more pronounced is the situation that the frontal branches of the facial sutures end in each other, resulting in yoked free cheeks. This is known in ''[[Triarthrus]]'', and in the Phacopidae, but in that family the facial sutures are not functional, as can be concluded from the fact that free cheeks are not found separated from the cranidium.\n\nThere are also two types of sutures in the dorsal surface connected to the [[compound eye]]s of trilobites.<ref name=\"gon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trilobites.info/sutures.htm|title=Trilobite Facial Sutures|author=Samuel M.

The mouth is linked by a small esophagus to the stomach that lay forward of the mouth, below the glabella. The \"intestine\" led backward from there to the pygidium.<ref name=Bruton03a /> The \"feeding limbs\" attached to the cephalon are thought to have fed food into the mouth, possibly \"slicing\" the food on the hypostome and/or gnathobases first. Alternative lifestyles are suggested, with the cephalic legs used to disturb the sediment to make food available. A large glabella, (implying a large stomach), coupled with an impendent hypostome has been used as evidence of more complex food sources, i.e. possibly a carnivorous lifestyle.<ref name=Fortey04 />\n\n===Internal organs===\nWhile there is direct and implied evidence for the presence and location of the mouth, stomach and digestive tract (see above) the presence of heart, brain and liver are only implied (although \"present\" in many reconstructions) with little direct geological evidence.<ref name=\"Whittington97b\" />\n\n===Musculature===\nAlthough rarely preserved, long lateral muscles extended from the cephalon to midway down the pygidium, attaching to the axial rings allowing enrollment while separate muscles on the legs tucked them out of the way.<ref name=Bruton03a />\n\n==Sensory organs==\nMany trilobites had complex eyes; they also had a pair of [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e. Some trilobites were blind, probably living too deep in the sea for light to reach them. As such, they became secondarily blind in this branch of trilobite evolution. Other trilobites (e.g., ''[[Phacops rana]]'' and ''[[Erbenochile|Erbenochile erbeni]]'') had large eyes that were for use in well lit, predator-filled waters.\n\n===Antennae===\nThe pair of [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e suspected in most trilobites (and preserved in a few examples) were highly flexible to allow them to be retracted when the trilobite was enrolled. One species (''[[Olenoides|Olenoides serratus]]'') preserves antenna-like [[Cercus|cerci]], which project from the rear of the trilobite.<ref name=\"Whittington80\" />\n\n===Eyes===\nEven the earliest trilobites had complex, compound eyes with lenses made of calcite (a characteristic of all trilobite eyes), confirming that the eyes of arthropods and probably other animals could have developed before the Cambrian.<ref name=\"McCall2006\">{{Citation | author=McCall, G.

Holochroal eyes are the ancestral eye of trilobites, and are by far the most common, found in all orders except the Agnostida, and through the entirety of the Trilobites' existence.<ref name=Clarkson79 /> Little is known of the early history of holochroal eyes; Lower and Middle Cambrian trilobites rarely preserve the visual surface.<ref name=Clarkson79 /> The spatial resolving power of grated eyes (such as holochroal eyes) is dependent on [[irradiance|light intensity]], [[circular motion]], receptor density, registered light angle, and the extent to which the signal of individual [[Ommatidium|rhabdoms]] are neurally combined. This implies that lenses need to be larger under low light conditions (such as for ''[[Pricyclopyge]]'', when comparing it to ''[[Carolinites]]''), and for fast moving predators and prey. As the circular velocity caused by the forward speed of an animal itself is much higher for the [[Ommatidium|ommatidia]] directed perpendicular to the movement, fast-moving trilobites (such as ''Carolinites'') have eyes flattened from the side and more curved were ommatia are directed to the front or back.

This type of trilobite is not found around Yonne, so it may have been highly prized and traded from elsewhere.<ref name=\"McKay\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Paleontology|Arthropods}}\n* [[Notostraca]]\n* [[Horseshoe crab]]\n* [[Isopoda]]\n*[[List of trilobite genera]]\n*[[Evolutionary history of life]]\n\n{{Commons-inline|Trilobita}}\n{{Wikispecies-inline|Trilobita}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation | last = Fortey | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Fortey\n| title = Trilobite: Eyewitness to Evolution | publisher = [[Vintage Books]]\n| year = 2000 | location = New York\n| url =\n| isbn = 978-0-375-70621-9 }}\n*{{Citation | last = Lawrence | first = Pete | title = Trilobites of the World: An atlas of 1000 photographs | publisher = [[Siri Scientific Press]] | year = 2014 | location = Manchester | url = http://www.siriscientificpress.co.uk/Pages/default.aspx | isbn = 978-0-9574530-3-6 | access-date = 2014-04-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140308203643/http://www.siriscientificpress.co.uk/Pages/default.aspx | archive-date = 2014-03-08 | url-status = dead }}\n*{{Citation | last = Levi-Setti | first = Riccardo | title = The Trilobite Book: A Visual Journey | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]\n| year = 2014 | location = Chicago\n| url = http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo17616349.html\n| isbn = 978-0-226-12441-4 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{citation|url=http://www.trilobites.info/|title=A Guide to the Orders of Trilobite|first=Sam|last=Gon III}}.

James VI had spent his childhood at [[Stirling Castle]]. Now he came to Edinburgh to begin his adult rule. \n\n==Events==\nAccording to [[David Moysie]], James VI left Stirling on 29 September 1579 despite a storm. He had lunch at [[Dunipace]] and dinner at [[Linlithgow Palace]] where he stayed the night, and came to [[Holyroodhouse]] the next evening. The town lined the road with men in armour and a salute was fired from [[Edinburgh Castle]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofaffairs39moysuoft/page/24 David Moysie, ''Memoirs of the affairs of Scotland: from early manuscripts'' (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 25.]</ref>\n\nHis entry to the town was marked by a ceremonial [[Royal entry]].

Hale & Kilburn had pioneered the replacement of cast iron with pressed steel for many parts for the interiors of railway carriages. According to Nelson, \u201cNone of the Detroit plants would contract\u201d to make an all-steel body for the Hupp 32. [[Edward G. Budd|Edward Budd]] and [[Joseph Ledwinka]] were employed at Hale & Kilburn at the time, Budd as the general manager and Ledwinka as engineer.  Budd was interested in the project.  Hale & Kilburn had built some body panels for King and Paige but Budd had grander aspirations the Hupp project would permit him to pursue.\n\nBudd and Ledwinka worked with Nelson to develop means to manufacture Nelson's design for this body. They devised a system where the body's numerous steel stampings were welded together by hand and supported by a crude system of angle iron supports that held the welded subassemblies together. The disassembled bodies were shipped by rail to Detroit where they were put back together, painted and trimmed in the Hupmobile factory. Both the touring car and a coupe were made by this process and even one Hupmobile limousine. In 1911 no one, not Nelson, Ledwinka or Budd, thought to patent the process to manufacture all-steel bodies.\n[[File:Hupmobile Model 32 (5870815158).jpg|thumb|1913 Model 32 Touring Car]]\nWhile the Hupp 32 bodies were in production, Budd and Ledwinka left and formed the [[Budd Company|Edward G.

However, Budd later lost a patent infringement litigation it brought against [[Wilson Body Company|C.R.

The opinion does provide insight as to what was or was not novel about the process to manufacture the Hupp 32's body.\n\nSeveral thousand all steel touring cars were made before Nelson resigned as Chief Engineer in 1912.

Historically, the ethnonyms ''[[Irish people|Irish]]'' and ''[[Scottish people|Scots]]'' referred to the Gaels in general, but the scope of those [[ethnicities]] and [[nationalities]] is today more complex.\n\nGaelic language and culture originated in [[Gaelic Ireland|Ireland]], extending the kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] into the west of what would become [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. In antiquity the Gaels [[Hiberno-Roman relations|traded with]] the Roman Empire and also [[End of Roman rule in Britain|raided]] [[Roman Britain]]. In the Middle Ages, Gaelic culture became dominant throughout the rest of [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. There was also some Gaelic settlement [[Wales in the Roman era#Irish settlement|in Wales]], as well as cultural influence through [[Celtic Christianity]]. In the [[Viking Age]], small numbers of Vikings raided and settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the [[Norse-Gaels]]. In the 9th century, D\u00e1l Riata and [[Pictland]] merged to form the Gaelic [[Kingdom of Alba]]. Meanwhile, [[Gaelic Ireland]] was made up of several kingdoms, with a [[High King of Ireland|High King]] often claiming lordship over them.\n\nIn the 12th century, [[Normans in Ireland|Normans]] [[Norman invasion of Ireland|conquered]] parts of Ireland (leading to centuries of conflict), while parts of Scotland [[Davidian Revolution|became Normanized]]. However, Gaelic culture remained strong throughout Ireland, the [[Scottish Highlands]] and [[Galloway]]. In the early 17th century, the last Gaelic kingdoms in Ireland fell under control of the emerging [[British Empire]]'s [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. [[James VI and I]] sought to subdue the Gaels and wipe out their culture; first in the Scottish Highlands via repressive laws such as the [[Parliament of Scotland]]'s [[Statutes of Iona]] and then in Ireland by [[Plantations of Ireland|settling Gaelic land]] with English-speaking Protestant settlers. In the following centuries the Gaelic language was suppressed and mostly supplanted by English. However, it continues to be the main language in Ireland's ''[[Gaeltacht]]'' and Scotland's [[Outer Hebrides]]. The modern descendants of the Gaels have spread throughout the rest of the [[British Isles]], the [[Americas]] and [[Australasia]].\n\nTraditional Gaelic society is organised into [[clans]], each with its own territory and king (or chief), elected through [[tanistry]]. The Irish were previously [[Celtic polytheism|pagans]] who worshipped the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]], [[Veneration of the dead|venerated]] the ancestors and believed in an [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]]. Their four yearly festivals \u2013 [[Samhain]], [[Imbolc]], [[Beltane]] and [[Lughnasa]] \u2013 continued to be celebrated into modern times. The Gaels have a strong [[oral tradition]], traditionally maintained by [[Seancha\u00ed|shanachies]]. [[Ogham inscription|Inscription]] in the [[ogham]] alphabet began in the 4th century. Their conversion to [[Christianity]] accompanied the introduction of writing in the Roman alphabet, and Irish Gaelic has the oldest [[vernacular literature]] in western Europe. [[Irish mythology]] and [[Brehon law]] were preserved, albeit Christianised. Gaelic monasteries were renowned centres of learning and played a key role in developing [[Insular art]], while Gaelic missionaries and scholars were [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|highly influential]] in western Europe. In the Middle Ages, most Gaels lived in [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouse]]s and [[ringfort]]s. The Gaels had their own style of dress, which (in Scotland) became the [[belted plaid]] and [[kilt]]. They also have distinctive [[Traditional Gaelic music|music]], dance, [[Feis|festivals]], and [[Gaelic games|sports]]. Gaelic culture continues to be a major component of [[Culture of Ireland|Irish]], [[Culture of Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Culture of the Isle of Man|Manx culture]].\n\n==Ethnonyms==\n{{Indo-European topics}}\nThroughout the centuries, Gaels and Gaelic-speakers have been known by a number of names. The most consistent of these have been ''Gael'', ''[[Irish people|Irish]]'' and ''[[Scottish people|Scots]]''. The latter two have developed more ambiguous meanings, due to the early modern concept of the nation state, which encompasses non-Gaels. Other terms, such as ''[[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]]'', are not as often used.<ref name=\"mil\"/> An [[Old Norse]] name for the Gaels was ''[[Vestmenn]]'' (meaning \"Westmen\", due to inhabiting the Western fringes of Europe).<ref>{{cite book |last=Woolf |first=Alex |date=2007 |title=From Pictland to Alba, 789\u20131070 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=283}}</ref> Informally, archetypal forenames such as ''[[Tadhg]]'' or ''[[D\u00f2mhnall]]'' are sometimes used for Gaels.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Leary|2004|p=376}}.</ref>\n\nThe word \"Gaelic\" is first recorded in print in the [[English language]] in the 1770s,<ref name=\"gath\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Gaelic&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|title=Gaelic|date=6 November 2012}}</ref> replacing the earlier word ''Gathelik'' which is attested as far back as 1596.<ref name=\"gath\"/> ''Gael'', defined as a \"member of the Gaelic race\", is first attested in print in 1810.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Gael&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|title=Gael|date=6 November 2012}}</ref> The name ultimately derives from the [[Old Irish]] word ''Go\u00eddel/Ga\u00eddel'', commonly spelled ''Gaoidheal'' in pre-[[Irish orthography#Spelling reform|spelling reform]] [[Irish language|Modern Irish]], but today officially spelled ''Gaeil'' (plural) or ''Gael'' (singular; the word is spelled ''Gael'' in [[Manx language|Manx]] and ''G\u00e0idheal'' (singular) and ''G\u00e0idheil'' (plural) in [[Scottish Gaelic]]). In [[early modern Irish]], the words ''Gaelic'' and ''Gael'' were spelled respectively ''Gaoidhealg'' (''Go\u00eddelc'' in [[Old Irish]]) and ''Gaoidheal'' (singular), ''Gaoidheil/Gaoidhil'' (plural).{{sfn|Koch|2004|p=775}} When Gaelic power was  the hegemonic force in Ireland during the medieval period, the [[Irish bardic poetry|bardic poets]] who acted as the cultural intelligentsia of the nation, limited the use of ''Gaoidheal'' specifically to those who claimed genealogical descent in the paternal line from [[Go\u00eddel Glas]].<ref name=\"morris\"/> Even the [[Gaelicised]] Normans who were born in Ireland, spoke the Irish language and sponsored Gaelic Irish bardic poetry, such as [[Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond|Gear\u00f3id Iarla]], were ultimately referred to as ''Gall'' (ie - \"foreigner\") instead by [[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]], the [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]] of the day.<ref name=\"morris\"/> In English literature, the more antiquarian term ''Goidels'' came to be used by some due to [[Edward Lhuyd]]'s work on the relationship between [[Celtic languages]].

Examples can be taken from [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] and other figures from [[Hiberno-Latin]] culture and the ''[[Schottenkloster]]'' founded by Irish Gaels in Germanic lands.\n\nThe Gaels of northern Britain referred to themselves as ''[[Albannaich]]'' in their own tongue and their realm as the [[Kingdom of Alba]] (founded as a successor kingdom to D\u00e1l Riata and Pictland).

The majority of the genomes of the [[insular Celts]] would therefore have emerged by 4,000 years ago. It was also suggested that the arrival of [[proto-Celtic]] language, possibly ancestral to [[Gaelic languages]], may have occurred around this time.<ref name=Cassidy>[http://www.pnas.org/content/113/2/368 Neolithic and Bronze Age migration to Ireland and establishment of the insular Atlantic genome] \"Three Bronze Age individuals from Rathlin Island (2026\u20131534 cal BC), including one high coverage (10.5\u00d7) genome, showed substantial Steppe genetic heritage indicating that the European population upheavals of the third millennium manifested all of the way from southern Siberia to the western ocean. This turnover invites the possibility of accompanying introduction of Indo-European, perhaps early Celtic, language.

Gaelic [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Christian missionaries]] were also active across the [[Frankish Empire]].

Core destinations for were Iberia, France, the West Indies, [[North America]] (what is today the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]) and [[Oceania]] ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]). There has also been a mass \"internal migration\" within Ireland and Britain from the 19th century, with Irish and Scots migrating to the English-speaking industrial cities of [[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Cardiff]], [[Leeds]], [[Edinburgh]] and others. Many underwent a linguistic \"Anglicisation\" and eventually merged with Anglo populations.\n\nIn a more narrow interpretation of the term ''Gaelic diaspora'', it could be interpreted as referring to the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic-speaking]] minority among the [[Irish diaspora|Irish]], [[Scottish diaspora|Scottish]], and [[Manx people|Manx]] diaspora.  However, the use of the term \"diaspora\" in relation to the Gaelic languages (i.e., in a narrowly linguistic rather than a more broadly cultural context) is arguably not appropriate, as it may suggest that Gaelic speakers and people interested in Gaelic necessarily have Gaelic ancestry, or that people with such ancestry naturally have an interest or fluency in their ancestral language.

Another group were the Ithians, descended from [[\u00cdth]] (an uncle of Milesius) who were located in South Leinster (associated with the [[Brigantes]]) but they later became extinct. The Four Masters date the start of Milesian rule from 1700 BCE. Initially, the Heremonians dominated the [[High Kingship of Ireland]] from their stronghold of [[Kingdom of Mide|Mide]], the Heberians were given [[Kingdom of Munster|Munster]] and the Irians were given [[Kingdom of Ulster|Ulster]]. At this early point of the Milesian-era, the non-Gaelic [[Fir Domnann]] held [[Kingdom of Leinster|Leinster]] and the [[Fir Ol nEchmacht]] held what was later known as [[Connacht]] (possibly remnants of the [[Fir Bolg]]).\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]] there was heightened activity at a number of important royal ceremonial sites, including [[Hill of Tara|Tara]], [[D\u00fan Ailinne]], [[Rathcroghan]] and [[Emain Macha]].{{sfn|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|2005|p=166}} Each was associated with a Gaelic tribe. The most important was Tara, where the High King (also known as the [[King of Tara]]) was inaugurated on the ''[[Lia F\u00e1il]]'' (Stone of Destiny), which stands to this day. According to the Annals, this era also saw, during the 7th century BCE, a branch of the Heremonians known as the [[Laigin]], descending from [[\u00dagaine M\u00f3r]]'s son [[L\u00f3egaire Lorc]], displacing the Fir Bolg remnants in Leinster. This was also a critical period for the [[Ulaid]] (earlier known as the Irians) as their kinsman [[Rudraige mac Sithrigi|Rudraige M\u00f3r]] took over the High Kingship in the 3rd century BCE; his offspring would be the subject of the [[Ulster Cycle]] of heroic tradition, including the epic ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]''. This includes the struggle between [[Conchobar mac Nessa]] and [[Fergus mac R\u00f3ich]].\n\nAfter regaining power, the Heremonians, in the form of [[F\u00edachu Finnolach]] were overthrown in a 1st-century AD provincial coup.

The earliest recorded raids were on [[Rathlin]] and [[Iona]] in 795; these hit and run attacks continued for some time until the Norsemen began to settle in the 840s at [[Dublin]] (setting up a large slave market), [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]] and elsewhere. The Norsemen also took most of the Hebrides and the [[Isle of Man]] from the D\u00e1l Riata clans and established the [[Kingdom of the Isles]]. The monarchy of [[Pictland]] had kings of Gaelic origin, since the 7th century with [[Bruide mac Der-Ilei]], around the times of the ''[[C\u00e1in Adomn\u00e1in]]''. However, they remained a separate realm from D\u00e1l Riata, until the latter gained full hegemony during the reign of [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] from the [[House of Alpin]], whereby D\u00e1l Riata and Pictland were merged to form the [[Kingdom of Alba]]. This meant an excelleration of Gaelicisation in the northern part of Great Britain. The [[Battle of Brunanburh]] in 937 defined the Anglo-Saxon [[Kingdom of England]] as the hegemonic force in Great Britain, over a Gaelic-Viking alliance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ncmh/dna/brunanburh.aspx|publisher=University of Nottingham|title=Battle of Brunanburh AD937|date=12 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter a spell when the Norsemen were driven from Dublin by Leinsterman [[Cerball mac Muirec\u00e1in]], they returned in the reign of [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]], heralding a second Viking period. The Dublin Norse\u2014some of them, such as [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] king [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]] now partly Gaelicised as the [[Norse-Gaels]]\u2014were a serious regional power, with territories across [[Northumbria]] and [[Scandinavian York|York]]. At the same time, the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill branches were involved in an internal power struggle for hegemony between the northern or southern branches. [[Donnchad Donn]] raided [[Munster]] and took [[Cellach\u00e1n Caisil]] of the E\u00f3ganachta hostage. The destabilisation led to the rise of the D\u00e1l gCais and [[Brian B\u00f3ruma]]. Through military might, Brian went about building a Gaelic [[Imperium]] under his High Kingship, even gaining the submission of [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]]. They were involved in a series of battles against the Vikings: [[Battle of Tara (Ireland)|Tara]], [[Battle of Glenmama|Glenmama]] and [[Battle of Clontarf|Clontarf]]. The last of these saw Brian's death in 1014. Brian's campaign is glorified in the ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'' (\"The War of the Gaels with the Foreigners\").\n\nThe Irish Church became closer to Continental models with the [[Synod of R\u00e1th Breasail]] and the arrival of the [[Cistercians]]. There was also more trade and communication with Normanised Britain and France. Between themselves, the [[\u00d3 Briain]] and the [[\u00d3 Conchobhair]] attempted to build a national monarchy.\n\nThe remainder of the Middle Ages was marked by conflict between Gaels and [[Anglo-Normans]]. The [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] took place in stages during the late 12th century. Norman mercenaries landed in [[Leinster]] in 1169 at the request of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], who sought their help in regaining his throne. By 1171 the Normans had gained control of Leinster, and King [[Henry II of England]], with the backing of the Papacy, established the [[Lordship of Ireland]]. The Norman kings of England claimed sovereignty over this territory, leading to centuries of conflict between the Normans and the native Irish. The origins of a literary anti-Gaelic sentiment was born at this time, and developed by the likes of [[Gerald of Wales]], as part of a propaganda campaign (with a [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian \"reform\"]] gloss) to justify taking Gaelic lands. Scotland also came under Anglo-Norman influence in the 12th century. The [[Davidian Revolution]] saw the Normanisation of Scotland's monarchy, government and church; the founding of [[burgh]]s, which became mainly English-speaking; and the royally-sponsored immigration of Norman aristocrats.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Alice |date=2016 |title=The Shape of the State in Medieval Scotland, 1124\u20131290 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=17\u201318}}</ref> This Normanisation was mainly limited to the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. In Ireland, the Normans carved out their own semi-independent lordships, but many Gaelic Irish kingdoms remained outside Norman control and [[gallowglass]] warriors were brought in from the Highlands to fight for various Irish kings.\n\nIn 1315, a [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|Scottish army landed in Ireland]] as part of Scotland's [[First War of Scottish Independence|war against England]]. It was led by [[Edward Bruce]], brother of Scottish king [[Robert the Bruce]]. Despite his own Norman ancestry, Edward urged the Irish to ally with the Scots by invoking a shared Gaelic ancestry and culture, and most of the northern kings acknowledged him as High King of Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |last=Duffy |first=Se\u00e1n |date=2002 |title=Robert the Bruce's Irish Wars |publisher=Tempus Publishing |page=129}}</ref> However, the campaign ended three years later with Edward's defeat and death in the [[Battle of Faughart]].\n\nA Gaelic Irish resurgence began in the mid-14th century: English royal control shrank to an area known as [[the Pale]] and, outside this, many Norman lords adopted Gaelic culture, becoming culturally Gaelicised. The English government tried to prevent this through the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] (1366), which forbade English settlers from adopting Gaelic culture, but the results were mixed and particularly in the West, some Normans became Gaelicised.\n\n[[File:Gaelic clothing Ireland.jpg|thumb|220px|Gaelic Irish men and noblewomen, c.1575]]\n[[File:Geschichte_des_Kost%C3%BCms_(1905)_(14597696020).jpg|thumb|300px|Scottish Highlanders depicted in [[R.

In 1542, [[Henry VIII of England]] declared the Lordship of Ireland [[Kingdom of Ireland|a Kingdom]] and himself King of Ireland. The new English, whose power lay in the Pale of Dublin, then began to [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|conquer the island]]. Gaelic kings were encouraged to apply for a [[surrender and regrant]]: to surrender their lands to the king, and then have them regranted as [[freehold (English law)|freeholds]]. Those who surrendered were also expected to follow English law and customs, speak English, and convert to the Protestant [[Church of Ireland|Anglican Church]]. Decades of conflict followed in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], culminating in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594\u20131603). The war ended in defeat for the Irish Gaelic alliance, and brought an end to the independence of the last Irish Gaelic kingdoms.\n\nIn 1603, with the [[Union of the Crowns]], King [[James VI and I|James of Scotland]] also became king of England and Ireland. James saw the Gaels as a barbarous and rebellious people in need of civilising,<ref name=\"ellis296\">{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Steven |date=2014 |title=The Making of the British Isles: The State of Britain and Ireland, 1450\u20131660 |publisher=Routledge |page=296}}</ref> and believed that Gaelic culture should be wiped out.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szasz |first=Margaret |date=2007 |title=Scottish Highlanders and Native Americans |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=48}}</ref> Also, while most of Britain had converted to Protestantism, most Gaels had held on to Catholicism. When the leaders of the Irish Gaelic alliance [[Flight of the Earls|fled Ireland]] in 1607, their lands were confiscated. James set about colonising this land with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Britain, in what became known as the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. It was meant to establish a loyal British Protestant colony in Ireland's most rebellious region and to sever Gaelic Ulster's links with Gaelic Scotland.<ref name=\"ellis296\"/> In Scotland, James attempted to subdue the Gaelic clans and suppress their culture through laws such as the [[Statutes of Iona]].<ref name=\"wedg\"/> He also attempted to colonise the [[Isle of Lewis]] with [[Gentleman Adventurers of Fife|settlers from the Lowlands]].\n\nSince then, the Gaelic language has gradually diminished in most of Ireland and Scotland. The 19th century was the turning point as [[The Great Hunger]] in Ireland, and across the [[Irish Sea]] the [[Highland Clearances]], caused mass emigration (leading to Anglicisation, but also a large [[Irish diaspora|diaspora]]). The language was rolled back to the Gaelic strongholds of the [[Highlands of Scotland|north west]] of Scotland, the west of Ireland and [[Cape Breton Island]] in Nova Scotia.\n\n===Modern===\nThe [[Gaelic revival]] also occurred in the 19th century, with organisations such as ''[[Conradh na Gaeilge]]'' and ''[[An Comunn G\u00e0idhealach]]'' attempting to restore the prestige of Gaelic culture and the socio-communal hegemony of the Gaelic languages. Many of the participants in the [[Irish Revolution]] of 1912\u20131923 were inspired by these ideals and so when a sovereign state was formed (the [[Irish Free State]]), [[post-colonial]] enthusiasm for the re-[[Gaelicisation]] of Ireland was high and promoted through public education. Results were very mixed however and the ''[[Gaeltacht]]'' where native speakers lived continued to retract. In the 1960s and 70s, pressure from groups such as ''Misneach'' (supported by [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]), the ''[[Gluaiseacht Chearta Siabhialta na Gaeltachta]]'' and others; particularly in [[Connemara]]; paved the way for the creation of development agencies such as ''[[\u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta]]'' and state media (television and radio) in Irish.\n\nThe last [[native speaker]] of Manx died in the 1970s, though use of the Manx language never fully ceased. There is now a resurgent language movement and Manx is once again taught in all schools as a second language and in some as a first language.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Gaelic Ireland|Culture of Scotland in the High Middle Ages}}\nGaelic society was traditionally made up of kin groups known as clans, each with its own territory and headed by a male chieftain. [[Order of succession|Succession]] to the chieftainship or kingship was through [[tanistry]]. When a man became chieftain or king, a relative was elected to be his deputy or 'tanist' (''t\u00e1naiste''). When the chieftain or king died, his tanist would automatically succeed him. The tanist had to share the same great-grandfather as his predecessor (i.e. was of the same ''[[derbfhine]]'') and he was elected by freemen who also shared the same great-grandfather.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholls |first=Kenneth W. |chapter=Chapter XIV: Gaelic society and economy |editor-last=Cosgrove |editor-first=Art |title=A New History of Ireland, Volume II: Medieval Ireland 1169\u20131534 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vSht2aNHR4C&pg=PA397 |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-953970-3 |pages=397\u2013438|orig-year=1987 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199539703.003.0015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Michael |date=2000 |title=A handbook of the Scottish Gaelic world |publisher=Four Courts Press |page=114}}</ref> Gaelic law is known as the ''F\u00e9nechas'' or [[Brehon law]].

Little can be said with certainty, as the language now known as [[Old Irish]]\u2014ancestral to modern [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]\u2014only began to be properly recorded with the [[Christianisation of Ireland]] in the 4th century, after the introduction of the [[Roman script]]. Primitive Irish does appear in a specialised written form, using a unique script known as [[Ogham]]. The oldest examples of Ogham have survived in the form of memorial inscriptions or short [[epitaphs]] on pillar-like stone monuments (see [[Mac Cairthinn mac Coelboth]]). Ogham stones are found throughout Ireland and neighbouring parts of Britain. This form of written Primitive Irish is thought to have been in use as early as 1000 BC. The script frequently encodes a name or description of the owner and surrounding region, and it is possible that the inscribed stones may have represented territorial claims.\n\n====Contemporary====\n{{multiple image|align=right|image1=Irish speakers in 2011.png|width1={{#expr: (225 * 388 / 579) round 0}}|image2=Scots Gaelic speakers in the 2011 census.png|width2={{#expr: (225 * 336 / 589) round 0}}|footer=Respondents who stated they could speak Irish and Gaelic in the 2011 censuses.}}\nThe Gaelic languages have been in steep decline since the beginning of the 19th century, when they were majority languages of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands; today they are [[endangered language]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blog.marylhurst.edu/blog/2013/04/23/irish-as-an-endangered-language/ |publisher=Marlyhurst University |title=Irish as an endangered language |date=21 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906202149/http://blog.marylhurst.edu/blog/2013/04/23/irish-as-an-endangered-language/ |archivedate=6 September 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/endangered-gaelic-on-map-of-world-s-dead-languages-1-830316|newspaper=The Scotsman|title='Endangered' Gaelic on map of world's dead languages|date=21 July 2015}}</ref> The spread of the [[English language]] has resulted in a vast majority of people of Gaelic ancestry being unable to speak a Goidelic language. As far back as the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1366, the British government had dissuaded use of Gaelic for political reasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cq/vol28/iss3/7/|publisher=Collin Meissner|title=Words Between Worlds: The Irish Language, the English Army, and the Violence of Translation in Brian Friel's Translations|date=21 July 2015}}</ref> The [[Statutes of Iona]] in 1609 and the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge#SSPCK in Scotland|SSPCK]] in the Highlands (for most of its history) are also notable examples. As the old Gaelic aristocracy were displaced or assimilated, the language lost its prestige and became primarily a peasant language, rather than one of education and government.\n\nDuring the 19th century, a number of ''Gaeilgeoir'' organisations were founded to promote a broad cultural and linguistic revival. ''[[Conradh na Gaeilge]]'' ({{lang-en|the Gaelic League}}) was set up in 1893 and had its origins in [[Charles Owen O'Conor]]'s Gaelic Union, itself a derivative of the [[Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language]]. Similar Highland Gaelic groups existed, such as ''[[An Comunn G\u00e0idhealach]]''. At this time, Irish Gaelic was widely spoken along the Western seaboard (and a few other enclaves) and the Gaelic League began defining it as the \"''[[Gaeltacht]]''\", idealised as the core of true Irish-Ireland, rather than the Anglo-dominated Dublin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/columnists/victoria-white/lets-speak-gaeilge-however-we-can-and-wherever-we-want-346511.html|newspaper=Irish Examiner|title=Let's speak Gaeilge however we can and wherever we want|date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Although the Gaelic League itself aimed to be apolitical, this ideal was attractive to militant republicans such as the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], who formulated and led the Irish Revolution at the turn of the 20th century; a key leader, [[P\u00e1draig Pearse]], imagined an Ireland \"Not merely Free but Gaelic as well \u2013 Not merely Gaelic but Free as well.\" Scottish Gaelic did not undergo as extensive of a politicalisation at this juncture, as nationalists there tended to focus on the Lowland mythos of [[William Wallace]] rather than the ''[[G\u00e0idhealtachd]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Tanner|2006|p=65}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1950s, the independent Irish state developed ''[[An Caighde\u00e1n Oifigi\u00fail]]'' as a national standard for the Irish language (using elements from local dialects but leaning towards [[Connacht Irish]]), with a simplified spelling. Until 1973, school children had to pass Modern Irish to achieve a [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Cert]] and studying the subject remains obligatory. There are also ''[[Gaelscoileanna]]'' where children are taught exclusively through the medium of Irish. In the ''Gaeltacht'' itself, the language has continued to be in crisis under the pressure of globalism, but there are institutions such as ''[[\u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta]]'' and a [[Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs|Minister for the Gaeltacht]], as well as media outlets such as ''[[TG4]]'' and ''[[RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta]]'' to support it. The last native Manx Gaelic speaker died in 1974, although there are ongoing attempts at revival.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21242667|publisher=BBC|title=Manx: Bringing a language back from the dead|date=21 July 2015}}</ref> While the ''G\u00e0idhealtachd'' has retracted in the Highlands, Scottish Gaelic has enjoyed renewed support<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/02/springtime-gaelic|magazine=New Statesman|title=Language as activism: the big Gaelic comeback|date=21 July 2015}}</ref> with the [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005]], establishing the ''[[B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig]]'' under the devolved [[Scottish Government]]. This has seen the growth of [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic medium education]]. There are also media outlets such as ''[[BBC Alba]]'' and ''[[BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal]]'', although these have been criticized for excessive use of English and pandering to an English-speaking audience.<ref>{{cite news |title= BBC Alba is not a Gaelic channel|author= |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/naidheachdan/29125194|newspaper= |date= 9 September 2014|accessdate=12 September 2014 |work=BBCAlbaNews}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n====Pre-Christian====\n\n{{main|Ancient Celtic religion}}\n[[File:Heroes of the dawn (1914) (14750481494).jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artistic rendering of the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]]]]\n\nThe traditional, or \"[[pagan]]\", worldview of the pre-Christian Gaels of Ireland is typically described as [[Celtic animism|animistic]],<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|1992|p=4}}.</ref> [[Celtic polytheism|polytheistic]], [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor venerating]] and focused on the [[hero]] cult of archetypal Gaelic warriors such as [[C\u00fa Chulainn]] and [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]].

Unlike other religions, there is no overall \"[[holy book]]\" systematically setting out exact rules to follow, but various works, such as the ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', ''[[Dindsenchas]]'', ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]'' and ''[[Acallam na Sen\u00f3rach]]'', represent the metaphysical orientation of ''Gaelachas''.\n\nThe main gods held in high regard were the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]], the superhuman beings said to have ruled Ireland before the coming of the Milesians, known in later times as the ''[[aes s\u00eddhe]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|1992|p=2}}.</ref> Among the gods were male and female deities such as [[The Dagda]], [[Lugh]], [[Nuada]], [[The Morr\u00edgan]], [[Aengus]], [[Brigid]] and [[\u00c1ine]], as well as many others. Some of them were associated with specific social functions, seasonal events and personal archetypal qualities. Some physical locations of importance in Ireland related to these stories include the [[Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne]], [[Hill of Tara]] and [[Hill of Uisneach]]. Although the ''s\u00eddhe'' were held to intervene in worldly affairs sometimes, particularly battles and issues of sovereignty, the gods were held to reside in [[Celtic Otherworld|the Otherworld]], also known as ''[[Mag Mell]]'' (Plain of Joy) or ''[[T\u00edr na n\u00d3g]]'' (Land of the Young). This realm was variously held to be located on a set of islands or underground. The Gaels believed that certain heroic persons could gain access to this spiritual realm, as recounted in the various ''[[echtra]]'' (adventure) and ''[[immram]]'' (voyage) tales.\n\n====Christianity====\n{{main|Gaelic Christianity}}\n[[File:Monasterboice West Cross West Face 2013 09 27.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Medieval [[high cross]] at [[Monasterboice]]]]\nThe Gaels underwent [[Christianisation]] during the 5th century and that religion, ''de facto'', remains the predominant one to this day, although [[irreligion]] is fast rising.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/08/religiosity-plummets-ireland-declines-worldwide-atheism_n_1757453.html|work=Huffington Post|title=Religiosity Plummets in Ireland and Declines Worldwide; Atheism on the Rise|date=21 July 2015}}</ref> At first the [[Christian Church]] had difficulty infiltrating Gaelic life: Ireland had never been part of the [[Roman Empire]] and was a decentralised tribal society, making patron-based mass conversion problematic.<ref name=\"martz\">{{cite news|url=http://publish.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=caaurj|publisher=Thomas Martz|title=The Adoption of Christianity by the Irish and Anglo-Saxons: The Creation of Two Different Christian Societies|date=8 February 2015}}</ref> It gradually penetrated through the remnants of [[Roman Britain]] and is especially associated with the activities of [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]], a [[Britons (Celtic people)|Briton]] who had been a slave in Ireland.<ref name=\"martz\"/> He tried to explain its doctrines by using elements of native folk tradition, so Gaelic culture itself was not completely cast aside and to some extent local Christianity was Gaelicised.<ref name=\"martz\"/> The last High King inaugurated in the pagan style was [[Diarmait mac Cerbaill]].

As part of this, the Catholic Church actively participated in the Norman conquest of Gaelic Ireland, with the issuing of ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' (claiming to gift the [[King of England]] the title \"[[Lord of Ireland]]\") and in Scotland [[David I and the Scottish Church|strongly encouraged]] king David who [[Davidian Revolution|Normanised that country]].

The Tudor state used the [[Church of Ireland|Anglican Church]] to bolster their power and enticed native elites into the project, without making much initial effort to convert the Irish Gaelic masses; meanwhile, the mass of Gaeldom (as well as the \"[[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]]\") became [[Irish Catholic|staunchly Catholic]]. Due to the geopolitical rivalry between Protestant Britain and Catholic France and Spain, the Catholic religion and its mostly Gaelic followers in Ireland were persecuted for a long time. In the Scottish Highlands too, the Gaels were generally slow to accept the Scottish Reformation. Efforts at persuading Highlanders in general of the value of this primarily Lowland movement were hampered by the complicated politics of the Highlands, with religious rivalries and clan antagonism becoming entwined (a prominent example was the intense rivalry, even hatred, between the generally [[Clan Campbell|Presbyterian Campbells]] and the generally [[Clan Donald|Catholic MacDonalds]]), but most Highlanders later converted to [[Presbyterianism]] in the 19th century during the breakdown of the clan system. In a few remote areas, however, Catholicism was kept alive and even rejuvenated to some extent by Irish Franciscan missionaries,{{citation needed|reason=retained in S. Hebrides and Moidart/Ardnamurchan but by native Scottish Gaels afaik|date=July 2017}} but in most of the Highlands it was replaced by Presbyterianism.\n\nThe adoption of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)]] in the Highlands following the [[Disruption of 1843]] was a reassertion of Gaelic identity in opposition to forces of improvement and clearance.<ref>{{cite book|page=85|last1=Lynch|first1=Michael|title=The Oxford Companion to Scottish History|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199234820|url=https://books.google.com/?id=65A-KFw1GU8C&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=free+church+patronage+highlands#v=onepage&q=free%20church%20patronage%20highlands&f=false|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Withers|first1=Charles W.

Historically, the ethnonyms ''[[Irish people|Irish]]'' and ''[[Scottish people|Scots]]'' referred to the Gaels in general, but the scope of those [[ethnicities]] and [[nationalities]] is today more complex.\n\nGaelic language and culture originated in [[Gaelic Ireland|Ireland]], extending the kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] into the west of what would become [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. In antiquity the Gaels [[Hiberno-Roman relations|traded with]] the Roman Empire and also [[End of Roman rule in Britain|raided]] [[Roman Britain]]. In the Middle Ages, Gaelic culture became dominant throughout the rest of [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. There was also some Gaelic settlement [[Wales in the Roman era#Irish settlement|in Wales]], as well as cultural influence through [[Celtic Christianity]]. In the [[Viking Age]], small numbers of Vikings raided and settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the [[Norse-Gaels]]. In the 9th century, D\u00e1l Riata and [[Pictland]] merged to form the Gaelic [[Kingdom of Alba]]. Meanwhile, [[Gaelic Ireland]] was made up of several kingdoms, with a [[High King of Ireland|High King]] often claiming lordship over them.\n\nIn the 12th century, [[Normans in Ireland|Normans]] [[Norman invasion of Ireland|conquered]] parts of Ireland (leading to centuries of conflict), while parts of Scotland [[Davidian Revolution|became Normanized]]. However, Gaelic culture remained strong throughout Ireland, the [[Scottish Highlands]] and [[Galloway]]. In the early 17th century, the last Gaelic kingdoms in Ireland fell under control of the emerging [[British Empire]]'s [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. [[James VI and I]] sought to subdue the Gaels and wipe out their culture; first in the Scottish Highlands via repressive laws such as the [[Parliament of Scotland]]'s [[Statutes of Iona]] and then in Ireland by [[Plantations of Ireland|settling Gaelic land]] with English-speaking Protestant settlers. In the following centuries the Gaelic language was suppressed and mostly supplanted by English. However, it continues to be the main language in Ireland's ''[[Gaeltacht]]'' and Scotland's [[Outer Hebrides]]. The modern descendants of the Gaels have spread throughout the rest of the [[British Isles]], the [[Americas]] and [[Australasia]].\n\nTraditional Gaelic society is organised into [[clans]], each with its own territory and king (or chief), elected through [[tanistry]]. The Irish were previously [[Celtic polytheism|pagans]] who worshipped the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]], [[Veneration of the dead|venerated]] the ancestors and believed in an [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]]. Their four yearly festivals \u2013 [[Samhain]], [[Imbolc]], [[Beltane]] and [[Lughnasa]] \u2013 continued to be celebrated into modern times. The Gaels have a strong [[oral tradition]], traditionally maintained by [[Seancha\u00ed|shanachies]]. [[Ogham inscription|Inscription]] in the [[ogham]] alphabet began in the 4th century. Their conversion to [[Christianity]] accompanied the introduction of writing in the Roman alphabet, and Irish Gaelic has the oldest [[vernacular literature]] in western Europe. [[Irish mythology]] and [[Brehon law]] were preserved, albeit Christianised. Gaelic monasteries were renowned centres of learning and played a key role in developing [[Insular art]], while Gaelic missionaries and scholars were [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|highly influential]] in western Europe. In the Middle Ages, most Gaels lived in [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouse]]s and [[ringfort]]s. The Gaels had their own style of dress, which (in Scotland) became the [[belted plaid]] and [[kilt]]. They also have distinctive [[Traditional Gaelic music|music]], dance, [[Feis|festivals]], and [[Gaelic games|sports]]. Gaelic culture continues to be a major component of [[Culture of Ireland|Irish]], [[Culture of Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Culture of the Isle of Man|Manx culture]].\n\n==Ethnonyms==\n{{Indo-European topics}}\nThroughout the centuries, Gaels and Gaelic-speakers have been known by a number of names. The most consistent of these have been ''Gael'', ''[[Irish people|Irish]]'' and ''[[Scottish people|Scots]]''. The latter two have developed more ambiguous meanings, due to the early modern concept of the nation state, which encompasses non-Gaels. Other terms, such as ''[[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]]'', are not as often used.<ref name=\"mil\"/> An [[Old Norse]] name for the Gaels was ''[[Vestmenn]]'' (meaning \"Westmen\", due to inhabiting the Western fringes of Europe).<ref>{{cite book |last=Woolf |first=Alex |date=2007 |title=From Pictland to Alba, 789\u20131070 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=283}}</ref> Informally, archetypal forenames such as ''[[Tadhg]]'' or ''[[D\u00f2mhnall]]'' are sometimes used for Gaels.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Leary|2004|p=376}}.</ref>\n\nThe word \"Gaelic\" is first recorded in print in the [[English language]] in the 1770s,<ref name=\"gath\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Gaelic&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|title=Gaelic|date=6 November 2012}}</ref> replacing the earlier word ''Gathelik'' which is attested as far back as 1596.<ref name=\"gath\"/> ''Gael'', defined as a \"member of the Gaelic race\", is first attested in print in 1810.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Gael&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|title=Gael|date=6 November 2012}}</ref> The name ultimately derives from the [[Old Irish]] word ''Go\u00eddel/Ga\u00eddel'', commonly spelled ''Gaoidheal'' in pre-[[Irish orthography#Spelling reform|spelling reform]] [[Irish language|Modern Irish]], but today officially spelled ''Gaeil'' (plural) or ''Gael'' (singular; the word is spelled ''Gael'' in [[Manx language|Manx]] and ''G\u00e0idheal'' (singular) and ''G\u00e0idheil'' (plural) in [[Scottish Gaelic]]). In [[early modern Irish]], the words ''Gaelic'' and ''Gael'' were spelled respectively ''Gaoidhealg'' (''Go\u00eddelc'' in [[Old Irish]]) and ''Gaoidheal'' (singular), ''Gaoidheil/Gaoidhil'' (plural).{{sfn|Koch|2004|p=775}} When Gaelic power was  the hegemonic force in Ireland during the medieval period, the [[Irish bardic poetry|bardic poets]] who acted as the cultural intelligentsia of the nation, limited the use of ''Gaoidheal'' specifically to those who claimed genealogical descent in the paternal line from [[Go\u00eddel Glas]].<ref name=\"morris\"/> Even the [[Gaelicised]] Normans who were born in Ireland, spoke the Irish language and sponsored Gaelic Irish bardic poetry, such as [[Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond|Gear\u00f3id Iarla]], were ultimately referred to as ''Gall'' (ie - \"foreigner\") instead by [[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]], the [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]] of the day.<ref name=\"morris\"/> In English literature, the more antiquarian term ''Goidels'' came to be used by some due to [[Edward Lhuyd]]'s work on the relationship between [[Celtic languages]]. This term was further popularised in academia by [[John Rhys]]; the first Professor of Celtic at [[Oxford University]]; due to his work ''Celtic Britain'' (1882).<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |date=December 1989|title= Goidel|trans-title= |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50096518?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=Goidel&first=1&max_to_show=10|accessdate=14 April 2010|quote= }}.</ref>\n\nAccording to the scholar [[John T.

Although the D\u00e1l Riata settled in Argyll in the 6th century, the term \"Scots\" did not just apply to them, but to Gaels in general. Examples can be taken from [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] and other figures from [[Hiberno-Latin]] culture and the ''[[Schottenkloster]]'' founded by Irish Gaels in Germanic lands.\n\nThe Gaels of northern Britain referred to themselves as ''[[Albannaich]]'' in their own tongue and their realm as the [[Kingdom of Alba]] (founded as a successor kingdom to D\u00e1l Riata and Pictland). Germanic groups tended to refer to the Gaels as ''Scottas''<ref name=\"OED\"/> and so when Anglo-Saxon influence grew at court with [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]], the Latin ''Rex Scottorum''  began to be used and the realm was known as Scotland; this process and cultural shift was put into full effect under [[David I of Scotland|David I]], who let the Normans come to power and furthered the Lowland-Highland divide. Germanic-speakers in Scotland spoke a language called ''[[Early Scots|Inglis]]'', which they started to call ''Scottis'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]) in the 16th century, while they in turn began to refer to Scottish Gaelic as ''Erse'' (meaning \"Irish\").<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Erse&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|title=Erse|date=13 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n\n===Kinship groups===\n{{Main|Irish clans|Scottish clans}}\n[[File:MacGregor Red and Green tartan.png|200px|thumb|right|Clan [[tartan]] of the [[MacGregors]].

The majority of the genomes of the [[insular Celts]] would therefore have emerged by 4,000 years ago. It was also suggested that the arrival of [[proto-Celtic]] language, possibly ancestral to [[Gaelic languages]], may have occurred around this time.<ref name=Cassidy>[http://www.pnas.org/content/113/2/368 Neolithic and Bronze Age migration to Ireland and establishment of the insular Atlantic genome] \"Three Bronze Age individuals from Rathlin Island (2026\u20131534 cal BC), including one high coverage (10.5\u00d7) genome, showed substantial Steppe genetic heritage indicating that the European population upheavals of the third millennium manifested all of the way from southern Siberia to the western ocean. This turnover invites the possibility of accompanying introduction of Indo-European, perhaps early Celtic, language.

Further to the north, the \u00c9rainn's D\u00e1l Riata colonised [[Argyll]] (eventually founding [[Kingdom of Alba|Alba]]) and there was a significant Gaelic influence in [[Northumbria]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ608220.pdf|publisher=Colin Ireland|title=Seventh-Century Ireland as a Study Abroad Destination|date=10 February 2015}}</ref> and the [[House of \u00d3engus|MacAngus]] clan arose to the Pictish kingship by the 8th century. Gaelic [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Christian missionaries]] were also active across the [[Frankish Empire]]. With the coming of the [[Viking Age]] and their slave markets, Irish were also dispersed in this way across the realms under Viking control; as a legacy, in genetic studies, [[Icelanders]] exhibit high levels of Gaelic-derived [[Mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://history.rutgers.edu/honors-papers-2009/152-they-accuse-us-of-being-descended-from-slaves/file|publisher=Rutgers University|title=\"They Accuse Us of Being Descended from Slaves\": Settlement History, Cultural Syncretism and the Foundation of Medieval Icelandic Identity|date=10 February 2015|access-date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211011903/http://history.rutgers.edu/honors-papers-2009/152-they-accuse-us-of-being-descended-from-slaves/file|archive-date=11 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSince the fall of Gaelic polities, the Gaels have made their way across parts of the world, successively under the auspices of the [[Spanish Empire]], [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], and the [[British Empire]]. Core destinations for were Iberia, France, the West Indies, [[North America]] (what is today the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]) and [[Oceania]] ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]). There has also been a mass \"internal migration\" within Ireland and Britain from the 19th century, with Irish and Scots migrating to the English-speaking industrial cities of [[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Cardiff]], [[Leeds]], [[Edinburgh]] and others. Many underwent a linguistic \"Anglicisation\" and eventually merged with Anglo populations.\n\nIn a more narrow interpretation of the term ''Gaelic diaspora'', it could be interpreted as referring to the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic-speaking]] minority among the [[Irish diaspora|Irish]], [[Scottish diaspora|Scottish]], and [[Manx people|Manx]] diaspora.  However, the use of the term \"diaspora\" in relation to the Gaelic languages (i.e., in a narrowly linguistic rather than a more broadly cultural context) is arguably not appropriate, as it may suggest that Gaelic speakers and people interested in Gaelic necessarily have Gaelic ancestry, or that people with such ancestry naturally have an interest or fluency in their ancestral language.

Another group were the Ithians, descended from [[\u00cdth]] (an uncle of Milesius) who were located in South Leinster (associated with the [[Brigantes]]) but they later became extinct. The Four Masters date the start of Milesian rule from 1700 BCE. Initially, the Heremonians dominated the [[High Kingship of Ireland]] from their stronghold of [[Kingdom of Mide|Mide]], the Heberians were given [[Kingdom of Munster|Munster]] and the Irians were given [[Kingdom of Ulster|Ulster]]. At this early point of the Milesian-era, the non-Gaelic [[Fir Domnann]] held [[Kingdom of Leinster|Leinster]] and the [[Fir Ol nEchmacht]] held what was later known as [[Connacht]] (possibly remnants of the [[Fir Bolg]]).\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]] there was heightened activity at a number of important royal ceremonial sites, including [[Hill of Tara|Tara]], [[D\u00fan Ailinne]], [[Rathcroghan]] and [[Emain Macha]].{{sfn|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|2005|p=166}} Each was associated with a Gaelic tribe. The most important was Tara, where the High King (also known as the [[King of Tara]]) was inaugurated on the ''[[Lia F\u00e1il]]'' (Stone of Destiny), which stands to this day. According to the Annals, this era also saw, during the 7th century BCE, a branch of the Heremonians known as the [[Laigin]], descending from [[\u00dagaine M\u00f3r]]'s son [[L\u00f3egaire Lorc]], displacing the Fir Bolg remnants in Leinster. This was also a critical period for the [[Ulaid]] (earlier known as the Irians) as their kinsman [[Rudraige mac Sithrigi|Rudraige M\u00f3r]] took over the High Kingship in the 3rd century BCE; his offspring would be the subject of the [[Ulster Cycle]] of heroic tradition, including the epic ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]''. This includes the struggle between [[Conchobar mac Nessa]] and [[Fergus mac R\u00f3ich]].\n\nAfter regaining power, the Heremonians, in the form of [[F\u00edachu Finnolach]] were overthrown in a 1st-century AD provincial coup.

The earliest recorded raids were on [[Rathlin]] and [[Iona]] in 795; these hit and run attacks continued for some time until the Norsemen began to settle in the 840s at [[Dublin]] (setting up a large slave market), [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]] and elsewhere. The Norsemen also took most of the Hebrides and the [[Isle of Man]] from the D\u00e1l Riata clans and established the [[Kingdom of the Isles]]. The monarchy of [[Pictland]] had kings of Gaelic origin, since the 7th century with [[Bruide mac Der-Ilei]], around the times of the ''[[C\u00e1in Adomn\u00e1in]]''. However, they remained a separate realm from D\u00e1l Riata, until the latter gained full hegemony during the reign of [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] from the [[House of Alpin]], whereby D\u00e1l Riata and Pictland were merged to form the [[Kingdom of Alba]]. This meant an excelleration of Gaelicisation in the northern part of Great Britain. The [[Battle of Brunanburh]] in 937 defined the Anglo-Saxon [[Kingdom of England]] as the hegemonic force in Great Britain, over a Gaelic-Viking alliance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ncmh/dna/brunanburh.aspx|publisher=University of Nottingham|title=Battle of Brunanburh AD937|date=12 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter a spell when the Norsemen were driven from Dublin by Leinsterman [[Cerball mac Muirec\u00e1in]], they returned in the reign of [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]], heralding a second Viking period. The Dublin Norse\u2014some of them, such as [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] king [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]] now partly Gaelicised as the [[Norse-Gaels]]\u2014were a serious regional power, with territories across [[Northumbria]] and [[Scandinavian York|York]]. At the same time, the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill branches were involved in an internal power struggle for hegemony between the northern or southern branches. [[Donnchad Donn]] raided [[Munster]] and took [[Cellach\u00e1n Caisil]] of the E\u00f3ganachta hostage. The destabilisation led to the rise of the D\u00e1l gCais and [[Brian B\u00f3ruma]]. Through military might, Brian went about building a Gaelic [[Imperium]] under his High Kingship, even gaining the submission of [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]]. They were involved in a series of battles against the Vikings: [[Battle of Tara (Ireland)|Tara]], [[Battle of Glenmama|Glenmama]] and [[Battle of Clontarf|Clontarf]]. The last of these saw Brian's death in 1014. Brian's campaign is glorified in the ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'' (\"The War of the Gaels with the Foreigners\").\n\nThe Irish Church became closer to Continental models with the [[Synod of R\u00e1th Breasail]] and the arrival of the [[Cistercians]]. There was also more trade and communication with Normanised Britain and France. Between themselves, the [[\u00d3 Briain]] and the [[\u00d3 Conchobhair]] attempted to build a national monarchy.\n\nThe remainder of the Middle Ages was marked by conflict between Gaels and [[Anglo-Normans]]. The [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] took place in stages during the late 12th century. Norman mercenaries landed in [[Leinster]] in 1169 at the request of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], who sought their help in regaining his throne. By 1171 the Normans had gained control of Leinster, and King [[Henry II of England]], with the backing of the Papacy, established the [[Lordship of Ireland]]. The Norman kings of England claimed sovereignty over this territory, leading to centuries of conflict between the Normans and the native Irish. The origins of a literary anti-Gaelic sentiment was born at this time, and developed by the likes of [[Gerald of Wales]], as part of a propaganda campaign (with a [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian \"reform\"]] gloss) to justify taking Gaelic lands. Scotland also came under Anglo-Norman influence in the 12th century. The [[Davidian Revolution]] saw the Normanisation of Scotland's monarchy, government and church; the founding of [[burgh]]s, which became mainly English-speaking; and the royally-sponsored immigration of Norman aristocrats.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Alice |date=2016 |title=The Shape of the State in Medieval Scotland, 1124\u20131290 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=17\u201318}}</ref> This Normanisation was mainly limited to the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. In Ireland, the Normans carved out their own semi-independent lordships, but many Gaelic Irish kingdoms remained outside Norman control and [[gallowglass]] warriors were brought in from the Highlands to fight for various Irish kings.\n\nIn 1315, a [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|Scottish army landed in Ireland]] as part of Scotland's [[First War of Scottish Independence|war against England]]. It was led by [[Edward Bruce]], brother of Scottish king [[Robert the Bruce]]. Despite his own Norman ancestry, Edward urged the Irish to ally with the Scots by invoking a shared Gaelic ancestry and culture, and most of the northern kings acknowledged him as High King of Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |last=Duffy |first=Se\u00e1n |date=2002 |title=Robert the Bruce's Irish Wars |publisher=Tempus Publishing |page=129}}</ref> However, the campaign ended three years later with Edward's defeat and death in the [[Battle of Faughart]].\n\nA Gaelic Irish resurgence began in the mid-14th century: English royal control shrank to an area known as [[the Pale]] and, outside this, many Norman lords adopted Gaelic culture, becoming culturally Gaelicised. The English government tried to prevent this through the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] (1366), which forbade English settlers from adopting Gaelic culture, but the results were mixed and particularly in the West, some Normans became Gaelicised.\n\n[[File:Gaelic clothing Ireland.jpg|thumb|220px|Gaelic Irish men and noblewomen, c.1575]]\n[[File:Geschichte_des_Kost%C3%BCms_(1905)_(14597696020).jpg|thumb|300px|Scottish Highlanders depicted in [[R.

In 1542, [[Henry VIII of England]] declared the Lordship of Ireland [[Kingdom of Ireland|a Kingdom]] and himself King of Ireland. The new English, whose power lay in the Pale of Dublin, then began to [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|conquer the island]]. Gaelic kings were encouraged to apply for a [[surrender and regrant]]: to surrender their lands to the king, and then have them regranted as [[freehold (English law)|freeholds]]. Those who surrendered were also expected to follow English law and customs, speak English, and convert to the Protestant [[Church of Ireland|Anglican Church]]. Decades of conflict followed in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], culminating in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594\u20131603). The war ended in defeat for the Irish Gaelic alliance, and brought an end to the independence of the last Irish Gaelic kingdoms.\n\nIn 1603, with the [[Union of the Crowns]], King [[James VI and I|James of Scotland]] also became king of England and Ireland. James saw the Gaels as a barbarous and rebellious people in need of civilising,<ref name=\"ellis296\">{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Steven |date=2014 |title=The Making of the British Isles: The State of Britain and Ireland, 1450\u20131660 |publisher=Routledge |page=296}}</ref> and believed that Gaelic culture should be wiped out.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szasz |first=Margaret |date=2007 |title=Scottish Highlanders and Native Americans |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=48}}</ref> Also, while most of Britain had converted to Protestantism, most Gaels had held on to Catholicism. When the leaders of the Irish Gaelic alliance [[Flight of the Earls|fled Ireland]] in 1607, their lands were confiscated. James set about colonising this land with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Britain, in what became known as the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. It was meant to establish a loyal British Protestant colony in Ireland's most rebellious region and to sever Gaelic Ulster's links with Gaelic Scotland.<ref name=\"ellis296\"/> In Scotland, James attempted to subdue the Gaelic clans and suppress their culture through laws such as the [[Statutes of Iona]].<ref name=\"wedg\"/> He also attempted to colonise the [[Isle of Lewis]] with [[Gentleman Adventurers of Fife|settlers from the Lowlands]].\n\nSince then, the Gaelic language has gradually diminished in most of Ireland and Scotland. The 19th century was the turning point as [[The Great Hunger]] in Ireland, and across the [[Irish Sea]] the [[Highland Clearances]], caused mass emigration (leading to Anglicisation, but also a large [[Irish diaspora|diaspora]]). The language was rolled back to the Gaelic strongholds of the [[Highlands of Scotland|north west]] of Scotland, the west of Ireland and [[Cape Breton Island]] in Nova Scotia.\n\n===Modern===\nThe [[Gaelic revival]] also occurred in the 19th century, with organisations such as ''[[Conradh na Gaeilge]]'' and ''[[An Comunn G\u00e0idhealach]]'' attempting to restore the prestige of Gaelic culture and the socio-communal hegemony of the Gaelic languages. Many of the participants in the [[Irish Revolution]] of 1912\u20131923 were inspired by these ideals and so when a sovereign state was formed (the [[Irish Free State]]), [[post-colonial]] enthusiasm for the re-[[Gaelicisation]] of Ireland was high and promoted through public education. Results were very mixed however and the ''[[Gaeltacht]]'' where native speakers lived continued to retract. In the 1960s and 70s, pressure from groups such as ''Misneach'' (supported by [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]), the ''[[Gluaiseacht Chearta Siabhialta na Gaeltachta]]'' and others; particularly in [[Connemara]]; paved the way for the creation of development agencies such as ''[[\u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta]]'' and state media (television and radio) in Irish.\n\nThe last [[native speaker]] of Manx died in the 1970s, though use of the Manx language never fully ceased. There is now a resurgent language movement and Manx is once again taught in all schools as a second language and in some as a first language.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Gaelic Ireland|Culture of Scotland in the High Middle Ages}}\nGaelic society was traditionally made up of kin groups known as clans, each with its own territory and headed by a male chieftain. [[Order of succession|Succession]] to the chieftainship or kingship was through [[tanistry]]. When a man became chieftain or king, a relative was elected to be his deputy or 'tanist' (''t\u00e1naiste''). When the chieftain or king died, his tanist would automatically succeed him. The tanist had to share the same great-grandfather as his predecessor (i.e. was of the same ''[[derbfhine]]'') and he was elected by freemen who also shared the same great-grandfather.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholls |first=Kenneth W. |chapter=Chapter XIV: Gaelic society and economy |editor-last=Cosgrove |editor-first=Art |title=A New History of Ireland, Volume II: Medieval Ireland 1169\u20131534 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vSht2aNHR4C&pg=PA397 |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-953970-3 |pages=397\u2013438|orig-year=1987 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199539703.003.0015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Michael |date=2000 |title=A handbook of the Scottish Gaelic world |publisher=Four Courts Press |page=114}}</ref> Gaelic law is known as the ''F\u00e9nechas'' or [[Brehon law]].

There are two main historical theories concerning the origin and development of the Gaelic languages from a [[Proto-Celtic]] root: the North Atlantic-based [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic hypothesis]] posits that Goidelic and [[Brythonic languages]] have a more recent common ancestor than [[Continental Celtic languages]], while the Q-Celtic and [[Gallo-Brittonic languages|P-Celtic hypothesis]] posits that Goidelic is more closely related to the [[Celtiberian language]], while Brythonic is closer to the [[Gaulish language]].\n\nEstimates of the emergence of proto-Gaelic in Ireland vary widely from the introduction of agriculture {{circa}} 7000\u20136000 BC to around the first{{clarify|date=April 2017}} few centuries BC. Little can be said with certainty, as the language now known as [[Old Irish]]\u2014ancestral to modern [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]\u2014only began to be properly recorded with the [[Christianisation of Ireland]] in the 4th century, after the introduction of the [[Roman script]]. Primitive Irish does appear in a specialised written form, using a unique script known as [[Ogham]]. The oldest examples of Ogham have survived in the form of memorial inscriptions or short [[epitaphs]] on pillar-like stone monuments (see [[Mac Cairthinn mac Coelboth]]). Ogham stones are found throughout Ireland and neighbouring parts of Britain. This form of written Primitive Irish is thought to have been in use as early as 1000 BC. The script frequently encodes a name or description of the owner and surrounding region, and it is possible that the inscribed stones may have represented territorial claims.\n\n====Contemporary====\n{{multiple image|align=right|image1=Irish speakers in 2011.png|width1={{#expr: (225 * 388 / 579) round 0}}|image2=Scots Gaelic speakers in the 2011 census.png|width2={{#expr: (225 * 336 / 589) round 0}}|footer=Respondents who stated they could speak Irish and Gaelic in the 2011 censuses.}}\nThe Gaelic languages have been in steep decline since the beginning of the 19th century, when they were majority languages of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands; today they are [[endangered language]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blog.marylhurst.edu/blog/2013/04/23/irish-as-an-endangered-language/ |publisher=Marlyhurst University |title=Irish as an endangered language |date=21 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906202149/http://blog.marylhurst.edu/blog/2013/04/23/irish-as-an-endangered-language/ |archivedate=6 September 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/endangered-gaelic-on-map-of-world-s-dead-languages-1-830316|newspaper=The Scotsman|title='Endangered' Gaelic on map of world's dead languages|date=21 July 2015}}</ref> The spread of the [[English language]] has resulted in a vast majority of people of Gaelic ancestry being unable to speak a Goidelic language.

As the old Gaelic aristocracy were displaced or assimilated, the language lost its prestige and became primarily a peasant language, rather than one of education and government.\n\nDuring the 19th century, a number of ''Gaeilgeoir'' organisations were founded to promote a broad cultural and linguistic revival. ''[[Conradh na Gaeilge]]'' ({{lang-en|the Gaelic League}}) was set up in 1893 and had its origins in [[Charles Owen O'Conor]]'s Gaelic Union, itself a derivative of the [[Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language]]. Similar Highland Gaelic groups existed, such as ''[[An Comunn G\u00e0idhealach]]''. At this time, Irish Gaelic was widely spoken along the Western seaboard (and a few other enclaves) and the Gaelic League began defining it as the \"''[[Gaeltacht]]''\", idealised as the core of true Irish-Ireland, rather than the Anglo-dominated Dublin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/columnists/victoria-white/lets-speak-gaeilge-however-we-can-and-wherever-we-want-346511.html|newspaper=Irish Examiner|title=Let's speak Gaeilge however we can and wherever we want|date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Although the Gaelic League itself aimed to be apolitical, this ideal was attractive to militant republicans such as the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], who formulated and led the Irish Revolution at the turn of the 20th century; a key leader, [[P\u00e1draig Pearse]], imagined an Ireland \"Not merely Free but Gaelic as well \u2013 Not merely Gaelic but Free as well.\" Scottish Gaelic did not undergo as extensive of a politicalisation at this juncture, as nationalists there tended to focus on the Lowland mythos of [[William Wallace]] rather than the ''[[G\u00e0idhealtachd]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Tanner|2006|p=65}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1950s, the independent Irish state developed ''[[An Caighde\u00e1n Oifigi\u00fail]]'' as a national standard for the Irish language (using elements from local dialects but leaning towards [[Connacht Irish]]), with a simplified spelling. Until 1973, school children had to pass Modern Irish to achieve a [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Cert]] and studying the subject remains obligatory. There are also ''[[Gaelscoileanna]]'' where children are taught exclusively through the medium of Irish. In the ''Gaeltacht'' itself, the language has continued to be in crisis under the pressure of globalism, but there are institutions such as ''[[\u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta]]'' and a [[Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs|Minister for the Gaeltacht]], as well as media outlets such as ''[[TG4]]'' and ''[[RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta]]'' to support it.

Some of them were associated with specific social functions, seasonal events and personal archetypal qualities. Some physical locations of importance in Ireland related to these stories include the [[Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne]], [[Hill of Tara]] and [[Hill of Uisneach]]. Although the ''s\u00eddhe'' were held to intervene in worldly affairs sometimes, particularly battles and issues of sovereignty, the gods were held to reside in [[Celtic Otherworld|the Otherworld]], also known as ''[[Mag Mell]]'' (Plain of Joy) or ''[[T\u00edr na n\u00d3g]]'' (Land of the Young). This realm was variously held to be located on a set of islands or underground.

The Tudor state used the [[Church of Ireland|Anglican Church]] to bolster their power and enticed native elites into the project, without making much initial effort to convert the Irish Gaelic masses; meanwhile, the mass of Gaeldom (as well as the \"[[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]]\") became [[Irish Catholic|staunchly Catholic]]. Due to the geopolitical rivalry between Protestant Britain and Catholic France and Spain, the Catholic religion and its mostly Gaelic followers in Ireland were persecuted for a long time. In the Scottish Highlands too, the Gaels were generally slow to accept the Scottish Reformation. Efforts at persuading Highlanders in general of the value of this primarily Lowland movement were hampered by the complicated politics of the Highlands, with religious rivalries and clan antagonism becoming entwined (a prominent example was the intense rivalry, even hatred, between the generally [[Clan Campbell|Presbyterian Campbells]] and the generally [[Clan Donald|Catholic MacDonalds]]), but most Highlanders later converted to [[Presbyterianism]] in the 19th century during the breakdown of the clan system. In a few remote areas, however, Catholicism was kept alive and even rejuvenated to some extent by Irish Franciscan missionaries,{{citation needed|reason=retained in S.

{"title_page": "Government of Alabama", "text_new": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].  From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government. He or she (currently Governor Kay Ivey) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham \n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Director: Wesley Helton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}'''General Information''' \n\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}'''General Information'''\n\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}<br />\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].  From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government. He or she (currently Governor Kay Ivey) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham \n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Director: Wesley Helton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "name_user": "AveryRedPandaGirl", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Im sorry.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Alabama"}
