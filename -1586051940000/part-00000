Amongst those were [[Walt Disney]] ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' and [[Krazy Kat]]. After Charles Mintz become involved with the progress it was clear that he was unhappy with the production costs on cartoons and asked Disney and [[Ub Iwerks]] to develop a new character. The result was [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], the first animated character for [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|year=2006|publisher=Alfred A.

After losing the Oswald contract to [[Walter Lantz]], Mintz focused on the ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' series, which was the output of a Winkler-distributed property.\nThe Winkler Studio became known as the Mintz Studio after he took over in 1929, and Mintz partnered with [[Columbia Pictures]] for distribution. The Mintz studio became known as Screen Gems in 1933. In 1939, a short while before his death, after becoming Indebted to Columbia, Mintz relinquished ownership of his studio and the Screen Gems name to Columbia to settle longstanding financial problems.<ref name=\"Dobson2010\">{{cite book|author=Nichola Dobson|title=The A to Z of Animation and Cartoons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVeK2elZxTcC&pg=PA47|date=1 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4616-6402-4|pages=47\u2013}}</ref> Walt Disney mentioned in an interview that Mintz cultivated his standards for high-quality cartoon movies, and he kept emphasizing them even after their contract ended.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|year=2006|publisher=Alfred A.

When Mintz became indebted to Columbia in 1938, he ended up selling his studio to them. Mintz's production manager became the studio head but was shortly replaced by Mintz's brother-in-law, George Winkler. Columbia then decided to \"clean house\" by ousting the bulk of the staff (including Winkler) and hiring creative cartoonist [[Frank Tashlin]]. After Tashlin's short stay came [[Dave Fleischer]], formerly of the [[Fleischer Studios]], and after several of his successors came Ray Katz and Henry Binder from [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] (previously Leon Schlesinger Productions). Animators, directors, and writers at the series included people such as [[Arthur Davis (animator)|Art Davis]], Sid Marcus, Bob Wickersham, and during its latter period, [[Bob Clampett]].\n\nLike most studios, the Screen Gems studio had several established characters on their roster.  These included ''[[Flippity and Flop]]'', ''[[Willoughby's Magic Hat|Willoughby Wren]]'', and ''Tito and His Burrito''. However, the most successful characters the studio had were ''[[The Fox and the Crow]]'', a comic duo of a refined Fox and a street-wise Crow. These two were so popular, that the studio made plans for a movie sometime in 1944, though it was ultimately cancelled, most likely due to World War II and the failure of Disney's animated films at the time...\n\nScreen Gems was, in an attempt to keep costs low, the last American animation studio to stop producing black and white cartoons. The final black-and-white Screen Gems shorts appeared in 1946, over three years after the second-longest holdouts ([[Famous Studios]] and Leon Schlesinger Productions). During that same year, the studio shut its doors for good,<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3206620/future_of_movie_cartoons_gloomy_as/|title = Future of Movie Cartoons Gloomy As Costs Increase|last = Thomas|first = Bob|date = November 28, 1946|work = [[Paris News|The Paris News]]|access-date = September 11, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|agency = Associated Press|author-link = Bob Thomas (reporter)|page = 13|location = Paris, Texas}}{{Open access}}</ref> though their animation output continued to be distributed until 1948.

Many film studios saw television as a threat to their business, thus it was expected that they would shun the medium. However, Columbia was one of a few studios who branched out to television under a pseudonym to conceal the true ownership of the television arm. That is until 1955, when Columbia decided to use [[Columbia Pictures#Logo|the woman from its logo]] under the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as a part of \"the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures\", as spoken in announcements at the end of some Screen Gems series.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1974, under President John H. Mitchell and Vice President of Production [[Harry Ackerman]], Screen Gems delivered classic TV shows and sitcoms: ''[[Father Knows Best]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'', ''[[Here Come the Brides]]'',  ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (TV series)|Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[Gidget]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', and ''[[The Partridge Family]]''. It was also the original distributor for [[Hanna-Barbera]] Productions, an animation studio founded by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] after leaving [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and was also the distributor of the ''[[Soupy Sales]]'' show. The company also entered a co-production deal with [[Canada]]'s [[CTV Television Network]] and produced several shows, many of which were filmed or taped in [[Toronto]] for distribution to Canadian stations (''Showdown'', ''[[The Pierre Berton Show]]'').{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The company even expanded as far as [[Australia]], opening Screen Gems Australia to produce shows for that country's networks, including ''[[The Graham Kennedy Show]]'' for the [[Nine Network]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Closing credits, ''The Graham Kennedy Show,'' date unknown|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZinSHKRCgt8|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1950s, Screen Gems also entered into ownership and operation of television stations. Stations owned by Screen Gems over the years included [[KTVX|KCPX]] (Salt Lake City; now [[KTVX]], owned by [[Nexstar Media Group]]), [[WVUE-DT|WVUE]] (New Orleans; now owned by [[Gray Television]]), [[WAPA-TV|WAPA]] (San Juan; now owned by the Hemisphere Media Group), [[WNJU]] (Linden, NJ; now owned by [[NBCUniversal]]), and several radio stations as well, including 50,000-watt clear channel [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]] (Wheeling WV; now owned by [[iHeartMedia]]). As a result, in funding its acquisitions, 18% of Screen Gems' shares was spun off from Columbia and it became a publicly traded company in NYSE until 1968.\n\nFrom 1964\u20131969, former child star [[Jackie Cooper]] was Vice President of Program Development. He was responsible for packaging series (such as ''[[Bewitched]]'') and other projects and selling them to the networks.\n\nIn 1965, Columbia Pictures acquired a fifty percent interest in the New York-based commercial [[production company]] EUE, which was incorporated into Screen Gems and renamed [[EUE/Screen Gems]]. The studios were sold in 1982 to longtime Columbia Pictures Executive, George Cooney, shortly after Columbia Pictures was sold to [[The Coca-Cola Company]].\n\nOn December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with its parent company Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million.<ref name=\"broadcasting19681223\">{{cite journal|date=December 23, 1968|title=\nColumbia, SG complete $24.5 million merger|journal=Broadcasting|page=53}}</ref>\n\nOn May 6, 1974, Screen Gems was renamed [[Columbia Pictures Television]] as suggested by then-studio president [[David Gerber]].<ref name=\"broadcasting19740506\">{{cite journal|date=1974-05-06|title=Remodeling at Screen Gems|journal=Broadcasting|pages=39\u201340}}</ref> The final notable production from this incarnation of Screen Gems before the name change was the 1974 [[mini-series]] ''[[QB VII]]''. Columbia was, technically, the last major studio to enter television by name.\n\nChanges in corporate ownership of Columbia came in 1982, when Coca-Cola bought the company, although continuing to trade under the CPT name.  In the mid-1980s, Coca-Cola reorganized its television holdings to create Coca-Cola Television, merging CPT with the television unit of Embassy Communications as Columbia/Embassy Television,<ref>KATHRYN HARRIS \"Los Angeles Times\" November 25, 1986 [http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-25/business/fi-13054_1_columbia-pictures-television Nation] articles.latimes.com, Retrieved on May 31, 2013</ref> although both companies continued to use separate identities until January 4, 1988, when it and [[TriStar Television|Tri-Star Television]] were reunited under the CPT name.

It was renamed to Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., also creating Columbia/Tri-Star by merging Columbia and Tri-Star. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names.<ref>KATHRYN HARRIS (September 2, 1987) [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-02/business/fi-3400_1_coca-cola-television-and-columbia-pictures Coke, Tri-Star Confirm Plans for $3.1-Billion Deal] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Retrieved on August 8, 2013</ref> In 1989, Columbia Pictures Entertainment was purchased by [[Sony]] Corporation of Japan.

Amongst those were [[Walt Disney]] ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' and [[Krazy Kat]]. After Charles Mintz become involved with the progress it was clear that he was unhappy with the production costs on cartoons and asked Disney and [[Ub Iwerks]] to develop a new character. The result was [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], the first animated character for [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|year=2006|publisher=Alfred A.

After losing the Oswald contract to [[Walter Lantz]], Mintz focused on the ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' series, which was the output of a Winkler-distributed property.\nThe Winkler Studio became known as the Mintz Studio after he took over in 1929, and Mintz partnered with [[Columbia Pictures]] for distribution. The Mintz studio became known as Screen Gems in 1933. In 1939, a short while before his death, after becoming Indebted to Columbia, Mintz relinquished ownership of his studio and the Screen Gems name to Columbia to settle longstanding financial problems.<ref name=\"Dobson2010\">{{cite book|author=Nichola Dobson|title=The A to Z of Animation and Cartoons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVeK2elZxTcC&pg=PA47|date=1 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4616-6402-4|pages=47\u2013}}</ref> Walt Disney mentioned in an interview that Mintz cultivated his standards for high-quality cartoon movies, and he kept emphasizing them even after their contract ended.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|year=2006|publisher=Alfred A.

His first nomination was in 1935 for ''[[Holiday Land]]'', and he was nominated again in 1938 for ''[[The Little Match Girl#Adaptations|The Little Match Girl]]''.\nThe name was originally used in 1933, when [[Columbia Pictures]] acquired a stake in Charles Mintz's animation studio.<ref>\"Los Angeles Times\" [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/12/entertainment/ca-45573 History of Gems] articles.latimes.com June 12, 1999, Retrieved on 4 April 2016</ref> The name was derived from an early Columbia Pictures slogan, \"Gems of the Screen\"; itself a takeoff on the song \"[[Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3206549/juvenile_stars_of_these_movies_work_as/|title = Juvenile Stars Of These Movies Work As Long As Asked|date = October 8, 1939|work = The Helena Daily Independent|access-date = September 11, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|agency = Associated Press|page = 4|location = Helena, Montana}}{{Open access}}</ref>\n\nFor an entire decade, [[Charles Mintz]] produced ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', ''[[Scrappy]]'', and ''[[Color Rhapsodies|Color Rhapsody]]'' animated film [[short subject|shorts]] through Columbia Pictures. When Mintz became indebted to Columbia in 1938, he ended up selling his studio to them. Mintz's production manager became the studio head but was shortly replaced by Mintz's brother-in-law, George Winkler. Columbia then decided to \"clean house\" by ousting the bulk of the staff (including Winkler) and hiring creative cartoonist [[Frank Tashlin]]. After Tashlin's short stay came [[Dave Fleischer]], formerly of the [[Fleischer Studios]], and after several of his successors came Ray Katz and Henry Binder from [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] (previously Leon Schlesinger Productions). Animators, directors, and writers at the series included people such as [[Arthur Davis (animator)|Art Davis]], Sid Marcus, Bob Wickersham, and during its latter period, [[Bob Clampett]].\n\nLike most studios, the Screen Gems studio had several established characters on their roster.  These included ''[[Flippity and Flop]]'', ''[[Willoughby's Magic Hat|Willoughby Wren]]'', and ''Tito and His Burrito''. However, the most successful characters the studio had were ''[[The Fox and the Crow]]'', a comic duo of a refined Fox and a street-wise Crow. These two were so popular, that the studio made plans for a movie sometime in 1944, though it was ultimately cancelled, most likley due to World War II and the failure of Disney's animated films at the time...\n\nScreen Gems was, in an attempt to keep costs low, the last American animation studio to stop producing black and white cartoons. The final black-and-white Screen Gems shorts appeared in 1946, over three years after the second-longest holdouts ([[Famous Studios]] and Leon Schlesinger Productions). During that same year, the studio shut its doors for good,<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3206620/future_of_movie_cartoons_gloomy_as/|title = Future of Movie Cartoons Gloomy As Costs Increase|last = Thomas|first = Bob|date = November 28, 1946|work = [[Paris News|The Paris News]]|access-date = September 11, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|agency = Associated Press|author-link = Bob Thomas (reporter)|page = 13|location = Paris, Texas}}{{Open access}}</ref> though their animation output continued to be distributed until 1948.

Many film studios saw television as a threat to their business, thus it was expected that they would shun the medium. However, Columbia was one of a few studios who branched out to television under a pseudonym to conceal the true ownership of the television arm. That is until 1955, when Columbia decided to use [[Columbia Pictures#Logo|the woman from its logo]] under the Screen Gems banner, officially billing itself as a part of \"the Hollywood studios of Columbia Pictures\", as spoken in announcements at the end of some Screen Gems series.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1974, under President John H. Mitchell and Vice President of Production [[Harry Ackerman]], Screen Gems delivered classic TV shows and sitcoms: ''[[Father Knows Best]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'', ''[[Here Come the Brides]]'',  ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (TV series)|Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[Gidget]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', and ''[[The Partridge Family]]''. It was also the original distributor for [[Hanna-Barbera]] Productions, an animation studio founded by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] after leaving [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and was also the distributor of the ''[[Soupy Sales]]'' show. The company also entered a co-production deal with [[Canada]]'s [[CTV Television Network]] and produced several shows, many of which were filmed or taped in [[Toronto]] for distribution to Canadian stations (''Showdown'', ''[[The Pierre Berton Show]]'').{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The company even expanded as far as [[Australia]], opening Screen Gems Australia to produce shows for that country's networks, including ''[[The Graham Kennedy Show]]'' for the [[Nine Network]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Closing credits, ''The Graham Kennedy Show,'' date unknown|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZinSHKRCgt8|website=YouTube.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1950s, Screen Gems also entered into ownership and operation of television stations. Stations owned by Screen Gems over the years included [[KTVX|KCPX]] (Salt Lake City; now [[KTVX]], owned by [[Nexstar Media Group]]), [[WVUE-DT|WVUE]] (New Orleans; now owned by [[Gray Television]]), [[WAPA-TV|WAPA]] (San Juan; now owned by the Hemisphere Media Group), [[WNJU]] (Linden, NJ; now owned by [[NBCUniversal]]), and several radio stations as well, including 50,000-watt clear channel [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]] (Wheeling WV; now owned by [[iHeartMedia]]). As a result, in funding its acquisitions, 18% of Screen Gems' shares was spun off from Columbia and it became a publicly traded company in NYSE until 1968.\n\nFrom 1964\u20131969, former child star [[Jackie Cooper]] was Vice President of Program Development. He was responsible for packaging series (such as ''[[Bewitched]]'') and other projects and selling them to the networks.\n\nIn 1965, Columbia Pictures acquired a fifty percent interest in the New York-based commercial [[production company]] EUE, which was incorporated into Screen Gems and renamed [[EUE/Screen Gems]]. The studios were sold in 1982 to longtime Columbia Pictures Executive, George Cooney, shortly after Columbia Pictures was sold to [[The Coca-Cola Company]].\n\nOn December 23, 1968, Screen Gems merged with its parent company Columbia Pictures Corporation and became part of the newly formed Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. for $24.5 million.<ref name=\"broadcasting19681223\">{{cite journal|date=December 23, 1968|title=\nColumbia, SG complete $24.5 million merger|journal=Broadcasting|page=53}}</ref>\n\nOn May 6, 1974, Screen Gems was renamed [[Columbia Pictures Television]] as suggested by then-studio president [[David Gerber]].<ref name=\"broadcasting19740506\">{{cite journal|date=1974-05-06|title=Remodeling at Screen Gems|journal=Broadcasting|pages=39\u201340}}</ref> The final notable production from this incarnation of Screen Gems before the name change was the 1974 [[mini-series]] ''[[QB VII]]''. Columbia was, technically, the last major studio to enter television by name.\n\nChanges in corporate ownership of Columbia came in 1982, when Coca-Cola bought the company, although continuing to trade under the CPT name.
