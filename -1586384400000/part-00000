The wasp-waisted insects are a [[clade|complete natural group with a single ancestor]]; wasps are [[Paraphyly|not such a group]], as they do not include the bees and the ants.\n\nThe most commonly known wasps, such as [[yellowjacket]]s and [[hornet]]s, are in the family [[Vespidae]] and are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual [[haplodiploid]] system of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]] in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Females typically have an [[ovipositor]] for laying eggs in or near a food source for the larvae, though in the [[Aculeata]] the ovipositor is often modified instead into a [[Sting (biology)|sting]] used for defense or prey capture. Wasps play many [[ecology|ecological roles]]. Some are [[predator]]s or pollinators, whether to feed themselves or to provision their nests. Many, notably the [[cuckoo wasp]]s, are [[kleptoparasite]]s, laying eggs in the nests of other wasps. Many of the solitary wasps are [[parasitoid wasp|parasitoidal]], meaning they lay eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult) and often [[mass provisioning|provision their own nests]] with such [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every [[pest insect]], making wasps valuable in [[horticulture]] for [[biological pest control]] of species such as [[whitefly]] in [[tomato]]es and other crops.\n\nWasps first appeared in the fossil record in the [[Jurassic]], and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by the [[Cretaceous]]. They are a successful and diverse group of insects with tens of thousands of described species; wasps have spread to all parts of the world except for the polar regions. The largest social wasp is the [[Asian giant hornet]], at up to {{convert|5|cm}} in length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known as [[tarantula hawk]]s, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia (''[[Megascolia procer]]''). The smallest wasps are solitary [[chalcid wasp]]s in the family [[Mymaridae]], including the world's smallest known insect, with a body length of only {{convert|0.139|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the smallest known flying insect, only {{convert|0.15|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nWasps have appeared in literature from [[Classical era|Classical times]], as the eponymous chorus of old men in [[Aristophanes]]' 422 BC comedy {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03c6\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}} ({{transl|grc|Sph\u0113kes}}), ''[[The Wasps]]'', and in [[science fiction]] from [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1904 novel ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth]]'', featuring giant wasps with three-inch-long stings. The name \"Wasp\"<!--intentionally Upper Case--> has been used for many warships and other military equipment.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n[[File:Wasps are Paraphyletic.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Wasps are [[paraphyletic]], consisting of the [[clade]] [[Apocrita]] without [[ant]]s and [[bee]]s, which are not usually considered to be wasps.

With their powerful stings and conspicuous [[warning coloration]], often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for [[Batesian mimicry]] by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., [[resin]]), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with [[saliva]]. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as ''[[Median wasp|Dolichovespula media]]'' and ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris|D. sylvestris]]'' prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; ''[[Protopolybia exigua]] ''attaches its nests on the underside of leaves and branches; ''[[Polistes erythrocephalus]]'' chooses sites close to a water source.<ref name= bdigital>{{cite journal | author=Carlos A.

The wasp-waisted insects are a [[clade|complete natural group with a single ancestor]]; wasps are [[Paraphyly|not such a group]], as they do not include the bees and the ants.\n\nThe most commonly known wasps, such as [[yellowjacket]]s and [[hornet]]s, are in the family [[Vespidae]] and are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual [[haplodiploid]] system of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]] in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Females typically have an [[ovipositor]] for laying eggs in or near a food source for the larvae, though in the [[Aculeata]] the ovipositor is often modified instead into a [[Sting (biology)|sting]] used for defense or prey capture. Wasps play many [[ecology|ecological roles]]. Some are [[predator]]s or pollinators, whether to feed themselves or to provision their nests. Many, notably the [[cuckoo wasp]]s, are [[kleptoparasite]]s, laying eggs in the nests of other wasps. Many of the solitary wasps are [[parasitoid wasp|parasitoidal]], meaning they lay eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult) and often [[mass provisioning|provision their own nests]] with such [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every [[pest insect]], making wasps valuable in [[horticulture]] for [[biological pest control]] of species such as [[whitefly]] in [[tomato]]es and other crops.\n\nWasps first appeared in the fossil record in the [[Jurassic]], and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by the [[Cretaceous]]. They are a successful and diverse group of insects with tens of thousands of described species; wasps have spread to all parts of the world except for the polar regions. The largest social wasp is the [[Asian giant hornet]], at up to {{convert|5|cm}} in length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known as [[tarantula hawk]]s, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia (''[[Megascolia procer]]''). The smallest wasps are solitary [[chalcid wasp]]s in the family [[Mymaridae]], including the world's smallest known insect, with a body length of only {{convert|0.139|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the smallest known flying insect, only {{convert|0.15|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nWasps have appeared in literature from [[Classical era|Classical times]], as the eponymous chorus of old men in [[Aristophanes]]' 422 BC comedy {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03c6\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}} ({{transl|grc|Sph\u0113kes}}), ''[[The Wasps]]'', and in [[science fiction]] from [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1904 novel ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth]]'', featuring giant wasps with three-inch-long stings. The name \"Wasp\"<!--intentionally Upper Case--> has been used for many warships and other military equipment.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n[[File:Wasps are Paraphyletic.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Wasps are [[paraphyletic]], consisting of the [[clade]] [[Apocrita]] without [[ant]]s and [[bee]]s, which are not usually considered to be wasps.

With their powerful stings and conspicuous [[warning coloration]], often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for [[Batesian mimicry]] by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., [[resin]]), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with [[saliva]]. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as ''[[Median wasp|Dolichovespula media]]'' and ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris|D. sylvestris]]'' prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; ''[[Protopolybia exigua]] ''attaches its nests on the underside of leaves and branches; ''[[Polistes erythrocephalus]]'' chooses sites close to a water source.<ref name= bdigital>{{cite journal | author=Carlos A.

Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey.

[[Gustavo Franco]], former president of the [[Central Bank of Brazil]], has asserted that the crisis was entirely self-inflicted by a series of \"faulty local macroeconomic measures that went wrong.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=A crise brasileira n\u00e3o vem de fora, ela foi autoinfligida|url=https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2015/03/25/economia/1427322429_883162.html|work=El Pa\u00eds |date=27 March 2015}}</ref> These measures together are known as the ''{{ill|Nova Matriz Econ\u00f4mica|pt|Nova Matriz Econ\u00f4mica|vertical-align=sup}}'' (loosely translated as \"New Economic Matrix\"). \n\nPreviously, the government had played a major role in the expansion of the internal market by stimulating consumption, raising the national minimum wage, transferring wealth and expanding credit. By the end of Lula's administration, entrepreneurs and industrialists began to question the sustainability of these policies. They criticized the shrinking participation of the national industry in the GDP.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn a response to these concerns, Rousseff created the New Economic Matrix in an attempt to help the national industry become more competitive against foreign competition. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies, which ultimately failed to stimulate industry. Productivity, which had grown by 2.7% in 2010, fell by 0.9% and 3.7% in the next two years, which decreased government revenues, and therefore, public investments.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n=== Political instability ===\nIn the same year the crisis began, a major corruption scheme was discovered and was being investigated in the [[Operation Car Wash]], which involved top politicians and huge companies, such as the oil giant [[Petrobras]].

By the end of Lula's administration, entrepreneurs and industrialists began to question the sustainability of these policies. They criticized the shrinking participation of the national industry in the GDP.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn a response to these concerns, Rousseff created the New Economic Matrix in an attempt to help the national industry become more competitive against foreign competition. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies, which ultimately failed to stimulate industry. Productivity, which had grown by 2.7% in 2010, fell by 0.9% and 3.7% in the next two years, which decreased government revenues, and therefore, public investments.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\n=== Political instability ===\nIn the same year the crisis began, a major corruption scheme was discovered and was being investigated in the [[Operation Car Wash]], which involved top politicians and huge companies, such as the oil giant [[Petrobras]].

Few other countries in this period were going through a recession, which reinforces the argument that the crisis in Brazil was mainly due to local causes.<ref name=\"book\">{{Cite book|last=Carvalho|first=Laura|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XppWDwAAQBAJ|title=Valsa brasileira: Do boom ao caos econ\u00f4mico|date=2018-05-08|publisher=Editora Todavia S.A|isbn=978-85-93828-63-8|language=pt-BR}}</ref>\n\nIn comparison to other crises in Brazil, it was verified that the 2014 crisis was not the deepest, as previously thought. After the GDP values for 2015 and 2016 were reviewed by the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), the economy shrank by 8.2% in the period, in contrast to the 8.5% in the 1981 recession. Despite not being the deepest, the crisis was long. It was also followed by the slowest recovery of all.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nAccording to Codace (committee part of [[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas]]), the 1981 crisis lasted nine trimesters, reached its peak in the first trimester of 1983 and, since then, took seven trimesters for the GDP the reach its pre-crisis level. Later, the 1989-1992 crisis lasted 11 trimesters and the recovery time was the same: seven trimesters. This crisis, however, had a lower intensity, with an accumulated decrease in the GDP of 7.7%.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn turn, the GDP after the 2014 crisis will only reach its pre-crisis level in 2022, according to an optimistic estimate, with 20 trimesters of recovery in total.

In addition to the sluggish recovery, the new jobs will be of lower quality, including informal and autonomous labor. \n\n\n[[Autonomous labor.

TEL is a [[Viscosity|viscous]] colorless [[liquid]]. Because TEL is charge neutral and contains an exterior of alkyl groups, it is highly [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] and soluble in petrol (gasoline).\n\nDespite decades of research, no reactions were found to improve upon this rather difficult process that involves metallic sodium and converts only 25% of the lead to TEL. A related compound, [[tetramethyllead]], was commercially produced by a different electrolytic reaction.<ref name=\"Seyferth\" /> A process with [[lithium]] was developed but never put into practice.\n\n== Reactions ==\nA noteworthy feature of TEL is the weakness of its four C\u2013Pb bonds. At the temperatures found in [[internal combustion engine]]s, {{nowrap|(CH{{sub|3}}CH{{sub|2}}){{sub|4}}Pb}} decomposes completely into lead and lead oxides as well as combustible, short-lived ethyl [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]]. Lead and lead oxide scavenge [[Radical (chemistry)|radical intermediates]] in [[combustion]] reactions. Engine knock is caused by a [[cool flame]], an oscillating low-temperature combustion reaction that occurs before the proper, hot ignition. Lead quenches the pyrolysed radicals and thus kills the radical chain reaction that would sustain a cool flame, preventing it from disturbing the smooth ignition of the hot flame front. Lead itself is the reactive antiknock agent, and TEL serves as a gasoline-soluble lead carrier.<ref name=\"Seyferth\" /> When (CH{{sub|3}}CH{{sub|2}}){{sub|4}}Pb burns, it produces not only carbon dioxide and water, but also lead:\n\n{{block indent| (CH{{sub|3}}CH{{sub|2}}){{sub|4}}Pb + 13 O{{sub|2}} \u2192 8 CO{{sub|2}} + 10 H{{sub|2}}O + Pb}}\n\nThis lead can oxidize further to give species such as [[lead(II) oxide]]:\n\n{{block indent|2 Pb + O{{sub|2}} \u2192 2 PbO}}\n\nPb and PbO would quickly over-accumulate and destroy an engine.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} For this reason, the lead scavengers [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]] and [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]] are used in conjunction with TEL\u2014these agents form volatile [[lead(II) bromide]] and [[lead(II) chloride]], respectively, which are flushed from the engine and into the air.\n\n== In motor fuel ==\nTEL was extensively used as a [[gasoline additive]] beginning in the 1920s,<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> wherein it served as an effective [[antiknock agent]] and prevented exhaust [[Poppet valve|valve]] and [[valve seat]] wear.

The use of [[catalytic converter]]s, mandated in the US for 1975 and newer model-year cars to meet tighter emissions regulations, started a gradual phase-out of leaded gasoline in the US.<ref name=Kitman /> The need for TEL was lessened by several advances in automotive engineering and petroleum chemistry. Safer methods for making higher-octane blending stocks such as [[reformate]] and [[iso-octane]] reduced the need to rely on TEL, as did other antiknock additives of varying toxicity including metallic compounds such as [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT) as well as [[oxygenate]]s including [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|methyl ''tert''-butyl ether]] (MTBE), [[tert-Amyl methyl ether|''tert''-amyl methyl ether]] (TAME), and [[Ethyl tert-butyl ether|ethyl ''tert''-butyl ether]] (ETBE).\n\nLead-replacement additives were scientifically tested, and some were approved by the Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs at the UK's [[Motor Industry Research Association]] in 1999.\n\nIn Europe, Professor [[Derek Bryce-Smith]] was among the first to highlight the potential dangers of TEL and became a leading campaigner for removal of lead additives from petrol.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/19/derek-bryce-smith-obituary|title=Derek Bryce-Smith obituary|newspaper=the Guardian|date=2011-07-19|last1=Gilbert|first1=Andrew}}</ref> However, leaded motor fuel re-entered the [[United Kingdom|UK]] market in small quantities from 2000 in response to lobbying from classic-car organisations who contended their vehicles would be rendered useless without leaded fuel.

Since the main problem with TEL is its lead content, many alternative additives that contain less poisonous metals have been examined. A manganese-carrying additive, [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT or methylcymantrene), was used for a time as an antiknock agent, though its safety is controversial and it has been the subject of bans and lawsuits. [[Ferrocene]], an [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] compound of [[iron]], is also used as an antiknock agent although with some significant drawbacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osd.org.tr/14.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505193757/http://www.osd.org.tr/14.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Application of fuel additives|archivedate=5 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nHigh-percentage additives are [[organic compound]]s that do not contain metals, but require much higher blending ratios, such as 20\u201330% for [[benzene]] and [[ethanol]]. It had been established by 1921 that ethanol was an effective antiknock agent, but TEL was introduced instead mainly for commercial reasons.<ref name=\"Kitman\" /> [[Oxygenate]]s such as [[tert-Amyl methyl ether|TAME]] derived from natural gas, [[MTBE]] made from methanol, and ethanol-derived [[ETBE]], have largely supplanted TEL. MTBE has environmental risks of its own and there are also bans on its use.\n\nImprovements to gasoline itself decrease the need for antiknock additives. Synthetic [[iso-octane]] and [[alkylate]] are examples of such blending stocks. Benzene and other high-octane [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatics]] can be also blended to raise the octane number, but they are disfavored today because of [[toxicity]] and [[carcinogen]]icity.\n\n== Formulation of ethyl fluid ==\n[[File:EthylCorporationSign.jpg|thumb|upright|Sign on an antique gasoline pump advertising tetraethyllead by the Ethyl Corporation]]\nTEL was supplied for mixing with raw gasoline in the form of '''ethyl fluid''', which was TEL blended with the lead scavengers [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]] and [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]].

As he attempted to measure lead content of very old rocks, and the time it took uranium to decay into lead, the readings were made inaccurate by lead in the environment that contaminated his samples. He was then forced to work in a [[cleanroom]] to keep his samples uncontaminated by environmental pollution of lead. After coming up with a fairly accurate estimate of the age of the earth, he turned to investigating the lead contamination problem by examining ice cores from countries such as [[Greenland]]. He realized that the lead contamination in the environment dated from about the time that TEL became widely used as a fuel additive in gasoline. Being aware of the health dangers posed by lead and suspicious of the pollution caused by TEL, he became one of the earliest and most effective opponents of its use.<ref>{{cite book |last = Bryson |first = B. |year = 2003 |chapter = 10.

Although the EPA's regulation was initially dismissed,<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> the EPA won the case on appeal, so the TEL phasedown began to be implemented in 1976. Additional regulatory changes were made by EPA over the next decade (including adoption of a trading market in \"lead credits\" in 1982 that became the precursor of the Acid Rain Allowance Market, adopted in 1990 for SO<sub>2</sub>), but the decisive rule was issued in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eed.nsf/fa6512c6e51c4a208525766200639df2/df94392f72ebb26085257746000aff52!OpenDocument |title=Lead Credit Trading |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=c. 2006 |website=National Center for Environmental Economics |publisher=US EPA |accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>  Then EPA mandated that lead additive be reduced by 91 percent by the end of 1986.

TEL is a [[Viscosity|viscous]] colorless [[liquid]]. Because TEL is charge neutral and contains an exterior of alkyl groups, it is highly [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] and soluble in petrol (gasoline).\n\nDespite decades of research, no reactions were found to improve upon this rather difficult process that involves metallic sodium and converts only 25% of the lead to TEL. A related compound, [[tetramethyllead]], was commercially produced by a different electrolytic reaction.<ref name=\"Seyferth\" /> A process with [[lithium]] was developed but never put into practice.\n\n== Reactions ==\nA noteworthy feature of TEL is the weakness of its four C\u2013Pb bonds. At the temperatures found in [[internal combustion engine]]s, {{nowrap|(CH{{sub|3}}CH{{sub|2}}){{sub|4}}Pb}} decomposes completely into lead and lead oxides as well as combustible, short-lived ethyl [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]]. Lead and lead oxide scavenge [[Radical (chemistry)|radical intermediates]] in [[combustion]] reactions. Engine knock is caused by a [[cool flame]], an oscillating low-temperature combustion reaction that occurs before the proper, hot ignition. Lead quenches the pyrolysed radicals and thus kills the radical chain reaction that would sustain a cool flame, preventing it from disturbing the smooth ignition of the hot flame front. Lead itself is the reactive antiknock agent, and TEL serves as a gasoline-soluble lead carrier.<ref name=\"Seyferth\" /> When (CH{{sub|3}}CH{{sub|2}}){{sub|4}}Pb burns, it produces not only carbon dioxide and water, but also lead:\n\n{{block indent| (CH{{sub|3}}CH{{sub|2}}){{sub|4}}Pb + 13 O{{sub|2}} \u2192 8 CO{{sub|2}} + 10 H{{sub|2}}O + Pb}}\n\nThis lead can oxidize further to give species such as [[lead(II) oxide]]:\n\n{{block indent|2 Pb + O{{sub|2}} \u2192 2 PbO}}\n\nPb and PbO would quickly over-accumulate and destroy an engine.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} For this reason, the lead scavengers [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]] and [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]] are used in conjunction with TEL\u2014these agents form volatile [[lead(II) bromide]] and [[lead(II) chloride]], respectively, which are flushed from the engine and into the air.\n\n== In motor fuel ==\nTEL was extensively used as a [[gasoline additive]] beginning in the 1920s,<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> wherein it served as an effective [[antiknock agent]] and prevented exhaust [[Poppet valve|valve]] and [[valve seat]] wear.

A company, Ethyl GmbH, was formed that produced TEL at two sites in Germany with a government contract from 10 June 1936.<ref>[[Rainer Karlsch]], Raymond G. Stokes. ''\"Faktor \u00d6l\".

The use of [[catalytic converter]]s, mandated in the US for 1975 and newer model-year cars to meet tighter emissions regulations, started a gradual phase-out of leaded gasoline in the US.<ref name=Kitman /> The need for TEL was lessened by several advances in automotive engineering and petroleum chemistry. Safer methods for making higher-octane blending stocks such as [[reformate]] and [[iso-octane]] reduced the need to rely on TEL, as did other antiknock additives of varying toxicity including metallic compounds such as [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT) as well as [[oxygenate]]s including [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|methyl ''tert''-butyl ether]] (MTBE), [[tert-Amyl methyl ether|''tert''-amyl methyl ether]] (TAME), and [[Ethyl tert-butyl ether|ethyl ''tert''-butyl ether]] (ETBE).\n\nLead-replacement additives were scientifically tested, and some were approved by the Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs at the UK's [[Motor Industry Research Association]] in 1999.\n\nIn Europe, Professor [[Derek Bryce-Smith]] was among the first to highlight the potential dangers of TEL and became a leading campaigner for removal of lead additives from petrol.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/19/derek-bryce-smith-obituary|title=Derek Bryce-Smith obituary|newspaper=the Guardian|date=2011-07-19|last1=Gilbert|first1=Andrew}}</ref> However, leaded motor fuel re-entered the [[United Kingdom|UK]] market in small quantities from 2000 in response to lobbying from classic-car organisations who contended their vehicles would be rendered useless without leaded fuel.

These modifications fall into two categories: those required for physical compatibility with unleaded fuel, and those performed to compensate for the relatively low octane of early unleaded fuels. Physical compatibility requires the installation of [[Hardening (metallurgy)|hardened]] exhaust valves and seats. Compatibility with reduced octane was addressed by reducing compression, generally by installing thicker cylinder [[head gasket]]s and/or rebuilding the engine with compression-reducing pistons. The availability of high-octane unleaded gasoline (or LPG) has reduced or eliminated the need to decrease compression ratios.\n\nLeaded gasoline remained legal as of late 2014<ref name=corrupt-executives>{{cite news | title=Corrupt Executives Sent To Prison For Pumping Toxic Leaded Fuel Overseas | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/09/leaded-gas-corruption-innospec_n_5662418.html}}</ref> in parts of [[Algeria]], [[Iraq]], [[Yemen]], [[Myanmar]], [[North Korea]], and [[Afghanistan]].

Since the main problem with TEL is its lead content, many alternative additives that contain less poisonous metals have been examined. A manganese-carrying additive, [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT or methylcymantrene), was used for a time as an antiknock agent, though its safety is controversial and it has been the subject of bans and lawsuits. [[Ferrocene]], an [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] compound of [[iron]], is also used as an antiknock agent although with some significant drawbacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osd.org.tr/14.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505193757/http://www.osd.org.tr/14.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Application of fuel additives|archivedate=5 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nHigh-percentage additives are [[organic compound]]s that do not contain metals, but require much higher blending ratios, such as 20\u201330% for [[benzene]] and [[ethanol]]. It had been established by 1921 that ethanol was an effective antiknock agent, but TEL was introduced instead mainly for commercial reasons.<ref name=\"Kitman\" /> [[Oxygenate]]s such as [[tert-Amyl methyl ether|TAME]] derived from natural gas, [[MTBE]] made from methanol, and ethanol-derived [[ETBE]], have largely supplanted TEL. MTBE has environmental risks of its own and there are also bans on its use.\n\nImprovements to gasoline itself decrease the need for antiknock additives. Synthetic [[iso-octane]] and [[alkylate]] are examples of such blending stocks. Benzene and other high-octane [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatics]] can be also blended to raise the octane number, but they are disfavored today because of [[toxicity]] and [[carcinogen]]icity.\n\n== Formulation of ethyl fluid ==\n[[File:EthylCorporationSign.jpg|thumb|upright|Sign on an antique gasoline pump advertising tetraethyllead by the Ethyl Corporation]]\nTEL was supplied for mixing with raw gasoline in the form of '''ethyl fluid''', which was TEL blended with the lead scavengers [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]] and [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]].

As he attempted to measure lead content of very old rocks, and the time it took uranium to decay into lead, the readings were made inaccurate by lead in the environment that contaminated his samples. He was then forced to work in a [[cleanroom]] to keep his samples uncontaminated by environmental pollution of lead. After coming up with a fairly accurate estimate of the age of the earth, he turned to investigating the lead contamination problem by examining ice cores from countries such as [[Greenland]]. He realized that the lead contamination in the environment dated from about the time that TEL became widely used as a fuel additive in gasoline. Being aware of the health dangers posed by lead and suspicious of the pollution caused by TEL, he became one of the earliest and most effective opponents of its use.<ref>{{cite book |last = Bryson |first = B. |year = 2003 |chapter = 10.

Although the EPA's regulation was initially dismissed,<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> the EPA won the case on appeal, so the TEL phasedown began to be implemented in 1976. Additional regulatory changes were made by EPA over the next decade (including adoption of a trading market in \"lead credits\" in 1982 that became the precursor of the Acid Rain Allowance Market, adopted in 1990 for SO<sub>2</sub>), but the decisive rule was issued in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eed.nsf/fa6512c6e51c4a208525766200639df2/df94392f72ebb26085257746000aff52!OpenDocument |title=Lead Credit Trading |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=c. 2006 |website=National Center for Environmental Economics |publisher=US EPA |accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>  Then EPA mandated that lead additive be reduced by 91 percent by the end of 1986.

[[Reese Witherspoon]] stars as [[Elle Woods]], a [[sorority]] girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend, played by [[Matthew Davis]], by getting a [[Juris Doctor]] degree at [[Harvard Law School]], and in the process, overcomes prejudice against blondes and triumphs as a successful lawyer through unflappable self-confidence and fashion/beauty knowhow. [[Alanna Ubach]], [[Jessica Cauffiel]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Selma Blair]], [[Victor Garber]], and [[Jennifer Coolidge]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was based on Brown's experiences as a blonde going to [[Stanford Law School]] while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]''  magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her fellow peers.<ref name=\"sf-chronicle\"/> In 2000, Brown met producer [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]], who helped her develop her manuscript into a [[Legally Blonde (novel)|novel]].

She expects Warner to propose, but he breaks up with her instead. He intends to go to Harvard Law School and become a successful politician, and believes that Elle is not \"serious\" enough for that kind of life. Elle believes she can win Warner back if she shows herself capable of achieving the same things. After months of studying, Elle scores a 179 on the [[Law School Admission Test]] and, combined with her 4.0 GPA, is accepted to [[Harvard Law]].\n\nUpon arriving at Harvard, Elle's [[Southern California|SoCal]] personality is a complete contrast to her [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] classmates, who refuse to take her seriously. Elle soon encounters Warner, but discovers he is engaged to another classmate, his old girlfriend Vivian Kensington. The snobby Vivian sees Elle as a fool and constantly treats her as such. Later, Elle tells Warner that she intends to apply for one of her professor's internships,  but Warner tells her that she is wasting her time because she simply isn't smart enough. It is here when Elle realizes that Warner will never take her back or take her seriously, and finds motivation to prove herself by working hard and demonstrating her understanding of the subject.\n\nThe following semester, Professor Callahan, the school's most respected teacher, decides to take on some first-year interns to help with a high-profile case. Among those chosen are Elle, Warner, and Vivian. Callahan is defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, who is one of Elle's role models. Accused of murdering her husband, Brooke is unwilling to produce an alibi (she later reveals to Elle that she was having liposuction, which Elle promises not to disclose). Vivian earns a new respect for Elle, and even reveals that Warner couldn't get into Harvard without his father's help. Emmett Richmond, Callahan's junior partner, has also taken notice of Elle's potential. One night, Callahan attempts to seduce Elle, who now believes that is the reason why she got the internship. Devastated, she quits and nearly returns home to California, telling Emmett what happened. When Emmett explains how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, Brooke fires Callahan and replaces him with Elle (under the guidance of Emmett, as she is only a law student, citing a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that law students may represent clients as long as they do so under the supervision of a licensed attorney). Elle begins to cross-examine Brooke's step-daughter Chutney, and notices important inconsistencies in her story: Chutney testified that she was home during her father's murder but did not hear the gunshot because she was in the shower after getting her hair permed that morning. Elle says that washing permed hair within the first 24 hours would deactivate the [[ammonium thioglycolate]], and points out that Chutney's curls are still intact. With her story falling apart, Chutney confesses that she had killed her father by accident, but she actually  intended to kill Brooke because she hated the fact that her father married someone who was the same age as her.\n\nAfter the trial, Warner approaches Elle and asks her to take him back, since she has proven herself. Elle rejects him, realizing that he is shallow and a \"complete bonehead\". She and Vivian, however, become good friends \u2013 especially after she dumps Warner. Two years later, Elle gives the graduation speech. Emmett has started his own law firm and has been dating Elle for two years, with plans to propose to her later that night.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Elle Woods]]\n* [[Moonie (dog)|Moonie]] as Bruiser Woods\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Emmett Richmond\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Vivian Kensington\n* [[Matthew Davis]] as Warner Huntington III\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Professor Callahan\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Paulette Bonafont\u00e9\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Professor Stromwell\n* [[Ali Larter]] as Brooke Taylor-Windham\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Margot\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Serena McGuire\n* [[Oz Perkins]] as David Kidney\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Chutney Windham\n* [[Bruce Thomas (actor)|Bruce Thomas]] as UPS Guy\n* [[Meredith Scott Lynn]] as Enid Wexler\n* [[Wayne Federman]] as Harvard Admissions Counselor\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark\n* [[Greg Serano]] as Enrique Salvatore\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe film is based upon the [[Legally Blonde (novel)|book of the same name]] by [[Amanda Brown (novelist)|Amanda Brown]], who built the story upon her real life experiences as a blonde attending [[Stanford Law School]], while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her fellow peers.<ref name=\"sf-chronicle\">{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/Blonde-Ambition-Author-Amanda-Brown-marvels-at-2565659.php |title=Blonde Ambition / Author Amanda Brown marvels at the industry surrounding 'Legally Blonde' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2003-07-13 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nBrown said that when she first arrived to Stanford Law, she discovered she had made a big mistake. \"I was in my first week of law school, in 1993, and I saw this flyer for \"The Women of Stanford Law,\" so I was like, \"I'll go and meet some nice girls.

She expects Warner to propose, but he breaks up with her instead. He intends to go to Harvard Law School and become a successful politician, and believes that Elle is not \"serious\" enough for that kind of life. Elle believes she can win Warner back if she shows herself capable of achieving the same things. After months of studying, Elle scores a 179 on the [[Law School Admission Test]] and, combined with her 4.0 GPA, is accepted to [[Harvard Law]].\n\nUpon arriving at Harvard, Elle's [[Southern California|SoCal]] personality is a complete contrast to her [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] classmates, who refuse to take her seriously. Elle soon encounters Warner, but discovers he is engaged to another classmate, his old girlfriend Vivian Kensington. The snobby Vivian sees Elle as a fool and constantly treats her as such. Later, Elle tells Warner that she intends to apply for one of her professor's internships,  but Warner tells her that she is wasting her time because she simply isn't smart enough. It is here when Elle realizes that Warner will never take her back or take her seriously, and finds motivation to prove herself by working hard and demonstrating her understanding of the subject.\n\nThe following semester, Professor Callahan, the school's most respected teacher, decides to take on some first-year interns to help with a high-profile case. Among those chosen are Elle, Warner, and Vivian. Callahan is defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, who is one of Elle's role models. Accused of murdering her husband, Brooke is unwilling to produce an alibi (she later reveals to Elle that she was having liposuction, which Elle promises not to disclose). Vivian earns a new respect for Elle, and even reveals that Warner couldn't get into Harvard without his father's help. Emmett Richmond, Callahan's junior partner, has also taken notice of Elle's potential. One night, Callahan attempts to seduce Elle, who now believes that is the reason why she got the internship. Devastated, she quits and nearly returns home to California, telling Emmett what happened. When Emmett explains how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, Brooke fires Callahan and replaces him with Elle (under the guidance of Emmett, as she is only a law student, citing a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that law students may represent clients as long as they do so under the supervision of a licensed attorney). Elle begins to cross-examine Brooke's step-daughter Chutney, and notices important inconsistencies in her story: Chutney testified that she was home during her father's murder but did not hear the gunshot because she was in the shower after getting her hair permed that morning. Elle says that washing permed hair within the first 24 hours would deactivate the [[ammonium thioglycolate]], and points out that Chutney's curls are still intact. With her story falling apart, Chutney confesses that she had killed her father by accident, but she actually  intended to kill Brooke because she hated the fact that her father married someone who was the same age as her.\n\nAfter the trial, Warner approaches Elle and asks her to take him back, since she has proven herself. Elle rejects him, realizing that he is shallow and a \"complete bonehead\". She and Vivian, however, become good friends \u2013 especially after she dumps Warner. Two years later, Elle gives the graduation speech. Emmett has started his own law firm and has been dating Elle for two years, with plans to propose to her later that night.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Elle Woods]]\n* [[Moonie (dog)|Moonie]] as Bruiser Woods\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Emmett Richmond\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Vivian Kensington\n* [[Matthew Davis]] as Warner Huntington III\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Professor Callahan\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Paulette Bonafont\u00e9\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Professor Stromwell\n* [[Ali Larter]] as Brooke Taylor-Windham\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Margot\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Serena McGuire\n* [[Oz Perkins]] as David Kidney\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Chutney Windham\n* [[Bruce Thomas (actor)|Bruce Thomas]] as UPS Guy\n* [[Meredith Scott Lynn]] as Enid Wexler\n* [[Wayne Federman]] as Harvard Admissions Counselor\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark\n* [[Greg Serano]] as Enrique Salvatore\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe film is based upon the [[Legally Blonde (novel)|book of the same name]] by [[Amanda Brown (novelist)|Amanda Brown]], who built the story upon her real life experiences as a blonde attending [[Stanford Law School]], while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her fellow peers.<ref name=\"sf-chronicle\">{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/Blonde-Ambition-Author-Amanda-Brown-marvels-at-2565659.php |title=Blonde Ambition / Author Amanda Brown marvels at the industry surrounding 'Legally Blonde' |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2003-07-13 |accessdate=2018-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nBrown said that when she first arrived to Stanford Law, she discovered she had made a big mistake. \"I was in my first week of law school, in 1993, and I saw this flyer for \"The Women of Stanford Law,\" so I was like, \"I'll go and meet some nice girls.
