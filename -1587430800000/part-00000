The main interstate lines out of Adelaide towards [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[Perth]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] have been progressively converted to [[standard gauge]] {{RailGauge|1435mm}}, but the suburban system and a few freight-only branch lines to the north remain broad gauge.\n\n==Operators==\n[[Image:AdelaideRail 5.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[FreightLink]] Adelaide to Darwin freight train at [[Dry Creek railway station|Dry Creek]]]]\n[[Image:AdelaideRail 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Pacific National]] freight from Melbourne to Perth passing [[Belair railway station|Belair]] in the Adelaide Hills]]\n[[Image:AdelaideRail 8.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Australian Railroad Group]] ''[[Penrice Stone Train]]'' from the [[Barossa Valley railway line|Barossa Valley line]] to [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]] in [[Birkenhead, South Australia|Birkenhead]]]]\n[[Image:AdelaideRail 7.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Journey Beyond]] ''[[Indian Pacific]]'' from Perth to Sydney near Hawker Street, Bowden]]\n\nRail services around Adelaide are provided by a mixture of private and government-owned organisations.\n\nThe [[Department of Planning, Transport & Infrastructure]] (DPTI) owns and operates the suburban passenger rail network. This comprises six lines from [[Adelaide railway station]] on [[North Terrace]] in the CBD. The DPTI also owns and operates the [[Glenelg tram line]]. Adelaide's tram network is the only fully government owned and operated tram network in Australia.\n\nThe [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] (ARTC), an agency of the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]], owns standard gauge interstate lines heading north and south, together with the [[dual gauge]] freight-only branch from [[Dry Creek-Port Adelaide railway line|Dry Creek to Port Adelaide]] and [[Pelican Point (Adelaide)|Pelican Point]]. The ARTC lines bypass the city to the west and do not enter the CBD. The ARTC network extends from Adelaide towards Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Darwin and is used by substantial interstate freight traffic.\n\nFreight trains are operated by a number of private operators, which have access agreements with rail network owners such as the ARTC. The largest of these is [[Pacific National]], which handles the majority of interstate traffic and has the largest locomotive fleet. Other logistics companies also operate freight trains to and from interstate destinations and within South Australia.\n\n[[One Rail Australia]] owns the remaining broad-gauge lines beyond the Adelaide suburban network. These are a handful of lines used mainly to move bulk grain and stone from the Barossa Valley and mid-north region of the state to the Port Adelaide area. \n\n[[Journey Beyond]] is a private company operating long-distance passenger trains on ARTCs standard gauge lines, and run from the [[Adelaide Parklands Terminal]], just west of the CBD. Journey Beyond\u2019s trains are the ''[[Indian Pacific]]'' to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[East Perth railway station|Perth]], ''[[The Ghan]]'' to [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]] and [[Darwin railway station|Darwin]], ''[[The Overland]]'' to [[Southern Cross railway station|Melbourne]] and the seasonal ''[[Great Southern (train)|Great Southern]]'' to [[Roma Street railway station|Brisbane]]. There have been no intrastate regional passenger services in South Australia since 1990.\n\nThere are presently two heritage railways in South Australia run by volunteers, but none of these are in the Adelaide area. The [[SteamRanger Heritage Railway]] is based at [[Mount Barker railway station|Mount Barker]] and runs services through to [[Victor Harbor railway station|Victor Harbor]]. The [[Pichi Richi Railway]] is considerably more distant from Adelaide, based at [[Quorn railway station|Quorn]], and runs services through to [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]].\n\n==History==\n===Early days===\nIn 1856, the first steam train ran between [[Adelaide]] and [[Port Adelaide]], stopping at [[Bowden railway station|Bowden]], [[Woodville railway station, Adelaide|Woodville]] and [[Alberton railway station, Adelaide|Alberton]].<ref>'''''The Adelaide, City and Port Railway''''' Callaghan, W.H. [[Australian Railway History]], April/May, 2005 pp. 123-138, 143\u2013149, 182\u2013195</ref> Soon after, a 40&nbsp;km line was built from the [[Gawler|Town of Gawler]] to [[Adelaide]] to cater for the agricultural and mining industries.\n\nThe South Line, through the [[Adelaide Hills]], opened to [[Aldgate, South Australia|Aldgate]], then [[Nairne, South Australia|Nairne]] in 1883, and extended to [[Bordertown, South Australia|Bordertown]] in 1886. The first through train between Adelaide and [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] \u2013 ''The Intercolonial Express'' \u2013 ran on 19 January 1887, and was the first intercapital rail journey in Australia without changing trains at a [[break-of-gauge]] station.\n\nMost of the lines around Adelaide were built before 1900.\n\n===The Webb Era===\nDespite the earlier geographic expansion, by 1920 the infrastructure and rolling stock of [[South Australian Railways]] (SAR) had become run down, inadequate and outdated. Many of the operating practices, such as train control and signalling, were backward by the standards of the time.\n\nHowever the 1920s saw substantial and expensive improvements in most facets of the SAR\u2019s operations under the leadership of Railways Commissioner [[William Alfred Webb|William Webb]]. Webb was an American who had substantial operational experience with US railroads, and served as Commissioner between 1922 and 1930.\n\nDuring his reign, track, bridges, railway workshops, rolling stock and especially steam locomotives were all modernised and upgraded along essentially American lines. [[Adelaide railway station|Adelaide station]] was rebuilt with a handsome sandstone building as a showpiece of the city on [[North Terrace]]. The building still stands; the lower level remains as the railway station, but the upper levels have been converted into a casino.\n\nIn 1929, one of the original broad-gauge steam [[Holdfast Bay railway line|railways to the beach-side suburb of Glenelg]] was transferred to the [[Adelaide]] [[Municipal Tramways Trust]], electrified and converted to a tramway. The [[Glenelg tram]] line is still in operation.\n\n===SAR, STA and AN===\nFrom early colonial days up until 1978 the SAR had built and operated most of the railway system within the state.\n\nThe [[Commonwealth Railways]] (CR), owned by the Federal Government, also had a significant role in the northern part of SA, with lines from Port Augusta across the [[Nullarbor Plain]] to [[Kalgoorlie railway station|Kalgoorlie]], and to [[Marree railway station|Marree]] and [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]]. None of its lines came close to Adelaide.\n\nDuring the early 1970s the [[First Whitlam Ministry|Whitlam Federal Government]] proposed a strategy to nationalise and standardise the various state rail systems around Australia. South Australia and [[Tasmanian Government Railways|Tasmania]] were the only states to participate in this initiative and negotiations were long and drawn out. The result was that in March 1978 the SAR became defunct and South Australia\u2019s railways were split between Commonwealth and State Government ownership.\n\nA new Commonwealth Government organisation, [[Australian National Railways Commission]] (ANR), took over all the former SAR and CR track in South Australia outside the metropolitan area. Other rail facilities such as property and workshops were also transferred to ANR. ANR become Australian National (AN) as it refined its corporate identity.\n\nThe State Government retained ownership and control of tracks and trains in the Adelaide suburban area under the auspices of the [[State Transport Authority (South Australia)|State Transport Authority]] (STA). The STA had been created in 1974 to co-ordinate all public transport in South Australia.\n\nIn 1994 the STA was abolished and reformed as the government-owned corporate body [[TransAdelaide]] as a prelude to competitive tendering for operation of bus and rail services in metropolitan Adelaide. TransAdelaide subsequently lost all its bus services to private operators, but has retained the contracts to operate train and tram services.\n\nIn November 1997, AN was broken up and sold as part of a Federal Government privatisation agenda. Track, workshops, depots and passenger and freight operations were sold to various private organisations, which has led to today\u2019s operational structure described in an earlier section.\n\n==Future projects==\n===Gawler Line electrification===\n\nFollowing a decade of on-again, off-again talks,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-18/gawler-rail-line-disruptions-delayed-until-after-election/9340788 |title=Liberal MP's 'nana's nightie' remark on Gawler rail electrification steals the spotlight |date=18 January 2018 |website=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=7 July 2018}}</ref> electrification of the Gawler line was announced in 2018.

needed|date=April 2008}} It is operated by [[Adelaide Metro]], and is part of the citywide Adelaide Metro public transport system.\n\nAll lines around Adelaide were originally [[5 ft 3 in gauge railways|broad gauge]] {{RailGauge|1600mm}}. The main interstate lines out of Adelaide towards [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[Perth]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] have been progressively converted to [[standard gauge]] {{RailGauge|1435mm}}, but the suburban system and a few freight-only branch lines to the north remain broad gauge.\n\n==Operators==\n[[Image:AdelaideRail 5.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[FreightLink]] Adelaide to Darwin freight train at [[Dry Creek railway station|Dry Creek]]]]\n[[Image:AdelaideRail 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Pacific National]] freight from Melbourne to Perth passing [[Belair railway station|Belair]] in the Adelaide Hills]]\n[[Image:AdelaideRail 8.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Australian Railroad Group]] ''[[Penrice Stone Train]]'' from the [[Barossa Valley railway line|Barossa Valley line]] to [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]] in [[Birkenhead, South Australia|Birkenhead]]]]\n[[Image:AdelaideRail 7.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|[[Journey Beyond]] ''[[Indian Pacific]]'' from Perth to Sydney near Hawker Street, Bowden]]\n\nRail services around Adelaide are provided by a mixture of private and government-owned organisations.\n\nThe [[Department of Planning, Transport & Infrastructure]] (DPTI) owns and operates the suburban passenger rail network. This comprises six lines from [[Adelaide railway station]] on [[North Terrace]] in the CBD. The DPTI also owns and operates the [[Glenelg tram line]]. Adelaide's tram network is the only fully government owned and operated tram network in Australia.\n\nThe [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] (ARTC), an agency of the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]], owns standard gauge interstate lines heading north and south, together with the [[dual gauge]] freight-only branch from [[Dry Creek-Port Adelaide railway line|Dry Creek to Port Adelaide]] and [[Pelican Point (Adelaide)|Pelican Point]]. The ARTC lines bypass the city to the west and do not enter the CBD. The ARTC network extends from Adelaide towards Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Darwin and is used by substantial interstate freight traffic.\n\nFreight trains are operated by a number of private operators, which have access agreements with rail network owners such as the ARTC. The largest of these is [[Pacific National]], which handles the majority of interstate traffic and has the largest locomotive fleet. Other logistics companies also operate freight trains to and from interstate destinations and within South Australia.\n\n[[One Rail Australia]] owns the remaining broad-gauge lines beyond the Adelaide suburban network. These are a handful of lines used mainly to move bulk grain and stone from the Barossa Valley and mid-north region of the state to the Port Adelaide area. \n\n[[Journey Beyond]] is a private company operating long-distance passenger trains on ARTCs standard gauge lines, and run from the [[Adelaide Parklands Terminal]], just west of the CBD. Journey Beyond\u2019s trains are the ''[[Indian Pacific]]'' to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] and [[East Perth railway station|Perth]], ''[[The Ghan]]'' to [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]] and [[Darwin railway station|Darwin]], ''[[The Overland]]'' to [[Southern Cross railway station|Melbourne]] and the seasonal ''[[Great Southern (train)|Great Southern]]'' to [[Roma Street railway station|Brisbane]]. There have been no intrastate regional passenger services in South Australia since 1990.\n\nThere are presently two heritage railways in South Australia run by volunteers, but none of these are in the Adelaide area. The [[SteamRanger Heritage Railway]] is based at [[Mount Barker railway station|Mount Barker]] and runs services through to [[Victor Harbor railway station|Victor Harbor]]. The [[Pichi Richi Railway]] is considerably more distant from Adelaide, based at [[Quorn railway station|Quorn]], and runs services through to [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]].\n\n==History==\n===Early days===\nIn 1856, the first steam train ran between [[Adelaide]] and [[Port Adelaide]], stopping at [[Bowden railway station|Bowden]], [[Woodville railway station, Adelaide|Woodville]] and [[Alberton railway station, Adelaide|Alberton]].<ref>'''''The Adelaide, City and Port Railway''''' Callaghan, W.H. [[Australian Railway History]], April/May, 2005 pp123-138;143-149;182-195</ref> Soon after, a 40&nbsp;km line was built from the [[Gawler|Town of Gawler]] to [[Adelaide]] to cater for the agricultural and mining industries.\n\nThe South Line, through the [[Adelaide Hills]], opened to [[Aldgate, South Australia|Aldgate]], then [[Nairne, South Australia|Nairne]] in 1883, and extended to [[Bordertown, South Australia|Bordertown]] in 1886. The first through train between Adelaide and [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] \u2013 ''The Intercolonial Express'' \u2013 ran on 19 January 1887, and was the first intercapital rail journey in Australia without changing trains at a [[break-of-gauge]] station.\n\nMost of the lines around Adelaide were built before 1900.\n\n===The Webb Era===\nDespite the earlier geographic expansion, by 1920 the infrastructure and rolling stock of [[South Australian Railways]] (SAR) had become run down, inadequate and outdated. Many of the operating practices, such as train control and signalling, were backward by the standards of the time.\n\nHowever the 1920s saw substantial and expensive improvements in most facets of the SAR\u2019s operations under the leadership of Railways Commissioner [[William Alfred Webb|William Webb]]. Webb was an American who had substantial operational experience with US railroads, and served as Commissioner between 1922 and 1930.\n\nDuring his reign, track, bridges, railway workshops, rolling stock and especially steam locomotives were all modernised and upgraded along essentially American lines. [[Adelaide railway station|Adelaide station]] was rebuilt with a handsome sandstone building as a showpiece of the city on [[North Terrace]]. The building still stands; the lower level remains as the railway station, but the upper levels have been converted into a casino.\n\nIn 1929, one of the original broad-gauge steam [[Holdfast Bay railway line|railways to the beach-side suburb of Glenelg]] was transferred to the [[Adelaide]] [[Municipal Tramways Trust]], electrified and converted to a tramway. The [[Glenelg tram]] line is still in operation.\n\n===SAR, STA and AN===\nFrom early colonial days up until 1978 the SAR had built and operated most of the railway system within the state.\n\nThe [[Commonwealth Railways]] (CR), owned by the Federal Government, also had a significant role in the northern part of SA, with lines from Port Augusta across the [[Nullarbor Plain]] to [[Kalgoorlie railway station|Kalgoorlie]], and to [[Marree railway station|Marree]] and [[Alice Springs railway station|Alice Springs]]. None of its lines came close to Adelaide.\n\nDuring the early 1970s the [[First Whitlam Ministry|Whitlam Federal Government]] proposed a strategy to nationalise and standardise the various state rail systems around Australia. South Australia and [[Tasmanian Government Railways|Tasmania]] were the only states to participate in this initiative and negotiations were long and drawn out. The result was that in March 1978 the SAR became defunct and South Australia\u2019s railways were split between Commonwealth and State Government ownership.\n\nA new Commonwealth Government organisation, [[Australian National Railways Commission]] (ANR), took over all the former SAR and CR track in South Australia outside the metropolitan area. Other rail facilities such as property and workshops were also transferred to ANR. ANR become Australian National (AN) as it refined its corporate identity.\n\nThe State Government retained ownership and control of tracks and trains in the Adelaide suburban area under the auspices of the [[State Transport Authority (South Australia)|State Transport Authority]] (STA). The STA had been created in 1974 to co-ordinate all public transport in South Australia.\n\nIn 1994 the STA was abolished and reformed as the government-owned corporate body [[TransAdelaide]] as a prelude to competitive tendering for operation of bus and rail services in metropolitan Adelaide. TransAdelaide subsequently lost all its bus services to private operators, but has retained the contracts to operate train and tram services.\n\nIn November 1997, AN was broken up and sold as part of a Federal Government privatisation agenda. Track, workshops, depots and passenger and freight operations were sold to various private organisations, which has led to today\u2019s operational structure described in an earlier section.\n\n==Future projects==\n===Gawler Line electrification===\n\nFollowing a decade of on-again, off-again talks,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-18/gawler-rail-line-disruptions-delayed-until-after-election/9340788 |title=Liberal MP's 'nana's nightie' remark on Gawler rail electrification steals the spotlight |date=18 January 2018 |website=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=7 July 2018}}</ref> electrification of the Gawler line was announced in 2018.

Using outward-opening doors allowed the DC-10's cargo area to be completely filled, since the door was not occupying usable interior space when open. To secure the door against the outward force from the [[pressurization]] of the fuselage at high altitudes, outward-opening doors must use heavy locking mechanisms. In the event of a door lock malfunction, there is great potential for explosive decompression.<ref name=waddington_p85-6>Waddington 2000, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\n====American Airlines Flight 96====\n{{main|American Airlines Flight 96}}\nA problem with the outward-opening cargo door first became publicly known on June 12, 1972, when [[American Airlines Flight 96]] lost its [[aft]] cargo door shortly after takeoff from [[Detroit Metro Airport]], in flight above [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Before Flight 96 took off, an airport employee had forced the door shut. Due to the cargo door's design, the door appeared to be securely locked despite the internal locking mechanism not being fully engaged. Subsequently, when the aircraft reached approximately {{convert|11750|ft|m}} in altitude, the rear cargo door blew out, causing an [[explosive decompression]] that created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse.<ref name=aci>\"Behind Closed Doors\". ''Air Crash Investigation, Mayday (TV series)''. [[National Geographic Channel]], Season 5, Number 2.</ref> This collapsed section of the floor cut or impeded many of the control cables to the [[empennage]] control systems necessary to fly the aircraft, which were routed through the floor beams, leaving the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.<ref name=fielder_birsch_p94/><ref name=fielder_birsch_p94>Fielder and Birsch 1992, p. 94.</ref><ref>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR73-02.pdf \"NTSB-AAR-73-02 Report, Aircraft Accident Report: American Airlines, Inc.

The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found that it was possible to close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo-door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. Following the Windsor accident investigation, the NTSB made several recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design to make it impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the locking pins being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor, so that in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems.<ref name=aci /> Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no [[airworthiness directive]] was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between the head of the FAA, [[John H. Shaffer]], and the head of McDonnell Douglas's aircraft division, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.<ref name=aci />\n\n====Turkish Airlines Flight 981====\n{{main|Turkish Airlines Flight 981}}\nOn March 3, 1974, an almost identical cargo-door blowout caused [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] to crash into a forest near the town of [[Ermenonville]], France, shortly after leaving Paris.<ref name=aci />  All 346 people on board died;<ref name=TA_Flt_981/> it was one of the deadliest air crashes of all time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19740304&id=p-tRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RnMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4842,3446994 \"Plane crash in France kills 346\"].

Fitch|Dennis E. \"Denny\" Fitch]]), performed an emergency landing by constantly adjusting the thrust of the remaining two engines. The crew managed to fly the aircraft onto the runway in a partially controlled manner, and 185 of the 296 people on board survived (111 died) despite the destruction of the aircraft during the crash landing.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06/>\n\nThe DC-10 included no cable backup for the hydraulic-powered flight controls because it was considered nearly impossible for three hydraulic systems to fail during one flight, and that the control surfaces were too large to be moved without hydraulic assistance. All three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06>\"NTSB/AAR-90/06, Aircraft Accident Report United Airlines Flight 232, McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40, Sioux Gateway Airport, Sioux City, Iowa, July 19, 1989\" [http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/AAR9006.html summary], [http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104033524/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf |date=January 4, 2011}}. ''NTSB'', November 1, 1990.</ref>\n\nFollowing the UAL 232 accident, [[Fuse (hydraulic)|hydraulic fuses]] were installed in the #3 hydraulic system in the area below the #2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure that sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. It is still possible to lose all three hydraulic systems elsewhere. This nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main-gear tire exploded in the wheel well. The damage in the left wing area caused total loss of pressure from the #1 and the #2 hydraulic systems.

One cabin window separated from the fuselage after it was struck by debris flung from the exploding engine. The passenger sitting next to that window was killed and ejected from the aircraft. The crew initiated an emergency descent, and landed the aircraft safely.<ref name=job>[[Mcarthur Job]]. Air Disaster Volume 1.

All 168 passengers and crew survived. This is the first hull loss of a DC-10 aircraft.\n* November 12, 1975: [[Overseas National Airways|ONA]] Flight 032, a DC-10 on a ferry flight struck a heavy flock of seagulls while on its takeoff roll from JFK International Airport, New York. The captain aborted below V1 speed, but the #3 engine exploded, causing a partial braking failure. The landing gear collapsed and fire eventually destroyed the plane. All 139 ONA employees on board survived. Two were seriously injured, while 30 others had minor injuries.<ref>NTSB report, Identification: DCA76AZ010</ref>{{specify|This cite needs filling out|date=March 2014}}\n* January 2, 1976: An ONA DC-10 experienced an undershoot on a short runway in Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft touched the ground and crash landed, then a fire in the #1 engine started. The aircraft was destroyed. All passengers survived.<ref>NTSB report, Identification: DCA76RA017</ref>{{specify|This cite needs filling out|date=March 2014}} \n* March 1, 1978: [[Continental Airlines Flight 603]], a DC-10-10, began its take-off from Los Angeles International Airport. Approaching V1 in the takeoff roll, the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire on the left main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out. The blowouts ruptured a fuel tank, which combined with the excessive heat from the aborted take off maneuver, resulted in a massive fire. Two passengers were killed in the ensuing evacuation and two died later from injuries sustained in the accident.\n* October 31, 1979: [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]], a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground. The crash was caused by failure to follow proper landing guidelines in consideration of the fog on the runway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19791031-0|title=Accident description|last=|first=|date=|website=Aviation-safety.net|publisher=|access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n* November 11, 1979: an Aeromexico DC-10 entered a sustained stall while climbing through 29,800&nbsp;ft, to its assigned cruise altitude of 31,000&nbsp;ft, over [[Luxembourg]], Europe. The flight crew failed to monitor their flight instruments, so they did not immediately recognize that the plane was in a stalled condition. Instead, they blamed the heavy buffeting on the #3 engine, which they shut down, while continuing to hold the nose up. The plane continued to descend for one minute in a fully stalled condition, until the pilots lowered the nose and began a proper stall recovery procedure, which was completed at 18,900&nbsp;ft. The #3 engine was then restarted, the declaration of emergency was canceled and the flight continued to [[Miami, Florida]]. Ground inspection revealed four feet missing from each of the outboard elevator tips, including the balance weights.  The NTSB concluded that the sustained stall buffeting produced a dynamic structural overload on the elevator, which resulted in the failure of the elevator tips and balance weights. Further, the NTSB concluded that the autopilot had improperly been placed in vertical speed mode. That forced the AP to keep increasing the angle of attack to maintain the preselected vertical speed number, because maximum available engine thrust declined (normally) with increasing altitude. That caused the airspeed to fall below the stall speed of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1979-11-11-US.pdf  \"In-flight upset, Aeromexico, DC-10-30, XA-DUH, over Luxembourg, Europe, November 11, 1979\"].

This was a shock to Lockheed and there was general agreement within the U.S. aviation industry that American Airlines had left its competitors at the starting gate.

Using outward-opening doors allowed the DC-10's cargo area to be completely filled, since the door was not occupying usable interior space when open. To secure the door against the outward force from the [[pressurization]] of the fuselage at high altitudes, outward-opening doors must use heavy locking mechanisms. In the event of a door lock malfunction, there is great potential for explosive decompression.<ref name=waddington_p85-6>Waddington 2000, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\n====American Airlines Flight 96====\n{{main|American Airlines Flight 96}}\nA problem with the outward-opening cargo door first became publicly known on June 12, 1972, when [[American Airlines Flight 96]] lost its [[aft]] cargo door shortly after takeoff from [[Detroit Metro Airport]], in flight above [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Before Flight 96 took off, an airport employee had forced the door shut. Due to the cargo door's design, the door appeared to be securely locked despite the internal locking mechanism not being fully engaged. Subsequently, when the aircraft reached approximately {{convert|11750|ft|m}} in altitude, the rear cargo door blew out, causing an [[explosive decompression]] that created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse.<ref name=aci>\"Behind Closed Doors\". ''Air Crash Investigation, Mayday (TV series)''. [[National Geographic Channel]], Season 5, Number 2.</ref> This collapsed section of the floor cut or impeded many of the control cables to the [[empennage]] control systems necessary to fly the aircraft, which were routed through the floor beams, leaving the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.<ref name=fielder_birsch_p94/><ref name=fielder_birsch_p94>Fielder and Birsch 1992, p. 94.</ref><ref>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR73-02.pdf \"NTSB-AAR-73-02 Report, Aircraft Accident Report: American Airlines, Inc.

The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found that it was possible to close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo-door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. Following the Windsor accident investigation, the NTSB made several recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design to make it impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the locking pins being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor, so that in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems.<ref name=aci /> Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no [[airworthiness directive]] was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between the head of the FAA, [[John H. Shaffer]], and the head of McDonnell Douglas's aircraft division, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.<ref name=aci />\n\n====Turkish Airlines Flight 981====\n{{main|Turkish Airlines Flight 981}}\nOn March 3, 1974, an almost identical cargo-door blowout caused [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] to crash into a forest near the town of [[Ermenonville]], France, shortly after leaving Paris.<ref name=aci />  All 346 people on board died;<ref name=TA_Flt_981/> it was one of the deadliest air crashes of all time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19740304&id=p-tRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RnMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4842,3446994 \"Plane crash in France kills 346\"].

It grounded 138 U.S.-registered DC-10s, along with DC-10s from other nations with bilateral agreements with the United States, regarding aircraft certifications, and banned all other DC-10s from U.S. airspace. Even [[ferry flying]] within U.S. airspace was forbidden except to allow foreign air carriers to return their DC-10s to overseas maintenance bases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awin.aviationweek.com/Portals/aweek/media/DC-10/DC-10-1.html |title=DC-10 Type Certificate Lifted |website=awin.aviationweek.com |access-date=December 11, 2017}}</ref> These measures were rescinded five weeks later on July 13, 1979, after modifications were made to the slat actuation and position systems, along with stall warning and power supply changes.<ref name=AAR79-17 /><ref name=Endres_p63-4>Endres 1998, pp. 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) officials discovered that a maintenance procedure was the cause of the accident. American Airlines mechanics had removed the engine and its pylon as a unit, rather than removing the engine from the pylon, then removing the pylon from the wing, as recommended by McDonnell Douglas. The faulty procedure was done using a [[forklift]], which resulted in inadvertent structural damage. It was subsequently discovered that this short-cut procedure, believed to save many man-hours on maintenance, was being used by three major airlines, although McDonnell Douglas had advised against it.<ref name=AAR79-17>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR79-17.pdf \"Aircraft Accident report, DC-10-10, N110A, NTSB, 1979\"].

The panel's report, published in June 1980, found \"critical deficiencies in the way the Government certifies the safety of American-built airliners\". This conclusion was echoed nearly 40 years later in the inquiries into the [[Boeing 737 MAX groundings|2019 grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theaircurrent.com/historical-context/searching-for-40-year-old-lessons-for-boeing-in-the-grounding-of-the-dc-10/|title=Searching for 40-year old lessons for Boeing in the grounding of the DC-10|date=2019-10-15|website=The Air Current|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>{{vs|date=November 2019}}\n\n====United Airlines Flight 232====\nAnother major DC-10 crash was the [[United Airlines Flight 232]] crash at [[Sioux City, Iowa]], on July 19, 1989. The number two (tail) engine suffered an uncontained fan disk failure in flight, which damaged all three hydraulic systems and rendered the hydraulic flight controls inoperable. The flight crew, led by Captain [[Alfred C. Haynes|Al Haynes]] and assisted by DC-10 flight instructor [[Deadheading (aviation)|flying as a passenger]] ([[Dennis E. Fitch|Dennis E. \"Denny\" Fitch]]), performed an emergency landing by constantly adjusting the thrust of the remaining two engines. The crew managed to fly the aircraft onto the runway in a partially controlled manner, and 185 of the 296 people on board survived (111 died) despite the destruction of the aircraft during the crash landing.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06/>\n\nThe DC-10 included no cable backup for the hydraulic-powered flight controls because it was considered nearly impossible for three hydraulic systems to fail during one flight, and that the control surfaces were too large to be moved without hydraulic assistance. All three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06>\"NTSB/AAR-90/06, Aircraft Accident Report United Airlines Flight 232, McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40, Sioux Gateway Airport, Sioux City, Iowa, July 19, 1989\" [http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/AAR9006.html summary], [http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104033524/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf |date=January 4, 2011}}.

It is still possible to lose all three hydraulic systems elsewhere. This nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main-gear tire exploded in the wheel well. The damage in the left wing area caused total loss of pressure from the #1 and the #2 hydraulic systems. The #3 system was dented but not penetrated.<ref name=NTSB_Letter_2003>[https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20020510X00653&ntsbno=WAS02RA037&akey=1 \"WAS02RA037, NTSB Factual Report\"].

One cabin window separated from the fuselage after it was struck by debris flung from the exploding engine. The passenger sitting next to that window was killed and ejected from the aircraft. The crew initiated an emergency descent, and landed the aircraft safely.<ref name=job>[[Mcarthur Job]]. Air Disaster Volume 1.

All 168 passengers and crew survived. This is the first hull loss of a DC-10 aircraft.\n* November 12, 1975: [[Overseas National Airways|ONA]] Flight 032, a DC-10 on a ferry flight struck a heavy flock of seagulls while on its takeoff roll from JFK International Airport, New York. The captain aborted below V1 speed, but the #3 engine exploded, causing a partial braking failure. The landing gear collapsed and fire eventually destroyed the plane.

All passengers survived.<ref>NTSB report, Identification: DCA76RA017</ref>{{specify|This cite needs filling out|date=March 2014}} \n* March 1, 1978: [[Continental Airlines Flight 603]], a DC-10-10, began its take-off from Los Angeles International Airport. Approaching V1 in the takeoff roll, the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire on the left main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out. The blowouts ruptured a fuel tank, which combined with the excessive heat from the aborted take off maneuver, resulted in a massive fire. Two passengers were killed in the ensuing evacuation and two died later from injuries sustained in the accident.\n* October 31, 1979: [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]], a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground. The crash was caused by failure to follow proper landing guidelines in consideration of the fog on the runway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19791031-0|title=Accident description|last=|first=|date=|website=Aviation-safety.net|publisher=|access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n* November 11, 1979: an Aeromexico DC-10 entered a sustained stall while climbing through 29,800&nbsp;ft, to its assigned cruise altitude of 31,000&nbsp;ft, over [[Luxembourg]], Europe. The flight crew failed to monitor their flight instruments, so they did not immediately recognize that the plane was in a stalled condition. Instead, they blamed the heavy buffeting on the #3 engine, which they shut down, while continuing to hold the nose up. The plane continued to descend for one minute in a fully stalled condition, until the pilots lowered the nose and began a proper stall recovery procedure, which was completed at 18,900&nbsp;ft. The #3 engine was then restarted, the declaration of emergency was canceled and the flight continued to [[Miami, Florida]]. Ground inspection revealed four feet missing from each of the outboard elevator tips, including the balance weights.  The NTSB concluded that the sustained stall buffeting produced a dynamic structural overload on the elevator, which resulted in the failure of the elevator tips and balance weights. Further, the NTSB concluded that the autopilot had improperly been placed in vertical speed mode. That forced the AP to keep increasing the angle of attack to maintain the preselected vertical speed number, because maximum available engine thrust declined (normally) with increasing altitude. That caused the airspeed to fall below the stall speed of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1979-11-11-US.pdf  \"In-flight upset, Aeromexico, DC-10-30, XA-DUH, over Luxembourg, Europe, November 11, 1979\"].

When MCAS detects that the aircraft is operating in manual flight, with flaps up, at an elevated angle of attack (AoA), it adjusts the horizontal stabilizer trim to add positive force feedback (a \"nose heavy\" feel), through the control column, so the pilot will not inadvertently pull the airplane up too steeply, potentially causing a [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|stall]]. Contrary to descriptions in news reports, however, Boeing claims that MCAS is not an anti-stall system. Stabilizer movement commanded by MCAS pushes down the nose of the airplane automatically without pilot input.\n\nMCAS on the MAX was designed to activate using input from only one of the airplane's two angle of attack sensors, making the system susceptible to a [[single point of failure]]. Boeing omitted a description of MCAS from MAX flight manuals, leaving pilots unaware of the system when the airplane entered service.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Laris |first1=Michael |title=Changes to flawed Boeing 737 Max were kept from pilots, DeFazio says |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/changes-to-flawed-boeing-737-max-were-kept-from-pilots-defazio-says/2019/06/19/553522f0-92bc-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=29 February 2020 |date=June 19, 2019}}</ref> In April 2019, Boeing admitted that MCAS played a role in the fatal crashes of [[Lion Air Flight 610]] and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]]. The first time Boeing publicly revealed the existence of MCAS on the 737 MAX was in a message to airline operators and other aviation interests on November 10, 2018, twelve days after the Lion Air crash.<ref name=\"AvHerald\">{{cite web |last1=Hradecky |first1=Simon |title=Crash: Lion B38M near Jakarta on Oct 29th 2018, aircraft lost height and crashed into Java Sea, wrong AoA data |url=http://avherald.com/h?article=4bf90724/0009&opt=0 |website=The Aviation Herald |accessdate=2 March 2020 |date=January 14, 2019}}</ref> Boeing had also been aware of other software issues that suppressed a crucial AoA disagree message. With no knowledge of MCAS and its behavior, the pilots of the Lion Air flight, the first to crash, were at a disadvantage when attempting to respond to the system's erroneous activation. Procedures emphasized by Boeing and the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] did not prevent the later Ethiopian Airlines crash, which led to {{No selflink|Boeing 737 MAX groundings|the worldwide grounding}} of the airliner. \n\nMCAS was first deployed on the Boeing [[KC-46]] Air Force tanker, where it \"similarly moves the stabilizer in a wind-up turn\".<ref name=\"seattletimes.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/the-inside-story-of-mcas-how-boeings-737-max-system-gained-power-and-lost-safeguards/|title=The inside story of MCAS: How Boeing's 737 MAX system gained power and lost safeguards|date=2019-06-22|website=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref> Unlike the 737 MAX, however, MCAS could be overridden on the KC-46 by pulling back on its control column. The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2019 that Boeing failed to share information about that issue for \"about a year\" before the Lion Air crash in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal |page=A1 | title=Boeing Knew of Problem for a Year |author1=Andy Pasztor |author2= Andrew Tangel |author3=Alison Sider |date=May 6, 2019}}</ref>\n<section end=\"summary\" />\n\n== MCAS on the 737 MAX ==\n<!-- Affected four system elements: 1.

A runaway stabilizer has continuous un-commanded movement of the tail, whereas MCAS is not continuous and pilots (theoretically) can counter the nose-down movement, after which MCAS would move the aircraft tail down again. Moreover, unlike runaway stabilizer, MCAS disables the control column response that 737 pilots have grown accustomed to and relied upon in earlier generations of 737 aircraft.</blockquote>\n\nIn May 2019, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' reported that the two stabilizer cutoff switches on the MAX operate differently than on the earlier 737 NG. On previous aircraft, one cutoff switch deactivates the thumb buttons on the control yoke that pilots use to move the horizontal stabilizer; the other cutoff switch disables automatic control (as from autopilot) to move the stabilizer in the tail. On the MAX, both switches do the same thing: they cut off all electric power to the stabilizer, both from the yoke buttons and from an automatic system, like MCAS. With all power to the stabilizer cut, pilots have no choice but to use the mechanical trim wheel in the center console.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-altered-key-switches-in-737-max-cockpit-limiting-ability-to-shut-off-mcas/|title=Boeing altered key switches in 737 MAX cockpit, limiting ability to shut off MCAS|date=2019-05-10|website=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> However, as pilots pull on the 737 controls to raise the nose of the aircraft, aerodynamic forces on the elevator create an opposing force, effectively paralyzing the jackscrew mechanism.<ref\n      name=\"jscrew\">{{Cite web\n | url=              https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/vestigal-design-issue-clouds-737-max-crash-investigations/|title=Vestigal design issue clouds 737 MAX crash investigations\n | date=            2019-04-04\n    }}</ref>> It becomes very difficult for pilots to hand crank the trim wheel.<ref\n  name=\"jscrew\"/> The problem was encountered on earlier 737 versions, and a \"roller coaster\" emergency technique for handling the flight condition was documented in 1982 for the 737-200 but did not appear in training documentation for later versions (including the MAX).<ref\n  name=\"jscrew\"/>\n\nDuring the groundings, special flights to reposition MAX aircraft to storage locations, as per 14 CFR \u00a7 21.197, flew at lower [[flight level|altitude]] and with [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] extended to circumvent MCAS activation, rather than using the recovery procedure after the fact.

The trim is actuated via a [[jackscrew]] mechanism.\n\n====Slippage concern====\nSylvain Alarie and Gilles Primeau, experts on the horizontal stabilizers, observed anomalies in the data from the aircraft data recorders: a progressive shift of 0.2 degrees of the horizontal stabilizer, before the crash. \"It may not seem like much, but it is an order of magnitude higher than what is normally allowed when designing systems like these\", says Gilles Primeau. They say that the movements are easily observable, and disallowed according to Regulation 395A. These anomalies raise fundamental questions about this jack screw, which controls the horizontal stabilizer since the beginning of the 737 models, first certified in 1967.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite web|url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1382157/boeing-737-max-experts-questions-enquete-verin-systeme-anomalie-aeronautique|title=Des r\u00e9v\u00e9lations troublantes sur le Boeing 737 MAX 8|last=ICI.Radio-Canada.ca|first=Zone \u00c9conomie-|website=Radio-Canada.ca|language=fr-ca|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\nThese slips are particularly visible on flight ET302: \"While there is no MCAS command, and no control of the pilots, we see a movement of the jack screw which controls the horizontal stabilizer, we see a slip. And at the very end of the flight, the jack screw starts to slide again with an increase in the speed of the plane and its dive,\" says Alarie.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nSince its original design, the 737 has become 61% heavier, 24% longer, and 40% wider, and its engines twice as powerful.\nThese experts are concerned that the loads on the jack screw have potentially increased since the creation of the 737. By regulations, the controls must be designed for 125% of the foreseeable loads.<ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airinsight.com/more-bad-news-for-boeing-over-the-weekend/|title=November 2019: More Bad News for Boeing over the Weekend|date=2019-11-11|access-date=2019-11-11|website=airinsight.com|last=Arvai|first=Ernest}}\n</ref> These experts have raised concerns about the motors possibly overheating in April 2019.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Boeing a-t-il fait preuve de n\u00e9gligence?|trans-title=Was Boeing negligent?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbY5P-ylYS4|language=fr|access-date=2019-11-14|last=|first=|date=April 1, 2019|publisher=Radio-Canada info}}</ref>\n\n====Manual trim stiffness====\nIn the early 1980s a problem was found with the 737-200 model. When the elevator operated to raise or lower the nose, it set up a strong force on the trim jackscrew which opposed any corrective force from the control systems. When attempting to correct an unwanted deflection using the manual trim wheel, exerting enough hand force to overcome the force exerted by the elevator became increasingly difficult as speed and deflection increased and the jack screw effectively jammed in place.<ref name=\"ostrower\">Jon Ostrower; \"[https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/vestigal-design-issue-clouds-737-max-crash-investigations/ Vestigial design issue clouds 737 Max crash investigations]\", ''The Air Current'', April 4, 2019. (retrieved November 21, 2019)</ref>\n\nA workaround was developed called the \"roller coaster\" technique. Counter-intuitively, to correct an excessive deflection causing a dive the pilot first pushes the nose down further, before easing back to gently raise the nose again. During this easing back period, the elevator deflection reduces or even reverses, its force on the jackscrew does likewise and the manual trim eases up. The workaround was included in the pilot's emergency procedures and in the training schedule.<ref name=\"ostrower\"/>\n\nHowever while the 737 Max has a similar jackscrew mechanism the \"roller coaster\" technique has been dropped from the pilot information. During the events leading to the two Max crashes, the stiffness of the manual trim wheel repeatedly prevented manual trim adjustment to correct the MCAS-induced nose-down pitching. The issue has been brought to the notice of the DoJ criminal inquiry into the 737 Max crashes.<ref name=\"ostrower\"/>\n\nIn simulator tests of [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] flight scenario, the trim wheel was \"impossible\" to move when one of the pilots would instinctively pull up from the nosedives. It takes 15 turns to manually trim the aircraft one degree, and up to 40 turns to bring the trim back to neutral from the nose down position caused by MCAS.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/safety/simulator-tests-demonstrate-737-max-manual-trim-difficulties/137651.article |title= Simulator tests demonstrate 737 Max manual trim difficulties |last= Hemmerdinger |first= Jon |website= FlightGlobal |date= 2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite video |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QytfYyHmxtc |title= Rogue Boeing 737 Max planes \u2018with minds of their own\u2019 |author= 60 Minutes Australia |date= May 5, 2019 |via= YouTube |quote= MCAS was designed using data from only one of the sensors because we knew the FAA would not have certified a two sensor system without level D [simulator] training}}\n* {{cite video |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2tuKiiznsY|title=The real reason Boeing's new plane crashed twice |author= [[Vox (website)#Video|Vox Videos]] |date= Apr 15, 2019|via= Youtube}}\n* {{Cite video |author= Mentour Pilot|title=Boeing 737 Unable to Trim!!

When MCAS detects that the aircraft is operating in manual flight, with flaps up, at an elevated angle of attack (AoA), it adjusts the horizontal stabilizer trim to add positive force feedback (a \"nose heavy\" feel), through the control column, so the pilot will not inadvertently pull the airplane up too steeply, potentially causing a [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|stall]]. Contrary to descriptions in news reports, however, Boeing claims that MCAS is not an anti-stall system. Stabilizer movement commanded by MCAS pushes down the nose of the airplane automatically without pilot input.\n\nMCAS on the MAX was designed to activate using input from only one of the airplane's two angle of attack sensors, making the system susceptible to a [[single point of failure]].

A runaway stabilizer has continuous un-commanded movement of the tail, whereas MCAS is not continuous and pilots (theoretically) can counter the nose-down movement, after which MCAS would move the aircraft tail down again. Moreover, unlike runaway stabilizer, MCAS disables the control column response that 737 pilots have grown accustomed to and relied upon in earlier generations of 737 aircraft.</blockquote>\n\nIn May 2019, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' reported that the two stabilizer cutoff switches on the MAX operate differently than on the earlier 737 NG. On previous aircraft, one cutoff switch deactivates the thumb buttons on the control yoke that pilots use to move the horizontal stabilizer; the other cutoff switch disables automatic control (as from autopilot) to move the stabilizer in the tail. On the MAX, both switches do the same thing: they cut off all electric power to the stabilizer, both from the yoke buttons and from an automatic system, like MCAS. With all power to the stabilizer cut, pilots have no choice but to use the mechanical trim wheel in the center console.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-altered-key-switches-in-737-max-cockpit-limiting-ability-to-shut-off-mcas/|title=Boeing altered key switches in 737 MAX cockpit, limiting ability to shut off MCAS|date=2019-05-10|website=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> However, as pilots pull on the 737 controls to raise the nose of the aircraft, aerodynamic forces on the elevator create an opposing force, effectively paralyzing the jackscrew mechanism.<ref\n      name=\"jscrew\">{{Cite web\n | url=              https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/vestigal-design-issue-clouds-737-max-crash-investigations/|title=Vestigal design issue clouds 737 MAX crash investigations\n | date=            2019-04-04\n    }}</ref>> It becomes very difficult for pilots to hand crank the trim wheel.<ref\n  name=\"jscrew\"/> The problem was encountered on earlier 737 versions, and a \"roller coaster\" emergency technique for handling the flight condition was documented in 1982 for the 737-200 but did not appear in training documentation for later versions (including the MAX).<ref\n  name=\"jscrew\"/>\n\nDuring the groundings, special flights to reposition MAX aircraft to storage locations, as per 14 CFR \u00a7 21.197, flew at lower [[flight level|altitude]] and with [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] extended to circumvent MCAS activation, rather than using the recovery procedure after the fact.

They say that the movements are easily observable, and disallowed according to Regulation 395A. These anomalies raise fundamental questions about this jack screw, which controls the horizontal stabilizer since the beginning of the 737 models, first certified in 1967.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite web|url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1382157/boeing-737-max-experts-questions-enquete-verin-systeme-anomalie-aeronautique|title=Des r\u00e9v\u00e9lations troublantes sur le Boeing 737 MAX 8|last=ICI.Radio-Canada.ca|first=Zone \u00c9conomie-|website=Radio-Canada.ca|language=fr-ca|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\nThese slips are particularly visible on flight ET302: \"While there is no MCAS command, and no control of the pilots, we see a movement of the jack screw which controls the horizontal stabilizer, we see a slip.

When the elevator operated to raise or lower the nose, it set up a strong force on the trim jackscrew which opposed any corrective force from the control systems. When attempting to correct an unwanted deflection using the manual trim wheel, exerting enough hand force to overcome the force exerted by the elevator became increasingly difficult as speed and deflection increased and the jack screw effectively jammed in place.<ref name=\"ostrower\">Jon Ostrower; \"[https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/vestigal-design-issue-clouds-737-max-crash-investigations/ Vestigial design issue clouds 737 Max crash investigations]\", ''The Air Current'', April 4, 2019. (retrieved November 21, 2019)</ref>\n\nA workaround was developed called the \"roller coaster\" technique. Counter-intuitively, to correct an excessive deflection causing a dive the pilot first pushes the nose down further, before easing back to gently raise the nose again. During this easing back period, the elevator deflection reduces or even reverses, its force on the jackscrew does likewise and the manual trim eases up. The workaround was included in the pilot's emergency procedures and in the training schedule.<ref name=\"ostrower\"/>\n\nHowever while the 737 Max has a similar jackscrew mechanism the \"roller coaster\" technique has been dropped from the pilot information. During the events leading to the two Max crashes, the stiffness of the manual trim wheel repeatedly prevented manual trim adjustment to correct the MCAS-induced nose-down pitching.

The series narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]s\". In the story, Slayers, or the \u201dChosen Ones\u201d, are \"called\" (chosen by [[destiny|fate]]) to battle against [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], [[demon]]s, and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches, and trains her.

Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by \"Ripper\"), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.\n\nBuffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and [[coming out|comes out]] as a [[lesbian]]. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the \"[[Big Bad]]\". Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].\n\nThe cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (\"[[Becoming, Part Two]]\"). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five (\"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\"). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.\n\nAt Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the \"Scooby Gang\" or \"Scoobies\". [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Jenny Calendar]] ([[Robia LaMorte]]), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.\n\nIn Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was \"called\" forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.\n\nBuffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joins the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in \"the Initiative\", which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees [[geek]]y wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.\n\n''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the \"Big Bad\" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.\n\n===Setting and filming locations===\n{{Main|Sunnydale}}\n[[File:Torrance High School.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School.]]\nThe show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a \"Hellmouth\", a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and \"[[High school (North America)|High school]] as [[Hell]]\" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, \"Young Blood\", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: \"[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week.\"</ref>\n\nMost of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]], the same high school used for [[Beverly Hills, 90210]].<ref name=\"torrence\">\"[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html Buffy the Vampire Slayer film locations]\", ''Movie-locations.com''</ref> The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">{{cite video |title=Designing Buffy Featurette |medium=dvd |year=1998 |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video}}</ref> In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways, and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair.

While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the \"Scooby Gang\", who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.<ref name=\"FtF-Intro\" /> The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine.

PLEASE DO NOT ENLARGE IT. ALSO, KEEP IN MIND THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT BTVS. KEEP IT SIMPLE! -->\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 1)|Season one]] exemplifies the \"high school is hell\" concept. [[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil throughout the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.\n\nThe emotional stakes are raised in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2)|season two]]. Vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (weakened from a mob in [[Prague]], which, it is implied, caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with a new slayer, [[Kendra Young]], who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the [[Prophecy Girl|season one finale]]. Xander becomes involved with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]], who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] develops over the course of the season, but after they have sex, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost, and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the \"Scooby Gang\" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles' new girlfriend [[Jenny Calendar]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] who was sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angel to a demon dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.\n\nAfter attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|season three]]. Angel has mysteriously been released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to [[suicide]] by the [[First Evil]]. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles' place when Giles is fired from the Watcher's Council because he has developed a \"father's love\" for Buffy; and towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]], the Slayer activated after Kendra's death. She also encounters the affable [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]], who secretly has plans to \"ascend\" (become a \"pure\" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Season four]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head that punishes him whenever he tries to harm a human. He makes a truce with the Scooby Gang and begins to fight on their side, purely for the joy of fighting, upon learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a graduate student and member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|season five]], a younger sister, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], an exiled Hell God who is searching for a [[The Key (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|\"Key\"]] that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors have used Buffy's blood to turn the Key into human form \u2013 Dawn \u2013 concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]] dies of a brain [[aneurysm]], while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her, using Dawn's blood to open a portal to the Hell dimension. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal and thus closes it with her death.\n\nAt the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)|season six]], Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in [[Heaven]] and is devastated to be pulled back to Earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn, and develops a secret, mutually abusive sexual relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from [[kleptomania]] and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffyverse)|The Trio]], a group of [[nerd]]s led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to \"return him to what he used to be\" so that he can \"give Buffy what she deserves\". After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|season seven]], it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused instability that is allowing the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive [[Potential Slayers]], and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful [[Turok-Han]] vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight The First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, [[misogyny|misogynistic]] preacher known as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population \u2013 humans and demons alike \u2013 flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb, and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern, while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers. Anya dies in the fight, as do some of the new Slayers. Spike's amulet channels the power of the sun to destroy the Hellmouth and all the vampires within it, including himself. The collapse of the cavern creates a crater that swallows all of Sunnydale, while the survivors of the battle escape in a [[school bus]]. In the final scene, as the survivors survey the crater, Dawn asks, \"What are we going to do now?\" Buffy slowly begins to enigmatically smile as she contemplates the future ahead of her, ending the series on a hopeful note.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Joss Whedon by Gage Skidmore 8.jpg|200px|thumb|''Buffy'' creator Joss Whedon also served as executive producer, head writer, and director on the series.]]\nWriter [[Joss Whedon]] says that \"Rhonda the Immortal Waitress\" was really the first incarnation of the ''Buffy'' concept, \"the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary\".<ref>{{cite AV media |title=''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'': Television with a Bite |people=Jack Walworth (Director), [[Bill Mumy]] (Narrator) |series=[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]] |via=''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)#DVD release|Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 6)]]'' DVD set, disc 6 ([[DVD region code|region 1]] release: May 25, 2004) |date=May 14, 2003 |minutes=2:15 |publisher=[[A&E Network]]}}</ref> This early, unproduced idea evolved into ''Buffy'', which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every [[horror film|horror movie]]\".<ref name=blondegirl>{{cite book |last=Billson |first=Anne |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |date=December 5, 2005 |pages=24\u201325|title-link=Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BFI TV Classics) }}</ref> Whedon wanted \"to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero\".<ref name=blondegirl /> He explained, \"The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Gottlieb |first=Allie |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.26.02/buffy1-0239.html |title=Buffy's Angels |publisher=Metroactive.com |date=September 26, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe idea was first visited through Whedon's script for the 1992 movie ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', which featured [[Kristy Swanson]] in the title role.

Then the episode's story was \"broken\" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the [[television advertisement|commercial break]]. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once \"breaking\" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the showrunner.

The series was created by ''Buffy'''s creator [[Joss Whedon]] in collaboration with [[David Greenwalt]]. Like ''Buffy'', it was produced by the production company [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]]. At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen ratings]] than its parent series did.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\"/>\n\nThe series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to \"help the helpless\", to restore the faith and \"save the souls\" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram & Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.\n\nIn addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' series cast regular [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]). When [[Glenn Quinn]] ([[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]]) left the series during its first season, [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of ''Buffy'', took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]). Several actors and actresses who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]]), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]), [[Julie Benz]] ([[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]), [[Mark Metcalf]] ([[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]]), [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] ([[Anne Steele (Buffyverse)|Anne Steele]]) and [[Juliet Landau]] ([[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.\n\nOther actors that appeared in both the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel'' series but as different characters include: Bob Fimiani as Mr. Ward, a head of the Department of Defense in ''Buffy'' and Glith-roo, a Codger Demon in ''Angel''; [[Carlos Jacott]] as a demon named Ken in ''Buffy'' and a different demon named Richard Stanley in ''Angel''; [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as a vampire and former classmate in ''Buffy'' named Holden Webster and Knox, a Wolfram and Heart scientist in ''Angel''; and [[Andy Umberger]] who played a demon name D'Hoffryn in ''Buffy'' and predator named Ronald Meltzer in ''Angel''.\n\nThe storyline has been continued in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' published by [[IDW Publishing]] and later ''[[Angel and Faith]]'' published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n===Expanded universe===\n{{Main|Buffyverse canon|Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|List of Buffyverse comics}}\n[[File:Long way home tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Trade paperback cover of ''Buffy: Season Eight'' [[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|Volume One]], written by Joss Whedon.]]\nOutside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]\". The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] has published the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|''Buffy'' comics]] since 1998.<ref>\"[http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/98-372-a/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-1-photo-cover Buffy the Vampire Slayer#1]\" ''Dark Horse Comics'' (\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1\" released September 23, 1998).</ref> In 2003, Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled ''[[Fray (comic)|Fray]]'', about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off\u2014taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.<ref name=\"ew-firstlook\"/> The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}</ref> Also after \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" came other story arcs like Faith's return in \"[[No Future for You]]\" and a ''Fray'' cross-over in \"[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]\". Dark Horse later followed ''Season Eight'' with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', starting in 2011, and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'', which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish ''Buffy'' comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018 when they released the final issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve]]'' which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse's ''Buffy'' series, [[Boom! Studios]] acquired the license to publish ''Buffy'' comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted ''Buffy'' series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom! Studio's approach to rebooting ''Buffy'' has been stylistically compared to the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' series by the creators.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/2019/01/23/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-interview-jordie-bellaire-jeanine-schaefer/ |title=interview with Jordie Bellaire and Jeanie Schaefer |publisher=ComicBook.com |first=Jamie |last=Lovett |date=January 23, 2019 |accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref> Joss Whedon is not as involved in the rebooted ''Buffy'' comic as he was in Dark Horse's continuation, however he did take part in the initial development stages for the series and gave his blessing to the creators.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/23/why-boom-studios-decided-to-reboot-buffy-the-vampire-slayer |title=Why Boom!

''Buffy: The Animated Series'' was a proposed animated TV show based on ''Buffy''; Whedon and [[Jeph Loeb]] were to be executive producers for the show, and most of the cast from ''Buffy'' were to return to voice their characters. [[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up.

[[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \"[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]\" pulled in a season high of 4.9&nbsp;million viewers on the UPN network.<ref name=\"s7 ratings\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n\n''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode \"[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]\", which was watched by 8.2&nbsp;million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00&nbsp;pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211104047/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=December 11, 2011}}</ref> UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it.

The series narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]s\". In the story, Slayers, or the \u201dChosen Ones\u201d, are \"called\" (chosen by [[destiny|fate]]) to battle against [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], [[demon]]s, and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".\n\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-tv-shows-of-all-time-2017-6#buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1997-to-2003-12|title=50 TV shows everyone should watch in their lifetime|work=INSIDER|first=Jacob|last=Shamsian|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\">{{cite web |author=Wahoske, Matthew J. |url=http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043137/http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |title=Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly |work=Insightbb.com}}</ref> Although such [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt |title=The Dual Network Rule |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=May 15, 2001 |quote=[T]he four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience}}</ref> they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=March 9, 2005 |quote=Mr. Levin was a key player in establishing The WB's distinct brand and youth appeal through programming such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was almost entirely ignored by major award shows during its run, the series was nominated for the [[American Film Institute Awards 2001|American Film Institute Award for Drama Series of the Year]], Gellar was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama]] for her performance in the show, and the series was nominated five times for [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Awards]], winning once in 2003 for the [[19th TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Heritage Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-20-years-later-emmys/ |title=\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019: 20 years later, it still remains Emmy\u2019s biggest snub |website=Gold Derby |first=Ralph |last=Galvan |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/09/10/five-reasons-buffy-gets-snubbed-emmys/ |title=Five reasons ''Buffy'' gets snubbed by the Emmys |website=Entertainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/biggest-emmys-snubs-all-time/ |title=14 Jaw-Dropping Emmys Snubs We're Still Not Over |website=TV Guide |first=Kaitlin |last=Thomas |date=September 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Buffy'' has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|novels]], [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|comics]], and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|video games]].

Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by \"Ripper\"), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.\n\nBuffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and [[coming out|comes out]] as a [[lesbian]]. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the \"[[Big Bad]]\". Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].\n\nThe cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (\"[[Becoming, Part Two]]\"). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five (\"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\"). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.\n\nAt Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the \"Scooby Gang\" or \"Scoobies\". [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Jenny Calendar]] ([[Robia LaMorte]]), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.\n\nIn Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was \"called\" forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.\n\nBuffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joins the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in \"the Initiative\", which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees [[geek]]y wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.\n\n''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the \"Big Bad\" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.\n\n===Setting and filming locations===\n{{Main|Sunnydale}}\n[[File:Torrance High School.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School.]]\nThe show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a \"Hellmouth\", a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and \"[[High school (North America)|High school]] as [[Hell]]\" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, \"Young Blood\", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: \"[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week.\"</ref>\n\nMost of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]], the same high school used for [[Beverly Hills, 90210]].<ref name=\"torrence\">\"[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html Buffy the Vampire Slayer film locations]\", ''Movie-locations.com''</ref> The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">{{cite video |title=Designing Buffy Featurette |medium=dvd |year=1998 |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video}}</ref> In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways, and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair.

While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the \"Scooby Gang\", who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.<ref name=\"FtF-Intro\" /> The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine. Gellar described the show as \"the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It's the hardest time of life.\"<ref name = \"Guardian 21 July 2018\">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/21/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-to-be-remade-21-years-after-first-episode |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer to be remade 21 years after first episode |date=July 21, 2018 |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe}}</ref>\n\nIn the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Buffy'' bestiary]] are [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of [[Grimslaw demon|demons]], as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts and spirits|ghosts]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombies]], and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Dangerous Mortals|unscrupulous humans]].

KEEP IT SIMPLE! -->\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 1)|Season one]] exemplifies the \"high school is hell\" concept. [[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil throughout the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.\n\nThe emotional stakes are raised in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2)|season two]]. Vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (weakened from a mob in [[Prague]], which, it is implied, caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with a new slayer, [[Kendra Young]], who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the [[Prophecy Girl|season one finale]]. Xander becomes involved with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]], who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] develops over the course of the season, but after they have sex, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost, and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the \"Scooby Gang\" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles' new girlfriend [[Jenny Calendar]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] who was sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angel to a demon dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.\n\nAfter attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|season three]]. Angel has mysteriously been released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to [[suicide]] by the [[First Evil]]. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles' place when Giles is fired from the Watcher's Council because he has developed a \"father's love\" for Buffy; and towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]], the Slayer activated after Kendra's death. She also encounters the affable [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]], who secretly has plans to \"ascend\" (become a \"pure\" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Season four]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head that punishes him whenever he tries to harm a human. He makes a truce with the Scooby Gang and begins to fight on their side, purely for the joy of fighting, upon learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a graduate student and member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|season five]], a younger sister, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], an exiled Hell God who is searching for a [[The Key (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|\"Key\"]] that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors have used Buffy's blood to turn the Key into human form \u2013 Dawn \u2013 concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]] dies of a brain [[aneurysm]], while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her, using Dawn's blood to open a portal to the Hell dimension. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal and thus closes it with her death.\n\nAt the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)|season six]], Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in [[Heaven]] and is devastated to be pulled back to Earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn, and develops a secret, mutually abusive sexual relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from [[kleptomania]] and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffyverse)|The Trio]], a group of [[nerd]]s led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to \"return him to what he used to be\" so that he can \"give Buffy what she deserves\". After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|season seven]], it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused instability that is allowing the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive [[Potential Slayers]], and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful [[Turok-Han]] vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight The First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, [[misogyny|misogynistic]] preacher known as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population \u2013 humans and demons alike \u2013 flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb, and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern, while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers.

Then the episode's story was \"broken\" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the [[television advertisement|commercial break]]. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once \"breaking\" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the showrunner. The final article was used as the shooting script.\n\n===Broadcast history and syndication===\n[[File:UPN Promo Buffy Season 6.jpg|thumb|upright|UPN took great advantage promoting the network switch by teasing fans of Buffy's resurrection from The WB's series finale.]]\n''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first aired on March 10, 1997, (as a mid season replacement for the show ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'') on the [[The WB Television Network|WB network]], and played a key role in the growth of the [[Warner Bros.]] television network in its early years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kff.org |date=March 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Schneider, Michael |author2=Adalian, Josef |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |title=WB revisits glory days |work=Variety |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218025029/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |archivedate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) for its final two seasons.

Buffy asks her if she ever got it back. Willow's line was to reply \"most of it\". Hannigan decided on an upbeat and happy delivery of the line \"most of it\", as opposed to a sad, depressed delivery. Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got \"most of it\" back.

At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen ratings]] than its parent series did.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\"/>\n\nThe series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to \"help the helpless\", to restore the faith and \"save the souls\" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram & Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.\n\nIn addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' series cast regular [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]). When [[Glenn Quinn]] ([[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]]) left the series during its first season, [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of ''Buffy'', took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]). Several actors and actresses who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]]), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]), [[Julie Benz]] ([[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]), [[Mark Metcalf]] ([[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]]), [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] ([[Anne Steele (Buffyverse)|Anne Steele]]) and [[Juliet Landau]] ([[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.\n\nOther actors that appeared in both the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel'' series but as different characters include: Bob Fimiani as Mr. Ward, a head of the Department of Defense in ''Buffy'' and Glith-roo, a Codger Demon in ''Angel''; [[Carlos Jacott]] as a demon named Ken in ''Buffy'' and a different demon named Richard Stanley in ''Angel''; [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as a vampire and former classmate in ''Buffy'' named Holden Webster and Knox, a Wolfram and Heart scientist in ''Angel''; and [[Andy Umberger]] who played a demon name D'Hoffryn in ''Buffy'' and predator named Ronald Meltzer in ''Angel''.\n\nThe storyline has been continued in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' published by [[IDW Publishing]] and later ''[[Angel and Faith]]'' published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n===Expanded universe===\n{{Main|Buffyverse canon|Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|List of Buffyverse comics}}\n[[File:Long way home tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Trade paperback cover of ''Buffy: Season Eight'' [[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|Volume One]], written by Joss Whedon.]]\nOutside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]\". The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] has published the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|''Buffy'' comics]] since 1998.<ref>\"[http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/98-372-a/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-1-photo-cover Buffy the Vampire Slayer#1]\" ''Dark Horse Comics'' (\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1\" released September 23, 1998).</ref> In 2003, Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled ''[[Fray (comic)|Fray]]'', about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off\u2014taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.<ref name=\"ew-firstlook\"/> The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}</ref> Also after \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" came other story arcs like Faith's return in \"[[No Future for You]]\" and a ''Fray'' cross-over in \"[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]\". Dark Horse later followed ''Season Eight'' with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', starting in 2011, and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'', which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish ''Buffy'' comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018 when they released the final issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve]]'' which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse's ''Buffy'' series, [[Boom! Studios]] acquired the license to publish ''Buffy'' comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted ''Buffy'' series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom!

These projects remain undeveloped and may never be [[greenlight|greenlit]]. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: ''[[Buffy: The Animated Series]]'' and [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Ripper|''Ripper'']]. ''Buffy: The Animated Series'' was a proposed animated TV show based on ''Buffy''; Whedon and [[Jeph Loeb]] were to be executive producers for the show, and most of the cast from ''Buffy'' were to return to voice their characters. [[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up. Whedon revealed to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': \"We just could not find a home for it. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff \u2013 and nobody wanted it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204043/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |title=Dialogue with 'Buffy' creator Joss Whedon |author=Hockensmith, Steve |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=May 16, 2003 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry, though writer [[Jane Espenson]] has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.<ref>Espenson, Jane, \"[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000095.php Reading what's been written to sound written as it's spoken]\", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 9, 2006) & \"[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000097.php Sorry, JVC, but it's simply true]\", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 11, 2006).</ref>\n\n''Ripper'' was originally a proposed television show based upon the character of [[Rupert Giles]] portrayed by [[Anthony Stewart Head]]. More recent information has suggested that if ''Ripper'' were ever made, it would be a TV movie or a [[Direct-to-video|DVD movie]].<ref>''[[Buffyverse Magazines (UK)|UK Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel Magazine]]''.

[[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \"[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]\" pulled in a season high of 4.9&nbsp;million viewers on the UPN network.<ref name=\"s7 ratings\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n\n''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode \"[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]\", which was watched by 8.2&nbsp;million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00&nbsp;pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211104047/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=December 11, 2011}}</ref> UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it.

Two versions were considered then: a DC-10-10 with a fuselage stretch of {{convert|40|ft|m}} and a DC-10-30 stretched by {{convert|30|ft|m}}. The latter version would have been capable of transporting up to 340 passengers in a multi-class configuration, or 277 passengers and their luggage over {{convert|5300|nmi|km}}. At the same time, the manufacturer was seeking to reduce wing and engine drag on the trijet. Another version of the aircraft was also envisaged, the \"DC-10 global\", aimed to counter the risks of loss of orders for the DC-10-30 that the [[Boeing 747SP]] and its range were causing. The DC-10 global would have incorporated more fuel tanks.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\">{{Cite book |last= Marriott |first= Leo |title= McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (Modern Civil Aircraft: 12) |publisher= Howell Press |date=December 1992 |location= |isbn= 0-7110-2071-X }}</ref>\n\nWhile continuing their research for a new aircraft, McDonnell Douglas designated the program DC-10 Super 60, previously known for a short time as DC-10 Super 50. The Super 60 was to be an intercontinental aircraft incorporating many aerodynamic improvements in the wings, and a fuselage lengthened by {{convert|26|ft|8|in|m}} to allow for up to 350 passengers to be seated in a mixed-class layout, compared to 275 in the same configuration of the DC-10.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nFollowing more refinements, in 1979 the DC-10 Super 60 was proposed in three distinct versions like the DC-8. The DC-10-61 was designed to be a high-capacity medium-range aircraft. It would have a fuselage stretch of {{convert|40|ft|m}} over the earlier DC-10 models, enabling it to carry 390 passengers in a mixed class or 550 passengers in an all-economy layout, similar to [[Boeing]]'s later [[Boeing 777|777-300]] and [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-600]]. Like the [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]], the series 62 was proposed for long-range routes. It would feature a more modest fuselage stretch of {{convert|26|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, along with an increased wingspan and fuel capacity. It would be capable of carrying up to 350 passengers (mixed class) or 440 passengers (all-economy), similar to the later [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200]] or the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]]/[[Airbus A340|A340-300/500]]. Finally, the series 63 would have incorporated the same fuselage as the DC-10-61 as well as all the larger wing of the -62. After high-profile accidents in the 1970s, such as [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] and [[American Airlines Flight 191]], the trijet's reputation was seriously damaged by doubts regarding its structural integrity. For these reasons, and due to a downturn in the airline industry, all work on the Super 60 was stopped.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas MD-11, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines JP6102340.jpg|thumb|Nine-abreast economy class]]\nIn 1981, a [[Continental Airlines]] DC-10-10 (registration number N68048) was leased to conduct more research, particularly the effects the newly designed winglets would have on aircraft performance. Different types of winglets were tested during that time in conjunction with [[NASA]]. McDonnell Douglas was again planning new DC-10 versions that could incorporate winglets and more efficient engines developed at the time by [[Pratt & Whitney]] ([[PW2000|PW2037]]) and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] ([[RB211|RB.211-535F4]]). The manufacturer finally rationalized all these studies under the MD-EEE (Ecology-Economy-Efficiency) designation, that was later modified to the MD-100 following some more changes. The MD-100 was proposed in two versions: the Series 10, having an airframe shorter by {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} compared to the DC-10 and seating up to 270 passengers in a mixed-class configuration; and the Series 20, incorporating a fuselage stretch of {{convert|20|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} over the DC-10 and able to seat up to 333 passengers in the same kind of configuration as the Series 10. Both versions could be powered by the same engine families as the actual MD-11 plus the RB.211-600. However, the situation for the manufacturer, and the airline industry in general, did not look bright. No new DC-10 orders were received, and many among the observers and customers doubted that the manufacturer would stay in business much longer. Thus, the Board of Directors decided in November 1983 to once again cease all work on the projected new trijet.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nThe following year no new orders for the DC-10 were received. The production line was kept active thanks to earlier orders from the U.S. Air Force for 60 [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10A]] tankers. McDonnell Douglas was still convinced that a new derivative for the DC-10 was needed, as shown by the second-hand market for their Series 30 and the heavier DC-10-30ER version. Thus, in 1984 a new derivative aircraft version of the DC-10 was designated MD-11. From the very beginning, the MD-11X was conceived in two different versions. The MD-11X-10, based on a DC-10-30 airframe, offered a range of {{convert|6500|nmi|km}} with passengers. That first version would have had a [[maximum takeoff weight]] (MTOW) of {{convert|580000|lb|kg}} and would have used [[CF6|CF6-80C2]] or [[PW4000]] engines. The MD-11X-20 was to have a longer fuselage, accommodating up to 331 passengers in a mixed-class layout, and a range of {{convert|6000|nmi|km}}.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nAs more orders for the DC-10 were received, McDonnell Douglas used the time gained before the end of DC-10 production to consult with potential customers and to refine the proposed new trijet. In July 1985, the Board of Directors authorized the Long Beach plant to offer the MD-11 to potential customers. At the time, the aircraft was still proposed in two versions, both with the same fuselage length, a stretch of {{convert|22|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} over the DC-10 airframe, as well as the same engine choice as the MD-11X. One version would have a range of {{convert|4780|nmi|km}} with a gross weight of {{convert|500000|lb|kg}} and transport up to 337 passengers, while the second would carry 331 passengers over {{convert|6900|nmi|km}}. A year later, as several airlines had committed to the MD-11, the situation was looking optimistic. The aircraft was now a 320-seater baseline and defined as an {{convert|18|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}} stretch over the DC-10-30 powered by the new advanced turbofans offered by the major engine manufacturers and giving it a range of {{convert|6800|nmi|km}}.

Two versions were considered then: a DC-10-10 with a fuselage stretch of {{convert|40|ft|m}} and a DC-10-30 stretched by {{convert|30|ft|m}}. The latter version would have been capable of transporting up to 340 passengers in a multi-class configuration, or 277 passengers and their luggage over {{convert|5300|nmi|km}}. At the same time, the manufacturer was seeking to reduce wing and engine drag on the trijet. Another version of the aircraft was also envisaged, the \"DC-10 global\", aimed to counter the risks of loss of orders for the DC-10-30 that the [[Boeing 747SP]] and its range were causing. The DC-10 global would have incorporated more fuel tanks.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\">{{Cite book |last= Marriott |first= Leo |title= McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (Modern Civil Aircraft: 12) |publisher= Howell Press |date=December 1992 |location= |isbn= 0-7110-2071-X }}</ref>\n\nWhile continuing their research for a new aircraft, McDonnell Douglas designated the program DC-10 Super 60, previously known for a short time as DC-10 Super 50. The Super 60 was to be an intercontinental aircraft incorporating many aerodynamic improvements in the wings, and a fuselage lengthened by {{convert|26|ft|8|in|m}} to allow for up to 350 passengers to be seated in a mixed-class layout, compared to 275 in the same configuration of the DC-10.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nFollowing more refinements, in 1979 the DC-10 Super 60 was proposed in three distinct versions like the DC-8. The DC-10-61 was designed to be a high-capacity medium-range aircraft. It would have a fuselage stretch of {{convert|40|ft|m}} over the earlier DC-10 models, enabling it to carry 390 passengers in a mixed class or 550 passengers in an all-economy layout, similar to [[Boeing]]'s later [[Boeing 777|777-300]] and [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-600]]. Like the [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]], the series 62 was proposed for long-range routes. It would feature a more modest fuselage stretch of {{convert|26|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, along with an increased wingspan and fuel capacity. It would be capable of carrying up to 350 passengers (mixed class) or 440 passengers (all-economy), similar to the later [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200]] or the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]]/[[Airbus A340|A340-300/500]]. Finally, the series 63 would have incorporated the same fuselage as the DC-10-61 as well as all the larger wing of the -62. After high-profile accidents in the 1970s, such as [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] and [[American Airlines Flight 191]], the trijet's reputation was seriously damaged by doubts regarding its structural integrity. For these reasons, and due to a downturn in the airline industry, all work on the Super 60 was stopped.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas MD-11, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines JP6102340.jpg|thumb|Nine-abreast economy class]]\nIn 1981, a [[Continental Airlines]] DC-10-10 (registration number N68048) was leased to conduct more research, particularly the effects the newly designed winglets would have on aircraft performance. Different types of winglets were tested during that time in conjunction with [[NASA]]. McDonnell Douglas was again planning new DC-10 versions that could incorporate winglets and more efficient engines developed at the time by [[Pratt & Whitney]] ([[PW2000|PW2037]]) and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] ([[RB211|RB.211-535F4]]). The manufacturer finally rationalized all these studies under the MD-EEE (Ecology-Economy-Efficiency) designation, that was later modified to the MD-100 following some more changes. The MD-100 was proposed in two versions: the Series 10, having an airframe shorter by {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} compared to the DC-10 and seating up to 270 passengers in a mixed-class configuration; and the Series 20, incorporating a fuselage stretch of {{convert|20|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} over the DC-10 and able to seat up to 333 passengers in the same kind of configuration as the Series 10. Both versions could be powered by the same engine families as the actual MD-11 plus the RB.211-600. However, the situation for the manufacturer, and the airline industry in general, did not look bright. No new DC-10 orders were received, and many among the observers and customers doubted that the manufacturer would stay in business much longer. Thus, the Board of Directors decided in November 1983 to once again cease all work on the projected new trijet.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nThe following year no new orders for the DC-10 were received. The production line was kept active thanks to earlier orders from the U.S. Air Force for 60 [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10A]] tankers. McDonnell Douglas was still convinced that a new derivative for the DC-10 was needed, as shown by the second-hand market for their Series 30 and the heavier DC-10-30ER version. Thus, in 1984 a new derivative aircraft version of the DC-10 was designated MD-11. From the very beginning, the MD-11X was conceived in two different versions. The MD-11X-10, based on a DC-10-30 airframe, offered a range of {{convert|6500|nmi|km}} with passengers. That first version would have had a [[maximum takeoff weight]] (MTOW) of {{convert|580000|lb|kg}} and would have used [[CF6|CF6-80C2]] or [[PW4000]] engines. The MD-11X-20 was to have a longer fuselage, accommodating up to 331 passengers in a mixed-class layout, and a range of {{convert|6000|nmi|km}}.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\nAs more orders for the DC-10 were received, McDonnell Douglas used the time gained before the end of DC-10 production to consult with potential customers and to refine the proposed new trijet. In July 1985, the Board of Directors authorized the Long Beach plant to offer the MD-11 to potential customers. At the time, the aircraft was still proposed in two versions, both with the same fuselage length, a stretch of {{convert|22|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} over the DC-10 airframe, as well as the same engine choice as the MD-11X. One version would have a range of {{convert|4780|nmi|km}} with a gross weight of {{convert|500000|lb|kg}} and transport up to 337 passengers, while the second would carry 331 passengers over {{convert|6900|nmi|km}}. A year later, as several airlines had committed to the MD-11, the situation was looking optimistic. The aircraft was now a 320-seater baseline and defined as an {{convert|18|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}} stretch over the DC-10-30 powered by the new advanced turbofans offered by the major engine manufacturers and giving it a range of {{convert|6800|nmi|km}}. Other versions, such as a shortened ER with a range of {{convert|7500|nmi|km}}, an all-cargo offering a maximum payload of {{convert|200970|lb|kg}} and a Combi with a provision for ten freight pallets on the main deck, were proposed. Further growth of the aircraft was also foreseen, such as the MD-11 Advanced.<ref name=\"md-11 civil\"/>\n\n[[File:D-ALCL (3119122609).jpg|thumb|Center engine at the base of the vertical stabilizer, like the DC-10]]\nThe lack of innovation from McDonnell Douglas during the MD-11's design had been attributed to the company's declining cash flow, as it struggled with problems with its military contracts and declining orders for its commercial jets.<ref name=iasa.com.au>{{cite web |url=http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/sr111/forbidding.html |title=Jet's Troubled History Raises Issues For the FAA and the Manufacturer |work=iasa.com.au [[The Wall Street Journal]] |last=Pasztor |first=Andy |date=September 19, 2000 |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref> Limited company resources resulting in the MD-11 being developed as a refinement of the existing DC-10, in contrast to rivals Airbus and Boeing who during this time period developed all-new aircraft designs that would become the Airbus A330/A340 and Boeing 777.
