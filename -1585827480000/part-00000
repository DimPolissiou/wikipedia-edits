In [[geometry|geometrical]] terms, the square root function maps the [[area]] of a square to its side length.\n\nThe square root of ''x'' is rational if and only if ''x'' is a [[rational number]] that can be represented as a ratio of two perfect squares. (See [[square root of 2]] for proofs that this is an irrational number, and [[quadratic irrational]] for a proof for all non-square natural numbers.)

It defines an important concept of [[standard deviation]] used in probability theory and statistics. It has a major use in the formula for roots of a [[quadratic equation]]; [[quadratic field]]s and rings of [[quadratic integer]]s, which are based on square roots, are important in algebra and have uses in geometry. Square roots frequently appear in mathematical formulas elsewhere, as well as in many [[physics|physical]] laws.\n\n==Square roots of positive integers==\nA positive number has two square roots, one positive, and one negative, which are [[opposite (mathematics)|opposite]] to each other. So, when talking of ''the'' square root of a positive integer, this is the positive square root that is meant. \n\nThe square roots of an integer are [[algebraic integer]]s and, more specifically, [[quadratic integer]]s.\n\nThe square root of a positive integer is the product of the roots of its [[prime number|prime]] factors, because the square root of a product is the product of the square roots of the factors. Since {{math|1={{sqrt|''p''<sup>2''k''</sup>}} = ''p''<sup>''k''</sup>}}, only roots of those primes having an odd power in the [[integer factorization|factorization]] are necessary.

Lagrange found that the representation of the square root of any non-square positive integer as a continued fraction is [[Periodic continued fraction|periodic]]. That is, a certain pattern of partial denominators repeats indefinitely in the continued fraction. In a sense these square roots are the very simplest irrational numbers, because they can be represented with a simple repeating pattern of integers.\n\n:{|\n|- \n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|2}}|| = [1; 2, 2, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|3}}|| = [1; 1, 2, 1, 2, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|4}}|| = [2]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|5}}|| = [2; 4, 4, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|6}}|| = [2; 2, 4, 2, 4, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|7}}|| = [2; 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|8}}||= [2; 1, 4, 1, 4, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|9}}|| = [3]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|10}}|| = [3; 6, 6, ...]\n|- \n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|11}}|| = [3; 3, 6, 3, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|12}}|| = [3; 2, 6, 2, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|13}}|| = [3; 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|14}}|| = [3; 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|15}}|| = [3; 1, 6, 1, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|16}}|| = [4]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|17}}|| = [4; 8, 8, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|18}}|| = [4; 4, 8, 4, 8, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|19}}|| = [4; 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|20}}|| = [4; 2, 8, 2, 8, ...]\n|}\n\nThe [[square bracket]] notation used above is a sort of mathematical shorthand to conserve space.

The motivation is that if ''x'' is an overestimate to the square root of a nonnegative real number ''a'' then ''a''/''x''<!-- please avoid intermixing <math> with a bare text in one paragraph: it is the ugliest pair among 3 existing styles --> will be an underestimate and so the average of these two numbers is a better approximation than either of them. However, the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]] shows this average is always an overestimate of the square root (as noted [[Square root#Geometric construction of the square root|below]]), and so it can serve as a new overestimate with which to repeat the process, which [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] as a consequence of the successive overestimates and underestimates being closer to each other after each iteration. To find ''x'':\n\n# Start with an arbitrary positive start value ''x''. The closer to the square root of ''a'', the fewer the iterations that will be needed to achieve the desired precision.\n# Replace ''x'' by the average (''x'' + ''a''/''x'') / 2 between ''x'' and ''a''/''x''.\n# Repeat from step 2, using this average as the new value of ''x''.\n\nThat is, if an arbitrary guess for {{sqrt|''a''}} is ''x''<sub>0</sub>, and {{nowrap|1 = ''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub> = (''x<sub>n</sub>'' + ''a''/''x<sub>n</sub>'') / 2}}, then each x<sub>n</sub> is an approximation of {{sqrt|''a''}} which is better for large ''n'' than for small ''n''. If ''a'' is positive, the convergence is [[Rate of convergence|quadratic]], which means that in approaching the limit, the number of correct digits roughly doubles in each next iteration. If {{nowrap|1 =''a'' = 0}}, the convergence is only linear.\n\nUsing the identity\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{a} = 2^{-n}\\sqrt{4^n a},</math>\n\nthe computation of the square root of a positive number can be reduced to that of a number in the range {{closed-open|1,4}}.

Therefore, no negative number can have a [[real number|real]] square root.  However, it is possible to work with a more inclusive set of numbers, called the [[complex number]]s, that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number.  This is done by introducing a new number, denoted by ''i'' (sometimes ''j'', especially in the context of [[electric current|electricity]] where \"''i''\" traditionally represents electric current) and called the [[imaginary unit]], which is ''defined'' such that {{nowrap|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. Using this notation, we can think of ''i'' as the square root of \u22121, but we also have {{nowrap|1=(\u2212''i'')<sup>2</sup> = ''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}} and so \u2212''i'' is also a square root of \u22121. By convention, the principal square root of \u22121 is ''i'', or more generally, if ''x'' is any nonnegative number, then the principal square root of \u2212''x'' is\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{-x} = i \\sqrt x.</math>\n\nThe right side (as well as its negative) is indeed a square root of \u2212''x'', since\n\n:<math>(i\\sqrt x)^2 = i^2(\\sqrt x)^2 = (-1)x = -x.</math>\n\nFor every non-zero complex number ''z'' there exist precisely two numbers ''w'' such that {{nowrap|1=''w''<sup>2</sup> = ''z''}}: the principal square root of ''z'' (defined below), and its negative.\n\n===Principal square root of a complex number===\n{{Visualisation complex number roots}}\nTo find a definition for the square root that allows us to consistently choose a single value, called the [[principal value]], we start by observing that any complex number ''x\u2265 0 is the distance of the point from the origin, and  <math>\\varphi</math> is the angle that the line from the origin to the point makes with the positive real (''x'') axis. In complex analyufkuyfkhfgkghfkfghksis, the location of this point is conventionally written <math>re^{i\\varphi}.</math> If\n\n:<math> z=r e^{i \\varphi} \\text{ with } -\\pi < \\varphi \\le \\pi, </math>\n\nthen we define the principal square root of ''z'' as follows:\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{z} = \\sqrt{r} e^{i \\varphi / 2}.</math>\n\nThe principal square root function is thus defined using the nonpositive real axis as a [[branch cut]].  The principal square root function is [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] everywhere except on the set of non-positive real numbers (on strictly negative reals it isn't even [[continuous function|continuous]]). The above Taylor series for {{sqrt|1 + ''x''}} remains valid for complex numbers ''x'' with {{nowrap|{{abs|''x''}} < 1}}.\n\nThe above can also be expressed in terms of [[trigonometric function]]s:\n:<math>\\sqrt{r \\left(\\cos \\varphi + i \\sin \\varphi \\right)} = \\sqrt{r} \\left ( \\cos \\frac{\\varphi}{2} + i \\sin \\frac{\\varphi}{2} \\right ) .</math>\n\n===Algebraic formula===\n[[Image:Imaginary2Root.svg|right|thumb|The square roots of {{mvar|i}}]]\nWhen the number is expressed using Cartesian coordinates the following formula can be used for the principal square root:<ref>{{cite book\n |title       = Handbook of mathematical functions with formulas, graphs, and mathematical tables\n |first1      = Milton\n |last1       = Abramowitz\n |first2      = Irene A.\n |last2       = Stegun\n |publisher   = Courier Dover Publications\n |year        = 1964\n |isbn        = 0-486-61272-4\n |page        = 17\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=MtU8uP7XMvoC\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160423180235/https://books.google.com/books?id=MtU8uP7XMvoC\n |archivedate = 2016-04-23\n}}, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_17.htm Section 3.7.27, p. 17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910094533/http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_17.htm |date=2009-09-10 }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |title       = Classical algebra: its nature, origins, and uses\n |first1      = Roger\n |last1       = Cooke\n |publisher   = John Wiley and Sons\n |year        = 2008\n |isbn        = 0-470-25952-3\n |page        = 59\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=lUcTsYopfhkC&pg=PA59\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160423183239/https://books.google.com/books?id=lUcTsYopfhkC&pg=PA59\n |archivedate = 2016-04-23\n}}\n</ref>\n:<math>\\sqrt{x+iy} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + x}{2}} \\pm i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} - x}{2}},</math>\nwhere the [[Sign function|sign]] of the imaginary part of the root is taken to be the same as the sign of the imaginary part of the original number, or positive when zero.

It can be made to hold by changing the meaning of \u221a so that this no longer represents the principal square root (see above) but selects a branch for the square root that contains ({{sqrt|\u22121}})\u00b7({{sqrt|\u22121}}). The left-hand side becomes either\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{-1} \\cdot \\sqrt{-1}=i \\cdot i=-1</math>\n\nif the branch includes +''i'' or\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{-1} \\cdot \\sqrt{-1}=(-i) \\cdot (-i)=-1</math>\n\nif the branch includes \u2212''i'', while the right-hand side becomes\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{\\left(-1\\right)\\cdot\\left(-1\\right)}=\\sqrt{1}=-1,</math>\n\nwhere the last equality, {{math|1={{sqrt|1}} = \u22121}}, is a consequence of the choice of branch in the redefinition of \u221a.\n\n==Square roots of matrices and operators==\n{{Main article|Square root of a matrix}}\n{{See also|Square root of a 2 by 2 matrix}}\n\nIf ''A'' is a [[positive-definite matrix]] or operator, then there exists precisely one positive definite matrix or operator ''B'' with {{nowrap|1=''B''<sup>2</sup> = ''A''}}; we then define {{nowrap|1=''A''<sup>1/2</sup> = ''B''}}. In general matrices may have multiple square roots or even an infinitude of them.  For example, the {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} [[identity matrix]] has an infinity of square roots,<ref>Mitchell, Douglas W., \"Using Pythagorean triples to generate square roots of I<sub>2</sub>\", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 87, November 2003, 499\u2013500.</ref> though only one of them is positive definite.\n\n==In integral domains, including fields==\nEach element of an [[integral domain]] has no more than 2 square roots. The [[difference of two squares]] identity {{math|1=''u''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''v''<sup>2</sup> = (''u'' \u2212 ''v'')(''u'' + ''v'')}} is proved using the [[commutative ring|commutativity of multiplication]]. If {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are square roots of the same element, then {{math|1=''u''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''v''<sup>2</sup> = 0}}. Because there are no [[zero divisors]] this implies {{math|1=''u'' = ''v''}} or {{math|1=''u'' + ''v'' = 0}}, where the latter means that two roots are [[additive inverse]]s of each other. In other words if an element a square root {{mvar|u}} of an element {{mvar|a}} exists, then the only square roots of {{mvar|a}} are {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|&minus;u}}. The only square root of 0 in an integral domain is 0 itself.\n\nIn a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]&nbsp;2, an element either has one square root or does not have any at all, because each element is its own additive inverse, so that {{math|1=&minus;''u'' = ''u''}}. If the field is [[finite field|finite]] of characteristic&nbsp;2 then every element has a unique square root. In a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of any other characteristic, any non-zero element either has two square roots, as explained above, or does not have any.\n\nGiven an odd [[prime number]] {{mvar|p}}, let {{math|1=''q'' = ''p''<sup>''e''</sup>}} for some positive integer {{mvar|e}}. A non-zero element of the field [[finite field|{{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}]] with {{mvar|q}} elements is a [[quadratic residue]] if it has a square root in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}. Otherwise, it is a quadratic non-residue. There are {{math|(''q'' \u2212 1)/2}} quadratic residues and {{math|(''q'' \u2212 1)/2}} quadratic non-residues; zero is not counted in either class. The quadratic residues form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication. The properties of quadratic residues are widely used in [[number theory]].\n\n==In rings in general==\nUnlike in an integral domain, a square root in an arbitrary (unital) ring need not be unique up to sign.  For example, in the ring <math>\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}</math> of integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo 8]] (which is commutative, but has zero divisors), the element 1 has four distinct square roots: \u00b11 and \u00b13.\n\nAnother example is provided by the ring of [[quaternion]]s <math>\\mathbb{H},</math> which has no zero divisors, but is not commutative.  Here, the element \u22121 has [[quaternion#Square roots of \u22121|infinitely many square roots]], including {{math|\u00b1''i''}}, {{math|\u00b1''j''}}, and {{math|\u00b1''k''}}.  In fact, the set of square roots of \u22121 is exactly\n\n:<math>\\{ai + bj + ck \\mid a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1\\} .</math>\n\nA square root of 0 is either 0 or a zero divisor.  Thus in rings where zero divisors do not exist, it is uniquely 0.  However, rings with zero divisors may have multiple square roots of 0.  For example, in <math>\\mathbb{Z}/n^2\\mathbb{Z},</math> any multiple of {{mvar|n}} is a square root of 0.\n\n==Geometric construction of the square root==\n[[File:Euclid Corollary 5.svg|thumb|The [[Spiral of Theodorus]] up to the triangle with a hypotenuse of {{math|{{radic|4}}}} ({{math|1 {{=}} {{sqrt|1}}}})]]\n\nThe square root of a positive number is usually defined as the side length of a [[square]] with the [[area]] equal to the given number. But the square shape is not necessary for it: if one of two [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] [[Euclidean plane|planar Euclidean]] objects has the area ''a'' times greater than another, then the ratio of their linear sizes is {{sqrt|''a''}}.\n\nA square root can be constructed with a compass and straightedge. In his [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]], [[Euclid]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 300&nbsp;BC) gave the construction of the [[geometric mean]] of two quantities in two different places: [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookII/propII14.html Proposition II.14] and [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVI/propVI13.html Proposition VI.13].  Since the geometric mean of ''a'' and ''b'' is {{sqrt|''ab''}}, one can construct {{sqrt|''a''}} simply by taking {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 1}}.\n\nThe construction is also given by [[Descartes]] in his ''[[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]]'', see figure 2 on [http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=00570001&seq=12&frames=0&view=50 page 2]. However, Descartes made no claim to originality and his audience would have been quite familiar with Euclid.\n\nEuclid's second proof in Book VI depends on the theory of [[Similar triangles#Similar triangles|similar triangles]]. Let AHB be a line segment of length {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} with {{nowrap|1=AH = ''a''}} and {{nowrap|1=HB = ''b''}}. Construct the circle with AB as diameter and let C be one of the two intersections of the perpendicular chord at H with the circle and denote the length CH as ''h''. Then, using [[Thales' theorem]] and, as in the [[Pythagorean theorem#Proof using similar triangles|proof of Pythagoras' theorem by similar triangles]], triangle AHC is similar to triangle CHB (as indeed both are to triangle ACB, though we don't need that, but it is the essence of the proof of Pythagoras' theorem) so that AH:CH is as HC:HB, i.e. {{nowrap|1= ''a''/''h'' = ''h''/''b''}}, from which we conclude by cross-multiplication that {{nowrap|1= ''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''ab''}}, and finally that {{nowrap|1=''h'' = {{sqrt|''ab''}}}}. When marking the midpoint O of the line segment AB and drawing the radius OC of length {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''b'')/2}}, then clearly OC > CH, i.e. {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''b'')/2 \u2265 {{sqrt|''ab''}}}} (with equality if and only if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}), which is the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means|arithmetic\u2013geometric mean inequality for two variables]] and, as noted [[Square root#Computation|above]], is the basis of the [[Greek Mathematics|Ancient Greek]] understanding of \"Heron's method\".\n\nAnother method of geometric construction uses [[right triangle]]s and [[Mathematical induction|induction]]: {{sqrt|1}} can, of course, be constructed, and once {{sqrt|''x''}} has been constructed, the right triangle with legs 1 and {{sqrt|''x''}} has a [[hypotenuse]] of {{sqrt|''x'' + 1}}. Constructing successive square roots in this manner yields the [[Spiral of Theodorus]] depicted above.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apotome (mathematics)]]\n* [[Cube root]]\n* [[Integer square root]]\n* [[Nested radical]]\n* [[Nth root]]\n* [[Root of unity]]\n* [[Solving quadratic equations with continued fractions]]\n* [[Square root principle]]\n* [[Quantum gate#Square root of NOT gate (\u221aNOT)|The square root of NOT gate ({{sqrt|NOT}})]], one of the [[logic gate]]s used in [[quantum computer]]s (doesn't exist for non-quantum where [[NOT gate]]s are used)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last = Dauben | first = Joseph W. | author-link = Joseph Dauben | editor-last = Katz | editor-first = Victor J. | title = The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam | chapter = Chinese Mathematics I | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3ullzl036UEC | isbn = 0-691-11485-4}}\n* {{cite book|title=Algebra|edition=3rd|first1=Izrael M.|last1=Gel'fand|first2=Alexander|author1-link=Israel Gelfand|last2=Shen|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=1993|isbn=0-8176-3677-3|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9z7iliyFD0C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Joseph | first = George | title = The Crest of the Peacock | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-691-00659-8 | url = https://archive.org/details/crestofpeacockno00jose }}\n* {{cite book | last = Smith | first = David | author-link = David Eugene Smith| title = History of Mathematics | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1958 | isbn = 978-0-486-20430-7 | volume = 2}}\n* {{citation|last=Selin|first=Helaine|author-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt9DIY1g9HYC&pg=PA1268|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-4559-2}}.\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/sqroot.html Algorithms, implementations, and more]{{snd}}Paul Hsieh's square roots webpage\n* [http://johnkerl.org/doc/square-root.html How to manually find a square root]\n* [http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fc-2013-05 AMS Featured Column, Galileo's Arithmetic by Tony Philips]{{snd}}includes a section on how Galileo found square roots\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Square Root}}\n[[Category:Elementary special functions]]\n[[Category:Elementary mathematics]]\n[[Category:Unary operations]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Number whose square is a given number}}\n{{Redirect|Square roots|other uses|Square Roots (disambiguation)}}\n\n[[File:Nuvola apps edu mathematics blue-p.svg|thumb|right|168px|The mathematical expression \"The (principal) square root of {{mvar|x}}\"]]\n[[Image:Five Squared.svg|thumb|right|168px<!-- at 160px and 200px lines render with unequal widths -->|For example, {{math|{{sqrt|25}} {{=}} 5}}, since {{math|25 {{=}} 5\u202f&sdot;\u202f5}}, or {{math|5<sup>2</sup>}} (5 squared).]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''square root''' of a number {{math|''x''}} is a number {{math|''y''}} such that {{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''}}; in other words, a number {{math|''y''}} whose ''[[square (algebra)|square]]'' (the result of multiplying the number by itself, or {{math|''y''}}\u202f&sdot;\u202f{{math|''y''}}) is {{math|''x''}}.<ref>Gel'fand, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9z7iliyFD0C&pg=PA120 p. 120] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902151740/https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9z7iliyFD0C&pg=PA120 |date=2016-09-02 }}\n</ref> For example, 4 and \u22124 are square roots of 16 because {{math|1=4<sup>2</sup> = (\u22124)<sup>2</sup> = 16}}.\nEvery nonnegative [[real number]] {{math|''x''}} has a unique nonnegative square root, called the ''principal square root'', which is denoted by {{math|{{sqrt|''x''}}}}, where the symbol {{math|{{sqrt|&nbsp;}}}} is called the ''[[radical sign]]'' or ''radix''. For example, the principal square root of 9 is 3, which is denoted by {{math|1={{sqrt|9}} = 3}}, because {{math|1=3<sup>2</sup> = 3\u202f&sdot;\u202f3 = 9}} and 3 is nonnegative.

In [[geometry|geometrical]] terms, the square root function maps the [[area]] of a square to its side length.\n\nThe square root of ''x'' is rational if and only if ''x'' is a [[rational number]] that can be represented as a ratio of two perfect squares. (See [[square root of 2]] for proofs that this is an irrational number, and [[quadratic irrational]] for a proof for all non-square natural numbers.) The square root function maps rational numbers into [[algebraic number]]s (a [[superset]] of the rational numbers).\n\nFor all real numbers ''x'',\n\n:<math>\n\\sqrt{x^2} = \\left|x\\right| = \n\\begin{cases} \n  x,  & \\mbox{if }x \\ge 0 \\\\\n  -x, & \\mbox{if }x < 0. \n\\end{cases}\n</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(see [[absolute value]])\n\nFor all nonnegative real numbers ''x'' and ''y'',\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{xy} = \\sqrt x \\sqrt y</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\sqrt x = x^{1/2}.</math>\n\nThe square root function is [[Continuous function|continuous]] for all nonnegative ''x'' and [[derivative|differentiable]] for all positive ''x''.

It defines an important concept of [[standard deviation]] used in probability theory and statistics. It has a major use in the formula for roots of a [[quadratic equation]]; [[quadratic field]]s and rings of [[quadratic integer]]s, which are based on square roots, are important in algebra and have uses in geometry. Square roots frequently appear in mathematical formulas elsewhere, as well as in many [[physics|physical]] laws.\n\n==Square roots of positive integers==\nA positive number has two square roots, one positive, and one negative, which are [[opposite (mathematics)|opposite]] to each other. So, when talking of ''the'' square root of a positive integer, this is the positive square root that is meant. \n\nThe square roots of an integer are [[algebraic integer]]s and, more specifically, [[quadratic integer]]s.\n\nThe square root of a positive integer is the product of the roots of its [[prime number|prime]] factors, because the square root of a product is the product of the square roots of the factors. Since {{math|1={{sqrt|''p''<sup>2''k''</sup>}} = ''p''<sup>''k''</sup>}}, only roots of those primes having an odd power in the [[integer factorization|factorization]] are necessary.

In all other cases, the square roots of positive integers are [[irrational number]]s, and therefore their [[decimal representation]]s are non-[[repeating decimal]]s.

Lagrange found that the representation of the square root of any non-square positive integer as a continued fraction is [[Periodic continued fraction|periodic]]. That is, a certain pattern of partial denominators repeats indefinitely in the continued fraction. In a sense these square roots are the very simplest irrational numbers, because they can be represented with a simple repeating pattern of integers.\n\n:{|\n|- \n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|2}}|| = [1; 2, 2, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|3}}|| = [1; 1, 2, 1, 2, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|4}}|| = [2]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|5}}|| = [2; 4, 4, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|6}}|| = [2; 2, 4, 2, 4, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|7}}|| = [2; 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|8}}||= [2; 1, 4, 1, 4, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|9}}|| = [3]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|10}}|| = [3; 6, 6, ...]\n|- \n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|11}}|| = [3; 3, 6, 3, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|12}}|| = [3; 2, 6, 2, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|13}}|| = [3; 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|14}}|| = [3; 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|15}}|| = [3; 1, 6, 1, 6, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|16}}|| = [4]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|17}}|| = [4; 8, 8, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|18}}|| = [4; 4, 8, 4, 8, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|19}}|| = [4; 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8, ...]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|{{sqrt|20}}|| = [4; 2, 8, 2, 8, ...]\n|}\n\nThe [[square bracket]] notation used above is a sort of mathematical shorthand to conserve space. Written in more traditional notation the simple continued fraction for the square root of 11, [3; 3, 6, 3, 6, ...], looks like this:\n\n:<math>\n\\sqrt{11} = 3 + \\cfrac{1}{3 + \\cfrac{1}{6 + \\cfrac{1}{3 + \\cfrac{1}{6 + \\cfrac{1}{3 + \\ddots}}}}}\n</math>\n\nwhere the two-digit pattern {3, 6} repeats over and over again in the partial denominators. Since {{nowrap|1=11 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 2}}, the above is also identical to the following [[generalized continued fraction#Roots of positive numbers|generalized continued fractions]]:\n\n:<math>\n\\sqrt{11} = 3 + \\cfrac{2}{6 + \\cfrac{2}{6 + \\cfrac{2}{6 + \\cfrac{2}{6 + \\cfrac{2}{6 + \\ddots}}}}} = 3 + \\cfrac{6}{20 - 1 - \\cfrac{1}{20 - \\cfrac{1}{20 - \\cfrac{1}{20 - \\cfrac{1}{20 - \\ddots}}}}}.\n</math>\n\n==Computation==\n{{Main article|Methods of computing square roots}}\nSquare roots of positive numbers are not in general [[rational number]]s, and so cannot be written as a terminating or recurring decimal expression. Therefore in general any attempt to compute a square root expressed in decimal form can only yield an approximation, though a sequence of increasingly accurate approximations can be obtained.\n\nMost [[pocket calculator]]s have a square root key. Computer [[spreadsheet]]s and other [[software]] are also frequently used to calculate square roots.

The motivation is that if ''x'' is an overestimate to the square root of a nonnegative real number ''a'' then ''a''/''x''<!-- please avoid intermixing <math> with a bare text in one paragraph: it is the ugliest pair among 3 existing styles --> will be an underestimate and so the average of these two numbers is a better approximation than either of them. However, the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]] shows this average is always an overestimate of the square root (as noted [[Square root#Geometric construction of the square root|below]]), and so it can serve as a new overestimate with which to repeat the process, which [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] as a consequence of the successive overestimates and underestimates being closer to each other after each iteration. To find ''x'':\n\n# Start with an arbitrary positive start value ''x''. The closer to the square root of ''a'', the fewer the iterations that will be needed to achieve the desired precision.\n# Replace ''x'' by the average (''x'' + ''a''/''x'') / 2 between ''x'' and ''a''/''x''.\n# Repeat from step 2, using this average as the new value of ''x''.\n\nThat is, if an arbitrary guess for {{sqrt|''a''}} is ''x''<sub>0</sub>, and {{nowrap|1 = ''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub> = (''x<sub>n</sub>'' + ''a''/''x<sub>n</sub>'') / 2}}, then each x<sub>n</sub> is an approximation of {{sqrt|''a''}} which is better for large ''n'' than for small ''n''. If ''a'' is positive, the convergence is [[Rate of convergence|quadratic]], which means that in approaching the limit, the number of correct digits roughly doubles in each next iteration. If {{nowrap|1 =''a'' = 0}}, the convergence is only linear.\n\nUsing the identity\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{a} = 2^{-n}\\sqrt{4^n a},</math>\n\nthe computation of the square root of a positive number can be reduced to that of a number in the range {{closed-open|1,4}}. This simplifies finding a start value for the iterative method that is close to the square root, for which a [[Polynomial function|polynomial]] or [[Piecewise linear function|piecewise-linear]] [[Approximation theory|approximation]] can be used.\n\nThe [[Computational complexity theory|time complexity]] for computing a square root with ''n'' digits of precision is equivalent to that of multiplying two ''n''-digit numbers.\n\nAnother useful method for calculating the square root is the [[shifting nth root algorithm]], applied for {{nowrap|1= ''n'' = 2}}.\n\nThe name of the square root [[Function (programming)|function]] varies from [[programming language]] to programming language, with <code>sqrt</code><ref>{{cite web |title=Function sqrt |work=CPlusPlus.com |date=2016 |publisher=The C++ Resources Network |url=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cmath/sqrt/ |access-date=June 24, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122050619/http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cmath/sqrt/ |archivedate=November 22, 2012 }}</ref> (often pronounced \"squirt\" <ref>{{cite book |title=C++ for the Impatient |first=Brian |last=Overland |page=338 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |date=2013 |isbn=9780133257120 |oclc=850705706 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJFpV-_t4WkC&pg=PA338&dq=%22squirt%22+sqrt+C%2B%2B&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEwfj04sHNAhUY0GMKHatGDnsQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=%22squirt%22%20sqrt%20C%2B%2B&f=false |access-date=June 24, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901082021/https://books.google.com/books?id=eJFpV-_t4WkC&pg=PA338&dq=%22squirt%22+sqrt+C%2B%2B&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEwfj04sHNAhUY0GMKHatGDnsQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=%22squirt%22%20sqrt%20C%2B%2B&f=false |archivedate=September 1, 2016 }}</ref>) being common, used in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and derived languages like [[JavaScript]], [[PHP]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].\n\n==Square roots of negative and complex numbers==<!-- This section is linked from [[Complex number]] -->\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal \n |image1=Complex sqrt leaf1.jpg |caption1=First leaf of the complex square root\n |image2=Complex sqrt leaf2.jpg |caption2=Second leaf of the complex square root\n |image3=Riemann surface sqrt.svg |caption3=Using the [[Riemann surface]] of the square root, it is shown how the two leaves fit together\n}}\n{{clear}}\nThe square of any positive or negative number is positive, and the square of 0 is 0. Therefore, no negative number can have a [[real number|real]] square root.  However, it is possible to work with a more inclusive set of numbers, called the [[complex number]]s, that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number.  This is done by introducing a new number, denoted by ''i'' (sometimes ''j'', especially in the context of [[electric current|electricity]] where \"''i''\" traditionally represents electric current) and called the [[imaginary unit]], which is ''defined'' such that {{nowrap|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. Using this notation, we can think of ''i'' as the square root of \u22121, but we also have {{nowrap|1=(\u2212''i'')<sup>2</sup> = ''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}} and so \u2212''i'' is also a square root of \u22121. By convention, the principal square root of \u22121 is ''i'', or more generally, if ''x'' is any nonnegative number, then the principal square root of \u2212''x'' is\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{-x} = i \\sqrt x.</math>\n\nThe right side (as well as its negative) is indeed a square root of \u2212''x'', since\n\n:<math>(i\\sqrt x)^2 = i^2(\\sqrt x)^2 = (-1)x = -x.</math>\n\nFor every non-zero complex number ''z'' there exist precisely two numbers ''w'' such that {{nowrap|1=''w''<sup>2</sup> = ''z''}}: the principal square root of ''z'' (defined below), and its negative.\n\n===Principal square root of a complex number===\n{{Visualisation complex number roots}}\nTo find a definition for the square root that allows us to consistently choose a single value, called the [[principal value]], we start by observing that any complex number ''x'' + ''iy'' can be viewed as a point in the plane, (''x'', ''y''), expressed using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]. The same point may be reinterpreted using [[polar coordinates]] as the pair <math>(r, \\varphi</math>), where ''r'' \u2265 0 is the distance of the point from the origin, and  <math>\\varphi</math> is the angle that the line from the origin to the point makes with the positive real (''x'') axis. In complex analysis, the location of this point is conventionally written <math>re^{i\\varphi}.</math> If\n\n:<math> z=r e^{i \\varphi} \\text{ with } -\\pi < \\varphi \\le \\pi, </math>\n\nthen we define the principal square root of ''z'' as follows:\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{z} = \\sqrt{r} e^{i \\varphi / 2}.</math>\n\nThe principal square root function is thus defined using the nonpositive real axis as a [[branch cut]].  The principal square root function is [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] everywhere except on the set of non-positive real numbers (on strictly negative reals it isn't even [[continuous function|continuous]]). The above Taylor series for {{sqrt|1 + ''x''}} remains valid for complex numbers ''x'' with {{nowrap|{{abs|''x''}} < 1}}.\n\nThe above can also be expressed in terms of [[trigonometric function]]s:\n:<math>\\sqrt{r \\left(\\cos \\varphi + i \\sin \\varphi \\right)} = \\sqrt{r} \\left ( \\cos \\frac{\\varphi}{2} + i \\sin \\frac{\\varphi}{2} \\right ) .</math>\n\n===Algebraic formula===\n[[Image:Imaginary2Root.svg|right|thumb|The square roots of {{mvar|i}}]]\nWhen the number is expressed using Cartesian coordinates the following formula can be used for the principal square root:<ref>{{cite book\n |title       = Handbook of mathematical functions with formulas, graphs, and mathematical tables\n |first1      = Milton\n |last1       = Abramowitz\n |first2      = Irene A.\n |last2       = Stegun\n |publisher   = Courier Dover Publications\n |year        = 1964\n |isbn        = 0-486-61272-4\n |page        = 17\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=MtU8uP7XMvoC\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160423180235/https://books.google.com/books?id=MtU8uP7XMvoC\n |archivedate = 2016-04-23\n}}, [http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_17.htm Section 3.7.27, p. 17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910094533/http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_17.htm |date=2009-09-10 }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |title       = Classical algebra: its nature, origins, and uses\n |first1      = Roger\n |last1       = Cooke\n |publisher   = John Wiley and Sons\n |year        = 2008\n |isbn        = 0-470-25952-3\n |page        = 59\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=lUcTsYopfhkC&pg=PA59\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160423183239/https://books.google.com/books?id=lUcTsYopfhkC&pg=PA59\n |archivedate = 2016-04-23\n}}\n</ref>\n:<math>\\sqrt{x+iy} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + x}{2}} \\pm i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} - x}{2}},</math>\nwhere the [[Sign function|sign]] of the imaginary part of the root is taken to be the same as the sign of the imaginary part of the original number, or positive when zero. The real part of the principal value is always nonnegative.\n\nFor example, the principal square roots of {{math|&plusmn;''i''}} are given by:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\sqrt{i} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(1+i),\\\\\n   \\sqrt{-i} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(1-i).\n \\end{align}</math>\n\n===Notes===\n\nIn the following, the complex ''z'' and ''w'' may be expressed as:\n\n* <math> z=|z|e^{i \\theta_z}</math>\n* <math> w=|w|e^{i \\theta_w}</math>\n\nwhere <math>-\\pi<\\theta_z\\le\\pi</math> and <math>-\\pi<\\theta_w\\le\\pi</math>.\n\nBecause of the discontinuous nature of the square root function in the complex plane, the following laws are '''not true''' in general.\n\n*  <math>\\sqrt{zw} = \\sqrt{z} \\sqrt{w}</math> (counterexample for the principal square root: {{math|1=''z'' = \u22121}} and  {{math|1=''w'' = \u22121}}) This equality is valid only when <math>-\\pi<\\theta_z+\\theta_w\\le\\pi</math>\n* <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{w}}{\\sqrt z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{w}{z}}</math> (counterexample for the principal square root: {{math|1=''w'' = 1}} and {{math|1=''z'' = \u22121}})This equality is valid only when <math>-\\pi<\\theta_w-\\theta_z\\le\\pi</math>\n*<math>\\sqrt{z^*} = \\left( \\sqrt z \\right)^*</math> (counterexample for the principal square root: {{math|1=''z'' = \u22121}})This equality is valid only when <math>\\theta_z\\ne\\pi</math>\n\nA similar problem appears with other complex functions with branch cuts, e.g., the [[complex logarithm]] and the relations {{math|1=log&thinsp;''z'' + log&thinsp;''w'' = log(''zw'')}} or {{math|1=log&thinsp;(''z''<sup>*</sup>) = log&thinsp;(''z'')<sup>*</sup>}} which are not true in general.\n\nWrongly assuming one of these laws underlies several faulty \"proofs\", for instance the following one showing that {{math|1=\u22121 = 1}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n-1 &= i \\cdot i \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{-1} \\cdot \\sqrt{-1} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\left(-1\\right)\\cdot\\left(-1\\right)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{1} \\\\\n&= 1\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe third equality cannot be justified (see [[invalid proof]]). It can be made to hold by changing the meaning of \u221a so that this no longer represents the principal square root (see above) but selects a branch for the square root that contains ({{sqrt|\u22121}})\u00b7({{sqrt|\u22121}}). The left-hand side becomes either\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{-1} \\cdot \\sqrt{-1}=i \\cdot i=-1</math>\n\nif the branch includes +''i'' or\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{-1} \\cdot \\sqrt{-1}=(-i) \\cdot (-i)=-1</math>\n\nif the branch includes \u2212''i'', while the right-hand side becomes\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{\\left(-1\\right)\\cdot\\left(-1\\right)}=\\sqrt{1}=-1,</math>\n\nwhere the last equality, {{math|1={{sqrt|1}} = \u22121}}, is a consequence of the choice of branch in the redefinition of \u221a.\n\n==Square roots of matrices and operators==\n{{Main article|Square root of a matrix}}\n{{See also|Square root of a 2 by 2 matrix}}\n\nIf ''A'' is a [[positive-definite matrix]] or operator, then there exists precisely one positive definite matrix or operator ''B'' with {{nowrap|1=''B''<sup>2</sup> = ''A''}}; we then define {{nowrap|1=''A''<sup>1/2</sup> = ''B''}}. In general matrices may have multiple square roots or even an infinitude of them.  For example, the {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} [[identity matrix]] has an infinity of square roots,<ref>Mitchell, Douglas W., \"Using Pythagorean triples to generate square roots of I<sub>2</sub>\", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 87, November 2003, 499\u2013500.</ref> though only one of them is positive definite.\n\n==In integral domains, including fields==\nEach element of an [[integral domain]] has no more than 2 square roots. The [[difference of two squares]] identity {{math|1=''u''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''v''<sup>2</sup> = (''u'' \u2212 ''v'')(''u'' + ''v'')}} is proved using the [[commutative ring|commutativity of multiplication]]. If {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are square roots of the same element, then {{math|1=''u''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''v''<sup>2</sup> = 0}}. Because there are no [[zero divisors]] this implies {{math|1=''u'' = ''v''}} or {{math|1=''u'' + ''v'' = 0}}, where the latter means that two roots are [[additive inverse]]s of each other. In other words if an element a square root {{mvar|u}} of an element {{mvar|a}} exists, then the only square roots of {{mvar|a}} are {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|&minus;u}}. The only square root of 0 in an integral domain is 0 itself.\n\nIn a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]&nbsp;2, an element either has one square root or does not have any at all, because each element is its own additive inverse, so that {{math|1=&minus;''u'' = ''u''}}. If the field is [[finite field|finite]] of characteristic&nbsp;2 then every element has a unique square root. In a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of any other characteristic, any non-zero element either has two square roots, as explained above, or does not have any.\n\nGiven an odd [[prime number]] {{mvar|p}}, let {{math|1=''q'' = ''p''<sup>''e''</sup>}} for some positive integer {{mvar|e}}. A non-zero element of the field [[finite field|{{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}]] with {{mvar|q}} elements is a [[quadratic residue]] if it has a square root in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}. Otherwise, it is a quadratic non-residue. There are {{math|(''q'' \u2212 1)/2}} quadratic residues and {{math|(''q'' \u2212 1)/2}} quadratic non-residues; zero is not counted in either class. The quadratic residues form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication. The properties of quadratic residues are widely used in [[number theory]].\n\n==In rings in general==\nUnlike in an integral domain, a square root in an arbitrary (unital) ring need not be unique up to sign.  For example, in the ring <math>\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}</math> of integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo 8]] (which is commutative, but has zero divisors), the element 1 has four distinct square roots: \u00b11 and \u00b13.\n\nAnother example is provided by the ring of [[quaternion]]s <math>\\mathbb{H},</math> which has no zero divisors, but is not commutative.  Here, the element \u22121 has [[quaternion#Square roots of \u22121|infinitely many square roots]], including {{math|\u00b1''i''}}, {{math|\u00b1''j''}}, and {{math|\u00b1''k''}}.  In fact, the set of square roots of \u22121 is exactly\n\n:<math>\\{ai + bj + ck \\mid a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1\\} .</math>\n\nA square root of 0 is either 0 or a zero divisor.  Thus in rings where zero divisors do not exist, it is uniquely 0.  However, rings with zero divisors may have multiple square roots of 0.  For example, in <math>\\mathbb{Z}/n^2\\mathbb{Z},</math> any multiple of {{mvar|n}} is a square root of 0.\n\n==Geometric construction of the square root==\n[[File:Euclid Corollary 5.svg|thumb|The [[Spiral of Theodorus]] up to the triangle with a hypotenuse of {{math|{{radic|4}}}} ({{math|1 {{=}} {{sqrt|1}}}})]]\n\nThe square root of a positive number is usually defined as the side length of a [[square]] with the [[area]] equal to the given number. But the square shape is not necessary for it: if one of two [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] [[Euclidean plane|planar Euclidean]] objects has the area ''a'' times greater than another, then the ratio of their linear sizes is {{sqrt|''a''}}.\n\nA square root can be constructed with a compass and straightedge. In his [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]], [[Euclid]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 300&nbsp;BC) gave the construction of the [[geometric mean]] of two quantities in two different places: [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookII/propII14.html Proposition II.14] and [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVI/propVI13.html Proposition VI.13].  Since the geometric mean of ''a'' and ''b'' is {{sqrt|''ab''}}, one can construct {{sqrt|''a''}} simply by taking {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 1}}.\n\nThe construction is also given by [[Descartes]] in his ''[[La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie]]'', see figure 2 on [http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=00570001&seq=12&frames=0&view=50 page 2]. However, Descartes made no claim to originality and his audience would have been quite familiar with Euclid.\n\nEuclid's second proof in Book VI depends on the theory of [[Similar triangles#Similar triangles|similar triangles]]. Let AHB be a line segment of length {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} with {{nowrap|1=AH = ''a''}} and {{nowrap|1=HB = ''b''}}. Construct the circle with AB as diameter and let C be one of the two intersections of the perpendicular chord at H with the circle and denote the length CH as ''h''. Then, using [[Thales' theorem]] and, as in the [[Pythagorean theorem#Proof using similar triangles|proof of Pythagoras' theorem by similar triangles]], triangle AHC is similar to triangle CHB (as indeed both are to triangle ACB, though we don't need that, but it is the essence of the proof of Pythagoras' theorem) so that AH:CH is as HC:HB, i.e. {{nowrap|1= ''a''/''h'' = ''h''/''b''}}, from which we conclude by cross-multiplication that {{nowrap|1= ''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''ab''}}, and finally that {{nowrap|1=''h'' = {{sqrt|''ab''}}}}. When marking the midpoint O of the line segment AB and drawing the radius OC of length {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''b'')/2}}, then clearly OC > CH, i.e. {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''b'')/2 \u2265 {{sqrt|''ab''}}}} (with equality if and only if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}), which is the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means|arithmetic\u2013geometric mean inequality for two variables]] and, as noted [[Square root#Computation|above]], is the basis of the [[Greek Mathematics|Ancient Greek]] understanding of \"Heron's method\".\n\nAnother method of geometric construction uses [[right triangle]]s and [[Mathematical induction|induction]]: {{sqrt|1}} can, of course, be constructed, and once {{sqrt|''x''}} has been constructed, the right triangle with legs 1 and {{sqrt|''x''}} has a [[hypotenuse]] of {{sqrt|''x'' + 1}}. Constructing successive square roots in this manner yields the [[Spiral of Theodorus]] depicted above.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apotome (mathematics)]]\n* [[Cube root]]\n* [[Integer square root]]\n* [[Nested radical]]\n* [[Nth root]]\n* [[Root of unity]]\n* [[Solving quadratic equations with continued fractions]]\n* [[Square root principle]]\n* [[Quantum gate#Square root of NOT gate (\u221aNOT)|The square root of NOT gate ({{sqrt|NOT}})]], one of the [[logic gate]]s used in [[quantum computer]]s (doesn't exist for non-quantum where [[NOT gate]]s are used)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last = Dauben | first = Joseph W. | author-link = Joseph Dauben | editor-last = Katz | editor-first = Victor J. | title = The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam | chapter = Chinese Mathematics I | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3ullzl036UEC | isbn = 0-691-11485-4}}\n* {{cite book|title=Algebra|edition=3rd|first1=Izrael M.|last1=Gel'fand|first2=Alexander|author1-link=Israel Gelfand|last2=Shen|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=1993|isbn=0-8176-3677-3|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9z7iliyFD0C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Joseph | first = George | title = The Crest of the Peacock | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-691-00659-8 | url = https://archive.org/details/crestofpeacockno00jose }}\n* {{cite book | last = Smith | first = David | author-link = David Eugene Smith| title = History of Mathematics | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1958 | isbn = 978-0-486-20430-7 | volume = 2}}\n* {{citation|last=Selin|first=Helaine|author-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt9DIY1g9HYC&pg=PA1268|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-4559-2}}.\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/sqroot.html Algorithms, implementations, and more]{{snd}}Paul Hsieh's square roots webpage\n* [http://johnkerl.org/doc/square-root.html How to manually find a square root]\n* [http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fc-2013-05 AMS Featured Column, Galileo's Arithmetic by Tony Philips]{{snd}}includes a section on how Galileo found square roots\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Square Root}}\n[[Category:Elementary special functions]]\n[[Category:Elementary mathematics]]\n[[Category:Unary operations]]\n", "name_user": "80.2.150.3", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePrincipal square root of a complex number)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root"}

After the first four Axis singles in early 1980, the name was changed when it became apparent that the name Axis was already being used by another music company. The solution to this problem came from a promotional flyer that they had printed to call attention to the new releases. The flyer's designer had added some typography that played on both the new year and the idea of progress:\n\n1980 FORWARD<br />\n1980 FWD<br />\n1984 AD<br />\n4AD\n\nScrambling for a new name, Ivo glanced at the flyer and suggested \"4AD.\" Peter Kent agreed, and, with that split-second decision, 4AD was named.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAn initial idea for the label was that it would be a \"testing ground\" for Beggars Banquet; successful acts would graduate up to Beggars Banquet after a year at 4AD. The only band to follow this path would be [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], who were signed to Beggars Banquet in late 1980 before Ivo and Peter purchased the label outright.\n\nThe two were the sole owners for about a year. Kent sold his share to Watts-Russell at the end of 1981, and started a new Beggars Banquet subsidiary, [[Situation Two Records]]. Watts-Russell would maintain ownership of the label, and act as its president, until the late 1990s.\n\nWatts-Russell invited the graphic designer [Vaughan Oliver] and the photographer Nigel Grierson to create sleeve art for the label, and as a result, 4AD acquired a visually distinctive identity. Its artists, such as [[Cocteau Twins]] and [[Dead Can Dance]], developed cult followings in the mid-1980s, but 4AD continued to evolve, and, after signing [[Throwing Muses]] and [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], the label increasingly concentrated on underground American rock music. In 1983, 4AD had a minor hit in America with the [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]] single \"[[I Melt With You]]\". In 1987, 4AD had a UK number-one hit with the [[sound collage|collaged]] \"[[Pump up the Volume (song)|Pump up the Volume]]\" by [[MARRS|M{{pipe}}A{{pipe}}R{{pipe}}R{{pipe}}S]] (licensed to [[4th & B'way Records|4th & B'Way]]/Island Records in the US).\n\nIn the 1990s, 4AD established an office in [[Los Angeles]] and had success with bands such as [[The Breeders]], [[Red House Painters]], [[Unrest (band)|Unrest]] and [[His Name Is Alive]]. In 1999, Watts-Russell sold his share in 4AD back to the Beggars Group (as it had by then become), but the label continued to release music and add new artists to its roster.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/events/1980/guide.shtml\n| title=6 Music \u2013 1980 Forward \u2013 25 Years of 4AD\n| publisher=[[BBC]]\n| date=2005-11-21\n| accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref>\n\nThe label's deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in the United States in 1992 would start the beginning of a new phase in 4AD history. New signings that year included American underground acts [[Kendra Smith]], [[Tarnation (band)|Tarnation]], [[Air Miami]] and [[The Amps]].\n\nSimon Halliday took control of the label at the end of 2007. Immediate successes were [[Bon Iver]]'s critically lauded debut [[For Emma, Forever Ago]] (CAD 2809) and [[Dear Science]] by Brooklyn's [[TV on the Radio]] (CAD 2821). In 2008, the Beggars Group re-aligned itself so that several labels, including Beggars Banquet itself, were folded up on to the 4AD label.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/apr/30/afarewelltobeggarsbanquets|title=A farewell to Beggars Banquet's indie charm|last=Swash|first=Rosie|date=2008-04-30|department=Music Blog|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News & Media|accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/50320-label-shuffle-4ad-absorbs-too-pure-beggars-banquet|title=Label Shuffle: 4AD Absorbs Too Pure, Beggars Banquet |last=Solarski|first=Matthew|date=2008-04-29|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|publisher=Pitchfork Media|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219062324/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/50320-label-shuffle-4ad-absorbs-too-pure-beggars-banquet|archivedate=2008-12-19|url-status=dead|accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref> Bands including [[The National (band)|The National]] were moved to 4AD as a part of this merger. 2009 saw the release, amongst others, of [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]]'s second record [[Actor (album)|Actor]] (CAD 2919) and [[Camera Obscura (band)|Camera Obscura]]'s [[My Maudlin Career]], with 2010 bringing [[The National (band)|The National]]'s [[High Violet]] and acclaimed albums from [[Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti]], [[Blonde Redhead]] and [[Deerhunter (band)|Deerhunter]].\n\nIn the next three years, 4AD oversaw new releases from [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], [[Bon Iver]], [[Iron & Wine]], and [[Tune-Yards]], whilst also expanded its roster with a number of beats and electronic acts<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.factmag.com/2012/08/07/4ad-boss-simon-halliday-on-living-with-the-labels-past-and-building-its-future/\n| title=4AD boss Simon Halliday on living with the label\u2019s past, and his vision for its future\n| author=Joe Muggs\n| date=2012-08-07\n| publisher=[[Fact (UK magazine)|FACT]]\n| accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref> in the shape of acts including [[Purity Ring (band)|Purity Ring]] and [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], with the latter releasing one of the best received albums of 2012. The latest signings to the label are bEEdEEgEE, of [[Gang Gang Dance]], [[Lo-Fang]], and British producer [[Sohn (musician)|SOHN]]. At the start of 2014, the label also announced the additions of [[Future Islands]] and Merchandise, followed by D.D Dumbo.\n\n2015 saw critically lauded releases by Deerhunter and Grimes, amongst others, with the following years seeing the label, and The National, land their first ever UK #1 record with [[Sleep Well Beast]].  Latest signings to the roster include Aldous Harding and British artist Pixx.\n\n== Distribution ==\nWhile 4AD did not handle any distribution outside the [[United Kingdom]] for many years, it had many willing distributors in many countries: [[Virgin Records]] for France, [[Nippon Columbia]] distributed much of the label in [[Japan]], while [[PolyGram]] subsidiary [[Vertigo Records]] released many of the label's records in [[Canada]]. The United States had always been a tough market for 4AD, even though its records sold well there as imports. Only a few of the label's acts had deals to license their recordings in the US, among various labels.\n\nIn 1992, Ivo signed a five-year distribution deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] so that nearly all 4AD releases would be released in the United States. While this seemed to be a simple licensing deal, in reality executives from Warner Bros. took a lot of control during this period, as 4AD shifted focus to the US market, signing more American bands. While still president, it is clear that Ivo ceded some control during this period, and when the deal ended, he offered to sell the label back to Beggars Banquet. Dead Can Dance's oeuvre, however, stayed with Warner Bros. until the sale back to Beggars Group.\n\nThe deal with Beggars was completed by early 1999, and since then it has owned 4AD and its distribution worldwide. This led to many negotiations for the label's back catalogue, like getting back US distribution rights for the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[Dead Can Dance]], and [[Cocteau Twins]].\n\n== Artists ==\n\n=== Current ===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- <!-- Table only gets ONE ROW -->\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:*;\"| <!-- New COL -->\n* [[Aldous Harding]]\n* [[Atlas Sound]]\n* [[Becky and the Birds]]\n* [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]]\n* [[Big Thief]]\n* [[Bing & Ruth]]\n* [[The Breeders]]\n* [[D.D Dumbo]]\n* [[Daughter (band)|Daughter]]\n* [[Deerhunter]]\n\n* [[Dry Cleaning]]\n* [[Efterklang]]\n* [[EL VY]]\n* [[Daughter (band)#Ex:Re|Ex:Re]]\n* [[Future Islands]]\n* [[Gang Gang Dance]]\n* [[Gene Clark]]\n* [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]]\n* [[Holly Herndon]]\n | style=\"vertical-align:top; width:*;\"| <!-- New COL -->\n* [[The Lemon Twigs]]\n* [[Methyl Ethel]]\n* [[The National (band)|The National]]\n* Pixx\n* [[Purity Ring (band)|Purity Ring]]\n* [[Sohn (musician)|SOHN]]\n* [[Spencer.]]\n* [[Tune-Yards]]\n* [[U.S. Girls]]\n* [[Velvet Negroni]]\n|}\n\n=== Former ===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n* [[Air Miami]] (disbanded)\n* [[The Amps]] (disbanded)\n* [[Anni Rossi]] (active)\n* [[A.R.

Although there have been some variations over the years, some general rules can be devised to easily determine the format (LP, CD, etc.) and year of release by looking at a 4AD catalog number.\n\n=== Prefix ===\nThe first part of a catalog number is a prefix that contains a variation of \"AD,\" based on the 4AD name. Some standards are:\n* AD = single\n* BAD = EP\n* CAD = full-length LP\n* DAD = double LP\n* MAD = [[mini-LP]]\n\nSpecial editions of releases had an extra \"D\" added to the prefix:\n* CAD D = special edition of a full-length LP\n* DAD D = special edition of a double LP\n\nSome other \"AD\" variations have been used less frequently over the years, including (but not limited to):\n* EAD = electronic download\n* GAD = reissue (usually mid-priced)\n* HAD = remastered or significantly altered reissue (usually with some combination of bonus tracks, re-mastering, or new artwork)\n* JAD and MAD = \"mini album\" that is longer than an EP but shorter than an LP\n* SAD = [[Super Audio CD]] release (as in the [[Dead Can Dance]] 2008 remastered reissues)\n* TAD = temporary/limited release\n\n4AD only released one LP on [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT format]], Cocteau Twins' ''[[Blue Bell Knoll]]'', which was designated CADT 807.\n\n=== Numerical designation ===\nThe second part of the catalog number is a number that represents the year of release (via the number of years since 1980, following the '1980 Forward' theme), and the order of release in the particular year. For example, [[This Mortal Coil]]'s LP ''[[It'll End in Tears]]'' is CAD 411. The \"CAD\" represents that the release is an LP, the \"4\" in 411 represents 1984, and 11 marks the 11th release of that year. This is the vinyl LP release; cassette versions have \"C\" added to the prefix (CADC 411 in this example); CD versions have \"CD\" added at the end (CAD 411CD).\n\nA side effect of this scheme is that it made it seem like 4AD had hundreds of releases early on. Again using CAD411 as an example, a causal observer might assume this was the 411th release in the label's catalog, when 4AD actually had less than 100 total releases in their catalog at the time. In the 1990s, 4AD changed the first part of the number from \"100s\" to \"1000s,\" temporarily making the number not correspond with the number of years since 1980. Releases in 1990 used \"00\" directly after the prefix (e.g., the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]' ''[[Bossanova]]'', CAD0010, released in the fall of 1990); 1991 used \"10\" directly after the prefix (e.g., This Mortal Coil's ''[[Blood (This Mortal Coil album)|Blood]]'', DAD 1005, released early in 1991), 1992 used \"20,\" and so on for the rest of the 1990s.\n\nWanting to return to numbering with the years since 1980, 4AD had to provide a workaround for releases in the year 2000. Since the \"20\" numerical designation had been used in 1992, all releases in 2000 used \"2K\" (e.g., [[Mojave 3]]'s ''[[Excuses for Travellers]]'', CAD 2K05, released in early 2000). Between 2001 and 2009, the catalog numbering scheme returned to the original format, with the first two digits of the number representing the years since 1980 (e.g., [[Blonde Redhead]]'s ''[[23 (Blonde Redhead album)|23]]'', CAD '''27'''17, released in 2007 \u2013 the '''27'''th year since 1980). Things have not been too consistent since, and there have been several gaps. 2010 releases feature the numerical designation 3X, as \"30\" had already been used in 1993.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/29/4ad-indie-label-30th-anniversary\n| title=4AD, the record label that gave birth to indie cool, celebrates 30th anniversary\n| first=Vanessa\n| last=Thorpe\n| date=2010-08-28\n| publisher=The Guardian\n| accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref>\nThis process appears to have come to an end with the few ''x''AD37''nn'' releases of the early months of 2017.

In 1987, the label scored an international hit with the [[dance music]] single \"[[Pump Up the Volume (song)|Pump Up the Volume]]\" by the one-off project [[MARRS|M/A/R/R/S]]. 4AD continued to have success in the 1990s and 2000s with releases from [[The Breeders]], [[Lush (band)|Lush]], [[Red House Painters]], [[Camera Obscura (band)|Camera Obscura]], [[TV on the Radio]], [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]] and [[Bon Iver]].

After the first four Axis singles in early 1980, the name was changed when it became apparent that the name Axis was already being used by another music company. The solution to this problem came from a promotional flyer that they had printed to call attention to the new releases. The flyer's designer had added some typography that played on both the new year and the idea of progress:\n\n1980 FORWARD<br />\n1980 FWD<br />\n1984 AD<br />\n4AD\n\nScrambling for a new name, Ivo glanced at the flyer and suggested \"4AD.\" Peter Kent agreed, and, with that split-second decision, 4AD was named.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAn initial idea for the label was that it would be a \"testing ground\" for Beggars Banquet; successful acts would graduate up to Beggars Banquet after a year at 4AD. The only band to follow this path would be [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], who were signed to Beggars Banquet in late 1980 before Ivo and Peter purchased the label outright.\n\nThe two were the sole owners for about a year. Kent sold his share to Watts-Russell at the end of 1981, and started a new Beggars Banquet subsidiary, [[Situation Two Records]]. Watts-Russell would maintain ownership of the label, and act as its president, until the late 1990s.\n\nWatts-Russell invited the graphic designer [Vaughan Oliver] and the photographer Nigel Grierson to create sleeve art for the label, and as a result, 4AD acquired a visually distinctive identity. Its artists, such as [[Cocteau Twins]] and [[Dead Can Dance]], developed cult followings in the mid-1980s, but 4AD continued to evolve, and, after signing [[Throwing Muses]] and [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], the label increasingly concentrated on underground American rock music. In 1983, 4AD had a minor hit in America with the [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]] single \"[[I Melt With You]]\". In 1987, 4AD had a UK number-one hit with the [[sound collage|collaged]] \"[[Pump up the Volume (song)|Pump up the Volume]]\" by [[MARRS|M{{pipe}}A{{pipe}}R{{pipe}}R{{pipe}}S]] (licensed to [[4th & B'way Records|4th & B'Way]]/Island Records in the US).\n\nIn the 1990s, 4AD established an office in [[Los Angeles]] and had success with bands such as [[The Breeders]], [[Red House Painters]], [[Unrest (band)|Unrest]] and [[His Name Is Alive]]. In 1999, Watts-Russell sold his share in 4AD back to the Beggars Group (as it had by then become), but the label continued to release music and add new artists to its roster.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/events/1980/guide.shtml\n| title=6 Music \u2013 1980 Forward \u2013 25 Years of 4AD\n| publisher=[[BBC]]\n| date=2005-11-21\n| accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref>\n\nThe label's deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in the United States in 1992 would start the beginning of a new phase in 4AD history. New signings that year included American underground acts [[Kendra Smith]], [[Tarnation (band)|Tarnation]], [[Air Miami]] and [[The Amps]].\n\nSimon Halliday took control of the label at the end of 2007. Immediate successes were [[Bon Iver]]'s critically lauded debut [[For Emma, Forever Ago]] (CAD 2809) and [[Dear Science]] by Brooklyn's [[TV on the Radio]] (CAD 2821). In 2008, the Beggars Group re-aligned itself so that several labels, including Beggars Banquet itself, were folded up on to the 4AD label.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/apr/30/afarewelltobeggarsbanquets|title=A farewell to Beggars Banquet's indie charm|last=Swash|first=Rosie|date=2008-04-30|department=Music Blog|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News & Media|accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/50320-label-shuffle-4ad-absorbs-too-pure-beggars-banquet|title=Label Shuffle: 4AD Absorbs Too Pure, Beggars Banquet |last=Solarski|first=Matthew|date=2008-04-29|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|publisher=Pitchfork Media|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219062324/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/50320-label-shuffle-4ad-absorbs-too-pure-beggars-banquet|archivedate=2008-12-19|url-status=dead|accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref> Bands including [[The National (band)|The National]] were moved to 4AD as a part of this merger. 2009 saw the release, amongst others, of [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]]'s second record [[Actor (album)|Actor]] (CAD 2919) and [[Camera Obscura (band)|Camera Obscura]]'s [[My Maudlin Career]], with 2010 bringing [[The National (band)|The National]]'s [[High Violet]] and acclaimed albums from [[Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti]], [[Blonde Redhead]] and [[Deerhunter (band)|Deerhunter]].\n\nIn the next three years, 4AD oversaw new releases from [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], [[Bon Iver]], [[Iron & Wine]], and [[Tune-Yards]], whilst also expanded its roster with a number of beats and electronic acts<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.factmag.com/2012/08/07/4ad-boss-simon-halliday-on-living-with-the-labels-past-and-building-its-future/\n| title=4AD boss Simon Halliday on living with the label\u2019s past, and his vision for its future\n| author=Joe Muggs\n| date=2012-08-07\n| publisher=[[Fact (UK magazine)|FACT]]\n| accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref> in the shape of acts including [[Purity Ring (band)|Purity Ring]] and [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], with the latter releasing one of the best received albums of 2012. The latest signings to the label are bEEdEEgEE, of [[Gang Gang Dance]], [[Lo-Fang]], and British producer [[Sohn (musician)|SOHN]]. At the start of 2014, the label also announced the additions of [[Future Islands]] and Merchandise, followed by D.D Dumbo.\n\n2015 saw critically lauded releases by Deerhunter and Grimes, amongst others, with the following years seeing the label, and The National, land their first ever UK #1 record with [[Sleep Well Beast]].  Latest signings to the roster include Aldous Harding and British artist Pixx.\n\n== Distribution ==\nWhile 4AD did not handle any distribution outside the [[United Kingdom]] for many years, it had many willing distributors in many countries: [[Virgin Records]] for France, [[Nippon Columbia]] distributed much of the label in [[Japan]], while [[PolyGram]] subsidiary [[Vertigo Records]] released many of the label's records in [[Canada]]. The United States had always been a tough market for 4AD, even though its records sold well there as imports. Only a few of the label's acts had deals to license their recordings in the US, among various labels.\n\nIn 1992, Ivo signed a five-year distribution deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] so that nearly all 4AD releases would be released in the United States. While this seemed to be a simple licensing deal, in reality executives from Warner Bros. took a lot of control during this period, as 4AD shifted focus to the US market, signing more American bands. While still president, it is clear that Ivo ceded some control during this period, and when the deal ended, he offered to sell the label back to Beggars Banquet. Dead Can Dance's oeuvre, however, stayed with Warner Bros. until the sale back to Beggars Group.\n\nThe deal with Beggars was completed by early 1999, and since then it has owned 4AD and its distribution worldwide. This led to many negotiations for the label's back catalogue, like getting back US distribution rights for the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[Dead Can Dance]], and [[Cocteau Twins]].\n\n== Artists ==\n\n=== Current ===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- <!-- Table only gets ONE ROW -->\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:*;\"| <!-- New COL -->\n* [[Aldous Harding]]\n* [[Atlas Sound]]\n* [[Becky and the Birds]]\n* [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]]\n* [[Big Thief]]\n* [[Bing & Ruth]]\n* [[The Breeders]]\n* [[D.D Dumbo]]\n* [[Daughter (band)|Daughter]]\n* [[Deerhunter]]\n\n* [[Dry Cleaning]]\n* [[Efterklang]]\n* [[EL VY]]\n* [[Daughter (band)#Ex:Re|Ex:Re]]\n* [[Future Islands]]\n* [[Gang Gang Dance]]\n* [[Gene Clark]]\n* [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]]\n* [[Holly Herndon]]\n | style=\"vertical-align:top; width:*;\"| <!-- New COL -->\n* [[The Lemon Twigs]]\n* [[Methyl Ethel]]\n* [[The National (band)|The National]]\n* Pixx\n* [[Purity Ring (band)|Purity Ring]]\n* [[Sohn (musician)|SOHN]]\n* [[Spencer.]]\n* [[Tune-Yards]]\n* [[U.S. Girls]]\n* [[Velvet Negroni]]\n|}\n\n=== Former ===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n* [[Air Miami]] (disbanded)\n* [[The Amps]] (disbanded)\n* [[Anni Rossi]] (active)\n* [[A.R.

Although there have been some variations over the years, some general rules can be devised to easily determine the format (LP, CD, etc.) and year of release by looking at a 4AD catalog number.\n\n=== Prefix ===\nThe first part of a catalog number is a prefix that contains a variation of \"AD,\" based on the 4AD name. Some standards are:\n* AD = single\n* BAD = EP\n* CAD = full-length LP\n* DAD = double LP\n* MAD = [[mini-LP]]\n\nSpecial editions of releases had an extra \"D\" added to the prefix:\n* CAD D = special edition of a full-length LP\n* DAD D = special edition of a double LP\n\nSome other \"AD\" variations have been used less frequently over the years, including (but not limited to):\n* EAD = electronic download\n* GAD = reissue (usually mid-priced)\n* HAD = remastered or significantly altered reissue (usually with some combination of bonus tracks, re-mastering, or new artwork)\n* JAD and MAD = \"mini album\" that is longer than an EP but shorter than an LP\n* SAD = [[Super Audio CD]] release (as in the [[Dead Can Dance]] 2008 remastered reissues)\n* TAD = temporary/limited release\n\n4AD only released one LP on [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT format]], Cocteau Twins' ''[[Blue Bell Knoll]]'', which was designated CADT 807.\n\n=== Numerical designation ===\nThe second part of the catalog number is a number that represents the year of release (via the number of years since 1980, following the '1980 Forward' theme), and the order of release in the particular year. For example, [[This Mortal Coil]]'s LP ''[[It'll End in Tears]]'' is CAD 411. The \"CAD\" represents that the release is an LP, the \"4\" in 411 represents 1984, and 11 marks the 11th release of that year. This is the vinyl LP release; cassette versions have \"C\" added to the prefix (CADC 411 in this example); CD versions have \"CD\" added at the end (CAD 411CD).\n\nA side effect of this scheme is that it made it seem like 4AD had hundreds of releases early on. Again using CAD411 as an example, a causal observer might assume this was the 411th release in the label's catalog, when 4AD actually had less than 100 total releases in their catalog at the time. In the 1990s, 4AD changed the first part of the number from \"100s\" to \"1000s,\" temporarily making the number not correspond with the number of years since 1980. Releases in 1990 used \"00\" directly after the prefix (e.g., the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]' ''[[Bossanova]]'', CAD0010, released in the fall of 1990); 1991 used \"10\" directly after the prefix (e.g., This Mortal Coil's ''[[Blood (This Mortal Coil album)|Blood]]'', DAD 1005, released early in 1991), 1992 used \"20,\" and so on for the rest of the 1990s.\n\nWanting to return to numbering with the years since 1980, 4AD had to provide a workaround for releases in the year 2000. Since the \"20\" numerical designation had been used in 1992, all releases in 2000 used \"2K\" (e.g., [[Mojave 3]]'s ''[[Excuses for Travellers]]'', CAD 2K05, released in early 2000). Between 2001 and 2009, the catalog numbering scheme returned to the original format, with the first two digits of the number representing the years since 1980 (e.g., [[Blonde Redhead]]'s ''[[23 (Blonde Redhead album)|23]]'', CAD '''27'''17, released in 2007 \u2013 the '''27'''th year since 1980). Things have not been too consistent since, and there have been several gaps. 2010 releases feature the numerical designation 3X, as \"30\" had already been used in 1993.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/29/4ad-indie-label-30th-anniversary\n| title=4AD, the record label that gave birth to indie cool, celebrates 30th anniversary\n| first=Vanessa\n| last=Thorpe\n| date=2010-08-28\n| publisher=The Guardian\n| accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref>\nThis process appears to have come to an end with the few ''x''AD37''nn'' releases of the early months of 2017. The catalogue numbers of all releases since April 2017 (beginning with ''The Far Field'' by [[Future Islands]], 4AD0001CD/4AD0001LP) have begun with 4AD00''nn'' and ended with letters indicating the release format. No indication of release year is given.\n\n== 4AD Sessions ==\nThe 4AD Sessions are an ongoing series of video recordings with various acts from the label's roster. Following on from the [[Deerhunter]] session at the Studio Plateaux on Platts Eyott island in 2008, the recordings see 4AD artists performing back-catalogue covers and alternative versions of their own material.

{"title_page": "Philosophical zombie", "text_new": "{{other uses|Zombie (disambiguation)}}\n{{Short description|A thought experiment in philosophy}}\n\nThe '''philosophical zombie''' or '''p-zombie''' argument is a [[thought experiment]] in [[philosophy of mind]] and [[philosophy of perception]] that imagines a being that, if it could conceivably exist, logically disproves the idea that physical substance is all that is required to explain consciousness. Such a zombie would be indistinguishable from a normal human being but lack [[consciousness|conscious experience]], [[qualia]], or [[sentience]].<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">{{cite web |last=Kirk |first=Robert |title=Zombies |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/zombies/ }}</ref> For example, if a philosophical zombie were poked with a sharp object it would not inwardly feel any pain, yet it would outwardly behave exactly as if it did feel pain. The thought experiment sometimes takes the form of imagining a zombie world, indistinguishable from our world, but lacking first person experiences in any of the beings of that world.\n\nPhilosophical zombie [[argument]]s are used in support of [[mind-body dualism]] against forms of [[physicalism]] such as [[materialism]], [[behaviorism]] and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]. It is an argument against the idea that the \"[[hard problem of consciousness]]\" (accounting for subjective, intrinsic, first person, what-it's-like-ness) could be answered by purely physical means. Proponents of the argument, such as philosopher [[David Chalmers]], argue that since a zombie is defined as physiologically indistinguishable from human beings, even its [[logical possibility]] would be a sound refutation of physicalism, because it would establish the existence of conscious experience as a [[further facts|further fact]].<ref name=\"Chalmers, D. 1996\">Chalmers, D.

Hill|Christopher Hill]] argue that philosophical zombies are coherent but not metaphysically possible.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\n==History==\nPhilosophical zombies are associated with David Chalmers, but it was philosopher [[Robert Kirk (philosopher)|Robert Kirk]] who first used the term \"zombie\" in this context in 1974. Prior to that, Keith Campbell made a similar argument in his 1970 book ''Body and Mind'', using the term \"Imitation Man.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philpapers.org/browse/zombies-and-the-conceivability-argument|title=Zombies and the Conceivability Argument|last=Chalmers|first=David|date=21 March 2019|website=Phil Papers|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Chalmers further developed and popularized the idea in his work.

P-zombies were introduced primarily to argue against specific types of physicalism such as [[behaviorism]], according to which mental states exist solely as behavior. Belief, desire, thought, consciousness, and so on, are only behavior (whether external behavior or internal behavior) or tendencies towards behaviors. A p-zombie that is behaviorally indistinguishable from a normal human being but lacks conscious experiences is therefore not logically possible according to the behaviorist {{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}, so an appeal to the logical possibility of a p-zombie furnishes an argument that behaviorism is false. Proponents of zombie arguments generally accept that p-zombies are not [[Modal logic#Physical possibility|physically possible]], while opponents necessarily deny that they are metaphysically or, in some cases, even logically possible.\n\nThe unifying idea of the zombie is of a human that has no conscious experience, but one might distinguish various types of zombie used in different thought experiments as follows:\n\n* A '''behavioral zombie''' that is behaviorally indistinguishable from a human.\n* A '''neurological zombie''' that has a human brain and is generally physiologically indistinguishable from a human.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harnad, Stevan |year=2000 |url=http://cogprints.org/2615/ |title=Minds, Machines, and Turing: The Indistinguishability of Indistinguishables |publisher=Journal of Logic, Language, and Information |volume= 9 |issue= 4 |pages= 425\u2013445 |author-link=Stevan Harnad }}</ref>\n* A '''soulless zombie''' that lacks a [[soul]].\n*A '''zombie universe''' that is identical to our world in all physical ways, except no being in that world has [[qualia]].\n\n==Zombie arguments==\nZombie arguments often support lines of reasoning that aim to show that zombies are metaphysically possible in order to support some form of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] \u2013 in this case the view that the world includes two kinds of [[Substance theory|substance]] (or perhaps two kinds of [[Property (philosophy)|property]]); the mental and the physical.<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Howard |title=Dualism |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/dualism/ }}</ref> According to physicalism, physical facts determine all other facts. Since any fact other than that of consciousness may be held to be the same for a p-zombie and a normal conscious human, it follows that physicalism must hold that p-zombies are either not possible or are the same as normal humans.\n\nThe zombie argument is a version of general [[modal logic|modal arguments]] against physicalism such as that of [[Saul Kripke]]<ref>Kripke, Saul. ''Naming and Necessity'' (1972)</ref> and the kind of physicalism known as [[type-identity theory]]. Further such arguments were notably advanced in the 1970s by [[Thomas Nagel]] (1970; 1974) and [[Robert Kirk (philosopher)|Robert Kirk]] (1974) but the general argument was most famously developed in detail by [[David Chalmers]] in ''[[The Conscious Mind]]'' (1996). According to Chalmers one can coherently conceive of an entire zombie world, a world physically indistinguishable from this world but entirely lacking conscious experience. The counterpart of every conscious being in our world would be a p-zombie. Since such a world is conceivable, Chalmers claims, it is metaphysically possible, which is all the argument requires. Chalmers states: \"Zombies are probably not naturally possible: they probably cannot exist in our world, with its laws of nature.\"<ref name=\"Chalmers2\">Chalmers, 2003, p. 5.</ref> The outline structure of Chalmers' version of the zombie argument is as follows;\n\n#According to physicalism, all that exists in our world (including consciousness) is physical. \n#Thus, if physicalism is true, a metaphysically possible world in which all physical facts are the same as those of the actual world must contain everything that exists in our actual world. In particular, conscious experience must exist in such a possible world.\n#In fact we can conceive of a world physically indistinguishable from our world but in which there is no consciousness (a zombie world). From this (so Chalmers argues) it follows that such a world is metaphysically possible. \n#Therefore, physicalism is false. (The conclusion [[Logical consequence|follows from]] 2. and 3. by ''[[modus tollens]]''.)\n\nThe above is a strong formulation of the zombie argument. There are other formulations of the zombies-type argument which follow the same general form. The premises of the general zombies argument are implied by the premises of all the specific zombie arguments. A general zombies argument is in part motivated by potential disagreements between various anti-physicalist views. For example, an anti-physicalist view can consistently assert that p-zombies are metaphysically impossible but that inverted qualia (such as inverted spectra) or absent qualia (partial zombiehood) are metaphysically possible. Premises regarding inverted qualia or partial zombiehood can substitute premises regarding p-zombies to produce variations of the zombie argument. The metaphysical possibility of a physically indistinguishable world with either inverted qualia or partial zombiehood would imply that physical truths don't metaphysically necessitate phenomenal truths. To formulate the general form of the zombies argument, take the sentence 'P' to be true if and only if the conjunct of all microphysical truths of our world obtain, take the sentence 'Q' to be true if some phenomenal truth, that obtains in the actual world, obtains. The general argument goes as follows.\n\n#It is conceivable that P is true and Q is not true.\n#If it is conceivable that P is true and Q is not true then it is metaphysically possible that P is true and Q not true.\n#If it is metaphysically possible that P is true and Q is not true then physicalism is false.\n#Therefore, physicalism is false.<ref name=\"Chalmers5\">Chalmers, 2010, p. 106-109</ref>\n\nQ can be false in a possible world if any of the following obtains: (1) there exists at least one invert relative to the actual world (2) there is at least one absent quale relative to the actual world (3) all actually conscious beings are p-zombies (all actual qualia are absent qualia).\n\n==Responses==\nIf one accepts two-dimensional semantics, Chalmers' argument is logically [[Validity (logic)|valid]]. Some philosophers accept its validity but dispute its soundness, arguing that its premises are false. Zombies might not actually be conceivable or, if they are, just because they are conceivable, that might not mean that they are possible. Chalmers has argued that zombies are conceivable, saying \"it certainly seems that a coherent situation is described; I can discern no contradiction in the description.\"<ref>Chalmers, 1996, p. 96.</ref> \nThis leads to the questions of the relevant notion of \"possibility\": if something is conceivable, does that mean it is possible? Most physicalist responses deny that the premise of a zombie scenario is possible.\n\nMany physicalist philosophers have argued that this scenario [[Self-refuting idea|eliminates itself by its description]]; the basis of a physicalist argument is that the world is defined entirely by physicality; thus, a world that was physically identical would necessarily contain consciousness, as consciousness would necessarily be generated from any set of physical circumstances identical to our own.\n\nOne can hold that zombies are a [[logical possibility]] but not a [[metaphysical possibility]]. If logical possibility does not entail metaphysical possibility across the domain of relevant truths, then the mere logical possibility of zombies is not sufficient to establish their metaphysical possibility. The zombie argument claims that one can tell by the power of reason that such a \"zombie scenario\" is metaphysically possible. Chalmers states; \"From the conceivability of zombies, proponents of the argument infer their metaphysical possibility\"<ref name=\"Chalmers2\"/> and argues that this inference, while not generally legitimate, is legitimate for phenomenal concepts such as consciousness since we must adhere to \"Kripke's insight that for phenomenal concepts, there is no gap between reference-fixers and reference (or between primary and secondary intentions).\" That is, for phenomenal concepts, conceivability implies possibility. According to Chalmers, whatever is logically possible is also, in the sense relevant here, metaphysically possible.<ref>Chalmers, 1996, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\nAnother response is the denial of the idea that qualia and related phenomenal notions of the mind are in the first place coherent concepts. [[Daniel Dennett]] and others argue that while [[Subjective character of experience|consciousness and subjective experience]] exist in some sense, they are not as the zombie argument proponent claims. The experience of pain, for example, is not something that can be stripped off a person's mental life without bringing about any behavioral or physiological differences. Dennett believes that consciousness is a complex series of functions and ideas. If we all can have these experiences the idea of the p-zombie is meaningless.\n\nDennett argues that \"when philosophers claim that zombies are conceivable, they invariably underestimate the task of conception (or imagination), and end up imagining something that violates their own definition\".<ref name=Dennett1991>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|title=Consciousness Explained|year=1991|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|location=Boston, Toronto, London|isbn=0-316-18065-3|url=https://archive.org/details/consciousnessexp00denn}}</ref><ref name=\"Dennett1995\"/> He coined the term \"zimboes\" \u2013 p-zombies that have [[Second-order logic|second-order beliefs]] \u2013 to argue that the idea of a p-zombie is incoherent;<ref>Dennett 1995; 1999</ref> \"Zimboes think<sup>Z</sup> they are conscious, think<sup>Z</sup> they have qualia, think<sup>Z</sup> they suffer pains \u2013 they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition), in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!\".<ref name=\"Dennett1995\"/> Under (reductive) [[physicalism]], one is inclined to believe either that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie \u2013 following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being, or not being a zombie is (just) a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. P-zombies in an observed world would be indistinguishable from the observer, even hypothetically (when the observer makes no assumptions regarding the validity of their convictions). Furthermore, when concept of self is deemed to correspond to physical reality alone (reductive physicalism), philosophical zombies are denied by definition. When a distinction is made in one's mind between a hypothetical zombie and oneself (assumed not to be a zombie), the hypothetical zombie, being a subset of the concept of oneself, must entail a deficit in observables (cognitive systems), a \"seductive error\"<ref name=Dennett1995>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea|url=https://archive.org/details/darwinsdangerous0000denn|url-access=registration|year=1995|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-684-82471-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/darwinsdangerous0000denn/page/322 322]}}</ref> contradicting the original definition of a zombie.\n\n[[Verificationism]]<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/> states that, for words to have meaning, their use must be open to public verification. Since it is assumed that we can talk about our qualia, the existence of zombies is impossible. A related argument is that of \"zombie-utterance\". If someone were to say they love the smell of some food, a zombie producing the same reaction would be perceived as a person having complex thoughts and ideas in their head indicated by the ability to vocalize it. If zombies were without awareness of their perceptions the idea of uttering words could not occur to them. Therefore, if a zombie has the ability to speak, it is not a zombie.\n\n[[Artificial intelligence]] researcher [[Marvin Minsky]] saw the argument as [[circular reasoning|circular]]. The proposition of the possibility of something physically identical to a human but without subjective experience assumes that the physical characteristics of humans are not what produces those experiences, which is exactly what the argument was claiming to prove.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/minsky/minsky_p2.html |title=Edge: CONSCIOUSNESS IS A BIG SUITCASE - A Talk with Marvin Minsky [page 2] |website=edge.com}}</ref> Richard Brown agrees that the zombie argument is circular. To show this, he proposes \"{{not a typo|zoombies}}\", which are creatures ''non''physically identical to people in every way and lacking phenomenal consciousness. If {{not a typo|zoombies}} existed, they would refute dualism because they would show that consciousness is not nonphysical, i.e., is physical. Paralleling the argument from Chalmers: It's conceivable that {{not a typo|zoombies}} exist, so it's possible they exist, so dualism is false. Given the symmetry between the zombie and {{not a typo|zoombie}} arguments, we can't arbitrate the physicalism/dualism question ''a priori''.<ref name=Brown2010>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Richard|title=Deprioritizing the A Priori Arguments Against Physicalism|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|date=2010|volume=17|issue=3\u20134|pages=47\u201369|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/BRODTA.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Yablo]]'s (1998) response is to provide an [[error theory]] to account for the intuition that zombies are possible.  Notions of what counts as physical and as physically possible change over time so [[conceptual analysis]] is not reliable here. Yablo says he is \"braced for the information that is going to make zombies inconceivable, even though I have no real idea what form the information is going to take.\"<ref>Yablo, 2000, \u00a7XV.</ref>\n\nThe zombie argument is difficult to assess because it brings to light fundamental disagreements about the method and scope of philosophy itself and the nature and abilities of conceptual analysis. Proponents of the zombie argument may think that conceptual analysis is a central part of (if not the only part of) philosophy and that it certainly can do a great deal of philosophical work. However others, such as Dennett, [[Paul Churchland]] and [[W.V.O. Quine]], have fundamentally different views. For this reason, discussion of the zombie argument remains vigorous in philosophy.\n\nSome accept [[Modal logic|modal]] reasoning in general but deny it in the zombie case. Christopher S. Hill and Brian P. Mclaughlin suggest that the zombie thought experiment combines imagination of a \"sympathetic\" nature (putting oneself in a phenomenal state) and a \"perceptual\" nature (imagining becoming aware of something in the outside world). Each type of imagination may work on its own, but they're not guaranteed to work when both used at the same time. Hence Chalmers's argument needn't go through.<ref name=HillMclaughlin1999>{{cite journal|author1=Christopher S. Hill|author2=Brian P. Mclaughlin|title=There are Fewer Things in Reality Than are Dreamt of in Chalmers's Philosophy|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=Jun 1999|volume=59|issue=2|pages=445\u2013454|doi=10.2307/2653682|jstor=2653682}}</ref>{{rp|448}} Moreover, while Chalmers defuses criticisms of the view that conceivability can tell us about possibility, he provides no positive defense of the principle. As an analogy, the [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] has no known counterexamples, but this doesn't mean we must accept it. And indeed, the fact that Chalmers concludes we have epiphenomenal mental states that don't cause our physical behavior seems one reason to reject his principle.<ref name=HillMclaughlin1999 />{{rp|449\u201351}}\n\nAnother way to construe the zombie hypothesis is [[Epistemology|epistemically]] \u2013 as a problem of causal explanation, rather than as a problem of logical or metaphysical possibility. The \"[[explanatory gap]]\" \u2013 also called the \"[[hard problem of consciousness]]\" \u2013 is the claim that  (to date) no one has provided a convincing causal explanation of how and why we are [[Consciousness|conscious]]. It is a manifestation of the very same gap that (to date) no one has provided a convincing causal explanation of how and why we are not zombies.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harnad | first1 = Stevan | authorlink = Stevan Harnad | year = 1995 | title = Why and How We Are Not Zombies | url = http://cogprints.org/1601/6/harnad95.zombies.html | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 164\u2013167 }}</ref>\n\n==Related thought-experiments==\n[[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]]'s [[Mary's room]] argument is based around a hypothetical scientist, Mary, who is forced to view the world through a black-and-white television screen in a black and white room. Mary is a brilliant scientist who knows everything about the neurobiology of vision. Even though Mary knows everything about color and its perception (e.g. what combination of wavelengths makes the sky seem blue), she has never seen color. If Mary were released from this room and were to experience color for the first time, would she learn anything new? Jackson initially believed this supported [[epiphenomenalism]] (mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena) but later changed his views to [[physicalism]], suggesting that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world.\n\n[[Swampman]] is an imaginary character introduced by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]. If Davidson goes hiking in a swamp and is struck and killed by a lightning bolt while nearby another lightning bolt spontaneously rearranges a bunch of molecules so that, entirely by coincidence, they take on exactly the same form that Davidson's body had at the moment of his untimely death then this being, 'Swampman', has a brain structurally identical to that which Davidson had and will thus presumably behave exactly like Davidson. He will return to Davidson's office and write the same essays he would have written, recognize all of his friends and family and so forth.\n\n[[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] argument deals with the nature of [[artificial intelligence]]: it imagines a room in which a conversation is held by means of written Chinese characters that the subject cannot actually read, but is able to manipulate meaningfully using a set of [[algorithm]]s. Searle holds that a program cannot give a computer a \"mind\" or \"understanding\", regardless of how intelligently it may make it behave. [[Stevan Harnad]] argues that Searle's critique is really meant to target [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[computationalism]], and to establish [[neuroscience]] as the only correct way to understand the mind.<ref>[http://cogprints.org/4023/ Harnad, Stevan (2001)], \"What's Wrong and Right About Searle's Chinese Room Argument\", in M.; Preston, J., Essays on Searle's Chinese Room Argument, Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nPhysicist Adam Brown has suggested constructing a type of philosophical zombie using [[Counterfactual quantum computation]], a technique in which a computer is placed into a superposition of running and not running.

P-zombies were introduced primarily to argue against specific types of physicalism such as [[behaviorism]], according to which mental states exist solely as behavior. Belief, desire, thought, consciousness, and so on, are only behavior (whether external behavior or internal behavior) or tendencies towards behaviors. A p-zombie that is behaviorally indistinguishable from a normal human being but lacks conscious experiences is therefore not logically possible according to the behaviorist {{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}, so an appeal to the logical possibility of a p-zombie furnishes an argument that behaviorism is false. Proponents of zombie arguments generally accept that p-zombies are not [[Modal logic#Physical possibility|physically possible]], while opponents necessarily deny that they are metaphysically or, in some cases, even logically possible.\n\nThe unifying idea of the zombie is of a human that has no conscious experience, but one might distinguish various types of zombie used in different thought experiments as follows:\n\n* A '''behavioral zombie''' that is behaviorally indistinguishable from a human.\n* A '''neurological zombie''' that has a human brain and is generally physiologically indistinguishable from a human.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harnad, Stevan |year=2000 |url=http://cogprints.org/2615/ |title=Minds, Machines, and Turing: The Indistinguishability of Indistinguishables |publisher=Journal of Logic, Language, and Information |volume= 9 |issue= 4 |pages= 425\u2013445 |author-link=Stevan Harnad }}</ref>\n* A '''soulless zombie''' that lacks a [[soul]].\n*A '''zombie universe''' that is identical to our world in all physical ways, except no being in that world has [[qualia]].\n\n==Zombie arguments==\nZombie arguments often support lines of reasoning that aim to show that zombies are metaphysically possible in order to support some form of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] \u2013 in this case the view that the world includes two kinds of [[Substance theory|substance]] (or perhaps two kinds of [[Property (philosophy)|property]]); the mental and the physical.<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Howard |title=Dualism |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/dualism/ }}</ref> According to physicalism, physical facts determine all other facts. Since any fact other than that of consciousness may be held to be the same for a p-zombie and a normal conscious human, it follows that physicalism must hold that p-zombies are either not possible or are the same as normal humans.\n\nThe zombie argument is a version of general [[modal logic|modal arguments]] against physicalism such as that of [[Saul Kripke]]<ref>Kripke, Saul. ''Naming and Necessity'' (1972)</ref> and the kind of physicalism known as [[type-identity theory]]. Further such arguments were notably advanced in the 1970s by [[Thomas Nagel]] (1970; 1974) and [[Robert Kirk (philosopher)|Robert Kirk]] (1974) but the general argument was most famously developed in detail by [[David Chalmers]] in ''[[The Conscious Mind]]'' (1996). According to Chalmers one can coherently conceive of an entire zombie world, a world physically indistinguishable from this world but entirely lacking conscious experience. The counterpart of every conscious being in our world would be a p-zombie. Since such a world is conceivable, Chalmers claims, it is metaphysically possible, which is all the argument requires. Chalmers states: \"Zombies are probably not naturally possible: they probably cannot exist in our world, with its laws of nature.\"<ref name=\"Chalmers2\">Chalmers, 2003, p. 5.</ref> The outline structure of Chalmers' version of the zombie argument is as follows;\n\n#According to physicalism, all that exists in our world (including consciousness) is physical. \n#Thus, if physicalism is true, a metaphysically possible world in which all physical facts are the same as those of the actual world must contain everything that exists in our actual world. In particular, conscious experience must exist in such a possible world.\n#In fact we can conceive of a world physically indistinguishable from our world but in which there is no consciousness (a zombie world). From this (so Chalmers argues) it follows that such a world is metaphysically possible. \n#Therefore, physicalism is false. (The conclusion [[Logical consequence|follows from]] 2. and 3. by ''[[modus tollens]]''.)\n\nThe above is a strong formulation of the zombie argument. There are other formulations of the zombies-type argument which follow the same general form. The premises of the general zombies argument are implied by the premises of all the specific zombie arguments. A general zombies argument is in part motivated by potential disagreements between various anti-physicalist views. For example, an anti-physicalist view can consistently assert that p-zombies are metaphysically impossible but that inverted qualia (such as inverted spectra) or absent qualia (partial zombiehood) are metaphysically possible. Premises regarding inverted qualia or partial zombiehood can substitute premises regarding p-zombies to produce variations of the zombie argument. The metaphysical possibility of a physically indistinguishable world with either inverted qualia or partial zombiehood would imply that physical truths don't metaphysically necessitate phenomenal truths. To formulate the general form of the zombies argument, take the sentence 'P' to be true if and only if the conjunct of all microphysical truths of our world obtain, take the sentence 'Q' to be true if some phenomenal truth, that obtains in the actual world, obtains. The general argument goes as follows.\n\n#It is conceivable that P is true and Q is not true.\n#If it is conceivable that P is true and Q is not true then it is metaphysically possible that P is true and Q not true.\n#If it is metaphysically possible that P is true and Q is not true then physicalism is false.\n#Therefore, physicalism is false.<ref name=\"Chalmers5\">Chalmers, 2010, p. 106-109</ref>\n\nQ can be false in a possible world if any of the following obtains: (1) there exists at least one invert relative to the actual world (2) there is at least one absent quale relative to the actual world (3) all actually conscious beings are p-zombies (all actual qualia are absent qualia).\n\n==Responses==\nIf one accepts two-dimensional semantics, Chalmers' argument is logically [[Validity (logic)|valid]]. Some philosophers accept its validity but dispute its soundness, arguing that its premises are false. Zombies might not actually be conceivable or, if they are, just because they are conceivable, that might not mean that they are possible. Chalmers has argued that zombies are conceivable, saying \"it certainly seems that a coherent situation is described; I can discern no contradiction in the description.\"<ref>Chalmers, 1996, p. 96.</ref> \nThis leads to the questions of the relevant notion of \"possibility\": if something is conceivable, does that mean it is possible? Most physicalist responses deny that the premise of a zombie scenario is possible.\n\nMany physicalist philosophers have argued that this scenario [[Self-refuting idea|eliminates itself by its description]]; the basis of a physicalist argument is that the world is defined entirely by physicality; thus, a world that was physically identical would necessarily contain consciousness, as consciousness would necessarily be generated from any set of physical circumstances identical to our own.\n\nOne can hold that zombies are a [[logical possibility]] but not a [[metaphysical possibility]]. If logical possibility does not entail metaphysical possibility across the domain of relevant truths, then the mere logical possibility of zombies is not sufficient to establish their metaphysical possibility. The zombie argument claims that one can tell by the power of reason that such a \"zombie scenario\" is metaphysically possible. Chalmers states; \"From the conceivability of zombies, proponents of the argument infer their metaphysical possibility\"<ref name=\"Chalmers2\"/> and argues that this inference, while not generally legitimate, is legitimate for phenomenal concepts such as consciousness since we must adhere to \"Kripke's insight that for phenomenal concepts, there is no gap between reference-fixers and reference (or between primary and secondary intentions).\" That is, for phenomenal concepts, conceivability implies possibility. According to Chalmers, whatever is logically possible is also, in the sense relevant here, metaphysically possible.<ref>Chalmers, 1996, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\nAnother response is the denial of the idea that qualia and related phenomenal notions of the mind are in the first place coherent concepts. [[Daniel Dennett]] and others argue that while [[Subjective character of experience|consciousness and subjective experience]] exist in some sense, they are not as the zombie argument proponent claims. The experience of pain, for example, is not something that can be stripped off a person's mental life without bringing about any behavioral or physiological differences. Dennett believes that consciousness is a complex series of functions and ideas. If we all can have these experiences the idea of the p-zombie is meaningless.\n\nDennett argues that \"when philosophers claim that zombies are conceivable, they invariably underestimate the task of conception (or imagination), and end up imagining something that violates their own definition\".<ref name=Dennett1991>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|title=Consciousness Explained|year=1991|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|location=Boston, Toronto, London|isbn=0-316-18065-3|url=https://archive.org/details/consciousnessexp00denn}}</ref><ref name=\"Dennett1995\"/> He coined the term \"zimboes\" \u2013 p-zombies that have [[Second-order logic|second-order beliefs]] \u2013 to argue that the idea of a p-zombie is incoherent;<ref>Dennett 1995; 1999</ref> \"Zimboes think<sup>Z</sup> they are conscious, think<sup>Z</sup> they have qualia, think<sup>Z</sup> they suffer pains \u2013 they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition), in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!\".<ref name=\"Dennett1995\"/> Under (reductive) [[physicalism]], one is inclined to believe either that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie \u2013 following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being, or not being a zombie is (just) a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. P-zombies in an observed world would be indistinguishable from the observer, even hypothetically (when the observer makes no assumptions regarding the validity of their convictions). Furthermore, when concept of self is deemed to correspond to physical reality alone (reductive physicalism), philosophical zombies are denied by definition. When a distinction is made in one's mind between a hypothetical zombie and oneself (assumed not to be a zombie), the hypothetical zombie, being a subset of the concept of oneself, must entail a deficit in observables (cognitive systems), a \"seductive error\"<ref name=Dennett1995>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea|url=https://archive.org/details/darwinsdangerous0000denn|url-access=registration|year=1995|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-684-82471-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/darwinsdangerous0000denn/page/322 322]}}</ref> contradicting the original definition of a zombie.\n\n[[Verificationism]]<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/> states that, for words to have meaning, their use must be open to public verification. Since it is assumed that we can talk about our qualia, the existence of zombies is impossible. A related argument is that of \"zombie-utterance\". If someone were to say they love the smell of some food, a zombie producing the same reaction would be perceived as a person having complex thoughts and ideas in their head indicated by the ability to vocalize it. If zombies were without awareness of their perceptions the idea of uttering words could not occur to them. Therefore, if a zombie has the ability to speak, it is not a zombie.\n\n[[Artificial intelligence]] researcher [[Marvin Minsky]] saw the argument as [[circular reasoning|circular]]. The proposition of the possibility of something physically identical to a human but without subjective experience assumes that the physical characteristics of humans are not what produces those experiences, which is exactly what the argument was claiming to prove.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/minsky/minsky_p2.html |title=Edge: CONSCIOUSNESS IS A BIG SUITCASE - A Talk with Marvin Minsky [page 2] |website=edge.com}}</ref> Richard Brown agrees that the zombie argument is circular. To show this, he proposes \"{{not a typo|zoombies}}\", which are creatures ''non''physically identical to people in every way and lacking phenomenal consciousness. If {{not a typo|zoombies}} existed, they would refute dualism because they would show that consciousness is not nonphysical, i.e., is physical. Paralleling the argument from Chalmers: It's conceivable that {{not a typo|zoombies}} exist, so it's possible they exist, so dualism is false. Given the symmetry between the zombie and {{not a typo|zoombie}} arguments, we can't arbitrate the physicalism/dualism question ''a priori''.<ref name=Brown2010>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Richard|title=Deprioritizing the A Priori Arguments Against Physicalism|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|date=2010|volume=17|issue=3\u20134|pages=47\u201369|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/BRODTA.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Yablo]]'s (1998) response is to provide an [[error theory]] to account for the intuition that zombies are possible.  Notions of what counts as physical and as physically possible change over time so [[conceptual analysis]] is not reliable here. Yablo says he is \"braced for the information that is going to make zombies inconceivable, even though I have no real idea what form the information is going to take.\"<ref>Yablo, 2000, \u00a7XV.</ref>\n\nThe zombie argument is difficult to assess because it brings to light fundamental disagreements about the method and scope of philosophy itself and the nature and abilities of conceptual analysis. Proponents of the zombie argument may think that conceptual analysis is a central part of (if not the only part of) philosophy and that it certainly can do a great deal of philosophical work. However others, such as Dennett, [[Paul Churchland]] and [[W.V.O. Quine]], have fundamentally different views. For this reason, discussion of the zombie argument remains vigorous in philosophy.\n\nSome accept [[Modal logic|modal]] reasoning in general but deny it in the zombie case. Christopher S. Hill and Brian P. Mclaughlin suggest that the zombie thought experiment combines imagination of a \"sympathetic\" nature (putting oneself in a phenomenal state) and a \"perceptual\" nature (imagining becoming aware of something in the outside world). Each type of imagination may work on its own, but they're not guaranteed to work when both used at the same time. Hence Chalmers's argument needn't go through.<ref name=HillMclaughlin1999>{{cite journal|author1=Christopher S. Hill|author2=Brian P. Mclaughlin|title=There are Fewer Things in Reality Than are Dreamt of in Chalmers's Philosophy|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=Jun 1999|volume=59|issue=2|pages=445\u2013454|doi=10.2307/2653682|jstor=2653682}}</ref>{{rp|448}} Moreover, while Chalmers defuses criticisms of the view that conceivability can tell us about possibility, he provides no positive defense of the principle. As an analogy, the [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] has no known counterexamples, but this doesn't mean we must accept it. And indeed, the fact that Chalmers concludes we have epiphenomenal mental states that don't cause our physical behavior seems one reason to reject his principle.<ref name=HillMclaughlin1999 />{{rp|449\u201351}}\n\nAnother way to construe the zombie hypothesis is [[Epistemology|epistemically]] \u2013 as a problem of causal explanation, rather than as a problem of logical or metaphysical possibility. The \"[[explanatory gap]]\" \u2013 also called the \"[[hard problem of consciousness]]\" \u2013 is the claim that  (to date) no one has provided a convincing causal explanation of how and why we are [[Consciousness|conscious]]. It is a manifestation of the very same gap that (to date) no one has provided a convincing causal explanation of how and why we are not zombies.<ref>[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, Stevan]] (1995) \"[http://cogprints.org/1601/6/harnad95.zombies.html Why and How We Are Not Zombies]. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1:164\u2013167</ref>\n\n==Related thought-experiments==\n[[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]]'s [[Mary's room]] argument is based around a hypothetical scientist, Mary, who is forced to view the world through a black-and-white television screen in a black and white room. Mary is a brilliant scientist who knows everything about the neurobiology of vision. Even though Mary knows everything about color and its perception (e.g. what combination of wavelengths makes the sky seem blue), she has never seen color. If Mary were released from this room and were to experience color for the first time, would she learn anything new? Jackson initially believed this supported [[epiphenomenalism]] (mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena) but later changed his views to [[physicalism]], suggesting that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world.\n\n[[Swampman]] is an imaginary character introduced by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]. If Davidson goes hiking in a swamp and is struck and killed by a lightning bolt while nearby another lightning bolt spontaneously rearranges a bunch of molecules so that, entirely by coincidence, they take on exactly the same form that Davidson's body had at the moment of his untimely death then this being, 'Swampman', has a brain structurally identical to that which Davidson had and will thus presumably behave exactly like Davidson. He will return to Davidson's office and write the same essays he would have written, recognize all of his friends and family and so forth.\n\n[[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] argument deals with the nature of [[artificial intelligence]]: it imagines a room in which a conversation is held by means of written Chinese characters that the subject cannot actually read, but is able to manipulate meaningfully using a set of [[algorithm]]s. Searle holds that a program cannot give a computer a \"mind\" or \"understanding\", regardless of how intelligently it may make it behave. [[Stevan Harnad]] argues that Searle's critique is really meant to target [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[computationalism]], and to establish [[neuroscience]] as the only correct way to understand the mind.<ref>[http://cogprints.org/4023/ Harnad, Stevan (2001)], \"What's Wrong and Right About Searle's Chinese Room Argument\", in M.; Preston, J., Essays on Searle's Chinese Room Argument, Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nPhysicist Adam Brown has suggested constructing a type of philosophical zombie using [[Counterfactual quantum computation]], a technique in which a computer is placed into a superposition of running and not running.

In popular usage, the term carries an overwhelmingly negative context although this does not reflect scholarly understanding. Potential sources for deep state organization include [[organs of state]], such as the [[armed forces]] or [[Public-benefit corporation|public authorities]] ([[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], [[police]], [[secret police]], [[administrative agencies]], and government [[bureaucracy]]). A deep state can also take the form of entrenched career [[Civil servant|civil servants]] acting in a non-conspiratorial [[United States administrative law|discretionary]]<!--There is no general article for agency discretion across countries, only a description of the US Administrative Law process.

It can operate in opposition to the agenda of elected officials, by obstructing, resisting, and subverting their policies, conditions and directives. \n\nAccording to Dr. Jyoti M. Pathania, broadly speaking, deep state refers to organisations such as military, police, bureaucracy, intelligence agencies or any such political or apolitical group that works secretly in order to protect a particular interest and to rule without being elected. \n\n== Etymology and historical usage ==\nThe modern concept of a deep state is associated with [[Turkey]], and the secret network established in 1923 by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]].<ref name=\"Filkins Turkey2\">{{cite news|last=Filkins|first=Dexter|url=http://abrahamson.medill.northwestern.edu/WWW/IALJS/Filkins_TheDeepState_NYer_12March2012.pdf|title=The Deep State|date=12 March 2012|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=31 December 2018}}</ref> Similar ideas are older.

An example of a non-conspiratorial version of the 'state as actor' from the empirical scholarly literature would be \"doing truth to power\" (as a play on speaking truth to power, which is what journalists often aspire to do) as studied by Todd La Porte.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9600406570652932200&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5|title=- Google Scholar|website=scholar.google.com}}</ref> Under this dual understanding, the conspiratorial version of the deep state concept would be one version of the 'state as actor' while the non-conspiratorial version would be another version of the 'state as actor.'\n\nThe fundamental takeaway from the scholarly literature on the dual nature of the state is that the 'state as actor' (deep state) is a functional characteristic of all states which has effects that may be [[Normative (disambiguation)|normatively]] judged as \"good\" or \"bad\" in different times, places, and contexts.

In other words, state personnel have interests of their own, which they can and do pursue independently of (at times in conflict with) actors in society. Since the state controls the means of coercion, and given the dependence of many groups in civil society on the state for achieving any goals they may espouse, state personnel can to some extent impose their own preferences on civil society.\n\n[this is what is popularly known as a deep state, but that is generally a pejorative term where there can be positive, technocratic/neutral, and negative effects].\n\n[\"all government is oligarchy, what matters is how we pick the oligarchs\", - Maurice Duverger, Duverger's law as important contribution but perhaps less significant insight than this quote from same book]--><!--More subsections to add:\nEffects on Policy Process\n\n[\"doing truth to power\" - La Porte]\n\n[institutional memory - continuity of ]\n\n[Expertise, bureaucratic autonomy/delegation, ]\n\nEffects on Accountability\n\n[Bureaucratic fairness]\n\n[democratic accountability/legitimacy]\n\n[A Theory of Justice/ John Rawls, New Public Management, random assignment of benefits, most deserving assignments, etc]-->\n\n== Popular understanding ==<!--CONTROVERSIAL BUT CRITICAL: before one enter's into an edit war in this section, please see the talk page to discuss the importance of distinguishing between the popular culture use of the term \"deep state\" and the scholarly understanding of state autonomy or \"state-as-actor.\"-->\n\nIn the [[United States]] after the [[2016 United States presidential election]], the term \"deep state\" has become much more widely used as pejorative term with an overwhelmingly negative definition by both the new [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Donald Trump administration]] as well as the wider news media.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Michaels|first=Jon D.|date=March 2018|title=The American Deep State|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/tndl93&i=1699|journal=Notre Dame Law Review|volume=93|issue=4|pages=1653\u20131670|via=HeinOnline}}</ref> In the [[United States]] [[news media]] and [[social media]] usage during the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Donald Trump administration]], the term deep state has come to be an all-purpose [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for elements of the [[United States federal civil service]] which the administration opposes.{{Sfn|Michaels|2018|p=1653-1654}}<!--An overwhelming number of news media articles can be cited here as examples should that be desireable.

Within this literature, the state is understood as both ''venue'' (a set of rules under which others act and interact) as well as ''actor'' (with its own agenda).{{Sfn|Skocpol|1985|p=}} Under this dual understanding, the conspiratorial version of the deep state concept would be one version of the 'state as actor' while the non-conspiratorial version would be another version of the 'state as actor.' The fundamental takeaway from the scholarly literature on the dual nature of the state is that the 'state as actor' (deep state) is a functional characteristic of all states which has effects that may be [[Normative (disambiguation)|normatively]] judged as \"good\" or \"bad\" in different times, places, and contexts. From a [[Positivism|positivist]] [[Social science|scientific]] perspective, the state-as-venue, colloquially known as the \"deep state,\" simply \"is\" and should not be assumed to be \"bad\" by default.\n\n==Cases==\n\n===Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia===\nThe [[Soviet secret police]] have been frequently described by historians as a \"state within a state\".

For instance, [[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of utilitarianism, described utility as \"that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness...[or] to prevent the happening of mischief, pain, evil, or unhappiness to the party whose interest is considered.\" Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong. Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] and [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]], utilitarianism considers the interests of all humans [[Equal consideration of interests|equally]].\n\nProponents of utilitarianism have disagreed on a number of points, such as whether actions should be chosen based on their likely results ([[act utilitarianism]]) or whether [[Agency (philosophy)|agents]] should conform to rules that maximize utility ([[rule utilitarianism]]). There is also disagreement as to whether total ([[Average and total utilitarianism|total utilitarianism]]), average ([[Average and total utilitarianism#Average utilitarianism|average utilitarianism]]) or minimum<ref>{{Citation|last=White|first=Stuart|title=Social Minimum|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/social-minimum/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> utility should be maximized.\n\nThough the seeds of the theory can be found in the [[hedonism|hedonists]] [[Aristippus]] and [[Epicurus]], who viewed happiness as the only good, the tradition of utilitarianism properly began with Bentham, and has included [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[R. M. Hare]], [[David Braybrooke]] and [[Peter Singer]]. It has been applied to social welfare economics, the crisis of global poverty, the [[ethics of eating meat|ethics of raising animals for food]] and the importance of avoiding [[Global catastrophic risk|existential risks]] to humanity.\n\n==Etymology==\nBenthamism, the utilitarian philosophy founded by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was substantially modified by his successor [[John Stuart Mill]], who popularized the word 'Utilitarianism'.<ref name=\"Habibi 2001 89, 112\">{{cite book | last=Habibi | first=Don | title=John Stuart Mill and the Ethic of Human Growth | publisher=Springer Netherlands | location=Dordrecht | year=2001 | isbn=978-90-481-5668-9 |chapter=Chapter 3, Mill's Moral Philosophy | pages=89\u201390, 112| doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2010-6_3 }}</ref> In 1861, Mill acknowledged in a footnote that, though \"believing himself to be the first person who brought the word 'utilitarian' into use, he did not invent it.

Forms of [[hedonism]] were put forward by [[Aristippus]] and [[Epicurus]]; [[Aristotle]] argued that [[eudaimonia]] is the highest human good and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote that \"all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness.\" Happiness was also explored in depth by [[Aquinas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2001.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Man's last end (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 1)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2002.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Things in which man's happiness consists (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 2)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: What is happiness (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 3)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2004.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Things that are required for happiness (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 4)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2005.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The attainment of happiness (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 5)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref> Different varieties of consequentialism also existed in the ancient and medieval world, like the [[state consequentialism]] of [[Mohism]] or the political philosophy of [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]].

In ''An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue'' (1725), Hutcheson says<ref>{{cite book |last= Hutcheson |first= Francis |editor-first= J.

In the same way, moral [[evil]], or [[vice]], is proportionate to the number of people made to suffer. The best action is the one that procures the greatest happiness of the greatest numbers\u2014and the worst is the one that causes the most misery.\n\nIn the first three editions of the book, Hutcheson included various mathematical algorithms \"...to compute the Morality of any Actions.\" In this, he pre-figured the [[Felicific calculus|hedonic calculus]] of Bentham.\n\nSome claim that [[John Gay (philosopher)|John Gay]] developed the first systematic theory of utilitarian ethics.<ref>Ashcraft, Richard (1991) John Locke: Critical Assessments (Critical assessments of leading political philosophers), Routledge, p. 691</ref> In ''Concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality'' (1731), Gay argues that:<ref>{{cite book |last= Gay |first= John |editor-first= J.

To ask why I pursue happiness, will admit of no other answer than an explanation of the terms.}}\n\nThis pursuit of happiness is given a theological basis:<ref>{{cite book |last= Gay |first= John |editor-first= J.

There are occasions, in which the hand of the assassin would be very useful... The true answer is this; that these actions, after all, are not useful, and for that reason, and that alone, are not right.\n\nTo see this point perfectly, it must be observed that the bad consequences of actions are twofold, particular and general. The particular bad consequence of an action, is the mischief which that single action directly and immediately occasions. The general bad consequence is, the violation of some necessary or useful general rule...\n\nYou cannot permit one action and forbid another, without showing a difference between them. Consequently, the same sort of actions must be generally permitted or generally forbidden.

By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness. I say of every action whatsoever, and therefore not only of every action of a private individual, but of every measure of government.}}\n\nIn Chapter IV, Bentham introduces a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains, which has come to be known as the hedonic calculus. Bentham says that the value of a pleasure or pain, considered by itself, can be measured according to its intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty and propinquity/remoteness. In addition, it is necessary to consider \"the tendency of any act by which it is produced\" and, therefore, to take account of the act's fecundity, or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind and its purity, or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind. Finally, it is necessary to consider the extent, or the number of people affected by the action.\n\nPerhaps aware that Hutcheson eventually removed his algorithms for calculating the greatest happiness because they \"appear'd useless, and were disagreeable to some readers\",<ref name=\"HutchesonIntroduction\">An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue, Francis Hutcheson, Introduction, 1726</ref> Bentham contends that there is nothing novel or unwarranted about his method, for \"in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind, wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest, is perfectly conformable to.\"\n\nRosen warns that descriptions of utilitarianism can bear \"little resemblance historically to utilitarians like Bentham and [[J. S. Mill]]\" and can be more \"a crude version of act utilitarianism conceived in the twentieth century as a [[straw man]] to be attacked and rejected.\"<ref>Rosen, Frederick (2003) Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill. Routledge, p. 32</ref> It is a mistake to think that Bentham is not concerned with rules. His seminal work is concerned with the principles of legislation and the hedonic calculus is introduced with the words \"Pleasures then, and the avoidance of pains, are the ends that the legislator has in view.\" In Chapter VII, Bentham says: \"The business of government is to promote the happiness of the society, by punishing and rewarding... In proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness, in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious, will be the demand it creates for punishment.\"\n\nThe question then arises as to when, if at all, it might be legitimate to break the law. This is considered in ''The Theory of Legislation'', where Bentham distinguishes between evils of the first and second orders. Those of the first order are the more immediate consequences; those of the second are when the consequences spread through the community causing \"alarm\" and \"danger\".\n\n<blockquote>It is true there are cases in which, if we confine ourselves to the effects of the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? ... It is not on account of the evil of the first order that it is necessary to erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bentham |first1=Jeremy |last2=Dumont |first2=Etienne |last3=Hildreth | first3=R |title=Theory of Legislation: Translated from the French of Etienne Dumont |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |date=November 2005 |pages=58 |isbn=978-1402170348}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===John Stuart Mill===\n{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}\nMill was brought up as a Benthamite with the explicit intention that he would carry on the cause of utilitarianism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halevy|first=Elie|title=The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism|year=1966|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-19-101020-0|pages=282\u201384}}</ref> Mill's book ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' first appeared as a series of three articles published in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in 1861 and was reprinted as a single book in 1863.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory|last=Hinman|first=Lawrence|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2012|isbn=978-1133050018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=John Stuart|orig-year=1863|last=Mill|date=2010|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=TnYZ4tO5640C&pg=PA33 |title=Utilitarianism - Ed.

It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality is considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone.}}\n\nThe word utility is used to mean general well-being or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is the consequence of a good action. Utility, within the context of utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.\n\nMill not only viewed actions as a core part of utility, but as the directive rule of moral human conduct. The rule being that we should only be committing actions that provide pleasure to society. This view of pleasure was hedonistic, as it pursued the thought that pleasure is the highest good in life. This concept was adopted by Bentham and can be seen in his works. According to Mill, good actions result in pleasure, and that there is no higher end than pleasure. Mill says that good actions lead to pleasure and define good [[Moral character|character]]. Better put, the justification of character, and whether an action is good or not, is based on how the person contributes to the concept of social utility. In the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions; and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good, of which the predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct. In the last chapter of Utilitarianism, Mill concludes that justice, as a classifying factor of our actions (being just or unjust) is one of the certain moral requirements, and when the requirements are all regarded collectively, they are viewed as greater according to this scale of \"social utility\" as Mill puts it.\n\nHe also notes that, contrary to what its critics might say, there is \"no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect... a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation.\" However, he accepts that this is usually because the intellectual pleasures are thought to have circumstantial advantages, i.e. \"greater permanency, safety, uncostliness, &c.\" Instead, Mill will argue that some pleasures are intrinsically better than others.\n\nThe accusation that hedonism is a \"doctrine worthy only of swine\" has a long history. In ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book 1 Chapter 5), [[Aristotle]] says that identifying the good with pleasure is to prefer a life suitable for beasts. The theological utilitarians had the option of grounding their pursuit of happiness in the will of God; the hedonistic utilitarians needed a different defence. Mill's approach is to argue that the pleasures of the intellect are intrinsically superior to physical pleasures.\n\n<blockquote>Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs... A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence... It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be [[Socrates]] dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question...<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=Roger |editor-last=Crisp |title=Utilitarianism |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |pages=56\u201357 |isbn=978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMill argues that if people who are \"competently acquainted\" with two pleasures show a decided preference for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and \"would not resign it for any quantity of the other\", then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these \"competent judges\" will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, the judgment of the majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that \"many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher.\" Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for there is no other way of measuring \"the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations.\" \"It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constitute, is imperfect.\"<ref>John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism, Chapter 2</ref>\n\nMill also thinks that \"intellectual pursuits have value out of proportion to the amount of contentment or pleasure (the mental state) that they produce\".<ref>Brink, David. \"Mill Moral and Political Philosophy\". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political [accessed 27 April 2018].</ref> Mill also says that people should pursue these grand ideals, because if they choose to have gratification from petty pleasures, \"some displeasure will eventually creep in. We will become bored and depressed.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0953820811000264|title = No Philosophy for Swine: John Stuart Mill on the Quality of Pleasures| journal=Utilitas| volume=23| issue=4| pages=428\u2013446|year = 2011|last1 = Hauskeller|first1 = Michael| hdl=10871/9381}}</ref> Mill claims that gratification from petty pleasures only gives short-term happiness and, subsequently, worsens the individual who may feel that his life lacks happiness, since the happiness is transient. Whereas, intellectual pursuits give long-term happiness because they provide the individual with constant opportunities throughout the years to improve his life, by benefiting from accruing knowledge. Mill views intellectual pursuits as \"capable of incorporating the 'finer things' in life\" while petty pursuits do not achieve this goal.<ref>Saunders, Ben. \"J. S. Mill's Conception of Utility.\" Utilitas 22, no. 1 (March 2010): 52-69. https://search.proquest.com/docview/200183451 [accessed 27 April 2018]</ref> Mill is saying that intellectual pursuits give the individual the opportunity to escape the constant depression cycle since these pursuits allow them to achieve their ideals, while petty pleasures do not offer this. Although debate persists about the nature of Mill's view of gratification, this suggests bifurcation in his position.\n\n==== Mill's 'proof' of the principle of utility ====\nIn Chapter Four of ''Utilitarianism'', Mill considers what proof can be given for the principle of utility. He says:<ref>{{cite book |last = Mill | first = John Stuart |editor-first= Roger |editor-last= Crisp |title = Utilitarianism |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |page = 81 |isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref>\n{{quote|The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it.

No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness... we have not only all the proof which the case admits of, but all which it is possible to require, that happiness is a good: that each person's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness, therefore, a good to the aggregate of all persons.}}\n\nIt is usual<ref name=\"Popkin, Richard H. 1950, p. 66\">{{cite journal |last=Popkin |first=Richard H. |year=1950 |title=A Note on the 'Proof' of Utility in J. S. Mill |journal=Ethics |volume=61 |pages=66\u201368 |doi=10.1086/290751}}</ref> to say that Mill is committing a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the [[naturalistic fallacy]], because he is trying to deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of [[equivocation]], because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and the [[fallacy of composition]], because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.\n\nSuch allegations began to emerge in Mill's lifetime, shortly after the publication of ''Utilitarianism'', and persisted for well over a century, though the tide has been turning in recent discussions.\n\nA defence of Mill against all three charges, with a chapter devoted to each, can be found in Necip Fikri Alican's ''Mill's Principle of Utility: A Defense of John Stuart Mill's Notorious Proof'' (1994). This is the first, and remains{{when|date=January 2019}} the only, book-length treatment of the subject matter. Yet the alleged fallacies in the proof continue to attract scholarly attention in journal articles and book chapters.\n\nHall<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Everett W. |year=1949 |title=The 'Proof' of Utility in Bentham and Mill |journal=Ethics |volume=60 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1086/290691}}</ref> and Popkin<ref>{{cite journal |last=Popkin |first=Richard H. |year=1950 |title=A Note on the 'Proof' of Utility in J.

Mill anticipates the objection that people desire other things such as virtue. He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a ''means'' to happiness, eventually, it becomes part of someone's happiness and is then desired as an end in itself.\n\n{{quote|The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure, as music, for instance, or any given exemption from pain, as for example health, are to be looked upon as means to a collective something termed happiness, and to be desired on that account. They are desired and desirable in and for themselves; besides being means, they are a part of the end.

E. Moore]]. In ''Ethics'' (1912), Moore rejected a purely hedonistic utilitarianism and argued that there is a range of values that might be maximized. Moore's strategy was to show that it is intuitively implausible that pleasure is the sole measure of what is good. He says that such an assumption:<ref name=\"Moore, G. E. 1912\">Moore, G. E. (1912).  ''Ethics'', London: Williams and Norgate, Ch. 7</ref>\n{{quote|involves our saying, for instance, that a world in which absolutely nothing except pleasure existed\u2014no knowledge, no love, no enjoyment of beauty, no moral qualities\u2014must yet be intrinsically better\u2014better worth creating\u2014provided only the total quantity of pleasure in it were the least bit greater, than one in which all these things existed as well as pleasure.\n\nIt involves our saying that, even if the total quantity of pleasure in each was exactly equal, yet the fact that all the beings in the one possessed, in addition knowledge of many different kinds and a full appreciation of all that was beautiful or worthy of love in their world, whereas none of the beings in the other possessed any of these things, would give us no reason whatever for preferring the former to the latter.}}\n\nMoore admits that it is impossible to prove the case either way, but he believed that it was intuitively obvious that even if the amount of pleasure stayed the same a world that contained such things as beauty and love would be a better world. He adds that, if a person was to take the contrary view, then \"I think it is self-evident that he would be wrong.\"<ref name=\"Moore, G. E. 1912\"/>\n\n=== Act and rule utilitarianism ===\nIn the mid-twentieth century a number of philosophers focused on the place of rules in utilitarian thinking.<ref>Bayles, M. D., ed. (1968) Contemporary Utilitarianism, Anchor Books, Doubleday</ref> It was already accepted that it is necessary to use rules to help you choose the right action because the problems of calculating the consequences on each and every occasion would almost certainly result in you frequently choosing something less than the best course of action. Paley had justified the use of rules and Mill says:<ref>{{cite book |last = Mill | first = John Stuart |editor-first= Roger |editor-last= Crisp |title = Utilitarianism |publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1998 |page = 70 |isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|It is truly a whimsical supposition that, if mankind were agreed in considering utility to be the test of morality, they would remain without any agreement as to what is useful, and would take no measures for having their notions on the subject taught to the young, and enforced by law and opinion... to consider the rules of morality as improvable, is one thing; to pass over the intermediate generalisations entirely, and endeavour to test each individual action directly by the first principle, is another... The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal... Nobody argues that the art of navigation is not founded on astronomy, because sailors cannot wait to calculate the Nautical Almanack. Being rational creatures, they go to sea with it ready calculated; and all rational creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds made up on the common questions of right and wrong.}}\n\nHowever, rule utilitarianism proposes a more central role for rules that was thought to rescue the theory from some of its more devastating criticisms, particularly problems to do with justice and promise keeping. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, articles were published both for and against the new form of utilitarianism, and through this debate the theory we now call rule utilitarianism was created. In an introduction to an anthology of these articles, the editor was able to say: \"The development of this theory was a dialectical process of formulation, criticism, reply and reformulation; the record of this process well illustrates the co-operative development of a philosophical theory.\"<ref>Bayles, M.

[[Act utilitarianism]] maintains that an action is right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.\n\nIn 1956, Urmson published an influential article<ref>{{cite journal |last=Urmson |first=J.

From then on, articles have debated this interpretation of Mill. In all probability, it was not a distinction that Mill was particularly trying to make and so the evidence in his writing is inevitably mixed. A collection of Mill's writing published in 1977 includes a letter in which he says:<ref>Mill, John Stuart, The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill. Gen. Ed. John M. Robson. 33 vols.

However, it is not clear that this distinction is made in the academic literature.\n\nIt has been argued that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism, because for any given rule, in the case where breaking the rule produces more utility, the rule can be refined by the addition of a sub-rule that handles cases like the exception.<ref>David Lyons, ''Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism'', 1965</ref> This process holds for all cases of exceptions, and so the \"rules\" have as many \"sub-rules\" as there are exceptional cases, which, in the end, makes an agent seek out whatever outcome produces the maximum utility.<ref>Allen Habib (2008), ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/promises/ Promises]'', in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].</ref>\n\n=== Two-level utilitarianism ===\n{{Main|Two-level utilitarianism}}\nIn ''Principles'' (1973),<ref name=\"HareRM\">{{cite journal | last = Hare | first = R.

M. Hare]] accepts that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism but claims that this is a result of allowing the rules to be \"as specific and un-general as we please.\" He argues that one of the main reasons for introducing rule utilitarianism was to do justice to the general rules that people need for moral education and character development and he proposes that \"a difference between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism can be introduced by limiting the specificity of the rules, i.e., by increasing their generality.\"<ref name=\"HareRM\"/>{{rp|14}} This distinction between a \"specific rule utilitarianism\" (which collapses into act utilitarianism) and \"general rule utilitarianism\" forms the basis of Hare's two-level utilitarianism.\n\nWhen we are \"playing God or the ideal observer\", we use the specific form, and we will need to do this when we are deciding what general principles to teach and follow. When we are \"inculcating\" or in situations where the biases of our human nature are likely to prevent us doing the calculations properly, then we should use the more general rule utilitarianism.\n\nHare argues that in practice, most of the time, we should be following the general principles:<ref name=\"HareRM\"/>{{rp|17}}\n\n{{quote|One ought to abide by the general principles whose general inculcation is for the best; harm is more likely to come, in actual moral situations, from questioning these rules than from sticking to them, unless the situations are very extra-ordinary; the results of sophisticated felicific calculations are not likely, human nature and human ignorance being what they are, to lead to the greatest utility.}}\n\nIn ''Moral Thinking'' (1981), Hare illustrated the two extremes. The \"archangel\" is the hypothetical person who has perfect knowledge of the situation and no personal biases or weaknesses and always uses critical moral thinking to decide the right thing to do; the \"prole\" is the hypothetical person who is completely incapable of critical thinking and uses nothing but intuitive moral thinking and, of necessity, has to follow the general moral rules they have been taught or learned through imitation.<ref name=\"Hare 1981 b\">{{cite book | last = Hare | first = R.M. | author-link = R.

However, the critical moral thinking underpins and informs the more intuitive moral thinking. It is responsible for formulating and, if necessary, reformulating the general moral rules. We also switch to critical thinking when trying to deal with unusual situations or in cases where the intuitive moral rules give conflicting advice.\n\n=== Preference utilitarianism ===\n{{Main|Preference utilitarianism}}\nThe concept of preference utilitarianism was first proposed in 1977 by [[John Harsanyi]] in ''Morality and the theory of rational behaviour'',<ref name=\"Harsanyi\">{{citation |last=Harsanyi |first=John C. |author-link=John Harsanyi |contribution=Morality and the theory of rational behaviour |editor-last1=Sen |editor-first1 = Amartya |editor-last2=Williams |editor-first2=Bernard |editor-link1=Amartya Sen |editor-link2=Bernard Williams |title=Utilitarianism and beyond |pages=39\u201362 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1982 |isbn=9780511611964 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}:''Originally printed as'': {{cite journal |last=Harsanyi |first=John C. |author-link=John Harsanyi |title=Morality and the theory of rational behavior |journal=Social Research |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=623\u201356 |date=Winter 1977 |jstor=40971169 |ref=harv }}</ref> but preference utilitarianism is more commonly associated with [[R.

He also rejects ideal utilitarianism because \"it is certainly not true as an empirical observation that people's only purpose in life is to have 'mental states of intrinsic worth'.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|54}}\n\nAccording to Harsanyi, \"preference utilitarianism is the only form of utilitarianism consistent with the important philosophical principle of preference autonomy. By this I mean the principle that, in deciding what is good and what is bad for a given individual, the ultimate criterion can only be his own wants and his own preferences.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|55}}\n\nHarsanyi adds two caveats. People sometimes have irrational preferences. To deal with this, Harsanyi distinguishes between \"manifest\" preferences and \"true\" preferences. The former are those \"manifested by his observed behaviour, including preferences possibly based on erroneous factual beliefs,{{clarify|date=September 2016}} or on careless logical analysis, or on strong emotions that at the moment greatly hinder rational choice\" whereas the latter are \"the preferences he would have if he had all the relevant factual information, always reasoned with the greatest possible care, and were in a state of mind most conducive to rational choice.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|55}} It is the latter that preference utilitarianism tries to satisfy.\n\nThe second caveat is that antisocial preferences, such as sadism, envy and resentment, have to be excluded. Harsanyi achieves this by claiming that such preferences partially exclude those people from the moral community:\n{{quote|Utilitarian ethics makes all of us members of the same moral community. A person displaying ill will toward others does remain a member of this community, but not with his whole personality. That part of his personality that harbours these hostile antisocial feelings must be excluded from membership, and has no claim for a hearing when it comes to defining our concept of social utility.<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|56}}}}\n\n== More varieties of utilitarianism ==\n\n===Negative utilitarianism===\n{{Main|Negative utilitarianism}}\nIn ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1945), [[Karl Popper]] argued that the principle \"maximize pleasure\" should be replaced by \"minimize pain\". He thought \"it is not only impossible but very dangerous to attempt to maximize the pleasure or the happiness of the people, since such an attempt must lead to totalitarianism.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 2|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415278423|page=339}}</ref> He claimed that:<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 1: The Spell of Plato|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237314|pages=284\u201385}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure... In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal, namely, the appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula \"Maximize pleasure\" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale that lets us treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all...}}\n\nThe actual term ''negative utilitarianism'' was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R.

Consequently, Knutsson argues:\n\n{{quote|The world destruction argument is not a reason to reject negative utilitarianism in favour of these other forms of consequentialism, because there are similar arguments against such theories that are at least as persuasive as the world destruction argument is against negative utilitarianism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knutsson|first=Simon|date=2019-08-29|title=The world destruction argument|journal=Inquiry|volume=0|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1080/0020174X.2019.1658631|issn=0020-174X}}</ref></blockquote>}}\n\nFurthermore, Knutsson notes that one could argue that other forms of consequentialism, such as classical utilitarianism, in some cases have less plausible implications than negative utilitarianism, such as in scenarios where classical utilitarianism implies it would be right to kill everyone and replace them in a manner that creates more suffering, but also more well-being such that the sum, on the classical utilitarian calculus, is net positive.

Ray Briggs writes in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'':<ref>{{citation|last1=Briggs|first1=Rachael |title=Normative Theories of Rational Choice: Expected Utility |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/rationality-normative-utility/ |year=2017 |edition=Spring 2017 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|One objection to this interpretation of utility is that there may not be a single good (or indeed any good) which rationality requires us to seek. But if we understand \"utility\" broadly enough to include all potentially desirable ends\u2014pleasure, knowledge, friendship, health and so on\u2014it's not clear that there is a unique correct way to make the tradeoffs between different goods so that each outcome receives a utility. There may be no good answer to the question of whether the life of an ascetic monk contains more or less good than the life of a happy libertine\u2014but assigning utilities to these options forces us to compare them.}}\n\nUtility understood this way is a [[#Preference utilitarianism|personal preference]], in the absence of any objective measurement.\n\n===Utility ignores justice===\nAs Rosen<ref name=\"Rosen, Frederick 2003, p. 132\"/> has pointed out, claiming that act utilitarians are not concerned about having rules is to set up a \"straw man\". Similarly, [[R. M. Hare|Hare]] refers to \"the crude caricature of act utilitarianism which is the only version of it that many philosophers seem to be acquainted with.\"<ref>Hare, R. M. (1981) Moral Thinking. Oxford Univ. Press, p. 36</ref> Given what Bentham says about second order evils<ref>Bentham, Jeremy (2009) Theory of Legislation. General Books LLC, p. 58</ref> it would be a serious misrepresentation to say that he and similar act utilitarians would be prepared to punish an innocent person for the greater good. Nevertheless, whether they would agree or not, this is what critics of utilitarianism claim is entailed by the theory. A classic version of this criticism was given by [[H. J. McCloskey]] in 1957:<ref name=McCloskey1957/>\n{{quote|Suppose that a sheriff were faced with the choice either of framing a Negro for a rape that had aroused hostility to the Negroes (a particular Negro generally being believed to be guilty but whom the sheriff knows not to be guilty)\u2014and thus preventing serious anti-Negro riots which would probably lead to some loss of life and increased hatred of each other by whites and Negroes\u2014or of hunting for the guilty person and thereby allowing the anti-Negro riots to occur, while doing the best he can to combat them. In such a case the sheriff, if he were an extreme utilitarian, would appear to be committed to framing the Negro.}}\n\nBy \"extreme\" utilitarian, McCloskey is referring to what later came to be called \"act\" utilitarianism. He suggests one response might be that the sheriff would not frame the innocent negro because of another rule: \"do not punish an innocent person\". Another response might be that the riots the sheriff is trying to avoid might have positive utility in the long run by drawing attention to questions of race and resources to help address tensions between the communities.\n\nIn a later article, McCloskey says:<ref>McCloskey, H.J. (1963) A Note on Utilitarian Punishment, in Mind, 72, 1963, p. 599</ref>\n{{quote|Surely the utilitarian must admit that whatever the facts of the matter may be, it is logically possible that an 'unjust' system of punishment\u2014e.g. a system involving collective punishments, retroactive laws and punishments, or punishments of parents and relations of the offender\u2014may be more useful than a 'just' system of punishment?}}\n\nAn older form of this argument was presented by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in his book ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. In it, Ivan challenges his brother Alyosha, a utilitarian, to answer his question: <blockquote>Tell me straight out, I call on you\u2014answer me: imagine that you yourself are building the edifice of human destiny with the object of making people happy in the finale, of giving them peace and rest at last, but for that you must inevitably and unavoidably torture just one tiny creature, [one child], and raise your edifice on the foundation of her unrequited tears\u2014would you agree to be the architect on such conditions?. . . And can you admit the idea that the people for whom you are building would agree to accept their happiness on the unjustified blood of a tortured child, and having accepted it, to remain forever happy?<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/the_dostoevsky_dilemma_for_religious_ethics/ | title=The Dostoevsky Dilemma for Religious Ethics &#124; Center for Inquiry| date=2011-02-15}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Predicting consequences ===\nSome argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. [[Daniel Dennett]] describes this as the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] effect.<ref>Dennett, Daniel (1995), ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', Simon & Schuster, p. 498 {{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}}.</ref> Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.\n\nRussell Hardin rejects such arguments. He argues that it is possible to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism (which is \"to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these\") from our ability to correctly apply rational principles that, among other things, \"depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actor's mental equipment.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Russell |title=Morality within the Limits of Reason |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=May 1990 |page=3 |isbn=978-0226316208}}</ref> The fact that the latter is limited and can change doesn't mean that the former has to be rejected. \"If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so that we are able to choose actions that better produce our intended ends, it does not follow that we then must change our ethics. The moral impulse of utilitarianism is constant, but our decisions under it are contingent on our knowledge and scientific understanding.\"<ref name=\"Hardin 1990 4\"/>\n\nFrom the beginning, utilitarianism has recognized that certainty in such matters is unobtainable and both Bentham and Mill said that it was necessary to rely on the ''tendencies'' of actions to bring about consequences. [[G. E. Moore]], writing in 1903, said:<ref>{{cite book |last=Moore |first=G. E. |title=Principia Ethica |publisher=Prometheus Books UK |year=1903 |pages=203\u20134 |isbn=978-0879754983}}</ref>\n{{quote|We certainly cannot hope directly to compare their effects except within a limited future; and all the arguments, which have ever been used in Ethics, and upon which we commonly act in common life, directed to shewing that one course is superior to another, are (apart from theological dogmas) confined to pointing out such probable immediate advantages...\n\nAn ethical law has the nature not of a scientific law but of a scientific ''prediction'': and the latter is always merely probable, although the probability may be very great.}}\n\n===Demandingness objection===\nAct utilitarianism not only requires everyone to do what they can to maximize utility, but to do so without any favouritism. Mill said, \"As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.\"<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\"/> Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. \"What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |editor-first=Timothy |editor-last=Chappell |title=The Problem of Moral Demandingness: new philosophical essays |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2011 |page=151 |chapter=Chapter 8: The Demandingness Objection |isbn=9780230219403}}</ref> As Shelly Kagan says, \"Given the parameters of the actual world, there is no question that ...(maximally)... promoting the good would require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity...a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kagan |first=Shelly |title=The Limits of Morality |series=Oxford Ethics Series |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=1991 |page=360 |isbn=978-0198239161}}</ref>\n\nHooker describes two aspects to the problem: act utilitarianism requires ''huge'' sacrifices from those who are relatively better off and also requires sacrifice of your own good even when the aggregate good will be only ''slightly'' increased.<ref name=\"Hooker 2002 152\">{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |title=Ideal Code, Real World: A Rule-Consequentialist Theory of Morality |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=2002 |page=152 |isbn=978-0199256570}}</ref> Another way of highlighting the complaint is to say that in utilitarianism, \"there is no such thing as morally permissible self-sacrifice that goes above and beyond the call of duty.\"<ref name=\"Hooker 2002 152\"/> Mill was quite clear about this, \"A sacrifice which does not increase, or tend to increase, the sum total of happiness, it considers as wasted.\"<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\"/>\n\nOne response to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: \"No doubt we do instinctively prefer to help those who are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what we ought to do, and it is difficult to see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |title=Practical Ethics |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2011 |pages=202\u20133 |isbn=978-0521707688}}</ref>\n\nOthers argue that a moral theory that is so contrary to our deeply held moral convictions must either be rejected or modified.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |editor-first=Timothy |editor-last= Chappell |title=The problem of moral demandingness: new philosophical essays |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2011 |page=148 |chapter=Chapter 8: The Demandingness Objection |isbn=9780230219403}}</ref> There have been various attempts to modify utilitarianism to escape its seemingly over-demanding requirements.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kagan|first= Shelly |title=Does Consequentialism Demand too Much?

Kagan suggests that such a procedure might be justified on the grounds that \"a general requirement to promote the good would lack the motivational underpinning necessary for genuine moral requirements\" and, secondly, that personal independence is necessary for the existence of commitments and close personal relations and that \"the value of such commitments yields a positive reason for preserving within moral theory at least some moral independence for the personal point of view.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kagan|first= Shelly |title=Does Consequentialism Demand too Much?

He suggests that many of the problems arise under the traditional formulation because the conscientious utilitarian ends up having to make up for the failings of others and so contributing more than their fair share.<ref>{{cite book |last=Goodin |first=Robert E. |title=Utilitarianism as a Public Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1995 |page=66 |isbn=978-0521468060}}</ref>\n\nGandjour specifically considers market situations and analyses whether individuals who act in markets may produce a utilitarian optimum.

This means that utilitarianism, if correctly interpreted, will yield a moral code with a standard of acceptable conduct very much below the level of highest moral perfection, leaving plenty of scope for supererogatory actions exceeding this minimum standard.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Harsanyi |first= John C. |title= Can the Maximin Principle Serve as a Basis for Morality?

Mill responded that there had been ample time to calculate the likely effects:<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill2.htm |title=Utilitarianism, Chapter 2 |author=Mill, John Stuart |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n{{quote|...namely, the whole past duration of the human species. During all that time, mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions; on which experience all the prudence, as well as all the morality of life, are dependent...It is a strange notion that the acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission of secondary ones. To inform a traveller respecting the place of his ultimate destination, is not to forbid the use of landmarks and direction-posts on the way. The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal, or that persons going thither should not be advised to take one direction rather than another. Men really ought to leave off talking a kind of nonsense on this subject, which they would neither talk nor listen to on other matters of practical concernment.}}\n\nMore recently, Hardin has made the same point. \"It should embarrass philosophers that they have ever taken this objection seriously. Parallel considerations in other realms are dismissed with eminently good sense.

For example, if we were given the choice between saving two random people or our mother, most would choose to save their mothers. According to utilitarianism, such a natural action is immoral. The first to respond to this was an early utilitarian and friend of [[Jeremy Bentham]] named [[William Godwin]], who held in his work ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' that such personal needs should be disregarded in favour of the greatest good for the greatest number of people. He wrote, <blockquote>Supposing the chambermaid had been my wife, my mother or my benefactor. That would not alter the truth of the proposition. The life of two would still be more valuable than that of the chambermaid; and justice- pure, unadulterated justice- would still have preferred that which was most valuable.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Godwin/pj22.html | title=Godwin, \"Political Justice,\" Book 2, Chap. 2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Criticisms of utilitarian value theory===\n\nUtilitarianism's assertion that well-being is the only thing with intrinsic moral value has been attacked by various critics.\n\n[[Karl Marx]], in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', criticises Bentham's utilitarianism on the grounds that it does not appear to recognise that people have different joys in different socioeconomic contexts:<ref>[[s:Das Kapital/Chapter 24#endnote 50|Das Kapital Volume 1, Chapter 24, endnote 50]]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>With the driest naivete he takes the modern shopkeeper, especially the English shopkeeper, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer normal man, and to his world, is absolutely useful. This yard-measure, then, he applies to past, present, and future. The Christian religion, e.g., is \"useful,\" \"because it forbids in the name of religion the same faults that the penal code condemns in the name of the law.\" Artistic criticism is \"harmful,\" because it disturbs worthy people in their enjoyment of [[Martin Tupper]], etc. With such rubbish has the brave fellow, with his motto, \"nulla dies sine linea [no day without a line]\", piled up mountains of books.</blockquote>\n\n[[Pope John Paul II]], following his [[Personalism|personalist philosophy]], argued that a danger of utilitarianism is that it tends to make persons, just as much as things, the object of use. \"Utilitarianism,\" he wrote, \"is a civilization of production and of use, a civilization of things and not of persons, a civilization in which persons are used in the same way as things are used.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405033300/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html |archivedate=5 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Duty-based criticisms===\n\n[[Roger Scruton]] is a deontologist, and believes that utilitarianism does not give duty the place that it needs inside our ethical judgements. He asks us to consider the dilemma of [[Anna Karenina]], who had to choose between her love of Vronsky and her duty towards her husband and her son. Scruton wrote, \"Suppose Anna were to reason that it is better to satisfy two healthy young people and frustrate one old one than to satisfy one old person and frustrate two young ones, by a factor of 2.5 to 1: ergo I am leaving. What would we think, then, of her moral seriousness?\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scruton |first1=Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton |title=On Human Nature |publisher=Princeton |date=2017 |pages=96 |isbn=978-0-691-18303-9}}</ref>\n\n===Baby farming===\n\nA critic of utilitarianism, in ''Innocence and Consequentialism'' [[Jacqueline Laing]] argued in 1996 that utilitarianism has insufficient conceptual apparatus to comprehend the very idea of innocence, a feature central to any comprehensive ethical theory.<ref>Laing, Jacqueline A.

His explanation that baby farming undermines attitudes of care and concern for the very young, can be applied to babies and the unborn (both 'non-persons' who may be killed, on his view) and contradicts positions that he adopts elsewhere in his work.\n\n== Additional considerations ==\n\n===Average v. total happiness===\n{{Main|Average and total utilitarianism}}\nIn ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', [[Henry Sidgwick]] asked, \"Is it total or average happiness that we seek to make a maximum?\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=xxxvi |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref><ref name=\"Sidgwick 1981 415\">{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=415 |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref> Paley notes that, although he speaks of the happiness of communities, \"the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients, or the pleasure of their perceptions\" and that if extreme cases, such as people held as slaves, are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people. Consequently, \"the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer; and the improvement of it the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesmoral08palegoog/page/n4 |title=The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy |last=Paley |first=William |year=1785 |accessdate =1 July 2012}}</ref> A similar view was expressed by Smart, who argued that, all other things being equal, a universe with two million happy people is better than a universe with only one million happy people.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smart |first1=J.

In other words, according to the theory, it is a moral good to breed more people on the world for as long as total happiness rises.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parfit |first=Derek |title=Reasons and Persons |publisher=Oxford Paperbacks |date=January 1986 |page=[https://archive.org/details/reasonspersons00parf/page/388 388] |isbn=978-0198249085 |url=https://archive.org/details/reasonspersons00parf/page/388 }}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, measuring the utility of a population based on the average utility of that population avoids [[Derek Parfit|Parfit's]] repugnant conclusion but causes other problems. For example, bringing a moderately happy person into a very happy world would be seen as an immoral act; aside from this, the theory implies that it would be a moral good to eliminate all people whose happiness is below average, as this would raise the average happiness.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=William |title=Contemporary Ethics: Taking Account of Utilitarianism |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=November 1998 |pages=31\u201335 |isbn=978-0631202943}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Shaw suggests that the problem can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people, who need not concern us, and actual future people, who should concern us. He says, \"utilitarianism values the happiness of people, not the production of units of happiness. Accordingly, one has no positive obligation to have children. However, if you have decided to have a child, then you have an obligation to give birth to the happiest child you can.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=William |title=Contemporary Ethics: Taking Account of Utilitarianism |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=November 1998 |page=34 |isbn=978-0631202943}}</ref>\n\n===Motives, intentions, and actions===\nUtilitarianism is typically taken to assess the rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just the consequences of that action. Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from [[intention]] and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain. He adds that, \"from every kind of motive, may proceed actions that are good, others that are bad, and others that are indifferent.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation |series=Dover Philosophical Classics |publisher=Dover Publications |date=January 2009 |page=102 |isbn=978-0486454528}}</ref> Mill makes a similar point<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=John |editor-last=Robson |title=Collected Works, volume 31 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1981 |page=51 |chapter=Autobiography |isbn=978-0-7100-0718-6}}</ref> and explicitly says that \"motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent.

The difficulty in interpretation centres around trying to explain why, since it is consequences that matter, intentions should play a role in the assessment of the morality of an action but motives should not. One possibility \"involves supposing that the 'morality' of the act is one thing, probably to do with the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agent, and its rightness or wrongness another.\"<ref name=\"Mill's Puzzling Footnote\">{{cite journal |last1=Dancy |first1=Jonathan |year=2000 |title=Mill's Puzzling Footnote |journal=Utilitas |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=219\u201322 |doi= 10.1017/S095382080000279X}}</ref> [[Jonathan Dancy]] rejects this interpretation on the grounds that Mill is explicitly making intention relevant to an assessment of the act not to an assessment of the agent.\n\nAn interpretation given by [[Roger Crisp]] draws on a definition given by Mill in ''[[A System of Logic]]'', where he says that an \"intention to produce the effect, is one thing; the effect produced in consequence of the intention, is another thing; the two together constitute the action.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |title=A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive |series=Classic Reprint |publisher=Forgotten Books |date=February 2011 |page=51 |isbn=978-1440090820}}</ref> Accordingly, whilst two actions may outwardly appear to be the same they will be different actions if there is a different intention. Dancy notes that this does not explain why intentions count but motives do not.\n\nA third interpretation is that an action might be considered a complex action consisting of several stages and it is the intention that determines which of these stages are to be considered part of the action. Although this is the interpretation favoured by Dancy, he recognizes that this might not have been Mill's own view, for Mill \"would not even allow that 'p & q' expresses a complex proposition. He wrote in his ''System of Logic'' I iv. 3, of 'Caesar is dead and Brutus is alive', that 'we might as well call a street a complex house, as these two propositions a complex proposition'.\"<ref name=\"Mill's Puzzling Footnote\"/>\n\nFinally, whilst motives may not play a role in determining the morality of an action, this does not preclude utilitarians from fostering particular motives if doing so will increase overall happiness.\n\n== Humans alone, or other sentient beings? ==\n\n=== Nonhuman animals ===\n{{further|Speciesism|Animal welfare}}\n[[File:Peter Singer MIT Veritas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peter Singer]]]]\nIn ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' Bentham wrote \"the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\"<ref name=\"BenthamIntroductiontothePrinciples\">An Introduction to the Principals of Morals and Legislation, Jeremy Bentham, 1789 (\"printed\" in 1780, \"first published\" in 1789, \"corrected by the Author\" in 1823.)

XVII Note 122.</ref> Mill's distinction between [[Utilitarianism#Higher and lower pleasures|higher and lower pleasures]] might suggest that he gave more status to humans. However, in his essay \"Whewell on Moral Philosophy\", Mill defends Bentham's position, calling it a 'noble anticipation', and writing: \"Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer 'immoral', let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mill |first1=J.

He writes: \"We have next to consider who the 'all' are, whose happiness is to be taken into account. Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct? or are we to confine our view to human happiness? The former view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill, and (I believe) by the Utilitarian school generally: and is obviously most in accordance with the universality that is characteristic of their principle ... it seems arbitrary and unreasonable to exclude from the end, as so conceived, any pleasure of any sentient being.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=414 |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref>\n\nAmong contemporary utilitarian philosophers, Peter Singer is especially known for arguing that the well-being of all [[sentience|sentient]] beings ought to be given [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]]. Singer suggests that rights are conferred according to the level of a creature's self-awareness, regardless of their species. He adds that humans tend to be [[speciesism|speciesist]] (discriminatory against non-humans) in ethical matters, and argues that, on utilitarianism, speciesism cannot be justified as there is no rational distinction that can be made between the suffering of humans and the suffering of nonhuman animals; all suffering ought to be reduced. Singer writes: \"The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is the same in each case ... Most human beings are speciesists.\"<ref>Peter Singer, ''Animal Liberation'', Chapter I, pp. 7\u20138, 2nd edition, 1990.</ref>\n\nIn his 1990 edition of ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'', Peter Singer said that he no longer ate oysters and mussels, because although the creatures might not suffer, there was a possibility they may and it was easy to avoid eating them in any case.<ref>[http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/warn/singer_fish.htm Animal Liberation, Second Edition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205080909/http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/warn/singer_fish.htm |date=5 December 2010 }}, Singer, Peter, 1975, 1990, excerpt, pp. 171\u201374, main passage on oysters, mussels, etc. p. 174 (last paragraph of this excerpt). And in a footnote in the actual book, Singer writes \"My change of mind about mollusks stems from conversations with R.I. Sikora.\"</ref>\n\nThis view still might be contrasted with [[deep ecology]], which holds that an intrinsic value is attached to all forms of life and nature, whether currently assumed to be sentient or not. According to utilitarianism, the forms of life that are unable to experience anything akin to either enjoyment or discomfort are denied moral status, because it is impossible to increase the happiness or reduce the suffering of something that cannot feel happiness or suffer. Singer writes:\n<blockquote>The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering\u2014in so far as rough comparisons can be made\u2014of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.</blockquote>\n\nThus, the moral value of one-celled organisms, as well as some multi-cellular organisms, and natural entities like a river, is only in the benefit they provide to sentient beings. Similarly, utilitarianism places no direct intrinsic value on [[biodiversity]], although the benefits that biodiversity bring to sentient beings may mean that, on utilitarianism, biodiversity ought to be maintained in general.\n\nIn John Stuart Mill's essay \"On Nature\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Mill's \"On Nature\"|url = http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/users/philosophy/texts/mill_on.htm|website = www.lancaster.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-08-09|date = 1904}}</ref> he argues that the [[wild animal suffering|welfare of wild animals]] is to be considered when making utilitarian judgments.

Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking.<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism Peter Singer: The why and how of effective altruism | Talk Video].

For instance, [[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of utilitarianism, described utility as \"that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness...[or] to prevent the happening of mischief, pain, evil, or unhappiness to the party whose interest is considered.\" Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong. Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] and [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]], utilitarianism considers the interests of all humans [[Equal consideration of interests|equally]].\n\nProponents of utilitarianism have disagreed on a number of points, such as whether actions should be chosen based on their likely results ([[act utilitarianism]]) or whether [[Agency (philosophy)|agents]] should conform to rules that maximize utility ([[rule utilitarianism]]). There is also disagreement as to whether total ([[Average and total utilitarianism|total utilitarianism]]), average ([[Average and total utilitarianism#Average utilitarianism|average utilitarianism]]) or minimum<ref>{{Citation|last=White|first=Stuart|title=Social Minimum|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/social-minimum/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> utility should be maximized.\n\nThough the seeds of the theory can be found in the [[hedonism|hedonists]] [[Aristippus]] and [[Epicurus]], who viewed happiness as the only good, the tradition of utilitarianism properly began with Bentham, and has included [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[R. M. Hare]], [[David Braybrooke]] and [[Peter Singer]]. It has been applied to social welfare economics, the crisis of global poverty, the [[ethics of eating meat|ethics of raising animals for food]] and the importance of avoiding [[Global catastrophic risk|existential risks]] to humanity.\n\n==Etymology==\nBenthamism, the utilitarian philosophy founded by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was substantially modified by his successor [[John Stuart Mill]], who popularized the word 'Utilitarianism'.<ref name=\"Habibi 2001 89, 112\">{{cite book | last=Habibi | first=Don | title=John Stuart Mill and the Ethic of Human Growth | publisher=Springer Netherlands | location=Dordrecht | year=2001 | isbn=978-90-481-5668-9 |chapter=Chapter 3, Mill's Moral Philosophy | pages=89\u201390, 112| doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2010-6_3 }}</ref> In 1861, Mill acknowledged in a footnote that, though \"believing himself to be the first person who brought the word 'utilitarian' into use, he did not invent it.

In the same way, moral [[evil]], or [[vice]], is proportionate to the number of people made to suffer. The best action is the one that procures the greatest happiness of the greatest numbers\u2014and the worst is the one that causes the most misery.\n\nIn the first three editions of the book, Hutcheson included various mathematical algorithms \"...to compute the Morality of any Actions.\" In this, he pre-figured the [[Felicific calculus|hedonic calculus]] of Bentham.\n\nSome claim that [[John Gay (philosopher)|John Gay]] developed the first systematic theory of utilitarian ethics.<ref>Ashcraft, Richard (1991) John Locke: Critical Assessments (Critical assessments of leading political philosophers), Routledge, p. 691</ref> In ''Concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality'' (1731), Gay argues that:<ref>{{cite book |last= Gay |first= John |editor-first= J.

It is possible that Bentham was spurred on to publish after he saw the success of Paley's ''The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy''.<ref name=\"Rosen, Frederick 2003, p. 132\">Rosen, Frederick (2003) Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill.

(1977) Sidgwick's Ethics and Victorian Moral Philosophy, Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 122</ref> but his ideas were spread further when [[Pierre \u00c9tienne Louis Dumont]] translated edited selections from a variety of Bentham's manuscripts into French. ''Trait\u00e9 de legislation civile et p\u00e9nale'' was published in 1802 and then later retranslated back into English by Hildreth as ''The Theory of Legislation'', although by this time significant portions of Dumont's work had already been retranslated and incorporated into Sir [[John Bowring]]'s edition of Bentham's works, which was issued in parts between 1838 and 1843.\n\nBentham's work opens with a statement of the principle of utility:<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation |series=Dover Philosophical Classics |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2009 |page=1 |isbn=978-0486454528}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do... By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness. I say of every action whatsoever, and therefore not only of every action of a private individual, but of every measure of government.}}\n\nIn Chapter IV, Bentham introduces a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains, which has come to be known as the hedonic calculus. Bentham says that the value of a pleasure or pain, considered by itself, can be measured according to its intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty and propinquity/remoteness. In addition, it is necessary to consider \"the tendency of any act by which it is produced\" and, therefore, to take account of the act's fecundity, or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind and its purity, or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind. Finally, it is necessary to consider the extent, or the number of people affected by the action.\n\nPerhaps aware that Hutcheson eventually removed his algorithms for calculating the greatest happiness because they \"appear'd useless, and were disagreeable to some readers\",<ref name=\"HutchesonIntroduction\">An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue, Francis Hutcheson, Introduction, 1726</ref> Bentham contends that there is nothing novel or unwarranted about his method, for \"in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind, wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest, is perfectly conformable to.\"\n\nRosen warns that descriptions of utilitarianism can bear \"little resemblance historically to utilitarians like Bentham and [[J. S. Mill]]\" and can be more \"a crude version of act utilitarianism conceived in the twentieth century as a [[straw man]] to be attacked and rejected.\"<ref>Rosen, Frederick (2003) Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill. Routledge, p. 32</ref> It is a mistake to think that Bentham is not concerned with rules. His seminal work is concerned with the principles of legislation and the hedonic calculus is introduced with the words \"Pleasures then, and the avoidance of pains, are the ends that the legislator has in view.\" In Chapter VII, Bentham says: \"The business of government is to promote the happiness of the society, by punishing and rewarding... In proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness, in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious, will be the demand it creates for punishment.\"\n\nThe question then arises as to when, if at all, it might be legitimate to break the law. This is considered in ''The Theory of Legislation'', where Bentham distinguishes between evils of the first and second orders. Those of the first order are the more immediate consequences; those of the second are when the consequences spread through the community causing \"alarm\" and \"danger\".\n\n<blockquote>It is true there are cases in which, if we confine ourselves to the effects of the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? ... It is not on account of the evil of the first order that it is necessary to erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bentham |first1=Jeremy |last2=Dumont |first2=Etienne |last3=Hildreth | first3=R |title=Theory of Legislation: Translated from the French of Etienne Dumont |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |date=November 2005 |pages=58 |isbn=978-1402170348}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===John Stuart Mill===\n{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}\nMill was brought up as a Benthamite with the explicit intention that he would carry on the cause of utilitarianism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halevy|first=Elie|title=The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism|year=1966|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-19-101020-0|pages=282\u201384}}</ref> Mill's book ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' first appeared as a series of three articles published in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in 1861 and was reprinted as a single book in 1863.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory|last=Hinman|first=Lawrence|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2012|isbn=978-1133050018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=John Stuart|orig-year=1863|last=Mill|date=2010|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=TnYZ4tO5640C&pg=PA33 |title=Utilitarianism - Ed.

It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality is considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone.}}\n\nThe word utility is used to mean general well-being or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is the consequence of a good action. Utility, within the context of utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.\n\nMill not only viewed actions as a core part of utility, but as the directive rule of moral human conduct. The rule being that we should only be committing actions that provide pleasure to society. This view of pleasure was hedonistic, as it pursued the thought that pleasure is the highest good in life. This concept was adopted by Bentham and can be seen in his works. According to Mill, good actions result in pleasure, and that there is no higher end than pleasure. Mill says that good actions lead to pleasure and define good [[Moral character|character]]. Better put, the justification of character, and whether an action is good or not, is based on how the person contributes to the concept of social utility. In the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions; and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good, of which the predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct. In the last chapter of Utilitarianism, Mill concludes that justice, as a classifying factor of our actions (being just or unjust) is one of the certain moral requirements, and when the requirements are all regarded collectively, they are viewed as greater according to this scale of \"social utility\" as Mill puts it.\n\nHe also notes that, contrary to what its critics might say, there is \"no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect... a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation.\" However, he accepts that this is usually because the intellectual pleasures are thought to have circumstantial advantages, i.e. \"greater permanency, safety, uncostliness, &c.\" Instead, Mill will argue that some pleasures are intrinsically better than others.\n\nThe accusation that hedonism is a \"doctrine worthy only of swine\" has a long history. In ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book 1 Chapter 5), [[Aristotle]] says that identifying the good with pleasure is to prefer a life suitable for beasts. The theological utilitarians had the option of grounding their pursuit of happiness in the will of God; the hedonistic utilitarians needed a different defence. Mill's approach is to argue that the pleasures of the intellect are intrinsically superior to physical pleasures.\n\n<blockquote>Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs... A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence... It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be [[Socrates]] dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question...<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=Roger |editor-last=Crisp |title=Utilitarianism |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |pages=56\u201357 |isbn=978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMill argues that if people who are \"competently acquainted\" with two pleasures show a decided preference for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and \"would not resign it for any quantity of the other\", then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these \"competent judges\" will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, the judgment of the majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that \"many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher.\" Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for there is no other way of measuring \"the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations.\" \"It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constitute, is imperfect.\"<ref>John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism, Chapter 2</ref>\n\nMill also thinks that \"intellectual pursuits have value out of proportion to the amount of contentment or pleasure (the mental state) that they produce\".<ref>Brink, David. \"Mill Moral and Political Philosophy\". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political [accessed 27 April 2018].</ref> Mill also says that people should pursue these grand ideals, because if they choose to have gratification from petty pleasures, \"some displeasure will eventually creep in.

Whereas, intellectual pursuits give long-term happiness because they provide the individual with constant opportunities throughout the years to improve his life, by benefiting from accruing knowledge. Mill views intellectual pursuits as \"capable of incorporating the 'finer things' in life\" while petty pursuits do not achieve this goal.<ref>Saunders, Ben. \"J. S. Mill's Conception of Utility.\" Utilitas 22, no. 1 (March 2010): 52-69. https://search.proquest.com/docview/200183451 [accessed 27 April 2018]</ref> Mill is saying that intellectual pursuits give the individual the opportunity to escape the constant depression cycle since these pursuits allow them to achieve their ideals, while petty pleasures do not offer this. Although debate persists about the nature of Mill's view of gratification, this suggests bifurcation in his position.\n\n==== Mill's 'proof' of the principle of utility ====\nIn Chapter Four of ''Utilitarianism'', Mill considers what proof can be given for the principle of utility.

He is accused of committing the [[naturalistic fallacy]], because he is trying to deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of [[equivocation]], because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and the [[fallacy of composition]], because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.\n\nSuch allegations began to emerge in Mill's lifetime, shortly after the publication of ''Utilitarianism'', and persisted for well over a century, though the tide has been turning in recent discussions.\n\nA defence of Mill against all three charges, with a chapter devoted to each, can be found in Necip Fikri Alican's ''Mill's Principle of Utility: A Defense of John Stuart Mill's Notorious Proof'' (1994).

E. Moore]]. In ''Ethics'' (1912), Moore rejected a purely hedonistic utilitarianism and argued that there is a range of values that might be maximized. Moore's strategy was to show that it is intuitively implausible that pleasure is the sole measure of what is good. He says that such an assumption:<ref name=\"Moore, G. E. 1912\">Moore, G. E. (1912).  ''Ethics'', London: Williams and Norgate, Ch. 7</ref>\n{{quote|involves our saying, for instance, that a world in which absolutely nothing except pleasure existed\u2014no knowledge, no love, no enjoyment of beauty, no moral qualities\u2014must yet be intrinsically better\u2014better worth creating\u2014provided only the total quantity of pleasure in it were the least bit greater, than one in which all these things existed as well as pleasure.\n\nIt involves our saying that, even if the total quantity of pleasure in each was exactly equal, yet the fact that all the beings in the one possessed, in addition knowledge of many different kinds and a full appreciation of all that was beautiful or worthy of love in their world, whereas none of the beings in the other possessed any of these things, would give us no reason whatever for preferring the former to the latter.}}\n\nMoore admits that it is impossible to prove the case either way, but he believed that it was intuitively obvious that even if the amount of pleasure stayed the same a world that contained such things as beauty and love would be a better world. He adds that, if a person was to take the contrary view, then \"I think it is self-evident that he would be wrong.\"<ref name=\"Moore, G. E. 1912\"/>\n\n=== Act and rule utilitarianism ===\nIn the mid-twentieth century a number of philosophers focused on the place of rules in utilitarian thinking.<ref>Bayles, M. D., ed. (1968) Contemporary Utilitarianism, Anchor Books, Doubleday</ref> It was already accepted that it is necessary to use rules to help you choose the right action because the problems of calculating the consequences on each and every occasion would almost certainly result in you frequently choosing something less than the best course of action. Paley had justified the use of rules and Mill says:<ref>{{cite book |last = Mill | first = John Stuart |editor-first= Roger |editor-last= Crisp |title = Utilitarianism |publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1998 |page = 70 |isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|It is truly a whimsical supposition that, if mankind were agreed in considering utility to be the test of morality, they would remain without any agreement as to what is useful, and would take no measures for having their notions on the subject taught to the young, and enforced by law and opinion... to consider the rules of morality as improvable, is one thing; to pass over the intermediate generalisations entirely, and endeavour to test each individual action directly by the first principle, is another... The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal... Nobody argues that the art of navigation is not founded on astronomy, because sailors cannot wait to calculate the Nautical Almanack. Being rational creatures, they go to sea with it ready calculated; and all rational creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds made up on the common questions of right and wrong.}}\n\nHowever, rule utilitarianism proposes a more central role for rules that was thought to rescue the theory from some of its more devastating criticisms, particularly problems to do with justice and promise keeping. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, articles were published both for and against the new form of utilitarianism, and through this debate the theory we now call rule utilitarianism was created. In an introduction to an anthology of these articles, the editor was able to say: \"The development of this theory was a dialectical process of formulation, criticism, reply and reformulation; the record of this process well illustrates the co-operative development of a philosophical theory.\"<ref>Bayles, M.

[[Act utilitarianism]] maintains that an action is right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.\n\nIn 1956, Urmson published an influential article<ref>{{cite journal |last=Urmson |first=J. O. |title=The Interpretation of the Moral Philosophy of J. S. Mill |journal=Philosophical Quarterly |volume=3 |issue=10 |year=1953 |pages=33\u201339 |jstor=2216697 |doi=10.2307/2216697}}</ref> arguing that Mill justified rules on utilitarian principles. From then on, articles have debated this interpretation of Mill. In all probability, it was not a distinction that Mill was particularly trying to make and so the evidence in his writing is inevitably mixed. A collection of Mill's writing published in 1977 includes a letter in which he says:<ref>Mill, John Stuart, The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill. Gen. Ed. John M. Robson. 33 vols.

However, it is not clear that this distinction is made in the academic literature.\n\nIt has been argued that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism, because for any given rule, in the case where breaking the rule produces more utility, the rule can be refined by the addition of a sub-rule that handles cases like the exception.<ref>David Lyons, ''Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism'', 1965</ref> This process holds for all cases of exceptions, and so the \"rules\" have as many \"sub-rules\" as there are exceptional cases, which, in the end, makes an agent seek out whatever outcome produces the maximum utility.<ref>Allen Habib (2008), ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/promises/ Promises]'', in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].</ref>\n\n=== Two-level utilitarianism ===\n{{Main|Two-level utilitarianism}}\nIn ''Principles'' (1973),<ref name=\"HareRM\">{{cite journal | last = Hare | first = R.

M. Hare]] accepts that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism but claims that this is a result of allowing the rules to be \"as specific and un-general as we please.\" He argues that one of the main reasons for introducing rule utilitarianism was to do justice to the general rules that people need for moral education and character development and he proposes that \"a difference between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism can be introduced by limiting the specificity of the rules, i.e., by increasing their generality.\"<ref name=\"HareRM\"/>{{rp|14}} This distinction between a \"specific rule utilitarianism\" (which collapses into act utilitarianism) and \"general rule utilitarianism\" forms the basis of Hare's two-level utilitarianism.\n\nWhen we are \"playing God or the ideal observer\", we use the specific form, and we will need to do this when we are deciding what general principles to teach and follow. When we are \"inculcating\" or in situations where the biases of our human nature are likely to prevent us doing the calculations properly, then we should use the more general rule utilitarianism.\n\nHare argues that in practice, most of the time, we should be following the general principles:<ref name=\"HareRM\"/>{{rp|17}}\n\n{{quote|One ought to abide by the general principles whose general inculcation is for the best; harm is more likely to come, in actual moral situations, from questioning these rules than from sticking to them, unless the situations are very extra-ordinary; the results of sophisticated felicific calculations are not likely, human nature and human ignorance being what they are, to lead to the greatest utility.}}\n\nIn ''Moral Thinking'' (1981), Hare illustrated the two extremes. The \"archangel\" is the hypothetical person who has perfect knowledge of the situation and no personal biases or weaknesses and always uses critical moral thinking to decide the right thing to do; the \"prole\" is the hypothetical person who is completely incapable of critical thinking and uses nothing but intuitive moral thinking and, of necessity, has to follow the general moral rules they have been taught or learned through imitation.<ref name=\"Hare 1981 b\">{{cite book | last = Hare | first = R.M. | author-link = R.

However, the critical moral thinking underpins and informs the more intuitive moral thinking. It is responsible for formulating and, if necessary, reformulating the general moral rules. We also switch to critical thinking when trying to deal with unusual situations or in cases where the intuitive moral rules give conflicting advice.\n\n=== Preference utilitarianism ===\n{{Main|Preference utilitarianism}}\nThe concept of preference utilitarianism was first proposed in 1977 by [[John Harsanyi]] in ''Morality and the theory of rational behaviour'',<ref name=\"Harsanyi\">{{citation |last=Harsanyi |first=John C. |author-link=John Harsanyi |contribution=Morality and the theory of rational behaviour |editor-last1=Sen |editor-first1 = Amartya |editor-last2=Williams |editor-first2=Bernard |editor-link1=Amartya Sen |editor-link2=Bernard Williams |title=Utilitarianism and beyond |pages=39\u201362 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1982 |isbn=9780511611964 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}:''Originally printed as'': {{cite journal |last=Harsanyi |first=John C. |author-link=John Harsanyi |title=Morality and the theory of rational behavior |journal=Social Research |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=623\u201356 |date=Winter 1977 |jstor=40971169 |ref=harv }}</ref> but preference utilitarianism is more commonly associated with [[R.

He also rejects ideal utilitarianism because \"it is certainly not true as an empirical observation that people's only purpose in life is to have 'mental states of intrinsic worth'.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|54}}\n\nAccording to Harsanyi, \"preference utilitarianism is the only form of utilitarianism consistent with the important philosophical principle of preference autonomy. By this I mean the principle that, in deciding what is good and what is bad for a given individual, the ultimate criterion can only be his own wants and his own preferences.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|55}}\n\nHarsanyi adds two caveats. People sometimes have irrational preferences. To deal with this, Harsanyi distinguishes between \"manifest\" preferences and \"true\" preferences. The former are those \"manifested by his observed behaviour, including preferences possibly based on erroneous factual beliefs,{{clarify|date=September 2016}} or on careless logical analysis, or on strong emotions that at the moment greatly hinder rational choice\" whereas the latter are \"the preferences he would have if he had all the relevant factual information, always reasoned with the greatest possible care, and were in a state of mind most conducive to rational choice.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|55}} It is the latter that preference utilitarianism tries to satisfy.\n\nThe second caveat is that antisocial preferences, such as sadism, envy and resentment, have to be excluded. Harsanyi achieves this by claiming that such preferences partially exclude those people from the moral community:\n{{quote|Utilitarian ethics makes all of us members of the same moral community. A person displaying ill will toward others does remain a member of this community, but not with his whole personality. That part of his personality that harbours these hostile antisocial feelings must be excluded from membership, and has no claim for a hearing when it comes to defining our concept of social utility.<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|56}}}}\n\n== More varieties of utilitarianism ==\n\n===Negative utilitarianism===\n{{Main|Negative utilitarianism}}\nIn ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1945), [[Karl Popper]] argued that the principle \"maximize pleasure\" should be replaced by \"minimize pain\". He thought \"it is not only impossible but very dangerous to attempt to maximize the pleasure or the happiness of the people, since such an attempt must lead to totalitarianism.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 2|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415278423|page=339}}</ref> He claimed that:<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 1: The Spell of Plato|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237314|pages=284\u201385}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure...

A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula \"Maximize pleasure\" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale that lets us treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all...}}\n\nThe actual term ''negative utilitarianism'' was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R.

Consequently, Knutsson argues:\n\n{{quote|The world destruction argument is not a reason to reject negative utilitarianism in favour of these other forms of consequentialism, because there are similar arguments against such theories that are at least as persuasive as the world destruction argument is against negative utilitarianism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knutsson|first=Simon|date=2019-08-29|title=The world destruction argument|journal=Inquiry|volume=0|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1080/0020174X.2019.1658631|issn=0020-174X}}</ref></blockquote>}}\n\nFurthermore, Knutsson notes that one could argue that other forms of consequentialism, such as classical utilitarianism, in some cases have less plausible implications than negative utilitarianism, such as in scenarios where classical utilitarianism implies it would be right to kill everyone and replace them in a manner that creates more suffering, but also more well-being such that the sum, on the classical utilitarian calculus, is net positive. Negative utilitarianism, in contrast, would not allow such killing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knutsson|first=Simon|date=2019-08-29|title=The world destruction argument|journal=Inquiry|volume=0|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1080/0020174X.2019.1658631|issn=0020-174X}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome versions of negative utilitarianism, negative ''total'' utilitarianism, tolerate suffering that can be compensated within the same person.<ref>Fricke Fabian (2002), Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus, Kriterion, vol.15, no.1, p. 14</ref><ref>Arrhenius Gustav (2000), Future Generations, A Challenge for Moral Theory, FD-Diss., Uppsala University, Dept. of Philosophy, Uppsala: University Printers, p. 100</ref>\n\nNegative ''preference'' utilitarianism avoids the problem of moral killing with reference to existing preferences that such killing would violate, while it still demands a justification for the creation of new lives.<ref>Fricke Fabian (2002), Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus, Kriterion, vol.15, no.1, pp. 20\u201322</ref> A possible justification is the reduction of the average level of preference-frustration.<ref>{[[Roger Chao|Chao]], \"[http://www.philosophyoflife.org/jpl201204.pdf Negative Average Preference Utilitarianism\"], ''Journal of Philosophy of Life'', 2012; 2(1): 55\u201366</ref>\n\nOthers see negative utilitarianism as a branch within modern hedonistic utilitarianism, which assigns a higher weight to the avoidance of suffering than to the promotion of happiness.<ref>Fricke Fabian(2002), Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus, Kriterion, vol.15, no.1, p. 14</ref> The moral weight of suffering can be increased by using a \"compassionate\" utilitarian metric, so that the result is the same as in [[prioritarianism]].<ref>Broome John (1991), Weighing Goods, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, p. 222</ref>\n\nPessimistic representatives of negative utilitarianism can be found in the environment of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Bruno Contestabile: ''Negative Utilitarianism and Buddhist Intuition''.

Nevertheless, whether they would agree or not, this is what critics of utilitarianism claim is entailed by the theory. A classic version of this criticism was given by [[H. J. McCloskey]] in 1957:<ref name=McCloskey1957/>\n{{quote|Suppose that a sheriff were faced with the choice either of framing a Negro for a rape that had aroused hostility to the Negroes (a particular Negro generally being believed to be guilty but whom the sheriff knows not to be guilty)\u2014and thus preventing serious anti-Negro riots which would probably lead to some loss of life and increased hatred of each other by whites and Negroes\u2014or of hunting for the guilty person and thereby allowing the anti-Negro riots to occur, while doing the best he can to combat them.

He suggests one response might be that the sheriff would not frame the innocent negro because of another rule: \"do not punish an innocent person\". Another response might be that the riots the sheriff is trying to avoid might have positive utility in the long run by drawing attention to questions of race and resources to help address tensions between the communities.\n\nIn a later article, McCloskey says:<ref>McCloskey, H.J. (1963) A Note on Utilitarian Punishment, in Mind, 72, 1963, p. 599</ref>\n{{quote|Surely the utilitarian must admit that whatever the facts of the matter may be, it is logically possible that an 'unjust' system of punishment\u2014e.g. a system involving collective punishments, retroactive laws and punishments, or punishments of parents and relations of the offender\u2014may be more useful than a 'just' system of punishment?}}\n\nAn older form of this argument was presented by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in his book ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. In it, Ivan challenges his brother Alyosha, a utilitarian, to answer his question: <blockquote>Tell me straight out, I call on you\u2014answer me: imagine that you yourself are building the edifice of human destiny with the object of making people happy in the finale, of giving them peace and rest at last, but for that you must inevitably and unavoidably torture just one tiny creature, [one child], and raise your edifice on the foundation of her unrequited tears\u2014would you agree to be the architect on such conditions?. . . And can you admit the idea that the people for whom you are building would agree to accept their happiness on the unjustified blood of a tortured child, and having accepted it, to remain forever happy?<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/the_dostoevsky_dilemma_for_religious_ethics/ | title=The Dostoevsky Dilemma for Religious Ethics &#124; Center for Inquiry| date=2011-02-15}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Predicting consequences ===\nSome argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. [[Daniel Dennett]] describes this as the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] effect.<ref>Dennett, Daniel (1995), ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', Simon & Schuster, p. 498 {{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}}.</ref> Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.\n\nRussell Hardin rejects such arguments. He argues that it is possible to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism (which is \"to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these\") from our ability to correctly apply rational principles that, among other things, \"depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actor's mental equipment.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Russell |title=Morality within the Limits of Reason |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=May 1990 |page=3 |isbn=978-0226316208}}</ref> The fact that the latter is limited and can change doesn't mean that the former has to be rejected. \"If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so that we are able to choose actions that better produce our intended ends, it does not follow that we then must change our ethics. The moral impulse of utilitarianism is constant, but our decisions under it are contingent on our knowledge and scientific understanding.\"<ref name=\"Hardin 1990 4\"/>\n\nFrom the beginning, utilitarianism has recognized that certainty in such matters is unobtainable and both Bentham and Mill said that it was necessary to rely on the ''tendencies'' of actions to bring about consequences. [[G. E. Moore]], writing in 1903, said:<ref>{{cite book |last=Moore |first=G.

Mill said, \"As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.\"<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\"/> Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. \"What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |editor-first=Timothy |editor-last=Chappell |title=The Problem of Moral Demandingness: new philosophical essays |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2011 |page=151 |chapter=Chapter 8: The Demandingness Objection |isbn=9780230219403}}</ref> As Shelly Kagan says, \"Given the parameters of the actual world, there is no question that ...(maximally)... promoting the good would require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity...a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kagan |first=Shelly |title=The Limits of Morality |series=Oxford Ethics Series |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=1991 |page=360 |isbn=978-0198239161}}</ref>\n\nHooker describes two aspects to the problem: act utilitarianism requires ''huge'' sacrifices from those who are relatively better off and also requires sacrifice of your own good even when the aggregate good will be only ''slightly'' increased.<ref name=\"Hooker 2002 152\">{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |title=Ideal Code, Real World: A Rule-Consequentialist Theory of Morality |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=2002 |page=152 |isbn=978-0199256570}}</ref> Another way of highlighting the complaint is to say that in utilitarianism, \"there is no such thing as morally permissible self-sacrifice that goes above and beyond the call of duty.\"<ref name=\"Hooker 2002 152\"/> Mill was quite clear about this, \"A sacrifice which does not increase, or tend to increase, the sum total of happiness, it considers as wasted.\"<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\"/>\n\nOne response to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: \"No doubt we do instinctively prefer to help those who are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what we ought to do, and it is difficult to see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |title=Practical Ethics |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2011 |pages=202\u20133 |isbn=978-0521707688}}</ref>\n\nOthers argue that a moral theory that is so contrary to our deeply held moral convictions must either be rejected or modified.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |editor-first=Timothy |editor-last= Chappell |title=The problem of moral demandingness: new philosophical essays |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2011 |page=148 |chapter=Chapter 8: The Demandingness Objection |isbn=9780230219403}}</ref> There have been various attempts to modify utilitarianism to escape its seemingly over-demanding requirements.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kagan|first= Shelly |title=Does Consequentialism Demand too Much?

Kagan suggests that such a procedure might be justified on the grounds that \"a general requirement to promote the good would lack the motivational underpinning necessary for genuine moral requirements\" and, secondly, that personal independence is necessary for the existence of commitments and close personal relations and that \"the value of such commitments yields a positive reason for preserving within moral theory at least some moral independence for the personal point of view.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kagan|first= Shelly |title=Does Consequentialism Demand too Much?

He suggests that many of the problems arise under the traditional formulation because the conscientious utilitarian ends up having to make up for the failings of others and so contributing more than their fair share.<ref>{{cite book |last=Goodin |first=Robert E. |title=Utilitarianism as a Public Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1995 |page=66 |isbn=978-0521468060}}</ref>\n\nGandjour specifically considers market situations and analyses whether individuals who act in markets may produce a utilitarian optimum.

This means that utilitarianism, if correctly interpreted, will yield a moral code with a standard of acceptable conduct very much below the level of highest moral perfection, leaving plenty of scope for supererogatory actions exceeding this minimum standard.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Harsanyi |first= John C. |title= Can the Maximin Principle Serve as a Basis for Morality?

The concept is also important in [[animal rights]] advocate [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]]'s rejection of utilitarianism, in which he talks of the \"boundary of the individual\", through which neither pain nor pleasure may pass.<ref>Ryder, Richard D. ''Painism: A Modern Morality''. Centaur Press, 2001. pp. 27\u201329</ref> However, a similar objection was noted in 1970 by [[Thomas Nagel]] (who claimed that consequentialism \"treats the desires, needs, satisfactions, and dissatisfactions of distinct persons as if they were the desires, etc., of a mass person\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Nagel |first=Thomas |title=The Possibility of Altruism |publisher=Princeton University Press |edition=New |year=2012 |page=134 |isbn= 978-0691020020}}</ref>), and even earlier by David Gauthier, who wrote that utilitarianism supposes \"that mankind is a super-person, whose greatest satisfaction is the objective of moral action. . . . But this is absurd. Individuals have wants, not mankind; individuals seek satisfaction, not mankind. A person's satisfaction is not part of any greater satisfaction.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Gauthier |first=David |title=Practical Reasoning: The Structure and Foundations of Prudential and Moral Arguments and Their Exemplification in Discourse |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1963 |page=126 |isbn= 978-0198241904}}</ref> Thus, the aggregation of utility becomes futile as both pain and happiness are intrinsic to and inseparable from the consciousness in which they are felt, rendering impossible the task of adding up the various pleasures of multiple individuals.\n\nA response to this criticism is to point out that whilst seeming to resolve some problems it introduces others. Intuitively, there are many cases where people do want to take the numbers involved into account. As Alastair Norcross has said, \"suppose that Homer is faced with the painful choice between saving Barney from a burning building or saving both Moe and Apu from the building...it is clearly better for Homer to save the larger number, precisely because it is a larger number...

He argues that each person can only lose one person's happiness or pleasures. There isn't five times more loss of happiness or pleasure when five die: who would be feeling this happiness or pleasure? \"Each person's potential loss has the same significance to me, only as a loss to that person alone. because, by hypothesis, I have an equal concern for each person involved, I am moved to give each of them an equal chance to be spared his loss\" (p.&nbsp;307).

Mill responded that there had been ample time to calculate the likely effects:<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill2.htm |title=Utilitarianism, Chapter 2 |author=Mill, John Stuart |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n{{quote|...namely, the whole past duration of the human species. During all that time, mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions; on which experience all the prudence, as well as all the morality of life, are dependent...It is a strange notion that the acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission of secondary ones. To inform a traveller respecting the place of his ultimate destination, is not to forbid the use of landmarks and direction-posts on the way. The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal, or that persons going thither should not be advised to take one direction rather than another. Men really ought to leave off talking a kind of nonsense on this subject, which they would neither talk nor listen to on other matters of practical concernment.}}\n\nMore recently, Hardin has made the same point. \"It should embarrass philosophers that they have ever taken this objection seriously. Parallel considerations in other realms are dismissed with eminently good sense.

For example, if we were given the choice between saving two random people or our mother, most would choose to save their mothers. According to utilitarianism, such a natural action is immoral. The first to respond to this was an early utilitarian and friend of [[Jeremy Bentham]] named [[William Godwin]], who held in his work ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' that such personal needs should be disregarded in favour of the greatest good for the greatest number of people. He wrote, <blockquote>Supposing the chambermaid had been my wife, my mother or my benefactor. That would not alter the truth of the proposition. The life of two would still be more valuable than that of the chambermaid; and justice- pure, unadulterated justice- would still have preferred that which was most valuable.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Godwin/pj22.html | title=Godwin, \"Political Justice,\" Book 2, Chap. 2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Criticisms of utilitarian value theory===\n\nUtilitarianism's assertion that well-being is the only thing with intrinsic moral value has been attacked by various critics.\n\n[[Karl Marx]], in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', criticises Bentham's utilitarianism on the grounds that it does not appear to recognise that people have different joys in different socioeconomic contexts:<ref>[[s:Das Kapital/Chapter 24#endnote 50|Das Kapital Volume 1, Chapter 24, endnote 50]]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>With the driest naivete he takes the modern shopkeeper, especially the English shopkeeper, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer normal man, and to his world, is absolutely useful. This yard-measure, then, he applies to past, present, and future. The Christian religion, e.g., is \"useful,\" \"because it forbids in the name of religion the same faults that the penal code condemns in the name of the law.\" Artistic criticism is \"harmful,\" because it disturbs worthy people in their enjoyment of [[Martin Tupper]], etc. With such rubbish has the brave fellow, with his motto, \"nulla dies sine linea [no day without a line]\", piled up mountains of books.</blockquote>\n\n[[Pope John Paul II]], following his [[Personalism|personalist philosophy]], argued that a danger of utilitarianism is that it tends to make persons, just as much as things, the object of use. \"Utilitarianism,\" he wrote, \"is a civilization of production and of use, a civilization of things and not of persons, a civilization in which persons are used in the same way as things are used.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405033300/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html |archivedate=5 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Duty-based criticisms===\n\n[[Roger Scruton]] is a deontologist, and believes that utilitarianism does not give duty the place that it needs inside our ethical judgements.

Scruton wrote, \"Suppose Anna were to reason that it is better to satisfy two healthy young people and frustrate one old one than to satisfy one old person and frustrate two young ones, by a factor of 2.5 to 1: ergo I am leaving.

His explanation that baby farming undermines attitudes of care and concern for the very young, can be applied to babies and the unborn (both 'non-persons' who may be killed, on his view) and contradicts positions that he adopts elsewhere in his work.\n\n== Additional considerations ==\n\n===Average v. total happiness===\n{{Main|Average and total utilitarianism}}\nIn ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', [[Henry Sidgwick]] asked, \"Is it total or average happiness that we seek to make a maximum?\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=xxxvi |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref><ref name=\"Sidgwick 1981 415\">{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=415 |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref> Paley notes that, although he speaks of the happiness of communities, \"the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients, or the pleasure of their perceptions\" and that if extreme cases, such as people held as slaves, are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people.

For example, bringing a moderately happy person into a very happy world would be seen as an immoral act; aside from this, the theory implies that it would be a moral good to eliminate all people whose happiness is below average, as this would raise the average happiness.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=William |title=Contemporary Ethics: Taking Account of Utilitarianism |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=November 1998 |pages=31\u201335 |isbn=978-0631202943}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Shaw suggests that the problem can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people, who need not concern us, and actual future people, who should concern us. He says, \"utilitarianism values the happiness of people, not the production of units of happiness. Accordingly, one has no positive obligation to have children. However, if you have decided to have a child, then you have an obligation to give birth to the happiest child you can.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=William |title=Contemporary Ethics: Taking Account of Utilitarianism |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=November 1998 |page=34 |isbn=978-0631202943}}</ref>\n\n===Motives, intentions, and actions===\nUtilitarianism is typically taken to assess the rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just the consequences of that action. Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from [[intention]] and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain. He adds that, \"from every kind of motive, may proceed actions that are good, others that are bad, and others that are indifferent.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation |series=Dover Philosophical Classics |publisher=Dover Publications |date=January 2009 |page=102 |isbn=978-0486454528}}</ref> Mill makes a similar point<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=John |editor-last=Robson |title=Collected Works, volume 31 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1981 |page=51 |chapter=Autobiography |isbn=978-0-7100-0718-6}}</ref> and explicitly says that \"motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent.

In a footnote printed in the second edition of ''Utilitarianism'', Mill says: \"the morality of the action depends entirely upon the intention\u2014that is, upon what the agent wills to do.\"<ref name=\"Mill 1998 65\"/> Elsewhere, he says, \"Intention, and motive, are two very different things. But it is the intention, that is, the foresight of consequences, which constitutes the moral rightness or wrongness of the act.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=John |editor-last=Robson |title=Collected Works, volume 31 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1981 |pages=252\u201353 |chapter=Comments upon James Mill's Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind |isbn= 978-0-7100-0718-6}} and as quoted by {{cite journal |last1=Ridge |first1=Michael |year=2002 |title=Mill's Intentions and Motives |journal=Utilitas |volume=14 |pages=54\u201370 |doi= 10.1017/S0953820800003393|url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/11822135/Mill_s_Intentions_and_Motives.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe correct interpretation of Mill's footnote is a matter of some debate. The difficulty in interpretation centres around trying to explain why, since it is consequences that matter, intentions should play a role in the assessment of the morality of an action but motives should not. One possibility \"involves supposing that the 'morality' of the act is one thing, probably to do with the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agent, and its rightness or wrongness another.\"<ref name=\"Mill's Puzzling Footnote\">{{cite journal |last1=Dancy |first1=Jonathan |year=2000 |title=Mill's Puzzling Footnote |journal=Utilitas |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=219\u201322 |doi= 10.1017/S095382080000279X}}</ref> [[Jonathan Dancy]] rejects this interpretation on the grounds that Mill is explicitly making intention relevant to an assessment of the act not to an assessment of the agent.\n\nAn interpretation given by [[Roger Crisp]] draws on a definition given by Mill in ''[[A System of Logic]]'', where he says that an \"intention to produce the effect, is one thing; the effect produced in consequence of the intention, is another thing; the two together constitute the action.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |title=A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive |series=Classic Reprint |publisher=Forgotten Books |date=February 2011 |page=51 |isbn=978-1440090820}}</ref> Accordingly, whilst two actions may outwardly appear to be the same they will be different actions if there is a different intention. Dancy notes that this does not explain why intentions count but motives do not.\n\nA third interpretation is that an action might be considered a complex action consisting of several stages and it is the intention that determines which of these stages are to be considered part of the action. Although this is the interpretation favoured by Dancy, he recognizes that this might not have been Mill's own view, for Mill \"would not even allow that 'p & q' expresses a complex proposition. He wrote in his ''System of Logic'' I iv. 3, of 'Caesar is dead and Brutus is alive', that 'we might as well call a street a complex house, as these two propositions a complex proposition'.\"<ref name=\"Mill's Puzzling Footnote\"/>\n\nFinally, whilst motives may not play a role in determining the morality of an action, this does not preclude utilitarians from fostering particular motives if doing so will increase overall happiness.\n\n== Humans alone, or other sentient beings? ==\n\n=== Nonhuman animals ===\n{{further|Speciesism|Animal welfare}}\n[[File:Peter Singer MIT Veritas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peter Singer]]]]\nIn ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' Bentham wrote \"the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\"<ref name=\"BenthamIntroductiontothePrinciples\">An Introduction to the Principals of Morals and Legislation, Jeremy Bentham, 1789 (\"printed\" in 1780, \"first published\" in 1789, \"corrected by the Author\" in 1823.) See Chapter I: Of the Principle of Utility.  For Bentham on animals, see Ch. XVII Note 122.</ref> Mill's distinction between [[Utilitarianism#Higher and lower pleasures|higher and lower pleasures]] might suggest that he gave more status to humans. However, in his essay \"Whewell on Moral Philosophy\", Mill defends Bentham's position, calling it a 'noble anticipation', and writing: \"Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer 'immoral', let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mill |first1=J. S. |title=Whewell on Moral Philosophy |url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/mill01.pdf | journal=Collected Works |volume=10 | pages = 185\u201387 }}</ref>\n\n[[Henry Sidgwick]] also considers the implications of utilitarianism for nonhuman animals. He writes: \"We have next to consider who the 'all' are, whose happiness is to be taken into account. Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct? or are we to confine our view to human happiness? The former view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill, and (I believe) by the Utilitarian school generally: and is obviously most in accordance with the universality that is characteristic of their principle ... it seems arbitrary and unreasonable to exclude from the end, as so conceived, any pleasure of any sentient being.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=414 |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref>\n\nAmong contemporary utilitarian philosophers, Peter Singer is especially known for arguing that the well-being of all [[sentience|sentient]] beings ought to be given [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]]. Singer suggests that rights are conferred according to the level of a creature's self-awareness, regardless of their species. He adds that humans tend to be [[speciesism|speciesist]] (discriminatory against non-humans) in ethical matters, and argues that, on utilitarianism, speciesism cannot be justified as there is no rational distinction that can be made between the suffering of humans and the suffering of nonhuman animals; all suffering ought to be reduced. Singer writes: \"The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is the same in each case ... Most human beings are speciesists.\"<ref>Peter Singer, ''Animal Liberation'', Chapter I, pp. 7\u20138, 2nd edition, 1990.</ref>\n\nIn his 1990 edition of ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'', Peter Singer said that he no longer ate oysters and mussels, because although the creatures might not suffer, there was a possibility they may and it was easy to avoid eating them in any case.<ref>[http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/warn/singer_fish.htm Animal Liberation, Second Edition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205080909/http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/warn/singer_fish.htm |date=5 December 2010 }}, Singer, Peter, 1975, 1990, excerpt, pp. 171\u201374, main passage on oysters, mussels, etc. p. 174 (last paragraph of this excerpt). And in a footnote in the actual book, Singer writes \"My change of mind about mollusks stems from conversations with R.I. Sikora.\"</ref>\n\nThis view still might be contrasted with [[deep ecology]], which holds that an intrinsic value is attached to all forms of life and nature, whether currently assumed to be sentient or not. According to utilitarianism, the forms of life that are unable to experience anything akin to either enjoyment or discomfort are denied moral status, because it is impossible to increase the happiness or reduce the suffering of something that cannot feel happiness or suffer. Singer writes:\n<blockquote>The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering\u2014in so far as rough comparisons can be made\u2014of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.</blockquote>\n\nThus, the moral value of one-celled organisms, as well as some multi-cellular organisms, and natural entities like a river, is only in the benefit they provide to sentient beings. Similarly, utilitarianism places no direct intrinsic value on [[biodiversity]], although the benefits that biodiversity bring to sentient beings may mean that, on utilitarianism, biodiversity ought to be maintained in general.\n\nIn John Stuart Mill's essay \"On Nature\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Mill's \"On Nature\"|url = http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/users/philosophy/texts/mill_on.htm|website = www.lancaster.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-08-09|date = 1904}}</ref> he argues that the [[wild animal suffering|welfare of wild animals]] is to be considered when making utilitarian judgments. [[Tyler Cowen]] argues that, if individual animals are carriers of utility, then we should consider limiting the predatory activity of carnivores relative to their victims: \"At the very least, we should limit current subsidies to nature's carnivores.\"<ref name=\"Cowen2003\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowen | first1 = T. | title = Policing Nature | editor1-last = c.

The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is the best way to make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Optimal Taxation of Height: A Case Study of Utilitarian Income Redistribution|author1=N.

Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking.<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism Peter Singer: The why and how of effective altruism | Talk Video].

At various times, the [[cryptomonad]]s, [[ebriid]]s, and [[ellobiopsid]]s have been included here, but only the last are now considered close relatives. Dinoflagellates have a known ability to transform from noncyst to cyst-forming strategies, which makes recreating their evolutionary history extremely difficult.\n\n==Morphology==\n\n[[File:Britannica Dinoflagellata 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Longitudinal (l.f.) and transverse flagellum (t.f.); sack pusule (s.p.); nucleus (n).]]\n[[File:Thorungar1.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Dinoflagellate anatomy]]\nDinoflagellates are unicellular and possess two dissimilar flagella arising from the ventral cell side (dinokont flagellation).

The axonemal edge has simple hairs that can be of varying lengths. The flagellar movement produces forward propulsion and also a turning force. The longitudinal flagellum is relatively conventional in appearance, with few or no hairs. It beats with only one or two periods to its wave. The flagella lie in surface grooves: the transverse one in the cingulum and the longitudinal one in the sulcus, although its distal portion projects freely behind the cell. In dinoflagellate species with desmokont flagellation (e.g., ''Prorocentrum''), the two flagella are differentiated as in dinokonts, but they are not associated with grooves.\n\nDinoflagellates have a complex cell covering called an '''amphiesma''' or cortex, composed of a series of membranes, flattened [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called alveolae (= amphiesmal vesicles) and related structures.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Morrill LC, Loeblich AR | title = Ultrastructure of the dinoflagellate amphiesma | volume = 82 | pages = 151\u201380 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6684652 | doi = 10.1016/s0074-7696(08)60825-6 | isbn = 9780123644824 | series = International Review of Cytology }}</ref><ref name=\"Netzel, H. 1984\">{{cite book |first=Harald |last=Netzel |first2=Georg |last2=D\u00fcrr | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ch. 3: Dinoflagellate cell cortex |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCcgFximE8oC&pg=PA43 |pages=43\u2013106 |isbn=9780323138130 |date=2012-12-02 }} In {{harvnb|Spector|1984}}</ref> In armoured dinoflagellates, these support overlapping [[cellulose]] plates to create a sort of armor called the '''theca or lorica''', as opposed to athecate dinoflagellates.

One way a lack of diversity may occur in a bloom is through a reduction in predation and a decreased competition. The first may be achieved by having predators reject the dinoflagellate, by, for example, decreasing the amount of food it can eat. This additionally helps prevent a future increase in predation pressure by cause predators that reject it to lack the energy to breed.

Under such circumstances, they can produce toxins (generally called [[dinotoxin]]s) in quantities capable of killing fish and accumulating in filter feeders such as [[shellfish]], which in turn may be passed on to people who eat them.  This phenomenon is called a [[red tide]], from the color the bloom imparts to the water.  Some colorless dinoflagellates may also form toxic blooms, such as ''[[Pfiesteria]]''.  Some dinoflagellate blooms are not dangerous.  Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] dinoflagellates, which emit short flashes of light when disturbed.\n[[File:Algal bloom(akasio) by Noctiluca in Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|Algal bloom (''akasio'') by ''Noctiluca'' spp. in Nagasaki]]\nThe same red tide mentioned above is more specifically produced when dinoflagellates are able to reproduce rapidly and copiously on account of the abundant nutrients in the water.

The axonemal edge has simple hairs that can be of varying lengths. The flagellar movement produces forward propulsion and also a turning force. The longitudinal flagellum is relatively conventional in appearance, with few or no hairs. It beats with only one or two periods to its wave. The flagella lie in surface grooves: the transverse one in the cingulum and the longitudinal one in the sulcus, although its distal portion projects freely behind the cell. In dinoflagellate species with desmokont flagellation (e.g., ''Prorocentrum''), the two flagella are differentiated as in dinokonts, but they are not associated with grooves.\n\nDinoflagellates have a complex cell covering called an '''amphiesma''' or cortex, composed of a series of membranes, flattened [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called alveolae (= amphiesmal vesicles) and related structures.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Morrill LC, Loeblich AR | title = Ultrastructure of the dinoflagellate amphiesma | volume = 82 | pages = 151\u201380 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6684652 | doi = 10.1016/s0074-7696(08)60825-6 | isbn = 9780123644824 | series = International Review of Cytology }}</ref><ref name=\"Netzel, H. 1984\">{{cite book |first=Harald |last=Netzel |first2=Georg |last2=D\u00fcrr | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ch. 3: Dinoflagellate cell cortex |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCcgFximE8oC&pg=PA43 |pages=43\u2013106 |isbn=9780323138130 |date=2012-12-02 }} In {{harvnb|Spector|1984}}</ref> In armoured dinoflagellates, these support overlapping [[cellulose]] plates to create a sort of armor called the '''theca or lorica''', as opposed to athecate dinoflagellates.

However, endosymbiontic [[Zooxanthellae]] inhabit a great number of other invertebrates and protists, for example many [[sea anemones]], [[jellyfish]], [[nudibranchs]], the giant clam ''[[Tridacna]]'', and several species of [[radiolarians]] and [[foraminiferans]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Trench |first=R.K. |chapter=Diversity of symbiotic dinoflagellates and the evolution of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses |editor-last=Lessios |editor-first=H.A. |editor2-first=I.G. |editor2-last=MacIntyre |title=Proceedings of the eighth International Coral Reef Symposium, Panama, June 24\u201329, 1996 |publisher=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute |location=Balboa, Panama |year=1997 |oclc=833272061 |pages=1275\u201386 |volume=2 | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> Many extant dinoflagellates are [[parasites]] (here defined as organisms that eat their prey from the inside, i.e. [[endoparasites]], or that remain attached to their prey for longer periods of time, i.e. ectoparasites). They can parasitize animal or protist hosts. ''Protoodinium, Crepidoodinium, Piscinoodinium'', and ''Blastodinium'' retain their plastids while feeding on their zooplanktonic or fish hosts. In most parasitic dinoflagellates, the infective stage resembles a typical motile dinoflagellate cell.\n\n===Nutritional strategies===\n\nThree nutritional strategies are seen in dinoflagellates: [[phototroph]]y, [[mixotroph]]y, and [[heterotroph]]y. Phototrophs can be [[photoautotroph]]s or [[Auxotrophy|auxotrophs]]. [[Mixotrophic dinoflagellates]] are photosynthetically active, but are also heterotrophic. Facultative mixotrophs, in which autotrophy or heterotrophy is sufficient for nutrition, are classified as amphitrophic. If both forms are required, the organisms are mixotrophic ''sensu stricto''. Some free-living dinoflagellates do not have chloroplasts, but host a phototrophic endosymbiont. A few dinoflagellates may use alien chloroplasts (cleptochloroplasts), obtained from food ([[kleptoplasty]]). Some dinoflagellates may feed on other organisms as predators or parasites.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnepf E, Elbr\u00e4chter M | title = Nutritional strategies in dinoflagellates: A review with emphasis on cell biological aspects | journal = European Journal of Protistology | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 3\u201324 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 23194978 | doi = 10.1016/S0932-4739(11)80315-9 }}</ref>\n\nFood inclusions contain bacteria, bluegreen algae, small dinoflagellates, diatoms, ciliates, and other dinoflagellates.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kofoid CA, Swezy O |title=The free-living unarmoured dinoflagellata |journal=Mere.

One way a lack of diversity may occur in a bloom is through a reduction in predation and a decreased competition. The first may be achieved by having predators reject the dinoflagellate, by, for example, decreasing the amount of food it can eat. This additionally helps prevent a future increase in predation pressure by cause predators that reject it to lack the energy to breed. A species can then inhibit the growth of its competitors, thus achieving dominance.<ref name=\"HuntleySykes1986\">{{cite journal| vauthors = Huntley M, Sykes P, Rohan S, Marin V |title=Chemically-mediated rejection of dinoflagellate prey by the copepods ''Calanus pacificus'' and ''Paracalanus parvus'': mechanism, occurrence and significance |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |year=1986 |volume=28 |pages=105\u2013120|doi=10.3354/meps028105 |bibcode=1986MEPS...28..105H }}</ref>\n\n====Harmful algal blooms====\n\nDinoflagellates sometimes bloom in concentrations of more than a million cells per millilitre.  Under such circumstances, they can produce toxins (generally called [[dinotoxin]]s) in quantities capable of killing fish and accumulating in filter feeders such as [[shellfish]], which in turn may be passed on to people who eat them.  This phenomenon is called a [[red tide]], from the color the bloom imparts to the water.  Some colorless dinoflagellates may also form toxic blooms, such as ''[[Pfiesteria]]''.  Some dinoflagellate blooms are not dangerous.  Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] dinoflagellates, which emit short flashes of light when disturbed.\n[[File:Algal bloom(akasio) by Noctiluca in Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|Algal bloom (''akasio'') by ''Noctiluca'' spp. in Nagasaki]]\nThe same red tide mentioned above is more specifically produced when dinoflagellates are able to reproduce rapidly and copiously on account of the abundant nutrients in the water.
