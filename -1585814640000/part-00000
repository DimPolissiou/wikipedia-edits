The tests are the culmination of year-long [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement (AP)]] courses.  AP exams (with few exceptions<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.org CollegeBoard]</ref>) have a multiple-choice section and a free-response section.\n\n[[AP Studio Art]] requires students to submit a [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] for review. [[AP Computer Science Principles]] requires students to complete the Create and Explore tasks, which are part of the AP grade for the class.\n[[File:AP Exams Taken in 2013.svg|300px|thumb|AP exams were taken by subject in 2013.]]\n\n==History==\nThe AP exams grew out of programs initiated in 1951. Part of the rationale for advanced placement given in 1952 was that \"advanced standing at the normal college-entering age after high school graduation is more desirable, for many reasons, than acceleration of able students out of high school at age 15\u00bd or 16...\".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Eric|last=Rothschild|journal=The History Teacher|title=Four Decades of the Advanced Placement Program|volume=32|issue=2|date=February 1999|pages=175\u2013206|doi=10.2307/494439|language=en|jstor=494439}}</ref> The first Advanced Placement exams were administered in 1954 by the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) to students limited to 27 schools participating at that time. In 1955, the College Board assumed leadership of the program and testing, deciding on curricula and pedagogical approaches, while retaining ETS to design and score the tests. The exams were given nationally for the first time in May, 1956, and students could take whichever tests they wanted for a single $10 fee. The 2020 exams were taken as 45 minute online at home exams due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic\n\n==AP Exam Format==\nThe exams themselves do not grade the students' mastery of the course material in a traditional sense. Rather, the students themselves set the grading rubrics and the scale for the \"AP Grades\" of each exam.\n\nThe AP exams are graded each summer at a week-long \"grading camp.\" Both high school AP teachers and university professors are invited to grade the exams at a predetermined location. When the AP Reading is over for a particular exam, the free response scores are combined with the results of computer-scored multiple-choice questions based upon a previously announced weighting.\n\nThe Chief Reader (a college or university faculty member selected by the [[Educational Testing Service]] and [[The College Board]]) then meets with members of ETS and sets the cutoff scores for each AP Grade. The Chief Reader's decision is based upon what percentage of students earned each AP Grade over the previous three years, how students did on multiple-choice questions that are used on the test from year to year, how he or she viewed the overall quality of the answers to the free response questions, how university students who took the exam as PART A experimental studies did, and how students performed on different parts of the exam.\n\nNo one outside of ETS is allowed to find out a student's raw score on an AP Exam and the cutoff scores for a particular exam are only released to the public if that particular exam is released in total (this happens on a staggered schedule and occurs approximately once every five to seven years for each exam). Usually, a 70 to 75 percent out of 100 translates to a 5. However, there are some exams that are exceptions to this rule of thumb. The AP Grades that are reported to students, high schools, colleges, and universities in July are on AP's five-point scale:\n\n*'''5''': Extremely well qualified\n*'''4''': Very well qualified\n*'''3''': Qualified\n*'''2''': Possibly qualified\n*'''1''': No recommendation\n\n===Spring 2020 Exam Format Changes===\nOn March 20th, [[College Board]] announced<ref>https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/coronavirus-update</ref> changes to the spring 2020 exams due to the impact of [[COVID-19]] on school closings. The exams will be 45 minutes long with an online testing version for at-home exams. Any student already registered for an exam can choose to cancel at no charge. In the announcement, College Board also said that more information regarding the format of this year's AP exams will be announced by April 3rd.\n\nAdditionally, College Board will be providing a free distance learning curriculum<ref>https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/coronavirus-updates#free-ap-classes</ref> by [[livestreaming]] AP review lessons on [[YouTube]].

The tests are the culmination of year-long [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement (AP)]] courses.  AP exams (with few exceptions<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.org CollegeBoard]</ref>) have a multiple-choice section and a free-response section.\n\n[[AP Studio Art]] requires students to submit a [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] for review. [[AP Computer Science Principles]] requires students to complete the Create and Explore tasks, which are part of the AP grade for the class.\n[[File:AP Exams Taken in 2013.svg|300px|thumb|AP exams were taken by subject in 2013.]]\n\n==History==\nThe AP exams grew out of programs initiated in 1951. Part of the rationale for advanced placement given in 1952 was that \"advanced standing at the normal college-entering age after high school graduation is more desirable, for many reasons, than acceleration of able students out of high school at age 15\u00bd or 16...\".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Eric|last=Rothschild|journal=The History Teacher|title=Four Decades of the Advanced Placement Program|volume=32|issue=2|date=February 1999|pages=175\u2013206|doi=10.2307/494439|language=en|jstor=494439}}</ref> The first Advanced Placement exams were administered in 1954 by the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) to students limited to 27 schools participating at that time. In 1955, the College Board assumed leadership of the program and testing, deciding on curricula and pedagogical approaches, while retaining ETS to design and score the tests. The exams were given nationally for the first time in May, 1956, and students could take whichever tests they wanted for a single $10 fee. The 2020 exams were taken as 45 minute online at home exams due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic\n\n==AP Exam Format==\nThe exams themselves do not grade the students' mastery of the course material in a traditional sense. Rather, the students themselves set the grading rubrics and the scale for the \"AP Grades\" of each exam.\n\nThe AP exams are graded each summer at a week-long \"grading camp.\" Both high school AP teachers and university professors are invited to grade the exams at a predetermined location. When the AP Reading is over for a particular exam, the free response scores are combined with the results of computer-scored multiple-choice questions based upon a previously announced weighting.\n\nThe Chief Reader (a college or university faculty member selected by the [[Educational Testing Service]] and [[The College Board]]) then meets with members of ETS and sets the cutoff scores for each AP Grade. The Chief Reader's decision is based upon what percentage of students earned each AP Grade over the previous three years, how students did on multiple-choice questions that are used on the test from year to year, how he or she viewed the overall quality of the answers to the free response questions, how university students who took the exam as PART A experimental studies did, and how students performed on different parts of the exam.\n\nNo one outside of ETS is allowed to find out a student's raw score on an AP Exam and the cutoff scores for a particular exam are only released to the public if that particular exam is released in total (this happens on a staggered schedule and occurs approximately once every five to seven years for each exam). Usually, a 70 to 75 percent out of 100 translates to a 5. However, there are some exams that are exceptions to this rule of thumb. The AP Grades that are reported to students, high schools, colleges, and universities in July are on AP's five-point scale:\n\n*'''5''': Extremely well qualified\n*'''4''': Very well qualified\n*'''3''': Qualified\n*'''2''': Possibly qualified\n*'''1''': No recommendation\n\n===Spring 2020 Exam Format Changes===\nOn March 20th, [[College Board]] announced<ref>https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/coronavirus-update</ref> changes to the spring 2020 exams due to the impact of [[COVID-19]] on school closings.
