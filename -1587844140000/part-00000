Hero of the battle of \u201cCiudad Bol\u00edvar\u201d, which seals the pacification of Venezuela in 1903. Later, as head of a failed conspiracy against the primitive and long time dictator Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez he was imprisoned for 14 years in 1913, before attempting a brave naval invasion in 1929 to overthrow G\u00f3mez\u2019s sanguinary regime and [[Juan Bautista P\u00e9rez|his Presidential front man]], in which he fought and died rising the flag of freedom. Father of Carlos Delgado-Chalbaud, the best educated and most cultured president of Venezuelan modernity.\n\n==Background and personal life==\nHe was born to General Miguel Delgado Brice\u00f1o (son of Santos Rom\u00e1n Delgado Abreu and Abigail Brice\u00f1o Gabald\u00f3n, whose grandparent was an Andalusian colonist) and Dolores Chalbaud Calder\u00f3n (the daughter of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Chalbaud, a French immigrant, and Dolores Calder\u00f3n Carrillo). He was the father of [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]]<ref name=VT>{{in lang|es}} venezuelatuya.com, [http://www.venezuelatuya.com/biografias/roman_delgado_chalbaud.htm Rom\u00e1n Delgado Chalbaud]</ref> (born 1909).\n\n==Career==\nDelgado entered the Venezuelan Naval Academy at [[Puerto Cabello]], and by 1901 had obtained the rank of Captain. He was Commander in Chief of the Venezuelan Navy during the ''Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora'' led by [[:es:Manuel Antonio Matos|Manuel Antonio Matos]] against the government of [[Cipriano Castro]]. In 1906-7 he was involved with a group called \"La Conjura\" opposed to [[Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez]], but nonetheless supported G\u00f3mez' 1908 coup against Castro.\n\nThe following year Delgado founded the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda An\u00f3nima de Navegaci\u00f3n Fluvial y Costanera'', which controlled the entire maritime and river transport of Venezuela, with G\u00f3mez holding some shares. Delgado became sufficiently identified with ''gomecismo'' to be considered a possible successor to G\u00f3mez. In 1911 Delgado visited Europe to try to obtain financial support for a variety of development schemes in Venezuela. With some sectors of public opinion opposing the deals, G\u00f3mez, who had appeared to support them, opposed them. In 1913 he initiated a conspiracy against G\u00f3mez. This failed, and he was imprisoned for 14 years.<ref name=VT/>\n\n==1929 invasion==\nFollowing his release, Delgado moved to Paris, a center of Venezuelan exile organisation against G\u00f3mez, and helped organise a government-in-exile, the ''Junta de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'', of which [[Santos Dominici]] was President and [[Alberto Smith]] Vice President. On the morning of 11 August 1929 Delgado led the steamship ''Falke'' (renamed ''General Anzo\u00e1tegui'' for the occasion) into Cuman\u00e1. Met by Venezuelan armed forces, the expeditionary force of 250-300 men soon ran into problems.

Hero of the battle of \u201cCiudad Bol\u00edvar\u201d, which seals the pacification of Venezuela in 1903. Later, as head of a failed conspiracy against the primitive and long time dictator Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez he was imprisoned for 14 years in 1913, before attempting a brave naval invasion in 1929 to overthrow G\u00f3mez\u2019s sanguinary regime and [[Juan Bautista P\u00e9rez|his Presidential front man]], in which he fought and died rising the flag of freedom. Father of Carlos Delgado-Chalbaud, the best educated and most cultured president of Venezuelan modernity.\n\n==Background and personal life==\nHe was born to General Miguel Delgado Brice\u00f1o (son of Santos Rom\u00e1n Delgado Abreu and Abigail Brice\u00f1o Gabald\u00f3n, whose grandparent was an Andalusian colonist) and Dolores Chalbaud Calder\u00f3n (the daughter of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Chalbaud, a French immigrant, and Dolores Calder\u00f3n Carrillo). He was the father of [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]]<ref name=VT>{{in lang|es}} venezuelatuya.com, [http://www.venezuelatuya.com/biografias/roman_delgado_chalbaud.htm Rom\u00e1n Delgado Chalbaud]</ref> (born 1909).\n\n==Career==\nDelgado entered the Venezuelan Naval Academy at [[Puerto Cabello]], and by 1901 had obtained the rank of Captain. He was Commander in Chief of the Venezuelan Navy during the ''Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora'' led by [[:es:Manuel Antonio Matos|Manuel Antonio Matos]] against the government of [[Cipriano Castro]]. In 1906-7 he was involved with a group called \"La Conjura\" opposed to [[Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez]], but nonetheless supported G\u00f3mez' 1908 coup against Castro.\n\nThe following year Delgado founded the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda An\u00f3nima de Navegaci\u00f3n Fluvial y Costanera'', which controlled the entire maritime and river transport of Venezuela, with G\u00f3mez holding some shares. Delgado became sufficiently identified with ''gomecismo'' to be considered a possible successor to G\u00f3mez. In 1911 Delgado visited Europe to try to obtain financial support for a variety of development schemes in Venezuela. With some sectors of public opinion opposing the deals, G\u00f3mez, who had appeared to support them, opposed them. In 1913 he initiated a conspiracy against G\u00f3mez. This failed, and he was imprisoned for 14 years.<ref name=VT/>\n\n==1929 invasion==\nFollowing his release, Delgado moved to Paris, a center of Venezuelan exile organisation against G\u00f3mez, and helped organise a government-in-exile, the ''Junta de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'', of which [[Santos Dominici]] was President and [[Alberto Smith]] Vice President. On the morning of 11 August 1929 Delgado led the steamship ''Falke'' (renamed ''General Anzo\u00e1tegui'' for the occasion) into Cuman\u00e1.
