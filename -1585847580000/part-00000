He was the son of [[Isaac Komnenos (d. 1152)|Isaac Komnenos]] and the grandson of the emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]].\n{{TOClimit|2}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nAndronikos Komnenos was born around 1118. He was handsome and eloquent, active, hardy, courageous, a great general and an able politician, but also [[licentious]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} His early years were spent alternately in pleasure and in military service.\n\nIn 1141 he was taken captive by the [[Seljuq Turks]] and remained in their hands for a year. On being [[Ransom|ransomed]], he went to [[Constantinople]], where he was held at the court of his [[first cousin]], the Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus|Manuel I Komnenos]], to whom he was a great favourite. Here the charms of his niece, Eudoxia, attracted him and she became his mistress.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} In 1152, accompanied by Eudoxia, he set out for an important command in [[Cilicia]]. [[Battle of Mamistra|Failing]] in his principal enterprise, an attack upon [[Mopsuestia]], he returned but was again appointed to the command of a province.  This second post he seems also to have left after a short interval, for he appeared again in Constantinople and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of Eudoxia.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\n===Exile===\nAbout 1153, a conspiracy against the Emperor in which Andronikos participated was discovered, and he was imprisoned. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, he escaped in 1165.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} After passing through many dangers, including captivity in [[Vlach]] territory,{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=131}} he reached [[Kiev]], where his cousin [[Yaroslav Osmomysl]] of [[Principality of Halych|Galicia]] held court. While under the protection of Yaroslav, Andronikos formed an alliance with the Emperor Manuel I, and with a Galician army he joined Manuel in the invasion of [[Hungary]], assisting at the siege of [[Zemun|Semlin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} The campaign was successful, and Andronikos returned to Constantinople with Manuel I in 1168; a year later, however, Andronikos refused to take the oath of allegiance to the future king [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]], whom Manuel desired to become his successor. Andronikos was removed from court but received the province of [[Cilicia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\nStill under the displeasure of the Emperor, Andronikos fled to the court of [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]]. While residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the Prince, [[Philippa of Antioch|Philippa]], sister of the Empress [[Maria of Antioch|Maria]]. The Emperor was again angered by this dishonour, and Andronikos was compelled to flee.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} He took refuge with King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], whose favour he gained, and who invested him with the [[Principality of Galilee|Lordship of Beirut]]. In Jerusalem he saw [[Theodora Komnene, Queen of Jerusalem|Theodora Komnene]], the beautiful widow of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] and niece of the Emperor Manuel. Although Andronikos was at that time fifty-six years old, age had not diminished his charms, and Theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} To avoid the vengeance of the Emperor, she fled with Andronikos to the court of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], the [[Rulers of Damascus|Sultan of Damascus]]. Feeling unsafe there, they continued their perilous journey through the [[Caucasus]] and [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} They were well received by King [[George III of Georgia]], whose anonymous sister had probably been the first wife of Andronikos.\n\nAndronikos was granted estates in [[Kakhetia]], in the east of Georgia. In 1173 or 1174, he accompanied the Georgian army on an expedition to [[Shirvan]] up to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] shores, where George recaptured the fortress of [[Shabaran]] from the invaders from [[Derbent|Darband]] for his cousin, the [[Shirvanshah]] [[Akhsitan I ibn Minuchihr III|Akhsitan I]].{{sfn|Minorsky|1945|pp=557\u2013558}} Finally, Andronikos and Theodora settled in the ancestral lands of the Komnenoi at [[Oinaion]], on the shores of the [[Black Sea]], between [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]].<ref>Speros Vryonis Jr., ''The Decline of medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor: and the process of Islamization from the eleventh through the fifteenth century'', (Berkeley: University of California, 1971), p. 127</ref> While Andronikos was on one of his incursions into Trebizond, his castle was surprised by the governor of that province, and Theodora and her two children were captured and sent to Constantinople. To obtain their release Andronikos in early 1180 made abject submission to the Emperor and, appearing in chains before him, besought pardon. This he obtained, and he was allowed to retire with Theodora into banishment at Oinaion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\n===Emperor===\nIn 1180 the Emperor Manuel died and was succeeded by his ten-year-old son [[Alexius II Comnenus|Alexios II]], who was under the guardianship of his mother, Empress Maria.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} Her Latin origins and culture led to creeping resentment from her Greek subjects. They had felt insulted by the Western tastes of Manuel, and being ruled by his Western wife built tensions to an explosion of rioting that almost became a full civil war.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This gave Andronikos the opportunity to seize the crown for himself, leaving his retirement in 1182 and marching to Constantinople with an army that (according to non-Byzantine sources) included Muslim contingents.<ref>\n* [[Ibn Jubayr]] p. 355 Broadhurst (Turks and Arabs);{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n* [[William of Tyre]], ''Historia Transmarina'' 22.11 (''innumeras Barbararum nationum secum trahens copias'');{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n* [[Walter Map]], ''[[De Nugis Curialium]]'' 2.18 (Turks).{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n</ref> The defection of the commander of the Byzantine navy, ''[[megas doux]]'' [[Andronikos Kontostephanos]], and the general Andronikos Angelos, played a key role in allowing the rebellious forces to enter Constantinople.{{sfn|Angold|1997|p=267}}\n\nThe arrival of Andronikos Komnenos was soon followed by a [[Massacre of the Latins|massacre of the city's Latin inhabitants]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} who virtually controlled its economy, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Westerners. He was believed to have arranged the poisoning of Alexios II's elder sister [[Maria Komnene (daughter of Manuel I)|Maria the Porphyrogenita]] and her husband [[Renier of Montferrat]], although Maria herself had encouraged him to intervene; the poisoner was said to be the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Pterygeonites.{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the poisoning and the details}} Soon afterwards Andronikos had the Empress Maria imprisoned and then killed \u2014 forcing a signature from the child Emperor Alexios to put his mother to death \u2014 by Pterygeonites and the ''[[hetaireiarches]]'' Constantine Tripsychos.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Alexios II was compelled to acknowledge Andronikos as colleague in the empire in front of the crowd on the terrace of the [[Arslan Hane, Istanbul|Church of Christ of the Chalk\u00e8]] and was then quickly put to death in turn; the killing was carried out by Tripsychos, Theodore Dadibrenos, and [[Stephen Hagiochristophorites]].{{sfn|Choniates|1984|pp=260\u2013274}}\n\nIn 1183, sixty-five year old Andronikos married twelve-year-old [[Agnes of France, Empress consort of the Eastern Roman Empire|Agnes of France]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} daughter of King [[Louis VII of France]] and his third wife [[Ad\u00e8le of Champagne]] \u2014 Agnes had been betrothed to Alexios II.<ref>Jonathan Harris, ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', 2nd ed.

He resolved to suppress many abuses but above all things to check [[feudalism]] and limit the power of the nobles, who were rivals for his throne. He attempted to reform the decaying political system by forbidding the sale of offices, punishing corrupt officials (often brutally) but above all, he moved to check the power of the feudal landowners. The people, who felt the severity of his laws, at the same time acknowledged their justice and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} who had grown corrupt under the safety and opulence of Manuel I's rule.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Andronikos became increasingly paranoid and violent, however, and the Empire descended into a terror state.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. In September 1185, he ordered the execution of all prisoners, exiles, and their families for collusion with the invaders. The aristocrats, in turn, were infuriated against him,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} and there were several revolts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe stories of chaos led to an invasion by King [[William II of Sicily|William]] of the Norman Sicilians.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} William landed in [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] with a strong force of 200 ships and 80,000 men, including 5,000 knights,{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the numbers}} and marched as far as [[Thessalonica]], which he [[Sack of Thessalonica (1185)|took and pillaged]] ruthlessly (7,000 Greeks died).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the numbers and ethnicity}} Andronikos hastily assembled five different armies to stop the Sicilian army from reaching Constantinople, but his forces failed to stand and retreated to the outlying hills. Andronikos also assembled a fleet of 100 ships to stop the Norman fleet from entering the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The invaders were finally driven out in 1186 by his successor, [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac Angelos]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for everything since the last Chisholm 1911 as none of these details are in EB1911 so they need a citation from another source}}\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Death of andronic I.png|thumb|250px|A medieval depiction of the death of Andronikos. Original in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, France.]]\n\nAndronikos seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy, and his plans were nearly successful. But on 11 September 1185, during his absence from the capital{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} Stephen Hagiochristophorites, his lieutenant, moved to arrest [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac Angelos]], whose loyalty was suspect.{{sfn|Harris|2003|p=136}} Angelos killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of [[Hagia Sophia]]. He appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose that spread rapidly over the whole city.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\nWhen Andronikos arrived he found that Isaac had been proclaimed emperor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} The deposed emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife Agnes and his mistress, but they were captured (though some claim that Andronikos survived and managed to escape to the self-proclaimed kingdom of [[Cyprus]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} Angelos handed him over to the city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} remaining for that period tied to a post and beaten. His right hand was cut off, his teeth and hair were pulled out, one of his eyes was gouged out, and, among many other sufferings, boiling water was thrown in his face, punishment probably associated with his handsomeness and life of licentiousness.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} At last he was led to the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] and hung by his feet between two pillars. Two Latin soldiers competed as to whose sword would penetrate his body more deeply, and he was, according to the representation of his death, torn apart.{{sfn|Choniates|1984|p=193}} He died on 12 September 1185.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} At the news of the Emperor's death, his son and co-emperor, John, was murdered by his own troops in [[Thrace]].{{sfn|Choniates|1984|p=193}}\nAndronikos I was the last of the [[Comnenus|Komnenoi]] to rule Constantinople, although his grandsons [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios]] and [[David Komnenos|David]] founded the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in 1204.

He was the son of [[Isaac Komnenos (d. 1152)|Isaac Komnenos]] and the grandson of the emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]].\n{{TOClimit|2}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nAndronikos Komnenos was born around 1118. He was handsome and eloquent, active, hardy, courageous, a great general and an able politician, but also [[licentious]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} His early years were spent alternately in pleasure and in military service.\n\nIn 1141 he was taken captive by the [[Seljuq Turks]] and remained in their hands for a year. On being [[Ransom|ransomed]], he went to [[Constantinople]], where he was held at the court of his [[first cousin]], the Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus|Manuel I Komnenos]], to whom he was a great favourite. Here the charms of his niece, Eudoxia, attracted him and she became his mistress.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} In 1152, accompanied by Eudoxia, he set out for an important command in [[Cilicia]]. [[Battle of Mamistra|Failing]] in his principal enterprise, an attack upon [[Mopsuestia]], he returned but was again appointed to the command of a province.  This second post he seems also to have left after a short interval, for he appeared again in Constantinople and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of Eudoxia.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\n===Exile===\nAbout 1153, a conspiracy against the Emperor in which Andronikos participated was discovered, and he was imprisoned. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, he escaped in 1165.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} After passing through many dangers, including captivity in [[Vlach]] territory,{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=131}} he reached [[Kiev]], where his cousin [[Yaroslav Osmomysl]] of [[Principality of Halych|Galicia]] held court. While under the protection of Yaroslav, Andronikos formed an alliance with the Emperor Manuel I, and with a Galician army he joined Manuel in the invasion of [[Hungary]], assisting at the siege of [[Zemun|Semlin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} The campaign was successful, and Andronikos returned to Constantinople with Manuel I in 1168; a year later, however, Andronikos refused to take the oath of allegiance to the future king [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]], whom Manuel desired to become his successor. Andronikos was removed from court but received the province of [[Cilicia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\nStill under the displeasure of the Emperor, Andronikos fled to the court of [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]]. While residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the Prince, [[Philippa of Antioch|Philippa]], sister of the Empress [[Maria of Antioch|Maria]]. The Emperor was again angered by this dishonour, and Andronikos was compelled to flee.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} He took refuge with King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], whose favour he gained, and who invested him with the [[Principality of Galilee|Lordship of Beirut]]. In Jerusalem he saw [[Theodora Komnene, Queen of Jerusalem|Theodora Komnene]], the beautiful widow of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] and niece of the Emperor Manuel. Although Andronikos was at that time fifty-six years old, age had not diminished his charms, and Theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} To avoid the vengeance of the Emperor, she fled with Andronikos to the court of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], the [[Rulers of Damascus|Sultan of Damascus]]. Feeling unsafe there, they continued their perilous journey through the [[Caucasus]] and [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} They were well received by King [[George III of Georgia]], whose anonymous sister had probably been the first wife of Andronikos.\n\nAndronikos was granted estates in [[Kakhetia]], in the east of Georgia. In 1173 or 1174, he accompanied the Georgian army on an expedition to [[Shirvan]] up to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] shores, where George recaptured the fortress of [[Shabaran]] from the invaders from [[Derbent|Darband]] for his cousin, the [[Shirvanshah]] [[Akhsitan I ibn Minuchihr III|Akhsitan I]].{{sfn|Minorsky|1945|pp=557\u2013558}} Finally, Andronikos and Theodora settled in the ancestral lands of the Komnenoi at [[Oinaion]], on the shores of the [[Black Sea]], between [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]].<ref>Speros Vryonis Jr., ''The Decline of medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor: and the process of Islamization from the eleventh through the fifteenth century'', (Berkeley: University of California, 1971), p. 127</ref> While Andronikos was on one of his incursions into Trebizond, his castle was surprised by the governor of that province, and Theodora and her two children were captured and sent to Constantinople. To obtain their release Andronikos in early 1180 made abject submission to the Emperor and, appearing in chains before him, besought pardon. This he obtained, and he was allowed to retire with Theodora into banishment at Oinaion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\n===Emperor===\nIn 1180 the Emperor Manuel died and was succeeded by his ten-year-old son [[Alexius II Comnenus|Alexios II]], who was under the guardianship of his mother, Empress Maria.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} Her Latin origins and culture led to creeping resentment from her Greek subjects. They had felt insulted by the Western tastes of Manuel, and being ruled by his Western wife built tensions to an explosion of rioting that almost became a full civil war.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This gave Andronikos the opportunity to seize the crown for himself, leaving his retirement in 1182 and marching to Constantinople with an army that (according to non-Byzantine sources) included Muslim contingents.<ref>\n* [[Ibn Jubayr]] p. 355 Broadhurst (Turks and Arabs);{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n* [[William of Tyre]], ''Historia Transmarina'' 22.11 (''innumeras Barbararum nationum secum trahens copias'');{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n* [[Walter Map]], ''[[De Nugis Curialium]]'' 2.18 (Turks).{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n</ref> The defection of the commander of the Byzantine navy, ''[[megas doux]]'' [[Andronikos Kontostephanos]], and the general Andronikos Angelos, played a key role in allowing the rebellious forces to enter Constantinople.{{sfn|Angold|1997|p=267}}\n\nThe arrival of Andronikos Komnenos was soon followed by a [[Massacre of the Latins|massacre of the city's Latin inhabitants]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} who virtually controlled its economy, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Westerners. He was believed to have arranged the poisoning of Alexios II's elder sister [[Maria Komnene (daughter of Manuel I)|Maria the Porphyrogenita]] and her husband [[Renier of Montferrat]], although Maria herself had encouraged him to intervene; the poisoner was said to be the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Pterygeonites.{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the poisoning and the details}} Soon afterwards Andronikos had the Empress Maria imprisoned and then killed \u2014 forcing a signature from the child Emperor Alexios to put his mother to death \u2014 by Pterygeonites and the ''[[hetaireiarches]]'' Constantine Tripsychos.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Alexios II was compelled to acknowledge Andronikos as colleague in the empire in front of the crowd on the terrace of the [[Arslan Hane, Istanbul|Church of Christ of the Chalk\u00e8]] and was then quickly put to death in turn; the killing was carried out by Tripsychos, Theodore Dadibrenos, and [[Stephen Hagiochristophorites]].{{sfn|Choniates|1984|pp=260\u2013274}}\n\nIn 1183, sixty-five year old Andronikos married twelve-year-old [[Agnes of France, Empress consort of the Eastern Roman Empire|Agnes of France]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} daughter of King [[Louis VII of France]] and his third wife [[Ad\u00e8le of Champagne]] \u2014 Agnes had been betrothed to Alexios II.<ref>Jonathan Harris, ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', 2nd ed.

He resolved to suppress many abuses but above all things to check [[feudalism]] and limit the power of the nobles, who were rivals for his throne. He attempted to reform the decaying political system by forbidding the sale of offices, punishing corrupt officials (often brutally) but above all, he moved to check the power of the feudal landowners. The people, who felt the severity of his laws, at the same time acknowledged their justice and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} who had grown corrupt under the safety and opulence of Manuel I's rule.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Andronikos became increasingly paranoid and violent, however, and the Empire descended into a terror state.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. In September 1185, he ordered the execution of all prisoners, exiles, and their families for collusion with the invaders. The aristocrats, in turn, were infuriated against him,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} and there were several revolts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe stories of chaos led to an invasion by King [[William II of Sicily|William]] of the Norman Sicilians.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} William landed in [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] with a strong force of 200 ships and 80,000 men, including 5,000 knights,{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the numbers}} and marched as far as [[Thessalonica]], which he [[Sack of Thessalonica (1185)|took and pillaged]] ruthlessly (7,000 Greeks died).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for the numbers and ethnicity}} Andronikos hastily assembled five different armies to stop the Sicilian army from reaching Constantinople, but his forces failed to stand and retreated to the outlying hills. Andronikos also assembled a fleet of 100 ships to stop the Norman fleet from entering the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The invaders were finally driven out in 1186 by his successor, [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac Angelos]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=for everything since the last Chisholm 1911 as none of these details are in EB1911 so they need a citation from another source}}\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Death of andronic I.png|thumb|250px|A medieval depiction of the death of Andronikos. Original in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, France.]]\n\nAndronikos seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy, and his plans were nearly successful. But on 11 September 1185, during his absence from the capital{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} Stephen Hagiochristophorites, his lieutenant, moved to arrest [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac Angelos]], whose loyalty was suspect.{{sfn|Harris|2003|p=136}} Angelos killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of [[Hagia Sophia]]. He appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose that spread rapidly over the whole city.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\nWhen Andronikos arrived he found that Isaac had been proclaimed emperor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} The deposed emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife Agnes and his mistress, but they were captured (though some claim that Andronikos survived and managed to escape to the self-proclaimed kingdom of [[Cyprus]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} Angelos handed him over to the city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} remaining for that period tied to a post and beaten. His right hand was cut off, his teeth and hair were pulled out, one of his eyes was gouged out, and, among many other sufferings, boiling water was thrown in his face, punishment probably associated with his handsomeness and life of licentiousness.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} At last he was led to the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] and hung by his feet between two pillars. Two Latin soldiers competed as to whose sword would penetrate his body more deeply, and he was, according to the representation of his death, torn apart.{{sfn|Choniates|1984|p=193}} He died on 12 September 1185.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} At the news of the Emperor's death, his son and co-emperor, John, was murdered by his own troops in [[Thrace]].{{sfn|Choniates|1984|p=193}}\nAndronikos I was the last of the [[Comnenus|Komnenoi]] to rule Constantinople, although his grandsons [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios]] and [[David Komnenos|David]] founded the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in 1204.

In 1964, he established his own firm to undertake [[Habitat 67]], an adaptation of his McGill thesis. Habitat 67, which pioneered the design and implementation of three-dimensional, prefabricated units for living, was a central feature of Expo 67 and an important development in architectural history. He was awarded the 1967 Construction Man of the Year Award from the Engineering News Record and the [[Governor General's Awards|Massey Medal for Architecture in Canada]] for Habitat 67.<ref>{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Montreal - QC - Habitat67.jpg|thumb|Habitat 67]]\nIn 1970, Safdie opened a branch office in [[Jerusalem]]. Among the projects he has designed in Jerusalem are [[Yad Vashem]] and the [[Mamilla|Alrov Mamilla Quarter]], which includes the [[Mamilla Mall]], David's Village luxury condominiums, and the 5-star Mamilla Hotel.

In 1964, he established his own firm to undertake [[Habitat 67]], an adaptation of his McGill thesis. Habitat 67, which pioneered the design and implementation of three-dimensional, prefabricated units for living, was a central feature of Expo 67 and an important development in architectural history. He was awarded the 1967 Construction Man of the Year Award from the Engineering News Record and the [[Governor General's Awards|Massey Medal for Architecture in Canada]] for Habitat 67.<ref>{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Montreal - QC - Habitat67.jpg|thumb|Habitat 67]]\nIn 1970, Safdie opened a branch office in [[Jerusalem]]. Among the projects he has designed in Jerusalem are [[Yad Vashem]] and the [[Mamilla|Alrov Mamilla Quarter]], which includes the [[Mamilla Mall]], David's Village luxury condominiums, and the 5-star Mamilla Hotel. In 1978, after teaching at McGill, [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev|Ben Gurion]], and [[Yale University|Yale]] universities, Safdie moved his main office to Boston and became director of the Urban Design Program at [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Harvard University's Graduate School of Design]], until 1984. From 1984 to 1989, he was the Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Harvard. Since the early 1990s, Safdie, a citizen of Canada, Israel, and the United States, has focused on his architectural practice, Safdie Architects, which is based in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], and has branches in Toronto, Jerusalem, and Singapore.\n\nSafdie has designed six of Canada's principal public institutions\u2014including the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in Ottawa, and [[Vancouver Public Library|Vancouver Library Square]]\u2014as well as many other notable projects around the world, including the [[Salt Lake City Public Library|Salt Lake City Main Public Library]]; the [[Virasat-e-Khalsa|Khalsa Heritage Centre]] in Punjab, India; the [[Marina Bay Sands]] integrated resort in Singapore; the [[United States Institute of Peace Headquarters]] in Washington, DC; the [[Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts]] in Kansas City, Missouri; and the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in Bentonville, Arkansas.\n\n==Architectural style==\n[[File:Marina_Bay_Sands_in_the_evening_-_20101120.jpg|thumb|Marina Bay Sands, Singapore]]\n[[File:Raffles_City_Chongqing_2019-9.jpg|thumb|Raffles City, Chongqing, China]]\nMoshe Safdie's works are known for their dramatic curves, arrays of geometric patterns, use of windows, and key placement of open and green spaces. His writings and designs stress the need to create meaningful, vital, and inclusive spaces that enhance community, with special attention to the essence of a particular locale, geography, and culture.\n\nHe is a self-described modernist.\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n* Gold Medal, American Institute of Architects\n* Companion of the Order of Canada\n* Gold Medal, Royal Architectural Institute of Canada\n* Richard Neutra Award for Professional Excellence\n* Mt.
