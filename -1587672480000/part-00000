Source does not have a concise [[version numbering]] scheme; instead, it is designed in constant incremental updates. The successor, [[Source 2]], was officially announced in March 2015, with the first game to use it being ''[[Dota 2]]'', which was ported over from Source later that year.\n\n==History==\nSource distantly originates from the [[GoldSrc]] engine, itself a heavily modified version of [[John Carmack]]'s [[Quake engine]].

At that point we [[Fork (software development)|forked]] off the code in [[Microsoft Visual SourceSafe|VSS]] to be both <code>/$Goldsrc</code> and <code>/$Src</code>. Over the next few years, we used these terms internally as \"Goldsource\" and \"Source\". At least initially, the Goldsrc branch of code referred to the codebase that was [[Software release life cycle#Release|currently released]], and Src referred to the next set of more risky technology that we were working on. When it came down to show ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' for the first time at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], it was part of our internal communication to refer to the \"Source\" engine vs. the \"Goldsource\" engine, and the name stuck.}}\n\nSource was developed part-by-part from TYRESSE IS GOING TO BE THE UNDISPUTED HEAVYWAIGHT CHAMPION  , slowly replacing GoldSrc in Valve's internal projects<ref>{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=David|year=2004|title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0-7615-4364-3}}</ref> and, in part, explaining the reasons behind its unusually modular nature.

Different systems within Source are represented by separate modules which can be updated independently. With [[Steam (software)|Steam]], Valve can distribute these updates automatically among its many users. In practice, however, there have been occasional breaks in this chain of compatibility. The release of ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' and ''[[The Orange Box]]'' both introduced new versions of the engine that could not be used to run older games or [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] without the developers performing upgrades to code and, in some cases, content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/new-update-breaking-new-and-old-mods/|title=New Update Breaking New and Old Mods?|publisher=PlanetPhillip|accessdate=October 17, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021132929/http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/new-update-breaking-new-and-old-mods/|archivedate=October 21, 2014}}</ref> Both cases required markedly less work to update its version than competing engines.\n\n==== Source 2006 ====\n[[File:Half-Life 2 Episode One Citadel Base.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A screenshot of ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]''.

Multiprocessor support was further expanded, allowing for features like split screen multiplayer, additional post-processing effects, event scripting with [[Squirrel (programming language)|Squirrel]], and the highly-dynamic [[Left 4 Dead#AI Director|AI Director]]. The menu interface was re-implemented with a new layout designed to be more console-oriented. This branch later fueled the releases of ''[[Alien Swarm]]'' and ''[[Portal 2]]'', the former released with source code outlining many of the changes made since the branch began. ''Portal 2'', in addition, served as the result of Valve taking the problem of porting to PlayStation 3 in-house, and in combination with [[Steam (software)#Developer features|Steamworks]] integration creating what they called \"the best console version of the game\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Portal 2: Pretty Much Every PS3 Question Answered (And That Cake Thing, Too)|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2011/04/14/portal-2-pretty-much-every-ps3-question-answered-and-that-cake-thing-too/|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment America]]|date=April 14, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110902205417/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2011/04/14/portal-2-pretty-much-every-ps3-question-answered-and-that-cake-thing-too/|archivedate=September 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== OS X, Linux, and Android support ====\nIn April 2010, Valve released all of their major Source games on [[OS X]], coinciding with the release of the Steam client on the same platform.

It comes with several command-line programs designed for special functions within the asset pipeline, as well as a few GUI-based programs designed for handling more complex functions. Source SDK was launched as a free standalone toolset through Steam, and required a Source game to be purchased on the same account. Since the release of ''Left 4 Dead'' in late 2008, Valve began releasing \"Authoring Tools\" for individual games, which constitute the same programs adapted for each game's engine build. After ''Team Fortress 2'' became free-to-play, Source SDK was effectively made open to all Steam users. When some Source games were updated to Source 2013, the older Source SDKs were phased out. The three applications mentioned below are now included in the install of each game.\n\nThere are three applications packaged in the Source SDK: Hammer Editor, Model Viewer, and Face Poser. Hammer Editor, the engine's official [[level editor]], uses rendering and compiling tools included in the SDK to create maps using the [[binary space partitioning]] (BSP) method. The tool was originally known as Worldcraft and was developed independently by Ben Morris before Valve acquired it.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 12, 2010|url=http://www.bluesnews.com/pressreleases/WC16release.doc|title=Valve Press Release|publisher=Valve|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610164022/http://www.bluesnews.com/pressreleases/WC16release.doc|archivedate=June 10, 2011}}</ref> The Model Viewer is a program that allows users to view models and can be used for a variety of different purposes, including development. Developers may use the program to view models and their corresponding animations, attachment points, bones, and so on. Face Poser is the tool used to access facial animations and choreography systems.  This tool allows one to edit [[Computer facial animation|facial expressions]], gestures and movements for characters, [[Lip-syncing#In video games|lip sync]] speech, and sequence expressions and other acting cues and preview what the scene will look like in the game engine.\n\n=== Source Dedicated Server ===\nThe '''Source Dedicated Server''' or '''SRCDS''' is a standalone launcher for the Source engine that runs multiplayer game sessions without requiring a client. It can be launched through Windows or Linux, and can allow for custom levels and assets. Most third-party servers additionally run [[Metamod|Metamod:Source]] and SourceMod, which together provide a framework on top of SRCDS for custom modification of gameplay on existing titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcemm.net/|title=MetaMod:S|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701222549/http://www.sourcemm.net/|archivedate=July 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcemod.net/|title=SourceMod|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601222846/http://www.sourcemod.net/|archivedate=June 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Source Filmmaker===\n{{Main|Source Filmmaker}}\nThe Source Filmmaker (SFM) is a video capture and editing application that works from within the Source engine.<ref name=sfm_home>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcefilmmaker.com|title=Source Filmmaker|accessdate=March 31, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402181751/http://sourcefilmmaker.com/|archivedate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> Developed by Valve, the tool was originally used to create movies for ''Day of Defeat: Source'', but is more associated with ''Team Fortress 2''.

Corporation|Valve]]. It debuted as the successor to [[GoldSrc]] with ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'' in June 2004, followed shortly by ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' in November, and has been in active development since. Source does not have a concise [[version numbering]] scheme; instead, it is designed in constant incremental updates. The successor, [[Source 2]], was officially announced in March 2015, with the first game to use it being ''[[Dota 2]]'', which was ported over from Source later that year.\n\n==History==\nSource distantly originates from the [[GoldSrc]] engine, itself a heavily modified version of [[John Carmack]]'s [[Quake engine]]. Carmack commented on his [[blog]] in 2004 that \"there are still bits of early ''Quake'' code in ''Half-Life 2''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/johnc/recent%20updates/archive?news_id=290|date=December 31, 2004|work=John Carmack's Blog|title=Welcome, Q3 source, Graphics|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517235354/http://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/johnc/recent%20updates/archive?news_id=290|archivedate=May 17, 2006}}</ref>  Valve employee Erik Johnson explained the engine's [[nomenclature]] on the Valve Developer Community:<ref name=\"goldsrc-src-quote\">{{cite web|url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Erik_Johnson&oldid=10088#GoldSource|title=Talk:Erik Johnson|work=Valve Developer Community|last=Johnson|first=Erik|date=September 1, 2005|accessdate=August 15, 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65ShXTOOe?url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Erik_Johnson&oldid=10088#GoldSource|archivedate=February 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|When we were getting very close to releasing ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (less than a week or so), we found there were already some projects that we needed to start working on, but we couldn't risk checking in code to the shipping version of the game. At that point we [[Fork (software development)|forked]] off the code in [[Microsoft Visual SourceSafe|VSS]] to be both <code>/$Goldsrc</code> and <code>/$Src</code>. Over the next few years, we used these terms internally as \"Goldsource\" and \"Source\". At least initially, the Goldsrc branch of code referred to the codebase that was [[Software release life cycle#Release|currently released]], and Src referred to the next set of more risky technology that we were working on. When it came down to show ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' for the first time at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], it was part of our internal communication to refer to the \"Source\" engine vs. the \"Goldsource\" engine, and the name stuck.}}\n\nSource was developed part-by-part from this fork onwards, slowly replacing GoldSrc in Valve's internal projects<ref>{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=David|year=2004|title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0-7615-4364-3}}</ref> and, in part, explaining the reasons behind its unusually modular nature. Valve's development of Source since has been a mixture of licensed [[middleware]] and in-house-developed code. Among others, Source uses [[Bink Video]] for video playback.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/counter-strike-remake-source-engine-powered/531716p1.html|title = Counter-Strike: Source - Full-Screen E3 2004 Presentation|last = O'Donnell|first = Ryan|date = Jul 19, 2004|work = GameSpy|access-date = Apr 20, 2015|via = |url-status=live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113927/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/counter-strike-remake-source-engine-powered/531716p1.html|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Modularity and notable upgrades===\nSource was created to evolve incrementally with new technology, as opposed to the [[backward compatibility]]-breaking \"version jumps\" of its competitors. Different systems within Source are represented by separate modules which can be updated independently. With [[Steam (software)|Steam]], Valve can distribute these updates automatically among its many users. In practice, however, there have been occasional breaks in this chain of compatibility. The release of ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' and ''[[The Orange Box]]'' both introduced new versions of the engine that could not be used to run older games or [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] without the developers performing upgrades to code and, in some cases, content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/new-update-breaking-new-and-old-mods/|title=New Update Breaking New and Old Mods?|publisher=PlanetPhillip|accessdate=October 17, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021132929/http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/new-update-breaking-new-and-old-mods/|archivedate=October 21, 2014}}</ref> Both cases required markedly less work to update its version than competing engines.\n\n==== Source 2006 ====\n[[File:Half-Life 2 Episode One Citadel Base.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A screenshot of ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]''. The [[high dynamic range rendering]] and [[Phong shading]] effects are evident.]]\n\nThe Source 2006 branch was the term used for Valve's games using technology that culminated with the release of ''Half-Life 2: Episode One''. [[High-dynamic-range rendering|HDR rendering]] and [[color correction]] were first implemented in 2005 using ''[[Day of Defeat: Source]]'', which required the engine's shaders to be rewritten.<ref name=\"hdr_shaders\">{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |year=2005|platform=PC|quote='''Chris Green''': The Source engine supports a wide variety of shaders.

Multiprocessor support was further expanded, allowing for features like split screen multiplayer, additional post-processing effects, event scripting with [[Squirrel (programming language)|Squirrel]], and the highly-dynamic [[Left 4 Dead#AI Director|AI Director]]. The menu interface was re-implemented with a new layout designed to be more console-oriented. This branch later fueled the releases of ''[[Alien Swarm]]'' and ''[[Portal 2]]'', the former released with source code outlining many of the changes made since the branch began. ''Portal 2'', in addition, served as the result of Valve taking the problem of porting to PlayStation 3 in-house, and in combination with [[Steam (software)#Developer features|Steamworks]] integration creating what they called \"the best console version of the game\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Portal 2: Pretty Much Every PS3 Question Answered (And That Cake Thing, Too)|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2011/04/14/portal-2-pretty-much-every-ps3-question-answered-and-that-cake-thing-too/|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment America]]|date=April 14, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110902205417/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2011/04/14/portal-2-pretty-much-every-ps3-question-answered-and-that-cake-thing-too/|archivedate=September 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== OS X, Linux, and Android support ====\nIn April 2010, Valve released all of their major Source games on [[OS X]], coinciding with the release of the Steam client on the same platform.

It comes with several command-line programs designed for special functions within the asset pipeline, as well as a few GUI-based programs designed for handling more complex functions. Source SDK was launched as a free standalone toolset through Steam, and required a Source game to be purchased on the same account. Since the release of ''Left 4 Dead'' in late 2008, Valve began releasing \"Authoring Tools\" for individual games, which constitute the same programs adapted for each game's engine build. After ''Team Fortress 2'' became free-to-play, Source SDK was effectively made open to all Steam users. When some Source games were updated to Source 2013, the older Source SDKs were phased out. The three applications mentioned below are now included in the install of each game.\n\nThere are three applications packaged in the Source SDK: Hammer Editor, Model Viewer, and Face Poser. Hammer Editor, the engine's official [[level editor]], uses rendering and compiling tools included in the SDK to create maps using the [[binary space partitioning]] (BSP) method. The tool was originally known as Worldcraft and was developed independently by Ben Morris before Valve acquired it.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 12, 2010|url=http://www.bluesnews.com/pressreleases/WC16release.doc|title=Valve Press Release|publisher=Valve|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610164022/http://www.bluesnews.com/pressreleases/WC16release.doc|archivedate=June 10, 2011}}</ref> The Model Viewer is a program that allows users to view models and can be used for a variety of different purposes, including development. Developers may use the program to view models and their corresponding animations, attachment points, bones, and so on. Face Poser is the tool used to access facial animations and choreography systems.  This tool allows one to edit [[Computer facial animation|facial expressions]], gestures and movements for characters, [[Lip-syncing#In video games|lip sync]] speech, and sequence expressions and other acting cues and preview what the scene will look like in the game engine.\n\n=== Source Dedicated Server ===\nThe '''Source Dedicated Server''' or '''SRCDS''' is a standalone launcher for the Source engine that runs multiplayer game sessions without requiring a client. It can be launched through Windows or Linux, and can allow for custom levels and assets. Most third-party servers additionally run [[Metamod|Metamod:Source]] and SourceMod, which together provide a framework on top of SRCDS for custom modification of gameplay on existing titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcemm.net/|title=MetaMod:S|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701222549/http://www.sourcemm.net/|archivedate=July 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcemod.net/|title=SourceMod|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601222846/http://www.sourcemod.net/|archivedate=June 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Source Filmmaker===\n{{Main|Source Filmmaker}}\nThe Source Filmmaker (SFM) is a video capture and editing application that works from within the Source engine.<ref name=sfm_home>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcefilmmaker.com|title=Source Filmmaker|accessdate=March 31, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402181751/http://sourcefilmmaker.com/|archivedate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> Developed by Valve, the tool was originally used to create movies for ''Day of Defeat: Source'', but is more associated with ''Team Fortress 2''.

Critical opinion improved over time; the song was included on several year-end lists and nominated for two awards at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards|59th Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]]. The song reached number one on the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming Rihanna's fourteenth number-one single and making her the act with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart (after [[The Beatles]], [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Elvis Presley]]). The song remained at the top for nine weeks.

It was just something in our DNA, so it woke him up, and we started remembering all these old dancehall songs from the '90s.\" Boi-1da came with up idea for sampling an \"old school dancehall rhythm\" and after that the chords were made with Ritter and past it, \"everything went organically\". The most recognizable sampling found in the \"Work\" [[riddim]] is from the 1998 riddim \"Sail Away\" which was produced by [[Richie Stephens (musician)|Richie Stephens]] and Mikey 2000,<ref name=\"complexwriting\"/> interpolating [[Alexander O'Neal]]'s \"[[If You Were Here Tonight]]\".\nWhen the song's music was finished, Boi-1da sent it to PartyNextDoor who wrote the lyrics, \"he's an incredible writer, and he's Jamaican as well. I think so that's how he's able to come up with those vibes and feels,\" noted Thomas. After Drake heard the song he loved it and decided to write and record a verse on it. Shortly after Braithwaite stayed at Rihanna's home in Malibu, where he played her the song.<ref name=\"complexwriting\"/>\n\nRihanna's vocals were recorded by Marcos Tovar and [[Kuk Harrell]] at the [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles; the latter also served as a vocal producer. Drake's vocals were recorded by Noel Cadastre and [[Noah \"40\" Shebib]] at the Sandra Gale Studios in California and the SOTA Studios in Toronto.

The song was written by [[PartyNextDoor]], Rihanna, Drake, [[Monte Moir]], [[Sevn Thomas|Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas]], Allen Ritter and [[Boi-1da|Matthew Samuels]], and was produced by [[Boi-1da]], Sevn Thomas, Ritter, [[Kuk Harrell]] and [[Noah \"40\" Shebib]]. The [[dancehall]], [[Reggae fusion|reggae-pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, contains an interpolation of \"[[If You Were Here Tonight]]\" (1985) performed by [[Alexander O'Neal]]. Lyrically, the song incorporates themes of working for money, as well as discussing fragile relationships. The song is in the [[Jamaican Patois]] language and three of its writer-producers: Rupert \"Sevn\" Thomas, Matthew \"Boi-1da\" Samuels, and Jahron \"PartyNextDoor\" Brathwaite, are [[Jamaican Canadians|Jamaican-Canadians]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7616664/dancehall-charts-producers|title=Meet the Producers Who Brought Dancehall Back to the Charts In 2016|website=Billboard |access-date= March 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaicans.com/jamaican-patois-mistaken-for-gibberish-on-rihannas-new-single/|title=American Music Critics Mistake Jamaican Patois for \"Gibberish\" on Rihanna's New Single|website=Jamaicans Magazine |access-date= March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nCritical response to \"Work\" was mixed upon release; critics praised its composition and Rihanna's decision to return to her earlier themes of [[Dancehall music|dancehall]] music, while others were more skeptical of the song's potential as a comeback for the singer. Critical opinion improved over time; the song was included on several year-end lists and nominated for two awards at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards|59th Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]]. The song reached number one on the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming Rihanna's fourteenth number-one single and making her the act with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart (after [[The Beatles]], [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Elvis Presley]]). The song remained at the top for nine weeks.

They found this practice could vary droplet size 10-fold or more by changing from an inefficient nebulizer system to a highly efficient one.<ref name=Boe2001/><ref name=Cates2013 />\nTwo advantages attributed to nebulizers, compared to MDIs with spacers (inhalers), are their ability to deliver larger dosages at a faster rate, especially in acute asthma; however, recent data suggests actual lung deposition rates are the same. In addition, another trial found that a MDI (with spacer) had a lower required dose for clinical result compared to a nebulizer (see Clark, et al. other references).<ref name=Clark2010/>\n\nBeyond use in chronic lung disease, nebulizers may also be used to treat acute issues like the inhalation of toxic substances. One such example is the treatment of inhalation of toxic [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) vapors <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kono |first1=K |title=Successful treatments of lung injury and skin burn due to hydrofluoric acid exposure. |journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health |volume=73 Suppl |pages=S93-7 |pmid=10968568 |year=2000 |doi=10.1007/pl00014634 }}</ref>. [[Calcium gluconate]] is a first-line treatment for HF exposure to the skin. By using a nebulizer, calcium gluconate is delivered to the lungs as an aerosol to counteract the toxicity of inhaled HF vapors.\n\n\n==Aerosol deposition==\nThe lung deposition characteristics and efficacy of an aerosol depend largely on the particle or droplet size. Generally, the smaller the particle the greater its chance of peripheral penetration and retention. However, for very fine particles below 0.5&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter there is a chance of avoiding deposition altogether and being exhaled. In 1966 the Task Group on Lung Dynamics, concerned mainly with the hazards of inhalation of environmental toxins, proposed a model for deposition of particles in the lung. This suggested that particles of more than 10&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter are most likely to deposit in the mouth and throat, for those of 5\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm diameter a transition from mouth to airway deposition occurs, and particles smaller than 5&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter deposit more frequently in the lower airways and are appropriate for pharmaceutical aerosols.<ref>The science of nebulised drug delivery, p6</ref>\n\n==Types of nebulizers==\n[[File:Jet nebulizer.jpg|thumb|A modern jet nebulizer]]\n[[File:Albuterol Sulfate (1).JPG|thumb|A vial of 0.5% [[albuterol]] sulfate inhalation solution for nebulizing]]\n\n===Pneumatic===\n====Jet nebulizer====\nThe most commonly used nebulizers are [[jet nebulizer]]<nowiki/>s, which are also called \"atomizers\".<ref name=Finlay>{{cite book |author=Finlay, W.H. |title=The Mechanics of Inhaled Pharmaceutical Aerosols: An Introduction |publisher=Academic Press |location= |year=2001 }}</ref> Jet nebulizers are connected by tubing to a supply of compressed gas, usually [[compressed air]] or [[oxygen]] to flow at high velocity through a liquid medicine to turn it into an [[aerosol]]<nowiki/>that is inhaled by the patient. Currently there seems to be a tendency among physicians to prefer prescription of a [[pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler]] (pMDI) for their patients, instead of a jet nebulizer that generates a lot more noise (often 60&nbsp;dB during use) and is less portable due to a greater weight. However, jet nebulizers are commonly used in hospitals for patients who have difficulty using inhalers, such as in serious cases of respiratory disease, or severe asthma attacks.<ref name=Hickey>{{cite book |author=Hickey, A.J. |title=Pharmaceutical Inhalation Aerosol Technology |url=https://archive.org/details/pharmaceuticalin134anth |url-access=registration |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York |year=2004 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The main advantage of the jet nebulizer is related to its low operational cost. If the patient needs to inhale medicine on a daily basis the use of a pMDI can be rather expensive. Today several manufacturers have also managed to lower the weight of the jet nebulizer to {{convert|635|g}}, and thereby started to label it as a portable device. Compared to all the competing inhalers and nebulizers, the noise and heavy weight is still the biggest draw back of the jet nebulizer.

This new technology provides a metered dose to the user, as the liquid bottom of the inhaler is rotated clockwise 180 degrees by hand, adding a build up tension into a spring around the flexible liquid container. When the user activates the bottom of the inhaler, the energy from the spring is released and imposes pressure on the flexible liquid container, causing liquid to spray out of 2 nozzles, thus forming a soft mist to be inhaled. The device features no gas propellant and no need for battery/power to operate. The average droplet size in the mist was measured to 5.8 micrometers, which could indicate some potential efficiency problems for the inhaled medicine to reach the lungs. Subsequent trials have proven this was not the case. Due to the very low velocity of the mist, the Soft Mist Inhaler in fact has a higher efficiency compared to a conventional pMDI.<ref name=\"Soft Mist Inhaler\">{{cite web|url=http://www.respimat.com/com/Main/functions/howitworks/index.jsp|author=Boehringer Ingelheim|title=How it works: Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler|year=2003|accessdate=2005-08-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527080759/http://www.respimat.com/com/Main/functions/howitworks/index.jsp|archivedate=2007-05-27|df=}}</ref> In 2000, arguments were launched towards the European Respiratory Society (ERS) to clarify/expand their definition of a nebulizer, as the new Soft Mist Inhaler in technical terms both could be classified as a \"hand driven nebulizer\" and a \"hand driven pMDI\".<ref name=\"Soft Mist Inhaler definition\">{{cite journal |journal=Eur Respir Rev |volume=10 |pages=187\u2013191  |vauthors=Denyer J, etal |title=New liquid drug aerosol devices for inhalation therapy |year=2000}}</ref>\n\n===Electrical===\n====Ultrasonic wave nebulizer====\nUltrasonic wave nebulizers were invented in 1965<ref>{{cite patent|url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=03243122|country = US|title = Ultrasonic Spray Apparatus|inventor = Snaper, Alvin A.|number = 3243122 |status = patent|pubdate = 29 March 1966|fdate = 24 February 1965}}</ref> as a new type of portable nebulizer. The technology inside an ultrasonic wave nebulizer is to have an [[electronic oscillator]] generate a high frequency [[ultrasonic wave]], which causes the mechanical vibration of a [[piezoelectric]] element. This vibrating element is in contact with a liquid reservoir and its high frequency vibration is sufficient to produce a vapor mist.<ref name=\"Ultrasonic humidifier\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airwin-luftbefeuchter.de/html/en/operating_principle.html|author=BOGA Gmbh|title=Operating principle of ultrasonic humidifier|accessdate=2010-04-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114085152/http://www.airwin-luftbefeuchter.de/html/en/operating_principle.html|archivedate=2010-11-14|df=}}</ref> As they create aerosols from ultrasonic vibration instead of using a heavy air compressor, they only have a weight around {{convert|170|g}}.

With this technology a mesh/membrane with 1000\u20137000 laser drilled holes vibrates at the top of the liquid reservoir, and thereby pressures out a mist of very fine droplets through the holes. This technology is more efficient than having a vibrating piezoelectric element at the bottom of the liquid reservoir, and thereby shorter treatment times are also achieved. The old problems found with the ultrasonic wave nebulizer, having too much liquid waste and undesired heating of the medical liquid, have also been solved by the new vibrating mesh nebulizers.

[[Corticosteroids]] and [[bronchodilator]]s such as [[salbutamol]] (''albuterol'' [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) are often used, and sometimes in combination with [[ipratropium]]. The reason these pharmaceuticals are inhaled instead of ingested is in order to target their effect to the [[respiratory tract]], which speeds onset of action of the medicine and reduces side effects, compared to other alternative intake routes.<ref name=Hickey />\n\nUsually, the aerosolized medicine is inhaled through a tube-like mouthpiece, similar to that of an [[inhaler]]. The mouthpiece, however, is sometimes replaced with a face mask, similar to that used for inhaled [[anesthesia]], for ease of use with young children or the elderly. Pediatric masks are often shaped like animals such as fish, dogs or dragons to make children less resistant to nebulizer treatments. Many nebulizer manufacturers also offer pacifier attachments for infants and toddlers. But mouthpieces are preferable if patients are able to use them since face-masks result in reduced lung delivery because of aerosol losses in the nose.<ref name=Finlay />\n\nAfter use with corticosteroid, it is theoretically possible for patients to develop a [[yeast infection]] in the mouth ([[Oral candidiasis|thrush]]) or hoarseness of voice ([[dysphonia]]), although these conditions are clinically very rare. To avoid these adverse effects, some clinicians suggest that the person who used the nebulizer should rinse his or her mouth. This is not true for bronchodilators; however, patients may still wish to rinse their mouths due to the unpleasant taste of some bronchodilating drugs.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Sales-Girons (1858).jpg|thumb|left|160px|Sales-Girons pressurized nebulizer from 1858]]\nThe first \"powered\" or pressurized inhaler was invented in France by Sales-Girons in 1858.<ref name=\"inhalation therapy\"/> This device used pressure to atomize the liquid medication. The pump handle is operated like a bicycle pump. When the pump is pulled up, it draws liquid from the reservoir, and upon the force of the user's hand, the liquid is pressurized through an atomizer, to be sprayed out for inhalation near the user's mouth.<ref name=\"Sales-Girons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.inhalatorium.com/page148.html|author=Inhalatorium|title=Pressurized inhaler invented by Sales-Girons|accessdate=2010-04-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103081752/http://www.inhalatorium.com/page148.html|archivedate=2013-01-03|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1864, the first steam-driven nebulizer was invented in Germany. This inhaler, known as \"Siegle's steam spray inhaler\", used the [[Venturi principle]] to atomize liquid medication, and this was the very beginning of nebulizer therapy. The importance of droplet size was not yet understood, so the efficacy of this first device was unfortunately mediocre for many of the medical compounds. The Siegle steam spray inhaler consisted of a spirit burner, which boiled water in the reservoir into steam that could then flow across the top and into a tube suspended in the pharmaceutical solution. The passage of steam drew the medicine into the vapor, and the patient inhaled this vapor through a mouthpiece made of glass.<ref name=\"Siegle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.inhalatorium.com/page113.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040826141841/http://www.inhalatorium.com/page113.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-08-26|author=Inhalatorium|title=Siegle's steam spray inhaler|accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref>\n\nThe first pneumatic nebulizer fed from an electrically driven gas (air) compressor was invented in the 1930s and called a Pneumostat.

In addition, another trial found that a MDI (with spacer) had a lower required dose for clinical result compared to a nebulizer (see Clark, et al. other references).<ref name=Clark2010/>\n\nBeyond use in chronic lung disease, nebulizers may also be used to treat acute issues like the inhalation of toxic substances. One such example is the treatment of inhalation of toxic [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) vapors <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kono |first1=K |title=Successful treatments of lung injury and skin burn due to hydrofluoric acid exposure. |journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health |volume=73 Suppl |pages=S93-7 |pmid=10968568 |year=2000 |doi=10.1007/pl00014634 }}</ref>. [[Calcium gluconate]] is a first-line treatment for HF exposure to the skin. By using a nebulizer, calcium gluconate is delivered to the lungs as an aerosol to counteract the toxicity of inhaled HF vapors.\n\n\n==Aerosol deposition==\nThe lung deposition characteristics and efficacy of an aerosol depend largely on the particle or droplet size. Generally, the smaller the particle the greater its chance of peripheral penetration and retention. However, for very fine particles below 0.5&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter there is a chance of avoiding deposition altogether and being exhaled. In 1966 the Task Group on Lung Dynamics, concerned mainly with the hazards of inhalation of environmental toxins, proposed a model for deposition of particles in the lung. This suggested that particles of more than 10&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter are most likely to deposit in the mouth and throat, for those of 5\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm diameter a transition from mouth to airway deposition occurs, and particles smaller than 5&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter deposit more frequently in the lower airways and are appropriate for pharmaceutical aerosols.<ref>The science of nebulised drug delivery, p6</ref>\n\n==Types of nebulizers==\n[[File:Jet nebulizer.jpg|thumb|A modern jet nebulizer]]\n[[File:Albuterol Sulfate (1).JPG|thumb|A vial of 0.5% [[albuterol]] sulfate inhalation solution for nebulizing]]\n\n===Pneumatic===\n====Jet nebulizer====\nThe most commonly used nebulizers are jet nebulizers, which are also called \"atomizers\".<ref name=Finlay>{{cite book |author=Finlay, W.H. |title=The Mechanics of Inhaled Pharmaceutical Aerosols: An Introduction |publisher=Academic Press |location= |year=2001 }}</ref> Jet nebulizers are connected by tubing to a supply of compressed gas, usually [[compressed air]] or [[oxygen]] to flow at high velocity through a liquid medicine to turn it into an [[aerosol]], which is then inhaled by the patient. Currently there seems to be a tendency among physicians to prefer prescription of a [[pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler]] (pMDI) for their patients, instead of a jet nebulizer that generates a lot more noise (often 60&nbsp;dB during use) and is less portable due to a greater weight.

This new technology provides a metered dose to the user, as the liquid bottom of the inhaler is rotated clockwise 180 degrees by hand, adding a build up tension into a spring around the flexible liquid container. When the user activates the bottom of the inhaler, the energy from the spring is released and imposes pressure on the flexible liquid container, causing liquid to spray out of 2 nozzles, thus forming a soft mist to be inhaled. The device features no gas propellant and no need for battery/power to operate. The average droplet size in the mist was measured to 5.8 micrometers, which could indicate some potential efficiency problems for the inhaled medicine to reach the lungs. Subsequent trials have proven this was not the case. Due to the very low velocity of the mist, the Soft Mist Inhaler in fact has a higher efficiency compared to a conventional pMDI.<ref name=\"Soft Mist Inhaler\">{{cite web|url=http://www.respimat.com/com/Main/functions/howitworks/index.jsp|author=Boehringer Ingelheim|title=How it works: Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler|year=2003|accessdate=2005-08-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527080759/http://www.respimat.com/com/Main/functions/howitworks/index.jsp|archivedate=2007-05-27|df=}}</ref> In 2000, arguments were launched towards the European Respiratory Society (ERS) to clarify/expand their definition of a nebulizer, as the new Soft Mist Inhaler in technical terms both could be classified as a \"hand driven nebulizer\" and a \"hand driven pMDI\".<ref name=\"Soft Mist Inhaler definition\">{{cite journal |journal=Eur Respir Rev |volume=10 |pages=187\u2013191  |vauthors=Denyer J, etal |title=New liquid drug aerosol devices for inhalation therapy |year=2000}}</ref>\n\n===Electrical===\n====Ultrasonic wave nebulizer====\nUltrasonic wave nebulizers were invented in 1965<ref>{{cite patent|url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=03243122|country = US|title = Ultrasonic Spray Apparatus|inventor = Snaper, Alvin A.|number = 3243122 |status = patent|pubdate = 29 March 1966|fdate = 24 February 1965}}</ref> as a new type of portable nebulizer. The technology inside an ultrasonic wave nebulizer is to have an [[electronic oscillator]] generate a high frequency [[ultrasonic wave]], which causes the mechanical vibration of a [[piezoelectric]] element.

This technology is more efficient than having a vibrating piezoelectric element at the bottom of the liquid reservoir, and thereby shorter treatment times are also achieved.

[[Corticosteroids]] and [[bronchodilator]]s such as [[salbutamol]] (''albuterol'' [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) are often used, and sometimes in combination with [[ipratropium]]. The reason these pharmaceuticals are inhaled instead of ingested is in order to target their effect to the [[respiratory tract]], which speeds onset of action of the medicine and reduces side effects, compared to other alternative intake routes.<ref name=Hickey />\n\nUsually, the aerosolized medicine is inhaled through a tube-like mouthpiece, similar to that of an [[inhaler]]. The mouthpiece, however, is sometimes replaced with a face mask, similar to that used for inhaled [[anesthesia]], for ease of use with young children or the elderly. Pediatric masks are often shaped like animals such as fish, dogs or dragons to make children less resistant to nebulizer treatments. Many nebulizer manufacturers also offer pacifier attachments for infants and toddlers. But mouthpieces are preferable if patients are able to use them since face-masks result in reduced lung delivery because of aerosol losses in the nose.<ref name=Finlay />\n\nAfter use with corticosteroid, it is theoretically possible for patients to develop a [[yeast infection]] in the mouth ([[Oral candidiasis|thrush]]) or hoarseness of voice ([[dysphonia]]), although these conditions are clinically very rare. To avoid these adverse effects, some clinicians suggest that the person who used the nebulizer should rinse his or her mouth. This is not true for bronchodilators; however, patients may still wish to rinse their mouths due to the unpleasant taste of some bronchodilating drugs.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Sales-Girons (1858).jpg|thumb|left|160px|Sales-Girons pressurized nebulizer from 1858]]\nThe first \"powered\" or pressurized inhaler was invented in France by Sales-Girons in 1858.<ref name=\"inhalation therapy\"/> This device used pressure to atomize the liquid medication. The pump handle is operated like a bicycle pump. When the pump is pulled up, it draws liquid from the reservoir, and upon the force of the user's hand, the liquid is pressurized through an atomizer, to be sprayed out for inhalation near the user's mouth.<ref name=\"Sales-Girons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.inhalatorium.com/page148.html|author=Inhalatorium|title=Pressurized inhaler invented by Sales-Girons|accessdate=2010-04-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103081752/http://www.inhalatorium.com/page148.html|archivedate=2013-01-03|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1864, the first steam-driven nebulizer was invented in Germany. This inhaler, known as \"Siegle's steam spray inhaler\", used the [[Venturi principle]] to atomize liquid medication, and this was the very beginning of nebulizer therapy. The importance of droplet size was not yet understood, so the efficacy of this first device was unfortunately mediocre for many of the medical compounds.

The subordinate units of the regiment constitute the bulk of the infantry elements assigned to the 2nd Infantry [[Brigade Combat Team]], [[82nd Airborne Division]].\n\nThe 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment deploys anywhere in the world, within 18 hours of notification. The [[regiment]] conducts forced entry parachute assaults to seize, retain and defend airfields or other assets, then increases combat power in order to control land, people, and resources.\n\n==History==\n===World War I===\nThe '''325th Infantry Regiment''' was activated in the [[History of the United States Army#National Army|National Army]] on August 25, 1917, almost five months after the [[American entry into World War I]]. The regiment was part of the [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd Division]]. Under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Walter M. Whitman (United States Army officer)|Walter M. Whitman]], a professional [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] officer, the regiment, which was composed of large numbers of wartime volunteers and [[Conscription in the United States|conscripts]], also known as draftees, trained at [[Fort Gordon|Camp Gordon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as part of the [[164th Infantry Brigade (United States)|164th Infantry Brigade]] of the 82nd Infantry Division. However, only a small [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of professional Regular Army soldiers were originally assigned to the 325th. The cadre was intended to train the many hundreds of new conscripts, most of whom recently called up and were very young and had had no prior [[military service]], who would soon be entering the camp.\n\nThe 325th, along with the [[326th Infantry Regiment (United States)|326th Infantry Regiment]], which also formed part of the 164th Infantry Brigade, was composed of men from the \"[[Deep South]]\". Soon after, the 82nd Division was instructed by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to send its men to other camps in order to help create other units. This left the regiment with only a small training cadre of just under 800 officers and men. They were replaced by conscripts from all 48 states, giving rise to the 82nd Division's nickname of the \"All Americans\".\n\nAfter further training in France, the regiment was committed to [[Toul]] sector from 18 June - 10 August 1918. After a brief rest, the regiment returned to the line to participate in the offensive to reduce the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|St. Mihiel salient]], securing the southern shoulder of the breach.\n\nFrom 26 September - 9 October 1918, the regiment waited to be committed to the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]. At 07:00 on 10 October, the regiment attacked to seize the Cornay Ridge, then continued the attack across the [[Aire (Aisne)|Aire River]]. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], the regiment returned to the United States and was demobilized on 18 May 1919 at [[Camp Upton]], [[New York State|New York]].<ref name=\"bragg.army.mil\">\"2nd Brigade Combat Team Origins.\" Fort Bragg: Home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces.

After initial training, the regiment was reorganized as a [[glider infantry]] unit when the 82nd Infantry Division was reorganized as the [[82nd Airborne Division]] in August 1942, and the 325th was redesignated the '''325th Glider Infantry Regiment'''.\n{{Infobox command structure\n| name = 325th Glider Infantry Regiment\n| date = 1942-1945\n| parent = [[82nd Airborne Division]]\n| subordinate = Headquarters and Headquarters Company<br>1st Battalion<br>-Headquarters and Headquarters Company<br>-Company A<br>-Company B<br>-Company C<br>2nd Battalion<br>-Headquarters and Headquarters Company<br>-Company D<br>-Company E<br>-Company F<br>2nd Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry (attached)<br>-Headquarters and Headquarters Company<br>-Company D<br>-Company E<br>-Company F<br>Service Company<br>Medical Detachment\n}}\nAfter further training, the regiment deployed to North Africa under the command of Colonel [[Harry Lewis (United States Army officer)|Harry L.

DeGlopper]].<ref name=\"bragg.army.mil\"/>\n\n[[File:TROOPS OF 325TH GLIDER INFANTRY MOVING THROUGH FOG TO A NEW POSITION.jpg|thumb|left|Men of the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment moving through fog to a new position, Belgium, December 1944.]]\n\nCommitted to another glider-borne assault in September 1944, the regiment fought in Holland as part of [[Operation Market Garden]] and later saw service in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] under Colonel [[Charles Billingslea]].\n\n===Post World War II===\nAfter the war the regiment was reorganized and redesignated, 15 December 1947, as Company A, 325th Infantry Regiment. (Organized Reserves redesignated 25 March 1948 as the Organized Reserve Corps.)\n\nWithdrawn 15 November 1948 from the Organized Reserve Corps and allotted to the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. Reorganized and redesignated 15 December 1948 as Company A, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment.\n\nReorganized and redesignated 1 September 1957 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 325th Infantry Regiment, and remained assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated).\n\nThe regiment was again reorganized and redesignated on 25 May 1964 as the 325th Infantry Regiment.\n\n====Cold War====\nThe regiment returned to the 82nd Airborne Division on 15 December 1948 and was redesignated this time the 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment. On 1 May 1965, the 325th deployed to the revolution torn [[Dominican Republic]] as part of [[Dominican Civil War|Operation Power Pack]]. Sent with the mission of relieving marines and evacuating civilians, the regiment swept from the [[San Isidro Air Base]] into the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], neutralizing rebel forces. By the end of May, all resistance had crumbled and the regiment began peacekeeping and civil affairs operations. \n\nWhen the army's regimental system began affiliating separate units with existing regiments The [[509th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-509th]] based in Vicenza Italy was re-flagged as the 4/325 Airborne Battalion Combat Team (ABCT) Part of the NATO's Southern European Task Force (SETAF) In June 1986 The 4/325 began to rotate to Ft Bragg NC as the 3/325 rotated to Italy to assume the duties of the ABCT. During the Cold War the 3/325th ABCT was called upon to prepare/deploy as a rapid strike force to secure hostile airfields for follow on forces in several scenarios in the middle east including [[Operation Prime Chance]] in 1987.\n\n====Operation Urgent Fury====\nOn 25 October 1983, as part of [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]], the 325th Regiment spearheaded the 82nd Airborne's assault on the communist dominated island of [[Grenada]]. Landing at [[Maurice Bishop International Airport|Point Salines Airfield]], the 2nd and 3rd Battalions in conjunction with other U.S. forces overwhelmed all resistance within three days. One hundred thirty eight students were rescued. During this operation, Bravo Company, Second Battalion was given the mission to assault an area known as Little Havana. The Commander of Bravo Company, Captain Michael Ritz, decided to conduct a reconnaissance prior to the assault. At 04:30 on 26 October, Captain Ritz and his recon patrol were ambushed. Captain Ritz and SSG Gary Epps were killed but the rest of the patrol, although wounded, survived. Bravo Company soon discovered large caches of weapons and equipment.\n\n====Operation Just Cause====\nIn December 1989, the 4th Battalion \"Gold Falcons\" conducted a night parachute assault onto [[Tocumen International Airport|Torrijos International Airport]] in the Republic of [[Panama]], during Operation Just Cause, the [[United States invasion of Panama]]. This operation represented the first combat parachute assault since Vietnam War. The battalion was to jump, assemble, and perform a helicopter assault to Fort Cimmarron to secure the garrison. While this was taking place, Delta Company was tasked to stay behind and secure another airport within Panama City.\n\n====Gulf War====\n[[File:Members of the 1st Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, make their way through concertina wire.JPEG|thumbnail|Members of the regiment in a live fire demonstration during Operation Desert Shield.]]\n\nIn August 1990, as DRF 1 for the 82nd Airborne Division, the 4/325 was called on to spearhead the deployment of U.S. forces to the Persian Gulf in response to the [[Gulf War|Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait]]. Their mission was to secure the area north of the approach to Al Jubayl, [Saudi Arabia] and keep secure the approach to Al Jubayl until US Marine Forces arrived later in August. While reinforcements streamed into the country, the 325th along with the remainder of the 82nd Airborne Division conducted the most intensive combat trainup in the unit's history.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn mid-January, after the air war had begun, the 82nd Airborne Division displaced nearly {{convert|650|mi}} to the northwest near the Iraqi border in preparation for the commencement of the ground war. On 22 February, a day before the official start of the ground war - Task Force Falcon which comprised the 2/325<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/2-325air.htm</ref> and attached elements of the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]] along with soldiers of the French [[6th Light Armoured Brigade (France)|6th Light Armored Brigade]] began their drive into Iraq and were responsible for the destruction of massive amounts of enemy weapons, equipment, and ammunition. The 1/325 and 4/325, as trailing elements, were responsible for the capture of several thousand Iraqi soldiers. The division is credited with playing a major role in the highly successful 100-hour ground war.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The first division elements began redeploying to Fort Bragg on 7 March, and by early April the redeployment of the division was complete.\n\n===Operation Provide Comfort===\nOn 19 April 1991, the 3/325 Airborne Battalion Combat Team, stationed in [[Caserma Ederle]], [[Vicenza]], Italy and attached to the Southern European Task Force (SETAF), commanded by Lt. Col. (later General) John P. Abizaid, deployed to Northern Iraq as part of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] to secure from the 36 parallel to the northern border of Iraq and protect the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] population from [[Saddam Hussein]]'s brutality. Saddam Hussein's regime had previously murdered Kurds by using chemical gas and other means, causing the Kurds to retreat to the mountains of Northern Iraq and Turkey and to assist U.S. forces during the Gulf War. The U.S. and its allies were worried that Hussein's regime would seek revenge on the Kurds for assisting the Americans. The 3/325's effort to secure the Kurds over a large expanse of territory during Operation Provide Comfort earned the battalion a Unit Congressional Medal of Honor. The unit only lost one soldier in Provide Comfort, Specialist Lars Chew, attached to the recon squad, who was killed in a landmine incident.\n\n===Kosovo Humanitarian Mission===\nThe 3-325th infantrymen began arriving in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina on 18 December 1995, to set up perimeter security, which completed the first in a series of steps paving the way for the arrival of thousands of NATO troops. 3-325th ABCT was the lead element for Task Force Eagle, part of Operation Joint Endeavor.\n\nAfter serving as the primary protection force for Eagle Base, Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina since mid-December 1995, members of the 3rd Battalion, 325th Infantry (Airborne Combat Team), began to return to their home base of Vicenza, Italy.\n\nThe first contingent of about 80 soldiers, began leaving 31 January 1996. They included soldiers in D Battery, Airborne Field Artillery.\n\nMore than 800 members of the 3-325th ABCT landed on Bosnian soil, bringing with them artillery, engineers, transportation and cooks that all helped prepare Eagle Base, Tuzla, for the onslaught of soldiers moving through the base and into the US sector.\n\nDuring its stay, C Company temporarily operated an observation point in the Serbian sector on the zone of separation. From here the unit kept watch, monitoring for possible illegal troop movement in the zone.\n\n3/325 Airborne Battalion Combat Team Stationed in Vicenza Italy with SETAF\" Campaign: Operation Provide Comfort, deployed 19 April 1991, a Humanitarian mission in Northern Iraq to secure the 36 parallel to the north border of Iraq.  In the northern area Saddam Hussein's regime brutally murdered the Kurds using chemical weapons after the Kurds and PKK tried to help the United States overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime during the Gulf War. The unit earned a Humanitarian Ribbon and Congressional Medal of Honor for its service in Operation Provide Comfort.\n\n'''Kosovo campaign::\nThe 3-325th infantrymen began arriving in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina on 18 December 1995, to set up perimeter security, which completed the first in a series of steps paving the way for the arrival of thousands of NATO troops. 3-325th ABCT was the lead element for Task Force Eagle, part of Operation Joint Endeavor.\n\nAfter serving as the primary protection force for Eagle Base, Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina since mid-December 1995, members of the 3rd Battalion, 325th Infantry (Airborne Combat Team), began to return to their home base of Vicenza, Italy.\n\nThe first contingent of about 80 soldiers, began leaving 31 January 1996.

From here the unit kept watch, monitoring for possible illegal troop movement in the zone.\n\n===War on Terrorism===\n[[File:82ndinBaghdad.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the regiment waiting to dash across a street in Baghdad, Iraq, as part of their mission there searching for suspected militants.]]\n\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]], President [[George W. Bush]] called upon the American military to fight global terrorism. The Brigade\u2019s role in the Global War on Terror began with the invasion of Iraq.\n\nOn 14 February 2003 the regiment began to deploy to Kuwait as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].\n\nOn 28 March 2003, the regiment was called on to spearhead the 82nd\u2019s assault into Iraq in support of the [[Iraq War]]. During the initial invasion, the regiment was ordered to attack into the town of [[Samawah]] to seize four critical bridges over the [[Euphrates]] River. For its actions, the regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nIn April 2003, according to [[Human Rights Watch]], soldiers from the regiment fired indiscriminately into a crowd of Iraqi civilians protesting their presence in the city of [[Fallujah]], [[Fallujah killings of April 2003|killing and wounding many protesters]]. The battalion suffered no casualties.<ref name=hrw>{{cite report|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/06/16/iraq-us-should-investigate-al-falluja|title=Iraq: U.S. Should Investigate al-Falluja|date=17 June 2003|accessdate=1 September 2013|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>\n\nThe regiment also fought at [[Al Diwaniyah]], [[Ramadi]], [[Habbaniyah]] and [[Baghdad]]. After the [[Iraqi Army]] capitulated in May 2003, the 325th AIR remained in Baghdad to conduct combat and support and stability operations. Missions continued until February 2004, when, after almost a year of sustained combat operations, the regiment returned home to Fort Bragg.\n\nIn December 2004, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 325th deployed to Iraq to provide security for the country\u2019s first-ever free national elections.\n\nIn July 2005, the 1st Battalion deployed to Afghanistan in support of the Afghanistan national parliamentary elections.\n\nIn September 2005, only six months after the end of their last deployment to Iraq, the 2nd Battalion returned to Iraq once more to provide contingency support in [[Tal Afar]] during the Iraqi national elections. Their successes during the five-month deployment were commended by the President.\n\nIn January 2006, the 325th AIR underwent one of the largest restructurings in its history. As part of the army-wide transformation program, the regiment was reorganized into a modular structure to become the 2nd Brigade Combat Team. As part of the restructuring, the brigade lost one infantry battalion \u2013 the 3/325 \u2013 but gained an artillery battalion, a mounted reconnaissance and surveillance squadron, a support battalion, and a special troops battalion containing signal, military intelligence, military police and engineer companies.\n\nA year later, in January 2007, the 325th was tasked with spearheading the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. forces]] into Iraq to restore security to the capital of Baghdad.\n[[File:U.S. Army Soldiers, deployed in support of CJTF-OIR, assigned to 2nd BN, 325th AIR, 2nd BCT, 82nd Airborne Division, use a rooftop as an OP in Mosul, Iraq, March 7, 2017.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Army Soldiers, deployed in support of Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve, assigned to 2nd Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, use a rooftop as an observation post in Mosul Iraq, March 7, 2017.]]\nWith violence in Iraq escalating out of control, the President on 10 January announced a new strategy involving an increase of forces and a new emphasis on counter-insurgency tactics. Within a week of receiving orders, the brigade had 3,000 troops, 300 vehicles, and thousands of pieces of equipment on the way to Iraq.\n\nOver the next 15 months, the 325th moved into small outposts throughout the city and waged an aggressive campaign against [[Al Qaeda]] terrorists, Sunni insurgents, Shiite militias, and other elements committed to destroying the fragile Iraqi democracy. At the same time, they devoted thousands of hours of labor and millions of dollars to rebuilding and infrastructure projects. By Christmas of 2007, violence in their area of operations had declined by 95%, and violence throughout all of Iraq was down steeply. The regiment redeployed to Fort Bragg in March 2008.\n\nIn May 2011 the 325th deployed to Iraq, over the next 8 months the brigade conducted combat operations and close out of American footholds from Haditha, Ramadi and Baghdad. The brigade suffered the loss of the last American service member in Iraq, SPC. David E. Hickman, on 14 November 2011. By 25 December 2011 the brigade had been returned to Fort Bragg.\n\nIn January 2017, Task Force Falcon comprising approximately 1,700 soldiers deployed to Iraq in support of [[Operation Inherent Resolve]]. 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division assumed responsibility from Task Force Strike, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Union III in Baghdad.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Drew|title=2nd BCT, 82nd Airborne Division officially assumes Iraq mission (with video)|url=http://www.fayobserver.com/blogs/news/fort_bragg_report/nd-bct-nd-airborne-division-officially-assumes-iraq-mission-with/article_2215ea7e-de5c-11e6-9089-7b5406063990.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|agency=fayobserver|date=January 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Army M14 Sage Stock.jpg|thumb|A [[Designated Marksman]] provides security]]\n\n==Lineage and Honors==\n\n===Lineage===\n*Constituted 5 August 1917 in the National Army as the 325th Infantry and assigned to the 82d Division\n*Organized 1 September 1917 at Camp Gordon, Georgia\n*Demobilized 18\u201325 May 1919 at Camp Upton, New York\n*Reconstituted 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves as the 325th infantry and assigned to the 82d Division (later redesignated as the 82d Airborne Division)\n*Organized in January 1922 with headquarters at Albany, Georgia\n*Ordered into active military service 25 March 1942 and reorganized at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana\n*Reorganized and redesignated 15 August 1942 as the 325th Glider Infantry\n:(3d Battalion consolidated 6 April 1945 with the 2d Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry [see ANNEX], and consolidated unit designated 3d Battalion,325th Glider Infantry\n*Reorganized and redesignated 15 December 1947 as the 325th Infantry\n:(Organized Reserves redesignated 25 March 1948 as the Organized Reserve Corps)\n*Withdrawn 25 November 1948 from the Organized Reserve Corps and allotted to the Regular Army\n*Reorganized and redesignated 15 December 1948 as the 325th Airborne Infantry\n*Relieved 1 September 1957 from assignment to the 82d Airborne Division and reorganized as the 325th Infantry, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System\n*Withdrawn 1 July 1983 from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System\n*Redesignated 1 October 2005 as the 325th Infantry Regiment\n::ANNEX\n:*Constituted 23 July 1918 in the National Army as the 2d Battalion, 401st Infantry, an element of the 101st Division\n:*Demobilized 30 November 1918\n:*Reconstituted 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves as the 2d Battalion, 401st Infantry, an element of the 101st Division\n:*Organized in November 1921 in Headquarters at Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n:*Disbanded 15 August 1942; concurrently reconstituted in the Army of the United State as the 2d Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry, an element of the 101st Division, and activated at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana\n:*Disbanded 1 March 1945 in France\n:*Reconstituted 6 April 1945 in the Army of the United States as the 2d Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry; concurrently consolidated with the 3d Battalion, 325th Glider Infantry, and consolidated unit designated as the 3d Battalion, 325th Glider Infantry, an element of the 82d Airborne Division<ref name = \"CMH Lineage\">Department of the Army. \"Lineage and Honors Information: 325th Infantry Regiment.\" U.S. Army Center for Military History. 31 March 2015.

The subordinate units of the regiment constitute the bulk of the infantry elements assigned to the 2nd Infantry [[Brigade Combat Team]], [[82nd Airborne Division]].\n\nThe 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment deploys anywhere in the world, within 18 hours of notification. The [[regiment]] conducts forced entry parachute assaults to seize, retain and defend airfields or other assets, then increases combat power in order to control land, people, and resources.\n\n==History==\n\n===World War I===\nThe '''325th Infantry Regiment''' was activated in the [[History of the United States Army#National Army|National Army]] on August 25, 1917, almost five months after the [[American entry into World War I]]. The regiment was part of the [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd Division]]. Under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Walter M. Whitman (United States Army officer)|Walter M. Whitman]], a professional [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] officer, the regiment, which was composed of large numbers of wartime volunteers and [[Conscription in the United States|conscripts]], also known as draftees, trained at [[Fort Gordon|Camp Gordon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as part of the [[164th Infantry Brigade (United States)|164th Infantry Brigade]] of the 82nd Infantry Division. However, only a small [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of professional Regular Army soldiers were originally assigned to the 325th. The cadre was intended to train the many hundreds of new conscripts, most of whom recently called up and were very young and had had no prior [[military service]], who would soon be entering the camp.\n\nThe 325th, along with the [[326th Infantry Regiment (United States)|326th Infantry Regiment]], which also formed part of the 164th Infantry Brigade, was composed of men from the \"[[Deep South]]\". Soon after, the 82nd Division was instructed by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to send its men to other camps in order to help create other units. This left the regiment with only a small training cadre of just under 800 officers and men. They were replaced by conscripts from all 48 states, giving rise to the 82nd Division's nickname of the \"All Americans\".\n\nAfter further training in France, the regiment was committed to [[Toul]] sector from 18 June - 10 August 1918. After a brief rest, the regiment returned to the line to participate in the offensive to reduce the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|St. Mihiel salient]], securing the southern shoulder of the breach.\n\nFrom 26 September - 9 October 1918, the regiment waited to be committed to the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]. At 07:00 on 10 October, the regiment attacked to seize the Cornay Ridge, then continued the attack across the [[Aire (Aisne)|Aire River]]. Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]], the regiment returned to the United States and was demobilized on 18 May 1919 at [[Camp Upton]], [[New York State|New York]].<ref name=\"bragg.army.mil\">\"2nd Brigade Combat Team Origins.\" Fort Bragg: Home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces.

After initial training, the regiment was reorganized as a [[glider infantry]] unit when the 82nd Infantry Division was reorganized as the [[82nd Airborne Division]] in August 1942, and the 325th was redesignated the '''325th Glider Infantry Regiment'''.\n{{Infobox command structure\n| name = 325th Glider Infantry Regiment\n| date = 1942-1945\n| parent = [[82nd Airborne Division]]\n| subordinate = Headquarters and Headquarters Company<br>1st Battalion<br>-Headquarters and Headquarters Company<br>-Company A<br>-Company B<br>-Company C<br>2nd Battalion<br>-Headquarters and Headquarters Company<br>-Company D<br>-Company E<br>-Company F<br>2nd Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry (attached)<br>-Headquarters and Headquarters Company<br>-Company D<br>-Company E<br>-Company F<br>Service Company<br>Medical Detachment\n}}\nAfter further training, the regiment deployed to North Africa under the command of Colonel [[Harry Lewis (United States Army officer)|Harry L. Lewis]]. The regiment was not committed to combat until they conducted a [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|landing at Salerno]], Italy, on 15 September 1943. It was not, however, by [[Military glider|glider]] but by [[landing craft]]\n\nAfter service in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], the regiment deployed to England and conducted further training in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]]. Conducting a glider-borne assault on 7 June 1944, the day after the initial [[Normandy landings]], the regiment fought in Normandy for over a month, sustaining heavy casualties before being withdrawn to England. On 9 June 1944 the 325th earned its first and only [[Medal of Honor]] of the war, belonging to [[Private first class|Private First Class]] [[Charles N. DeGlopper]].<ref name=\"bragg.army.mil\"/>\n\n[[File:TROOPS OF 325TH GLIDER INFANTRY MOVING THROUGH FOG TO A NEW POSITION.jpg|thumb|left|Men of the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment moving through fog to a new position, Belgium, December 1944.]]\n\nCommitted to another glider-borne assault in September 1944, the regiment fought in Holland as part of [[Operation Market Garden]] and later saw service in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] under Colonel [[Charles Billingslea]].\n\n===Post World War II===\nAfter the war the regiment was reorganized and redesignated, 15 December 1947, as Company A, 325th Infantry Regiment. (Organized Reserves redesignated 25 March 1948 as the Organized Reserve Corps.)\n\nWithdrawn 15 November 1948 from the Organized Reserve Corps and allotted to the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. Reorganized and redesignated 15 December 1948 as Company A, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment.\n\nReorganized and redesignated 1 September 1957 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 325th Infantry Regiment, and remained assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated).\n\nThe regiment was again reorganized and redesignated on 25 May 1964 as the 325th Infantry Regiment.\n\n====Cold War====\nThe regiment returned to the 82nd Airborne Division on 15 December 1948 and was redesignated this time the 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment. On 1 May 1965, the 325th deployed to the revolution torn [[Dominican Republic]] as part of [[Dominican Civil War|Operation Power Pack]]. Sent with the mission of relieving marines and evacuating civilians, the regiment swept from the [[San Isidro Air Base]] into the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], neutralizing rebel forces. By the end of May, all resistance had crumbled and the regiment began peacekeeping and civil affairs operations. \n\nWhen the army's regimental system began affiliating separate units with existing regiments The [[509th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1-509th]] based in Vicenza Italy was re-flagged as the 4/325 Airborne Battalion Combat Team (ABCT) Part of the NATO's Southern European Task Force (SETAF) In June 1986 The 4/325 began to rotate to Ft Bragg NC as the 3/325 rotated to Italy to assume the duties of the ABCT. During the Cold War the 3/325th ABCT was called upon to prepare/deploy as a rapid strike force to secure hostile airfields for follow on forces in several scenarios in the middle east including [[Operation Prime Chance]] in 1987.\n\n====Operation Urgent Fury====\nOn 25 October 1983, as part of [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]], the 325th Regiment spearheaded the 82nd Airborne's assault on the communist dominated island of [[Grenada]]. Landing at [[Maurice Bishop International Airport|Point Salines Airfield]], the 2nd and 3rd Battalions in conjunction with other U.S. forces overwhelmed all resistance within three days. One hundred thirty eight students were rescued. During this operation, Bravo Company, Second Battalion was given the mission to assault an area known as Little Havana. The Commander of Bravo Company, Captain Michael Ritz, decided to conduct a reconnaissance prior to the assault. At 04:30 on 26 October, Captain Ritz and his recon patrol were ambushed. Captain Ritz and SSG Gary Epps were killed but the rest of the patrol, although wounded, survived. Bravo Company soon discovered large caches of weapons and equipment.\n\n====Operation Just Cause====\nIn December 1989, the 4th Battalion \"Gold Falcons\" conducted a night parachute assault onto [[Tocumen International Airport|Torrijos International Airport]] in the Republic of [[Panama]], during Operation Just Cause, the [[United States invasion of Panama]]. This operation represented the first combat parachute assault since Vietnam War. The battalion was to jump, assemble, and perform a helicopter assault to Fort Cimmarron to secure the garrison. While this was taking place, Delta Company was tasked to stay behind and secure another airport within Panama City.\n\n====Gulf War====\n[[File:Members of the 1st Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, make their way through concertina wire.JPEG|thumbnail|Members of the regiment in a live fire demonstration during Operation Desert Shield.]]\n\nIn August 1990, as DRF 1 for the 82nd Airborne Division, the 4/325 was called on to spearhead the deployment of U.S. forces to the Persian Gulf in response to the [[Gulf War|Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait]]. Their mission was to secure the area north of the approach to Al Jubayl, [Saudi Arabia] and keep secure the approach to Al Jubayl until US Marine Forces arrived later in August. While reinforcements streamed into the country, the 325th along with the remainder of the 82nd Airborne Division conducted the most intensive combat trainup in the unit's history.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn mid-January, after the air war had begun, the 82nd Airborne Division displaced nearly {{convert|650|mi}} to the northwest near the Iraqi border in preparation for the commencement of the ground war. On 22 February, a day before the official start of the ground war - Task Force Falcon which comprised the 2/325<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/2-325air.htm</ref> and attached elements of the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]] along with soldiers of the French [[6th Light Armoured Brigade (France)|6th Light Armored Brigade]] began their drive into Iraq and were responsible for the destruction of massive amounts of enemy weapons, equipment, and ammunition. The 1/325 and 4/325, as trailing elements, were responsible for the capture of several thousand Iraqi soldiers. The division is credited with playing a major role in the highly successful 100-hour ground war.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The first division elements began redeploying to Fort Bragg on 7 March, and by early April the redeployment of the division was complete.\n\n===Operation Provide Comfort===\nOn 19 April 1991, the 3/325 Airborne Battalion Combat Team, stationed in [[Caserma Ederle]], [[Vicenza]], Italy and attached to the Southern European Task Force (SETAF), commanded by Lt. Col. (later General) John P. Abizaid, deployed to Northern Iraq as part of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] to secure from the 36 parallel to the northern border of Iraq and protect the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] population from [[Saddam Hussein]]'s brutality. Saddam Hussein's regime had previously murdered Kurds by using chemical gas and other means, causing the Kurds to retreat to the mountains of Northern Iraq and Turkey and to assist U.S. forces during the Gulf War. The U.S. and its allies were worried that Hussein's regime would seek revenge on the Kurds for assisting the Americans. The 3/325's effort to secure the Kurds over a large expanse of territory during Operation Provide Comfort earned the battalion a Unit Congressional Medal of Honor. The unit only lost one soldier in Provide Comfort, Specialist Lars Chew, attached to the recon squad, who was killed in a landmine incident.\n\n===Kosovo Humanitarian Mission===\nThe 3-325th infantrymen began arriving in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina on 18 December 1995, to set up perimeter security, which completed the first in a series of steps paving the way for the arrival of thousands of NATO troops. 3-325th ABCT was the lead element for Task Force Eagle, part of Operation Joint Endeavor.\n\nAfter serving as the primary protection force for Eagle Base, Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina since mid-December 1995, members of the 3rd Battalion, 325th Infantry (Airborne Combat Team), began to return to their home base of Vicenza, Italy.\n\nThe first contingent of about 80 soldiers, began leaving 31 January 1996. They included soldiers in D Battery, Airborne Field Artillery.\n\nMore than 800 members of the 3-325th ABCT landed on Bosnian soil, bringing with them artillery, engineers, transportation and cooks that all helped prepare Eagle Base, Tuzla, for the onslaught of soldiers moving through the base and into the US sector.\n\nDuring its stay, C Company temporarily operated an observation point in the Serbian sector on the zone of separation. From here the unit kept watch, monitoring for possible illegal troop movement in the zone.\n\n3/325 Airborne Battalion Combat Team Stationed in Vicenza Italy with SETAF\" Campaign: Operation Provide Comfort, deployed 19 April 1991, a Humanitarian mission in Northern Iraq to secure the 36 parallel to the north border of Iraq.  In the northern area Saddam Hussein's regime brutally murdered the Kurds using chemical weapons after the Kurds and PKK tried to help the United States overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime during the Gulf War. The unit earned a Humanitarian Ribbon and Congressional Medal of Honor for its service in Operation Provide Comfort.\n\n'''Kosovo campaign::\nThe 3-325th infantrymen began arriving in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina on 18 December 1995, to set up perimeter security, which completed the first in a series of steps paving the way for the arrival of thousands of NATO troops. 3-325th ABCT was the lead element for Task Force Eagle, part of Operation Joint Endeavor.\n\nAfter serving as the primary protection force for Eagle Base, Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina since mid-December 1995, members of the 3rd Battalion, 325th Infantry (Airborne Combat Team), began to return to their home base of Vicenza, Italy.\n\nThe first contingent of about 80 soldiers, began leaving 31 January 1996.

From here the unit kept watch, monitoring for possible illegal troop movement in the zone.\n\n===War on Terrorism===\n[[File:82ndinBaghdad.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the regiment waiting to dash across a street in Baghdad, Iraq, as part of their mission there searching for suspected militants.]]\n\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]], President [[George W. Bush]] called upon the American military to fight global terrorism. The Brigade\u2019s role in the Global War on Terror began with the invasion of Iraq.\n\nOn 14 February 2003 the regiment began to deploy to Kuwait as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].\n\nOn 28 March 2003, the regiment was called on to spearhead the 82nd\u2019s assault into Iraq in support of the [[Iraq War]]. During the initial invasion, the regiment was ordered to attack into the town of [[Samawah]] to seize four critical bridges over the [[Euphrates]] River. For its actions, the regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nIn April 2003, according to [[Human Rights Watch]], soldiers from the regiment fired indiscriminately into a crowd of Iraqi civilians protesting their presence in the city of [[Fallujah]], [[Fallujah killings of April 2003|killing and wounding many protesters]]. The battalion suffered no casualties.<ref name=hrw>{{cite report|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/06/16/iraq-us-should-investigate-al-falluja|title=Iraq: U.S. Should Investigate al-Falluja|date=17 June 2003|accessdate=1 September 2013|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>\n\nThe regiment also fought at [[Al Diwaniyah]], [[Ramadi]], [[Habbaniyah]] and [[Baghdad]]. After the [[Iraqi Army]] capitulated in May 2003, the 325th AIR remained in Baghdad to conduct combat and support and stability operations. Missions continued until February 2004, when, after almost a year of sustained combat operations, the regiment returned home to Fort Bragg.\n\nIn December 2004, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 325th deployed to Iraq to provide security for the country\u2019s first-ever free national elections.\n\nIn July 2005, the 1st Battalion deployed to Afghanistan in support of the Afghanistan national parliamentary elections.\n\nIn September 2005, only six months after the end of their last deployment to Iraq, the 2nd Battalion returned to Iraq once more to provide contingency support in [[Tal Afar]] during the Iraqi national elections. Their successes during the five-month deployment were commended by the President.\n\nIn January 2006, the 325th AIR underwent one of the largest restructurings in its history. As part of the army-wide transformation program, the regiment was reorganized into a modular structure to become the 2nd Brigade Combat Team. As part of the restructuring, the brigade lost one infantry battalion \u2013 the 3/325 \u2013 but gained an artillery battalion, a mounted reconnaissance and surveillance squadron, a support battalion, and a special troops battalion containing signal, military intelligence, military police and engineer companies.\n\nA year later, in January 2007, the 325th was tasked with spearheading the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. forces]] into Iraq to restore security to the capital of Baghdad.\n[[File:U.S. Army Soldiers, deployed in support of CJTF-OIR, assigned to 2nd BN, 325th AIR, 2nd BCT, 82nd Airborne Division, use a rooftop as an OP in Mosul, Iraq, March 7, 2017.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Army Soldiers, deployed in support of Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve, assigned to 2nd Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, use a rooftop as an observation post in Mosul Iraq, March 7, 2017.]]\nWith violence in Iraq escalating out of control, the President on 10 January announced a new strategy involving an increase of forces and a new emphasis on counter-insurgency tactics. Within a week of receiving orders, the brigade had 3,000 troops, 300 vehicles, and thousands of pieces of equipment on the way to Iraq.\n\nOver the next 15 months, the 325th moved into small outposts throughout the city and waged an aggressive campaign against [[Al Qaeda]] terrorists, Sunni insurgents, Shiite militias, and other elements committed to destroying the fragile Iraqi democracy. At the same time, they devoted thousands of hours of labor and millions of dollars to rebuilding and infrastructure projects. By Christmas of 2007, violence in their area of operations had declined by 95%, and violence throughout all of Iraq was down steeply. The regiment redeployed to Fort Bragg in March 2008.\n\nIn May 2011 the 325th deployed to Iraq, over the next 8 months the brigade conducted combat operations and close out of American footholds from Haditha, Ramadi and Baghdad. The brigade suffered the loss of the last American service member in Iraq, SPC. David E. Hickman, on 14 November 2011. By 25 December 2011 the brigade had been returned to Fort Bragg.\n\nIn January 2017, Task Force Falcon comprising approximately 1,700 soldiers deployed to Iraq in support of [[Operation Inherent Resolve]]. 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division assumed responsibility from Task Force Strike, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Union III in Baghdad.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Drew|title=2nd BCT, 82nd Airborne Division officially assumes Iraq mission (with video)|url=http://www.fayobserver.com/blogs/news/fort_bragg_report/nd-bct-nd-airborne-division-officially-assumes-iraq-mission-with/article_2215ea7e-de5c-11e6-9089-7b5406063990.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|agency=fayobserver|date=January 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Army M14 Sage Stock.jpg|thumb|A [[Designated Marksman]] provides security]]\n\n==Lineage and Honors==\n\n===Lineage===\n*Constituted 5 August 1917 in the National Army as the 325th Infantry and assigned to the 82d Division\n*Organized 1 September 1917 at Camp Gordon, Georgia\n*Demobilized 18\u201325 May 1919 at Camp Upton, New York\n*Reconstituted 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves as the 325th infantry and assigned to the 82d Division (later redesignated as the 82d Airborne Division)\n*Organized in January 1922 with headquarters at Albany, Georgia\n*Ordered into active military service 25 March 1942 and reorganized at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana\n*Reorganized and redesignated 15 August 1942 as the 325th Glider Infantry\n:(3d Battalion consolidated 6 April 1945 with the 2d Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry [see ANNEX], and consolidated unit designated 3d Battalion,325th Glider Infantry\n*Reorganized and redesignated 15 December 1947 as the 325th Infantry\n:(Organized Reserves redesignated 25 March 1948 as the Organized Reserve Corps)\n*Withdrawn 25 November 1948 from the Organized Reserve Corps and allotted to the Regular Army\n*Reorganized and redesignated 15 December 1948 as the 325th Airborne Infantry\n*Relieved 1 September 1957 from assignment to the 82d Airborne Division and reorganized as the 325th Infantry, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System\n*Withdrawn 1 July 1983 from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System\n*Redesignated 1 October 2005 as the 325th Infantry Regiment\n::ANNEX\n:*Constituted 23 July 1918 in the National Army as the 2d Battalion, 401st Infantry, an element of the 101st Division\n:*Demobilized 30 November 1918\n:*Reconstituted 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves as the 2d Battalion, 401st Infantry, an element of the 101st Division\n:*Organized in November 1921 in Headquarters at Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n:*Disbanded 15 August 1942; concurrently reconstituted in the Army of the United State as the 2d Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry, an element of the 101st Division, and activated at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana\n:*Disbanded 1 March 1945 in France\n:*Reconstituted 6 April 1945 in the Army of the United States as the 2d Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry; concurrently consolidated with the 3d Battalion, 325th Glider Infantry, and consolidated unit designated as the 3d Battalion, 325th Glider Infantry, an element of the 82d Airborne Division<ref name = \"CMH Lineage\">Department of the Army. \"Lineage and Honors Information: 325th Infantry Regiment.\" U.S. Army Center for Military History. 31 March 2015.

The series served as a continuation of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978) and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on four consecutive Saturday nights from August 18 to September 8, 1979.\n\n==Production background==\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' had completed its eleven-season run on [[CBS]], [[Carol Burnett]] and her then husband-manager [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] were dining in a restaurant with friends (including [[Tim Conway]] from ''The Carol Burnett Show''). At that gathering, Burnett started reminiscing about the old show and making suggestions to Conway of future [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] that she wished they could create if the show was still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series; Conway immediately agreed.\n\nTaking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton then approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979, but CBS already had their schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea.

The guest stars during the four-week period were chronologically [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Sally Field]].  The show also introduced new sketches and characters, including another one of Conway's creations: a preacher named \"Rolly D.

In 1910, he was again arrested for taking part in a student demonstration in Moscow to mark the death of [[Leo Tolstoy]], calling for the abolition of the death penalty, but was released after one month in prison. He was rearrested in July 1911, as a member of the illegal RSDLP organisation in the [[Lefortovo District]], held in custody for three months, then deported to Vologda for three years. He returned in 1914, after the outbreak of war, and joined the [[Petrograd]] [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] party committee. Rearrested in May 1915, he was sentenced to three years deportation in [[Yeniseysk]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Haupt |first1=and Marie |title=Makers... |page=237}}</ref>\n \n=== Role in 1917 ===\nFreed as a result of the [[February Revolution]], Smilga returned to Petrograd, and became a leading figure in the Bolshevik organisation in the [[Kronstadt]] naval base. In May, he was Kronstadt's delegate to the Seventh Conference of the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, at which, despite his being only 24 years old, former fellow Siberian exiles put him forward as a member of the nine-member Central Committee. During 1917, he was [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Lenin's]] most consistent ally and supporter in calling for a second revolution led by the Bolsheviks. In June, Lenin and Smilga submitted their resignations from the Central Committee after the majority agreed to call off an anti-government demonstration due to be held on 10 June, but both resignations were rejected.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rabinowitch |first1=Alexander |title=The Bolsheviks Come to Power |date=1979 |publisher=NLB (New Left Books) |location=London |isbn=978-0-86091-017-6|page=66}}</ref> Smilga had wanted the demonstration to escalate into a revolutionary crisis in which power would be seized by the First Congress of Soviets, then in sessions, and urged that they should not \"hesitate to seize the Post Office, telegraph and arsenal, if events developed\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=The History of the Russian Revolution, volume one |date=1967 |publisher=Sphere |location=London |page=410}}</ref> - but the Congress, which was dominated by supporters of the [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] government, insisted on the demonstration being called off.\n\nDuring the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik party, in August 1917, Smilga declared that the soviets had \"committed suicide\" by not opposing the government, and that the party should be ready to seize power alone. \"No-one has the right to deprive us of this initiative if fate gives us another chance,\" he declared. Responding to a fellow Bolshevik who had urged caution, he said: \"Let me remind him of [[Georges Danton|Danton's]] words: 'In revolution, one needs boldness, boldness, and more boldness!\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rabinowitch |title=The Bolsheviks |page=88}}</ref>\n\nIn September, Smilga led the Bolshevik delegation at the Third Regional Congress of Soviets in [[Helsingfors]] (Helsinki)- the capital of Finland, which was then under Russian rule - and was elected ''Chairman of the Regional [[Committee]] of the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]'', a position carrying real power because of the collapse of the government authority in the wake of the [[Kornilov affair]]. Lenin was then hiding in Helsingfors, and \"entered into a sort of conspiracy with Smilga\", sending a long and angry letter on 27 September complaining that their fellow Bolsheviks were \"passing resolutions\" instead of \"preparing their armed forces for the overthrow of Kerensky.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=The History of the Russian Revolution, volume 3 |date=1967 |publisher=Sphere |location=London |page=129}}</ref> In mid-October, Smilga returned to Petrograd for the Congress of Northern Region Soviets, and stayed to help plan the Bolsheviks seizure of power. Just before the October revolution, he was sent back to Finland with orders to send  1500 armed sailors to Petrograd to act as reserves in case any troops from the front came to attack the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=History of the Russian Revolution|date=1934|publisher=The Camelot Press ltd|location=London|page=1070}}</ref>\n\n== Political career ==\n{{addref|Section|date=February 2019}}\nSmilga returned to Petrograd in January 1918, after the Bolsheviks had been routed in the brief civil war that led to the creation of an independent Finland, and served as a member of the praesidium of the Petrograd soviet and an editor of the Bolshevik newspaper ''Petrogradskaya Pravda''. He consistently backed Lenin's line over whether to sign the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which ended the war with Germany. He was transferred to political work in the Red Army at the start of the [[Russian Civil War]], and acted as a political commissar on every major front. He was chief political commissar on the southern front, for the campaign against the army of [[Anton Denikin|General Denikin]]. In January 1921, he was appointed political commissar on the Causasus front, and head of the Caucasian Labour Army.\n\n=== Relations with Trotsky ===\nDuring the early part of 1919, Smilga was involved in a conflict over conduct of the civil war, which saw him aligned with [[Joseph Stalin|Iosif Stalin]] against [[Leon Trotsky]] the People's Commissar for War and future leader of the Left Opposition. Smilga, [[Mikhail Lashevich]] and [[Sergey Ivanovich Gusev|Sergei Gusev]] were political commissars on the Eastern Front, fighting the army of [[Admiral Kolchak]]. The military commander was [[Sergey Kamenev|Sergei Kamenev]], a former Colonel in the [[Russian Imperial Army|Imperial Army]]. The Red Army commander in chief  [[Ioakhim Vatzetis]] wanted them to halt operations once they had driven Kolchak's army east of the Urals, rather than risk pursuing him into Siberia. Trotsky supported him. Smilga, Lashevich and Kamenev insisted on continuing the offensive, which was a spectacular success. In May, Smilga was appointed head of the Political Directorate of the Red Army. With Stalin's support, he proposed that Kamenev should replace Vatzetis as commander in chief, against Trotsky's advice. After Lenin had overruled Trotsky, in July 1919, Smilga, Gusev and Kamenev joined Trotsky on the six-member Revolutionary Council of War.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=Stalin, volume 2 |date=1969 |publisher=Panther |pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n\n=== Relations with Stalin ===\n[[File:Zinoviev Sverdlov Lashevich Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets.jpg|left|thumb|Smilga among the Communists on the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets Jul 06 1918]]\nDuring the war between Russia and Poland, in 1920, Smilga headed the Revolutionary Military Council of the [[Western Front (RSFSR)|Western Front]], whose military commander was [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]. When the Red Army met unexpectedly strong resistance as it reached the outskirts of Warsaw, Tukhachevsky ordered the Southwestern front to turn northwards, but Stalin, who was the front's political commissar, refused, preferring to capture [[Lwow]]. At the Tenth party congress in March 1921, there was a secret session on why Russia lost the war, at which - according to Trotsky - \"Stalin came out with the declaration, equally startling in its viciousness and untruthfulness, that Smilga...had 'deceived the Central Committee' by 'promising' to take Warsaw by a definite date...I protested on the spot against this startling insinuation: Smilga's 'promise' meant merely that he had ''hoped'' to take Warsaw.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |title=Stalin, volume two |page=128}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-war career ===\nSmilga was dropped from the Central Committee in March 1921. Soon afterwards, he was appointed head of the Main Directorate for Fuel. He was also vice-chairman of the [[Vesenkha]] from 1921 to 1928, and of the [[Gosplan]] from 1924 to 1926. From 1925, he was a prominent supporter of the Left Opposition, one of only half a dozen oppositionists elected a full member of the Central Committee in December 1925 - despite the fact that in August 1925, Stalin complained about Smilga's influence in Gosplan and denounced him as a \"fake economic leader.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lars T.

His departure was the occasion for the last public demonstration against the Stalin regime, in which about a thousand people gathered at the railway to show solidarity.\n\nSmilga was expelled from the Central Committee on 14 November 1927, expelled from the communist party in December, and deported to a remote area of Siberia. In July 1929, along with [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]], [[Karl Radek]], he renounced his support for the Left Opposition, citing the reason that [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rise would have meant the application of much of the Left's recommended policies, and that the dangers the Soviet state faced, from the outside as well as from within, required their \"return to the Party\". About 400 other deportees followed their lead.

In 1910, he was again arrested for taking part in a student demonstration in Moscow to mark the death of [[Leo Tolstoy]], calling for the abolition of the death penalty, but was released after one month in prison. He was rearrested in July 1911, as a member of the illegal RSDLP organisation in the [[Lefortovo District]], held in custody for three months, then deported to Vologda for three years. He returned in 1914, after the outbreak of war, and joined the [[Petrograd]] [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] party committee. Rearrested in May 1915, he was sentenced to three years deportation in [[Yeniseysk]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Haupt |first1=and Marie |title=Makers... |page=237}}</ref>\n \n=== Role in 1917 ===\nFreed as a result of the [[February Revolution]], Smilga returned to Petrograd, and became a leading figure in the Bolshevik organisation in the [[Kronstadt]] naval base. In May, he was Kronstadt's delegate to the Seventh Conference of the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, at which, despite his being only 24 years old, former fellow Siberian exiles put him forward as a member of the nine-member Central Committee. During 1917, he was [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Lenin's]] most consistent ally and supporter in calling for a second revolution led by the Bolsheviks. In June, Lenin and Smilga submitted their resignations from the Central Committee after the majority agreed to call off an anti-government demonstration due to be held on 10 June, but both resignations were rejected.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rabinowitch |first1=Alexander |title=The Bolsheviks Come to Power |date=1979 |publisher=NLB (New Left Books) |location=London |isbn=978-0-86091-017-6|page=66}}</ref> Smilga had wanted the demonstration to escalate into a revolutionary crisis in which power would be seized by the First Congress of Soviets, then in sessions, and urged that they should not \"hesitate to seize the Post Office, telegraph and arsenal, if events developed\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=The History of the Russian Revolution, volume one |date=1967 |publisher=Sphere |location=London |page=410}}</ref> - but the Congress, which was dominated by supporters of the [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] government, insisted on the demonstration being called off.\n\nDuring the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik party, in August 1917, Smilga declared that the soviets had \"committed suicide\" by not opposing the government, and that the party should be ready to seize power alone. \"No-one has the right to deprive us of this initiative if fate gives us another chance,\" he declared. Responding to a fellow Bolshevik who had urged caution, he said: \"Let me remind him of [[Georges Danton|Danton's]] words: 'In revolution, one needs boldness, boldness, and more boldness!\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rabinowitch |title=The Bolsheviks |page=88}}</ref>\n\nIn September, Smilga led the Bolshevik delegation at the Third Regional Congress of Soviets in [[Helsingfors]] (Helsinki)- the capital of Finland, which was then under Russian rule - and was elected ''Chairman of the Regional [[Committee]] of the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]'', a position carrying real power because of the collapse of the government authority in the wake of the [[Kornilov affair]]. Lenin was then hiding in Helsingfors, and \"entered into a sort of conspiracy with Smilga\", sending a long and angry letter on 27 September complaining that their fellow Bolsheviks were \"passing resolutions\" instead of \"preparing their armed forces for the overthrow of Kerensky.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=The History of the Russian Revolution, volume 3 |date=1967 |publisher=Sphere |location=London |page=129}}</ref> In mid-October, Smilga returned to Petrograd for the Congress of Northern Region Soviets, and stayed to help plan the Bolsheviks seizure of power. Just before the October revolution, he was sent back to Finland with orders to send  1500 armed sailors to Petrograd to act as reserves in case any troops from the front came to attack the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=History of the Russian Revolution|date=1934|publisher=The Camelot Press ltd|location=London|page=1070}}</ref>\n\n== Political career ==\n{{addref|Section|date=February 2019}}\nSmilga returned to Petrograd in January 1918, after the Bolsheviks had been routed in the brief civil war that led to the creation of an independent Finland, and served as a member of the praesidium of the Petrograd soviet and an editor of the Bolshevik newspaper ''Petrogradskaya Pravda''. He consistently backed Lenin's line over whether to sign the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which ended the war with Germany. He was transferred to political work in the Red Army at the start of the [[Russian Civil War]], and acted as a political commissar on every major front. He was chief political commissar on the southern front, for the campaign against the army of [[Anton Denikin|General Denikin]]. In January 1921, he was appointed political commissar on the Causasus front, and head of the Caucasian Labour Army.\n\n=== Relations with Trotsky ===\nDuring the early part of 1919, Smilga was involved in a conflict over conduct of the civil war, which saw him aligned with [[Joseph Stalin|Iosif Stalin]] against [[Leon Trotsky]] the People's Commissar for War and future leader of the Left Opposition. Smilga, [[Mikhail Lashevich]] and [[Sergey Ivanovich Gusev|Sergei Gusev]] were political commissars on the Eastern Front, fighting the army of [[Admiral Kolchak]]. The military commander was [[Sergey Kamenev|Sergei Kamenev]], a former Colonel in the [[Russian Imperial Army|Imperial Army]]. The Red Army commander in chief  [[Ioakhim Vatzetis]] wanted them to halt operations once they had driven Kolchak's army east of the Urals, rather than risk pursuing him into Siberia. Trotsky supported him. Smilga, Lashevich and Kamenev insisted on continuing the offensive, which was a spectacular success. In May, Smilga was appointed head of the Political Directorate of the Red Army. With Stalin's support, he proposed that Kamenev should replace Vatzetis as commander in chief, against Trotsky's advice. After Lenin had overruled Trotsky, in July 1919, Smilga, Gusev and Kamenev joined Trotsky on the six-member Revolutionary Council of War.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |first1=Leon |title=Stalin, volume 2 |date=1969 |publisher=Panther |pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n\n=== Relations with Stalin ===\n[[File:Zinoviev Sverdlov Lashevich Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets.jpg|left|thumb|Smilga among the Communists on the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets Jul 06 1918]]\nDuring the war between Russia and Poland, in 1920, Smilga headed the Revolutionary Military Council of the [[Western Front (RSFSR)|Western Front]], whose military commander was [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]. When the Red Army met unexpectedly strong resistance as it reached the outskirts of Warsaw, Tukhachevsky ordered the Southwestern front to turn northwards, but Stalin, who was the front's political commissar, refused, preferring to capture [[Lwow]]. At the Tenth party congress in March 1921, there was a secret session on why Russia lost the war, at which - according to Trotsky - \"Stalin came out with the declaration, equally startling in its viciousness and untruthfulness, that Smilga...had 'deceived the Central Committee' by 'promising' to take Warsaw by a definite date...I protested on the spot against this startling insinuation: Smilga's 'promise' meant merely that he had ''hoped'' to take Warsaw.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trotsky |title=Stalin, volume two |page=128}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-war career ===\nSmilga was dropped from the Central Committee in March 1921. Soon afterwards, he was appointed head of the Main Directorate for Fuel. He was also vice-chairman of the [[Vesenkha]] from 1921 to 1928, and of the [[Gosplan]] from 1924 to 1926. From 1925, he was a prominent supporter of the Left Opposition, one of only half a dozen oppositionists elected a full member of the Cnetral Committee in December 1925 - despite the fact that in August 1925, Stalin complained about Smilga's influence in Gosplan and denounced him as a \"fake economic leader.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lars T.

His departure was the occasion for the last public demonstration against the Stalin regime, in which about a thousand people gathered at the railway to show solidarity.\n\nSmilga was expelled from the Central Committee on 14 November 1927, expelled from the communist party in December, and deported to a remote area of Siberia. In July 1929, along with [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]], [[Karl Radek]], he renounced his support for the Left Opposition, citing the reason that [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rise would have meant the application of much of the Left's recommended policies, and that the dangers the Soviet state faced, from the outside as well as from within, required their \"return to the Party\". About 400 other deportees followed their lead. His membership of the communist party was restored in 1930, and he was allowed to return to economic work.\n\n=== Arrest and execution ===\nSmilga was arrested on the night of 1\u20132 January 1935, in the wake of [[Sergey Kirov|Kirov's]] assassination, and sentenced to five years imprisonment.

Greater values of <math>\\delta</math> lead to stronger reductions of the basis.\nInitially, A. Lenstra, H. Lenstra and L. Lov\u00e1sz demonstrated the LLL-reduction algorithm for <math>\\delta = \\frac{3}{4}</math>.\nNote that although LLL-reduction is well-defined for <math>\\delta = 1</math>, the polynomial-time complexity is guaranteed only\nfor <math>\\delta</math> in <math>(0.25,1)</math>.\n\nThe LLL algorithm computes LLL-reduced bases.

For example, if it is believed that ''r''=1.618034 is a (slightly rounded) [[Root of a function|root]] to an unknown [[quadratic equation]] with integer coefficients, one may apply LLL reduction to the lattice in <math>\\mathbf{Z}^4</math> spanned by <math>[1,0,0,10000r^2], [0,1,0,10000r],</math> and <math>[0,0,1,10000]</math>. The first vector in the reduced basis will be an integer [[linear combination]] of these three, thus necessarily of the form <math>[a,b,c,10000(ar^2+br+c)]</math>; but such a vector is \"short\" only if ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are small and <math>ar^2+br+c</math> is even smaller. Thus the first three entries of this short vector are likely to be the coefficients of the integral quadratic [[polynomial]] which has ''r'' as a root. In this example the LLL algorithm finds the shortest vector to be [1, -1, -1, 0.00025] and indeed <math>x^2-x-1</math> has a root equal to the [[golden ratio]], 1.6180339887....\n\n==Properties of LLL-reduced basis==\nLet <math>\\mathbf{B}=\\{ \\mathbf{b}_1,\\mathbf{b}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_n \\}</math> be a <math>\\delta</math>-LLL-reduced basis of a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] <math>\\mathcal L</math>.

For example, if it is believed that ''r''=1.618034 is a (slightly rounded) [[Root of a function|root]] to an unknown [[quadratic equation]] with integer coefficients, one may apply LLL reduction to the lattice in <math>\\mathbf{Z}^4</math> spanned by <math>[1,0,0,10000r^2], [0,1,0,10000r],</math> and <math>[0,0,1,10000]</math>. The first vector in the reduced basis will be an integer [[linear combination]] of these three, thus necessarily of the form <math>[a,b,c,10000(ar^2+br+c)]</math>; but such a vector is \"short\" only if ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are small and <math>ar^2+br+c</math> is even smaller. Thus the first three entries of this short vector are likely to be the coefficients of the integral quadratic [[polynomial]] which has ''r'' as a root. In this example the LLL algorithm finds the shortest vector to be [1, -1, -1, 0.00025] and indeed <math>x^2-x-1</math> has a root equal to the [[golden ratio]], 1.6180339887....\n\n==Properties of LLL-reduced basis==\nLet <math>\\mathbf{B}=\\{ \\mathbf{b}_1,\\mathbf{b}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_n \\}</math> be a <math>\\delta</math>-LLL-reduced basis of a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] <math>\\mathcal L</math>.

It is carried out to normalize \u2013 or modulate \u2013 [[nervous tissue]] function. Neuromodulation is an evolving therapy that can involve a range of electromagnetic stimuli such as a magnetic field ([[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|rTMS]]), an [[electric current]], or a drug instilled directly in the subdural space (intrathecal drug delivery). Emerging applications involve targeted introduction of genes or gene regulators and light ([[optogenetics]]), and by 2014, these had been at minimum demonstrated in mammalian models, or first-in-human data had been acquired.<ref name=INS>{{cite web |url= http://www.neuromodulation.com/|title= International Neuromodulation Society home page|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref> The most clinical experience has been with electrical stimulation.\n\nNeuromodulation, whether electrical or magnetic, employs the body's natural biological response by stimulating nerve cell activity that can influence populations of nerves by releasing transmitters, such as [[dopamine]], or other chemical messengers such as the [[peptide]] [[Substance P]], that can modulate the excitability and firing patterns of neural circuits. There may also be more direct electrophysiological effects on neural membranes as the mechanism of action of electrical interaction with neural elements. The end effect is a \"normalization\" of a neural network function from its perturbed state. Presumed mechanisms of action for neurostimulation include depolarizing blockade, stochastic normalization of [[neural firing]], [[axonal blockade]], reduction of neural firing keratosis, and suppression of neural network oscillations.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Karas | first1 = Patrick J. | last2 = Mikell | first2 = Charles B. | last3 = Christian | first3 = Eisha | last4 = Liker | first4 = Mark A. | last5 = Sheth | first5 = Sameer A. | title = Deep brain stimulation: a mechanistic and clinical update. | journal = Neurosurgical Focus | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = E1 |date=2013 | doi = 10.3171/2013.9.focus13383| pmid = 24175861}}</ref> Although the exact mechanisms of neurostimulation are not known, the empirical effectiveness has led to considerable application clinically.\n\nExisting and emerging neuromodulation treatments also include application in medication-resistant [[epilepsy]],<ref name=\"Al-Otaibi 2011\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Al-Otaibi | first1 = FA. | last2 = Hamani | first2 = C. | last3 = Lozano | first3 = AM. | title = Neuromodulation in epilepsy. | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 957\u201379; discussion 979 |date=Oct 2011 | doi = 10.1227/NEU.0b013e31822b30cd | pmid = 21716154 }}</ref> chronic head pain conditions, and functional therapy ranging from bladder and bowel or respiratory control to improvement of sensory deficits, such as hearing ([[cochlear implants]] and [[auditory brainstem implant]]s) and vision ([[retinal implant]]s).<ref>Krames, Elliot S.; [[Peckham, P.

The stimulator, with the battery, similar to a pacemaker, may also be implanted, or may remain outside the body.\n\nIn general, neuromodulation systems deliver electrical currents and typically consist of the following components: An epidural, subdural or parenchymal electrode placed via minimally invasive needle techniques (so-called percutaneous leads) or an open surgical exposure to the target (surgical \"paddle\" or \"grid\" electrodes), or stereotactic implants for the central nervous system, and an implanted pulse generator (IPG).  Depending on the distance from the electrode access point an extension cable may also be added into the system. The IPG can have either a non-rechargeable battery needing replacement every 2\u20135 years (depending on stimulation parameters) or a rechargeable battery that is replenished via an external inductive charging system.\n\nAlthough most systems operate via delivery of a constant train of stimulation, there is now the advent of so-called \"feed-forward\" stimulation where the device's activation is contingent on a physiological event, such as an epileptic seizure. In this circumstance, the device is activated and delivers a desynchronizing pulse to the cortical area that is undergoing an epileptic seizure. This concept of feed-forward stimulation will likely become more prevalent as physiological markers of targeted diseases and neural disorders are discovered and verified.<ref name=\"pmid18164485\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun FT, Morrell MJ, Wharen RE | title = Responsive cortical stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 68\u201374 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18164485 | pmc = 5084128 | doi = 10.1016/j.nurt.2007.10.069 }}</ref> The on-demand stimulation may contribute to longer battery life, if sensing and signal-processing demands of the system are sufficiently power-efficient.

Earlier practitioners of deep brain stimulation in the latter half of the 20th century (Delgado, Heath, Hosbuchi.

Heath, in the 1950s, stimulated subcortical areas and made detailed observations of behavioral changes. A new understanding of pain perception was ushered in<!--not a mistake--> in 1965, with the Gate Theory of Wall and Melzack.<ref name = \"Melzack&Wall61\u201369\">{{vcite book | author = Wall PD & Melzack R | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The challenge of pain | edition = 2nd | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 1996 | pages = 61\u201369 | isbn = 0-14-025670-9 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref> Although now considered oversimplified, the theory held that pain transmissions from small nerve fibers can be overridden, or the gate \"closed\", by competing transmissions along the wider touch nerve fibers. Building on that concept, in 1967, the first dorsal column stimulator for pain control was demonstrated by Dr. Norm Shealy at Western Reserve Medical School, using a design adapted by Tom Mortimer, a graduate student at Case Institute of Technology, from cardiac nerve stimulators by Medtronic, Inc., where he had a professional acquaintance who shared the circuit diagram.

Delgado hinted at the power of neuromodulation with his implants in the bovine septal region and the ability of electrical stimulation to blunt or alter behavior. Further attempts at this \"behavioral modification\" in humans were difficult and seldom reliable, and contributed to the overall lack progress in central nervous system neuromodulation from that era. Attempts at intractable pain syndromes were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. In particular, the so-called DBS \"zero\" electrode, (consisting of a contact loop on its end) had an unacceptable failure rate and revisions were fraught with more risk than benefit. Overall, attempts at using electrical stimulation for \"behavioral modification\" were difficult and seldom reliable, slowing development of DBS. Attempts at addressing intractable pain syndromes with DBS were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. A number of physicians who hoped to address hitherto intractable problems sought development of more specialized equipment; for instance, in the 1960s, Wall's colleague Bill Sweet recruited engineer Roger Avery to make an implantable peripheral nerve stimulator. Avery started the Avery Company, which made a number of implantable stimulators. Shortly before his retirement in 1983, he submitted data requested by the FDA, which had begun to regulate medical devices following a 1977 meeting on the topic, regarding DBS for chronic pain. Medtronic and Neuromed also made deep brain stimulators at the time, but reportedly felt a complex safety and efficacy clinical trial in patients who were difficult to evaluate would be too costly for the size of the potential patient base, so did not submit clinical data on DBS for chronic pain to the FDA, and that indication was de-approved.<ref name=krames/>{{rp|13\u201316}}<ref name=lozano-textbook-2009 /><ref name=bittar-meta-analysis />\n\nHowever, near this time in France and elsewhere, DBS was investigated as a substitute for lesioning of brain nuclei to control motor symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and by the mid-1990s, this reversible, non-destructive stimulation therapy had become the primary application of DBS in appropriate patients, to slow progression of movement impairment from the disease and reduce side effects from long-term, escalating medication use.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Benabid | first1 = AL. | last2 = Chabardes | first2 = S. |last3 = Torres | first3 = N. | last4 = Piallat | first4 = B. | last5 = Krack | first5 = P. | last6 = Fraix | first6 = V. | last7 = Pollak | first7 = P.|title = Functional neurosurgery for movement disorders: a historial perspective. | journal = Prog.

The company's first investment in 2013 involved a small startup company, SetPoint Medical, which was developing neurostimulators to address inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cookson |first=Clive |date=31 July 2012 |title=Healthcare: Into the cortex Scientific advances on the brain promise to transform the pharmaceutical industry |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/487fb69e-db1f-11e1-8074-00144feab49a.html |newspaper=Financial Times |location=London |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Famm |first=Kristoffer |last2=Litt |first2=Brian |last3=Tracey |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Boyden |first4=Edward S.|last5= Siaoui |first5= Moncef |date=11 April 2013 |title=Drug discovery: A jump-start for electroceuticals |journal=Nature |volume= 496 |issue= 7444|pages=159\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/496159a |pmid=23579662 |pmc=4179459}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=John Carroll |title=GlaxoSmithKline stakes a pioneering effort to launch 'electroceutical' R&D |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/glaxosmithkline-stakes-pioneering-effort-launch-electroceutical-rd/2013-04-10 |newspaper=Fierce Biotech |location= |date=10 April 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the electroceuticals quest aims to find the electro-neural signature of disease and at a cellular level, in real time, play back the more normal electro-signature to help maintain the neural signature in the normal state. Unlike preceding neuromodulation therapy methods, the approach would not involve electrical leads stimulating large nerves or spinal cords or brain centers. It might involve methods that are emerging within the neuromodulation family of therapies, such as optogenetics or some new nanotechnology. Disease states and conditions that have been discussed as targets for future electroceutical therapy include diabetes, infertility, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Birmingham |first1=Karen |authorlink1= |last2=Gradinaru |first2=Viviana |authorlink2= |last3=Anikeeva |first3=Polina |authorlink3= |last4=Grill |first4=Warren M. |last5=McLaughlin |first5=Bryan |last6=Pansricha |first6=Pankaj |last7=Weber |first7=Douglas |last8=Ludwig |first8=Kip |authorlink9= |last9=Kristoffer |first9=Famm |first10=Victor |last10=Pikov |title=Bioelectronic medicines: A research roadmap |script-title= |trans-title= |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |type= |series= |language= |edition= |publication-date=30 May 2014 |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=399\u2013400 |doi=10.1038/nrd4351 |pmid=24875080 |year=2014|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/47172/7/nrd4351-s1.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alim-Louis Benabid]] \n* [[Brain computer interface|Brain computer interfacing (BCI)]]\n* [[BrainGate]]\n* [[International Neuromodulation Society]]\n* [[Interventional pain management]]\n* [[North American Neuromodulation Society]]\n* [[Neuromodulation (journal)|''Neuromodulation'' (journal)]]\n* [[Neuroprosthetics]]\n* [[Neurotechnology]]\n* [[Neurostimulation]]\n* [[Optogenetics]]\n* [[Visual prosthesis]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n\n* {{Cite journal  | last1 = Al\u00f3 | first1 = KM. | last2 = Holsheimer | first2 = J. | title = New trends in neuromodulation for the management of neuropathic pain. | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 690\u2013703; discussion 703\u20134 |date=Apr 2002 | pmid = 11904018 | doi=10.1097/00006123-200204000-00003}}\n* Althaus J: A Treatise on Medical Electricity, Theoretical and Practical; and Its Use in the Treatment of Paralysis, Neuralgia, and Other Diseases Philadelphia, Lindsay & Blakiston, 1860;163-170.\n* {{Cite journal  | last1 = Andrews | first1 = RJ. | title = Neuromodulation: advances in the next five years. | journal = Ann.

It is carried out to normalize \u2013 or modulate \u2013 [[nervous tissue]] function. Neuromodulation is an evolving therapy that can involve a range of electromagnetic stimuli such as a magnetic field ([[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|rTMS]]), an [[electric current]], or a drug instilled directly in the subdural space (intrathecal drug delivery). Emerging applications involve targeted introduction of genes or gene regulators and light ([[optogenetics]]), and by 2014, these had been at minimum demonstrated in mammalian models, or first-in-human data had been acquired.<ref name=INS>{{cite web |url= http://www.neuromodulation.com/|title= International Neuromodulation Society home page|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref> The most clinical experience has been with electrical stimulation.\n\nNeuromodulation, whether electrical or magnetic, employs the body's natural biological response by stimulating nerve cell activity that can influence populations of nerves by releasing transmitters, such as [[dopamine]], or other chemical messengers such as the [[peptide]] [[Substance P]], that can modulate the excitability and firing patterns of neural circuits. There may also be more direct electrophysiological effects on neural membranes as the mechanism of action of electrical interaction with neural elements. The end effect is a \"normalization\" of a neural network function from its perturbed state. Presumed mechanisms of action for neurostimulation include depolarizing blockade, stochastic normalization of [[neural firing]], [[axonal blockade]], reduction of neural firing keratosis, and suppression of neural network oscillations.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Karas | first1 = Patrick J. | last2 = Mikell | first2 = Charles B. | last3 = Christian | first3 = Eisha | last4 = Liker | first4 = Mark A. | last5 = Sheth | first5 = Sameer A. | title = Deep brain stimulation: a mechanistic and clinical update. | journal = Neurosurgical Focus | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = E1 |date=2013 | doi = 10.3171/2013.9.focus13383| pmid = 24175861}}</ref> Although the exact mechanisms of neurostimulation are not known, the empirical effectiveness has led to considerable application clinically.\n\nExisting and emerging neuromodulation treatments also include application in medication-resistant [[epilepsy]],<ref name=\"Al-Otaibi 2011\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Al-Otaibi | first1 = FA. | last2 = Hamani | first2 = C. | last3 = Lozano | first3 = AM. | title = Neuromodulation in epilepsy. | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 957\u201379; discussion 979 |date=Oct 2011 | doi = 10.1227/NEU.0b013e31822b30cd | pmid = 21716154 }}</ref> chronic head pain conditions, and functional therapy ranging from bladder and bowel or respiratory control to improvement of sensory deficits, such as hearing ([[cochlear implants]] and [[auditory brainstem implant]]s) and vision ([[retinal implant]]s).<ref>Krames, Elliot S.; [[Peckham, P.

The stimulator, with the battery, similar to a pacemaker, may also be implanted, or may remain outside the body.\n\nIn general, neuromodulation systems deliver electrical currents and typically consist of the following components: An epidural, subdural or parenchymal electrode placed via minimally invasive needle techniques (so-called percutaneous leads) or an open surgical exposure to the target (surgical \"paddle\" or \"grid\" electrodes), or stereotactic implants for the central nervous system, and an implanted pulse generator (IPG).  Depending on the distance from the electrode access point an extension cable may also be added into the system. The IPG can have either a non-rechargeable battery needing replacement every 2\u20135 years (depending on stimulation parameters) or a rechargeable battery that is replenished via an external inductive charging system.\n\nAlthough most systems operate via delivery of a constant train of stimulation, there is now the advent of so-called \"feed-forward\" stimulation where the device's activation is contingent on a physiological event, such as an epileptic seizure. In this circumstance, the device is activated and delivers a desynchronizing pulse to the cortical area that is undergoing an epileptic seizure. This concept of feed-forward stimulation will likely become more prevalent as physiological markers of targeted diseases and neural disorders are discovered and verified.<ref name=\"pmid18164485\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun FT, Morrell MJ, Wharen RE | title = Responsive cortical stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 68\u201374 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18164485 | pmc = 5084128 | doi = 10.1016/j.nurt.2007.10.069 }}</ref> The on-demand stimulation may contribute to longer battery life, if sensing and signal-processing demands of the system are sufficiently power-efficient.

Earlier practitioners of deep brain stimulation in the latter half of the 20th century (Delgado, Heath, Hosbuchi.

Heath, in the 1950s, stimulated subcortical areas and made detailed observations of behavioral changes. A new understanding of pain perception was ushered in<!--not a mistake--> in 1965, with the Gate Theory of Wall and Melzack.<ref name = \"Melzack&Wall61\u201369\">{{vcite book | author = Wall PD & Melzack R | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The challenge of pain | edition = 2nd | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 1996 | pages = 61\u201369 | isbn = 0-14-025670-9 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref> Although now considered oversimplified, the theory held that pain transmissions from small nerve fibers can be overridden, or the gate \"closed\", by competing transmissions along the wider touch nerve fibers. Building on that concept, in 1967, the first dorsal column stimulator for pain control was demonstrated by Dr. Norm Shealy at Western Reserve Medical School, using a design adapted by Tom Mortimer, a graduate student at Case Institute of Technology, from cardiac nerve stimulators by Medtronic, Inc., where he had a professional acquaintance who shared the circuit diagram.

Delgado hinted at the power of neuromodulation with his implants in the bovine septal region and the ability of electrical stimulation to blunt or alter behavior. Further attempts at this \"behavioral modification\" in humans were difficult and seldom reliable, and contributed to the overall lack progress in central nervous system neuromodulation from that era. Attempts at intractable pain syndromes were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. In particular, the so-called DBS \"zero\" electrode, (consisting of a contact loop on its end) had an unacceptable failure rate and revisions were fraught with more risk than benefit. Overall, attempts at using electrical stimulation for \"behavioral modification\" were difficult and seldom reliable, slowing development of DBS. Attempts at addressing intractable pain syndromes with DBS were met with more success, but again hampered by the quality of technology. A number of physicians who hoped to address hitherto intractable problems sought development of more specialized equipment; for instance, in the 1960s, Wall's colleague Bill Sweet recruited engineer Roger Avery to make an implantable peripheral nerve stimulator. Avery started the Avery Company, which made a number of implantable stimulators. Shortly before his retirement in 1983, he submitted data requested by the FDA, which had begun to regulate medical devices following a 1977 meeting on the topic, regarding DBS for chronic pain. Medtronic and Neuromed also made deep brain stimulators at the time, but reportedly felt a complex safety and efficacy clinical trial in patients who were difficult to evaluate would be too costly for the size of the potential patient base, so did not submit clinical data on DBS for chronic pain to the FDA, and that indication was de-approved.<ref name=krames/>{{rp|13\u201316}}<ref name=lozano-textbook-2009 /><ref name=bittar-meta-analysis />\n\nHowever, near this time in France and elsewhere, DBS was investigated as a substitute for lesioning of brain nuclei to control motor symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and by the mid-1990s, this reversible, non-destructive stimulation therapy had become the primary application of DBS in appropriate patients, to slow progression of movement impairment from the disease and reduce side effects from long-term, escalating medication use.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Benabid | first1 = AL. | last2 = Chabardes | first2 = S. |last3 = Torres | first3 = N. | last4 = Piallat | first4 = B. | last5 = Krack | first5 = P. | last6 = Fraix | first6 = V. | last7 = Pollak | first7 = P.|title = Functional neurosurgery for movement disorders: a historial perspective. | journal = Prog.

The company's first investment in 2013 involved a small startup company, SetPoint Medical, which was developing neurostimulators to address inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cookson |first=Clive |date=31 July 2012 |title=Healthcare: Into the cortex Scientific advances on the brain promise to transform the pharmaceutical industry |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/487fb69e-db1f-11e1-8074-00144feab49a.html |newspaper=Financial Times |location=London |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Famm |first=Kristoffer |last2=Litt |first2=Brian |last3=Tracey |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Boyden |first4=Edward S.|last5= Siaoui |first5= Moncef |date=11 April 2013 |title=Drug discovery: A jump-start for electroceuticals |journal=Nature |volume= 496 |issue= 7444|pages=159\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/496159a |pmid=23579662 |pmc=4179459}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=John Carroll |title=GlaxoSmithKline stakes a pioneering effort to launch 'electroceutical' R&D |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/glaxosmithkline-stakes-pioneering-effort-launch-electroceutical-rd/2013-04-10 |newspaper=Fierce Biotech |location= |date=10 April 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the electroceuticals quest aims to find the electro-neural signature of disease and at a cellular level, in real time, play back the more normal electro-signature to help maintain the neural signature in the normal state. Unlike preceding neuromodulation therapy methods, the approach would not involve electrical leads stimulating large nerves or spinal cords or brain centers. It might involve methods that are emerging within the neuromodulation family of therapies, such as optogenetics or some new nanotechnology. Disease states and conditions that have been discussed as targets for future electroceutical therapy include diabetes, infertility, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Birmingham |first1=Karen |authorlink1= |last2=Gradinaru |first2=Viviana |authorlink2= |last3=Anikeeva |first3=Polina |authorlink3= |last4=Grill |first4=Warren M. |last5=McLaughlin |first5=Bryan |last6=Pansricha |first6=Pankaj |last7=Weber |first7=Douglas |last8=Ludwig |first8=Kip |authorlink9= |last9=Kristoffer |first9=Famm |first10=Victor |last10=Pikov |title=Bioelectronic medicines: A research roadmap |script-title= |trans-title= |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |type= |series= |language= |edition= |publication-date=30 May 2014 |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=399\u2013400 |doi=10.1038/nrd4351 |pmid=24875080 |year=2014|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/47172/7/nrd4351-s1.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alim-Louis Benabid]] \n* [[Brain computer interface|Brain computer interfacing (BCI)]]\n* [[BrainGate]]\n* [[International Neuromodulation Society]]\n* [[Interventional pain management]]\n* [[North American Neuromodulation Society]]\n* [[Neuromodulation (journal)|''Neuromodulation'' (journal)]]\n* [[Neuroprosthetics]]\n* [[Neurotechnology]]\n* [[Neurostimulation]]\n* [[Optogenetics]]\n* [[Visual prosthesis]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n\n* {{Cite journal  | last1 = Al\u00f3 | first1 = KM. | last2 = Holsheimer | first2 = J. | title = New trends in neuromodulation for the management of neuropathic pain. | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 690\u2013703; discussion 703\u20134 |date=Apr 2002 | pmid = 11904018 | doi=10.1097/00006123-200204000-00003}}\n* Althaus J: A Treatise on Medical Electricity, Theoretical and Practical; and Its Use in the Treatment of Paralysis, Neuralgia, and Other Diseases Philadelphia, Lindsay & Blakiston, 1860;163-170.\n* {{Cite journal  | last1 = Andrews | first1 = RJ. | title = Neuromodulation: advances in the next five years. | journal = Ann.

The comet at discovery was predicted to become easily visible by [[naked eye]] in spring 1990, however it failed to become that bright.\n\n== Observations ==\nRobert Austin discovered the comet on December 6, 1989 through an 8-inch [[Schmidt-Newtonian telescope]], and it was his third comet discovery.<ref name=\"Machholz94\">{{cite journal |last1=Machholz |first1=Don E. |title=Comet Austin 1989c1: what went wrong? |journal=JALPO |date=April 1994 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=171\u2013176 |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1994JALPO..37..171M |language=en |issn=0039-2502}}</ref> By the time of its discovery, it was already obvious that it must be an large object, as the comet was still more than 350 million kilometres (2.42 AU) from the [[Sun]] and yet it was so bright that it was seen as an 11th magnitude object (that is, 1/100 as bright as what can be perceived with the unaided eye).<ref name=\"ESO9004\"/>\n\nMore observations were soon made, establishing the comet's orbit, and it was found that it would pass through its perihelion (the point of its orbit where it is closest to the Sun) on 9 April 1990 at a distance of about 53 million kilometres, inside the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the planet closest to the Sun, and it would come within 38 million kilometres of the Earth on May 25. The orbit indicated that the northern hemisphere after 20 April 1990 could be seen low above the NW horizon, just after sunset, and even better above the NE horizon, shortly before sunrise, and it was expected to develop an easily observable tail which would be a grand celestial view.<ref name=\"ESO9004\">{{cite web|title=ESO - eso9004 - Comet Austin Develops a Long Tail|publisher=ESO|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso9004/|accessdate=2010-01-11}}</ref> Its high eccentricity, above 1, indicated that it was a dynamically new object from the [[Oort cloud]].<ref name=\"Machholz94\"/>\n\nThe comet was at 83 degrees elongation from the Sun at discovery and nearly circumpolar for the south hemisphere. The comet slowly moved northwards and passed the [[Celestial equator|equator]] on March 21, 1990, however its elongation from the Sun, around 25 degrees, meant it was difficult to observe. After the perihelium the comet would start to move gradually away from the Sun and at the time of the closest approach to Earth would be 100 degrees away from the Sun, at the constellation of [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] and moving southward.<ref name=\"Machholz94\"/>\n\nA long ion tail was observed on late February 1990.<ref name=\"ESO9004\"/> However, as the comet approached to perihelium the rate of brightening started to slow when it was 1.56 to 1.27 AU away from the Sun and although activity increased again in April, the comet ended up about 6 magnitudes dimmer than expected at maximum brightness, being dimmer than magnitude 2, with most obervators reporting a maximum brightness between +4 and +6. The comet was visible with naked eye between May 5 and May 25, 1990, before fading below naked eye visibility.<ref name=\"Machholz94\"/>\n\n== Scientific results ==\n[[File:Comet Austin jet (Eso9003f).jpg|thumb|A jet observed by [[New Technology Telescope|NTT]] on February 9, 1990.]]\nThe spectrum of the comet upon discovery showed the presence of [[hydroxyl]] emission and continuum from the dust, however the presence of dust was noted to be unusually low.

D. Austin on December 6, 1989. The comet at discovery was predicted to become easily visible by [[naked eye]] in spring 1990, however it failed to become that bright.\n\n== Observations ==\nRobert Austin discovered the comet on December 6, 1989 through an 8-inch [[Schmidt-Newtonian telescope]], and it was his third comet discovery.<ref name=\"Machholz94\">{{cite journal |last1=Machholz |first1=Don E. |title=Comet Austin 1989c1: what went wrong? |journal=JALPO |date=April 1994 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=171\u2013176 |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1994JALPO..37..171M |language=en |issn=0039-2502}}</ref> By the time of its discovery, it was already obvious that it must be an large object, as the comet was still more than 350 million kilometres (2.42 AU) from the [[Sun]] and yet it was so bright that it was seen as an 11th magnitude object (that is, 1/100 as bright as what can be perceived with the unaided eye).<ref name=\"ESO9004\"/>\n\nMore observations were soon made, establishing the comet's orbit, and it was found that it would pass through its perihelion (the point of its orbit where it is closest to the Sun) on 9 April 1990 at a distance of about 53 million kilometres, inside the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the planet closest to the Sun, and it would come within 38 million kilometres of the Earth on May 25. The orbit indicated that the northern hemisphere after 20 April 1990 could be seen low above the NW horizon, just after sunset, and even better above the NE horizon, shortly before sunrise, and it was expected to develop an easily observable tail which would be a grand celestial view.<ref name=\"ESO9004\">{{cite web|title=ESO - eso9004 - Comet Austin Develops a Long Tail|publisher=ESO|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso9004/|accessdate=2010-01-11}}</ref> Its high eccentricity, above 1, indicated that it was a new object from the [[Oort cloud]].<ref name=\"Machholz94\"/>\n\nThe comet was at 83 degrees elongation from the Sun at discovery and nearly circumpolar for the south hemisphere. The comet slowly moved northwards and passed the [[Celestial equator|equator]] on March 21, 1990, however its elongation from the Sun, around 25 degrees, meant it was difficult to observe. After the perihelium the comet would start to move gradually away from the Sun and at the time of the closest approach to Earth would be 100 degrees away from the Sun, at the constellation of [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] and moving southward.<ref name=\"Machholz94\"/>\n\nA long ion tail was observed on late February 1990.<ref name=\"ESO9004\"/> However, as the comet approached to perihelium the rate of brightening started to slow when it was 1.56 to 1.27 AU away from the Sun and although activity increased again in April, the comet ended up about 6 magnitudes dimmer than expected at maximum brightness, being dimmer than magnitude 2, with most obervators reporting a maximum brightness between +4 and +6. The comet was visible with naked eye between May 5 and May 25, 1990, before fading below naked eye visibility.<ref name=\"Machholz94\"/>\n\n== Scientific results ==\n[[File:Comet Austin jet (Eso9003f).jpg|thumb|A jet observed by [[New Technology Telescope|NTT]] on February 9, 1990.]]\nThe spectrum of the comet upon discovery showed the presence of [[hydroxyl]] emission and continuum from the dust, however the presence of dust was noted to be unusually low.
