At its height it controlled modern-day Iran, [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan Republic]], parts of the [[North Caucasus]] ([[Dagestan]]), [[Afghanistan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Pakistan]], and parts of [[Iraq]], [[Turkey]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Oman]]. After his death, most of his empire was divided between the [[Zands]], [[Durranis]], [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti|Georgians]], and the [[Khanates of the Caucasus|Caucasian khanates]], while Afsharid rule was confined to a small local state in Khorasan. Finally, the Afsharid dynasty was overthrown by [[Mohammad Khan Qajar]] in 1796, who would establish a new native Iranian empire and restore Iranian [[suzerainty]] over several of the aforementioned regions.\n\nThe dynasty was named after the Turcoman Afshar tribe from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in north-east Iran, to which Nader belonged.<ref>Michael Axworthy's biography of Nader, ''The Sword of Persia'' (I.B. Tauris, 2006), pp. 17\u201319: \"His father was of lowly but respectable status, a herdsman of the [[Afshar tribe]] ... The Qereqlu Afshars to whom Nader's father belonged were a semi-nomadic Turcoman tribe settled in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in north-eastern [[Iran]] ... The tribes of Khorasan were for the most part ethnically distinct from the Persian-speaking population, speaking Turkic or Kurdish languages. Nader's mother tongue was a dialect of the language group spoken by the Turkic tribes of Iran and Central Asia, and he would have quickly learned Persian, the language of high culture and the cities as he grew older. But the Turkic language was always his preferred everyday speech, unless he was dealing with someone who knew only Persian.\"</ref> The Afshars had originally migrated from [[Turkestan]] to [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] (Iranian Azerbaijan) in the 13th century. In the early 17th century, [[Shah Abbas I|Shah Abbas the Great]] moved many Afshars from Azerbaijan to Khorasan to defend the north-eastern borders of his state against the [[Uzbeks]], after which the Afshars became native to those regions.

Nader fought to regain the lands lost to the Ottomans and Russians and to restore Iranian hegemony in Iran. While he was away in the east fighting the Ghilzais, Tahmasp [[Tahmasp's campaign of 1731|allowed the Ottomans to retake territory]] in the west.

He agreed and thus became a figure of national importance. When Nader discovered that Fath Ali Khan was corresponding with Malek Mahmud and revealed this to the shah, Tahmasp executed him and made Nader the chief of his army instead. Nader subsequently took on the title Tahmasp Qoli (Servant of Tahmasp). In late 1726, Nader recaptured [[Mashhad]].<ref>Axworthy pp. 57\u201374</ref>\n\nNader chose not to march directly on Isfahan. First, in May 1729, he defeated the [[Durrani|Abdali]] Afghans near [[Herat]]. Many of the Abdali Afghans subsequently joined his army. The new shah of the Ghilzai Afghans, [[Ashraf Khan|Ashraf]], decided to move against Nader but in September 1729, Nader defeated him at the [[Battle of Damghan (1729)|Battle of Damghan]] and again decisively in November at Murchakhort, banishing the Afghans from Persian soil forever. Ashraf fled and Nader finally entered Isfahan, handing it over to Tahmasp in December and plundering the city to pay his army. Tahmasp made Nader governor over many eastern provinces, including his native Khorasan, and married him to his sister.

At the same time, the Abdali Afghans rebelled and besieged Mashhad, forcing Nader to suspend his campaign and save his brother, Ebrahim. It took Nader fourteen months to crush this uprising.\n\n[[File:\u0646\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u0647.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Painting of Nader Shah]]\n\nRelations between Nader and the Shah had declined as the latter grew alarmed by his general's military successes. While Nader was absent in the east, Tahmasp tried to assert himself by launching [[Tahmasp's campaign of 1731|a campaign]] to recapture [[Yerevan]]. He ended up losing all of Nader's recent gains to the Ottomans, and [[Treaty of Ahmet Pasha|signed a treaty]] ceding [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]] in exchange for [[Tabriz]]. Nader, furious, saw that the moment had come to depose Tahmasp. He denounced the treaty, seeking popular support for a war against the Ottomans. In Isfahan, Nader got Tahmasp drunk then showed him to the courtiers asking if a man in such a state was fit to rule. In 1732 he forced Tahmasp to abdicate in favour of the Shah's baby son, Abbas III, to whom Nader became [[regent]].\n\n[[File:Baghavard 2 001sdf.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Battle of Yeghev\u0101rd]] was one of Nader's most tactically impressive triumphs in his military career]]\n\nNader decided, as he continued the [[Ottoman\u2013Persian War (1730\u201335)|1730\u201335 war]], that he could win back the territory in Armenia and Georgia by seizing Ottoman [[Baghdad]] and then offering it in exchange for the lost provinces, but his plan went badly amiss when his army was routed by the Ottoman general [[Topal Osman Pasha]] near the city in 1733. Nader decided he needed to regain the initiative as soon as possible to save his position because revolts were already breaking out in Persia. He faced Topal again with a larger force and defeated and killed him. He then besieged Baghdad, as well as [[Ganja (city)|Ganja]] in the northern provinces, earning a Russian alliance against the Ottomans. Nader scored a decisive victory over a superior Ottoman force [[Battle of Yeghev\u0101rd|at Yeghevard]] (modern-day Armenia) and by the summer of 1735, Persian Armenia and Georgia were under his rule again. In March 1735, he signed [[Treaty of Ganja|a treaty]] with the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] in Ganja by which the latter agreed to withdraw all of their troops from Persian territory,<ref name=\"The History of Iran\">Elton L.

This once powerful Muslim state to the east was falling apart as the nobles became increasingly disobedient and the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Maratha]]s of the [[Maratha Empire]] made inroads on its territory from the south-west.

On hearing the news, Reza's wife, who was Tahmasp's sister, committed suicide. Nader was not pleased with the young man's behaviour and humiliated him by removing him from the post of viceroy, but he took him on his expedition to conquer territory in [[Transoxiana]]. Nader became increasingly despotic as his health declined markedly. In 1740 he conquered Khanate of [[Khiva]]. After the Persians had forced the [[uzbeks|Uzbek]] khanate of [[Bukhara]] to submit, Nader wanted Reza to marry the khan's elder daughter because she was a descendant of his role model Genghis Khan, but Reza flatly refused and Nader married the girl himself. Nader also conquered [[Khwarezm]] on this expedition into Central Asia.<ref>svat soucek, a history of inner asia page 195: in 1740 Nadir Shah, the new ruler of Iran, crossed the Amu Darya and, accepting the submission of Muhammad Hakim Bi which was then formalized by the acquiescence of Abulfayz Khan himself, proceeded to attack Khiva. When rebellions broke out in 1743 upon the death of Muhammad Hakim, the shah dispatched the ataliq's son Muhammad Rahim Bi, who had accompanied him to Iran, to quell them. Mohammad hakim bi was ruler of the khanate of bukhara at that time.

In 1741, while Nader was passing through the forest of [[Mazandaran]] on his way to fight the Daghestanis, an assassin took a shot at him but Nader was only lightly wounded. He began to suspect his son was behind the attempt and confined him to [[Tehran]]. Nader's increasing ill health made his temper ever worse. Perhaps it was his illness that made Nader lose the initiative in his war against the [[Lezgins|Lezgin]] tribes of Daghestan. Frustratingly for him, they resorted to guerrilla warfare and the Persians could make little headway against them.<ref>Spencer C. Tucker.

During the same period, Nader accused his son of being behind the assassination attempt in Mazandaran. Reza angrily protested his innocence, but Nader had him blinded as punishment, although he immediately regretted it. Soon afterwards, Nader started executing the nobles who had witnessed his son's blinding. In his last years, Nader became increasingly [[paranoia|paranoid]], ordering the assassination of large numbers of suspected enemies.\n\nWith the wealth he gained, Nader started to build a Persian [[navy]]. With lumber from [[Mazandaran]], he built ships in [[Bushehr]]. He also purchased thirty ships in India.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Iranica\"/> He recaptured the island of [[Bahrain]] from the Arabs. In 1743, he conquered [[Oman]] and its main capital [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]. In 1743, Nader started another war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Despite having a huge army at his disposal, in this campaign Nader showed little of his former military brilliance. It ended in 1746 with the signing of a peace treaty, in which the Ottomans agreed to let Nader occupy [[Najaf]].<ref>This section: Axworthy pp. 175\u2013274</ref>\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Military of the Afsharid dynasty of Persia}}\nThe military forces of the Afsharid dynasty of Persia had their origins in the relatively obscure yet bloody inter-factional violence in Khorasan during the collapse of the Safavid state. The small band of warriors under local warlord [[Nader Shah|Nader Qoli]] of the Turkomen Afshar tribe in north-east Iran were no more than a few hundred men. Yet at the height of Nader's power as the king of kings, Shahanshah, he commanded an army of 375,000 fighting men which constituted the single most powerful military force of its time,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Axworthy|first=Michael|year=2007|title=The Army of Nader Shah|journal=Iranian Studies|publisher=Informa UK|volume=40|issue=5|pages=635\u2013646|doi=10.1080/00210860701667720|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>[[Michael Axworthy|Axworthy, Michael]] (2009).

Although there were numerous Afsharid pretenders to the throne, (amongst many other), who attempted to regain control of the entire country, Persia remained a fractured political entity in turmoil until the campaigns of [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar]] toward the very end of the eighteenth century reunified the nation.\n\n==Religious policy==\nThe Safavids had introduced [[Shi'a Islam]] as the state religion of Iran.

He wanted Persia to adopt a form of religion that would be more acceptable to Sunnis and suggested that Persia adopt a form of Shi'ism he called \"Ja'fari\", in honour of the sixth Shi'a [[imam]] [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]. He banned certain Shi'a practices which were particularly offensive to Sunnis, such as the cursing of the first three caliphs. Personally, Nader is said to have been indifferent toward religion and the French [[Jesuit]] who served as his personal [[physician]] reported that it was difficult to know which religion he followed and that many who knew him best said that he had none.<ref name=\"Axworthy p.168\">Axworthy p.168</ref> Nader hoped that \"Ja'farism\" would be accepted as a fifth school (''[[mazhab]]'') of Sunni Islam and that the Ottomans would allow its adherents to go on the [[hajj]], or pilgrimage, to [[Mecca]], which was within their territory. In the subsequent peace negotiations, the Ottomans refused to acknowledge Ja'farism as a fifth ''mazhab'' but they did allow Persian pilgrims to go on the ''hajj''. Nader was interested in gaining rights for Persians to go on the ''hajj'' in part because of revenues from the pilgrimage trade.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Iranica\"/> Nader's other primary aim in his religious reforms was to weaken the Safavids further since Shi'a Islam had always been a major element in support for the dynasty. He had the chief [[mullah]] of Persia strangled after he was heard expressing support for the Safavids. Among his reforms was the introduction of what came to be known as the ''kolah-e Naderi''. This was a hat with four peaks which symbolised the first four [[caliphs]].\n\n==Civil war and downfall of the Afsharids==\n{{see also|Khanates of the Caucasus}}\n[[File:Afsharid dynasty final stages.png|thumb|The Afsharid dynasty near its end, as its authority is reduced to the province of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]]<ref>Perry, Jonothan R.

The tribes of Khorasan were for the most part ethnically distinct from the Persian-speaking population, speaking Turkic or Kurdish languages.

He ended up losing all of Nader's recent gains to the Ottomans, and [[Treaty of Ahmet Pasha|signed a treaty]] ceding [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]] in exchange for [[Tabriz]]. Nader, furious, saw that the moment had come to depose Tahmasp. He denounced the treaty, seeking popular support for a war against the Ottomans. In Isfahan, Nader got Tahmasp drunk then showed him to the courtiers asking if a man in such a state was fit to rule. In 1732 he forced Tahmasp to abdicate in favour of the Shah's baby son, Abbas III, to whom Nader became [[regent]].\n\n[[File:Baghavard 2 001sdf.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Battle of Yeghev\u0101rd]] was one of Nader's most tactically impressive triumphs in his military career]]\n\nNader decided, as he continued the [[Ottoman\u2013Persian War (1730\u201335)|1730\u201335 war]], that he could win back the territory in Armenia and Georgia by seizing Ottoman [[Baghdad]] and then offering it in exchange for the lost provinces, but his plan went badly amiss when his army was routed by the Ottoman general [[Topal Osman Pasha]] near the city in 1733.

After his return from India, Nader fell out with his eldest son Reza Qoli Mirza, who had ruled Persia during his father's absence. Reza had behaved highhandedly and somewhat cruelly but he had kept the peace in Persia. Having heard a rumour that Nader was dead, he had prepared to seize the throne by having the Safavid royal captives, Tahmasp and his nine-year-old son Abbas III, executed. On hearing the news, Reza's wife, who was Tahmasp's sister, committed suicide. Nader was not pleased with the young man's behaviour and humiliated him by removing him from the post of viceroy, but he took him on his expedition to conquer territory in [[Transoxiana]]. Nader became increasingly despotic as his health declined markedly. In 1740 he conquered Khanate of [[Khiva]]. After the Persians had forced the [[uzbeks|Uzbek]] khanate of [[Bukhara]] to submit, Nader wanted Reza to marry the khan's elder daughter because she was a descendant of his role model Genghis Khan, but Reza flatly refused and Nader married the girl himself. Nader also conquered [[Khwarezm]] on this expedition into Central Asia.<ref>svat soucek, a history of inner asia page 195: in 1740 Nadir Shah, the new ruler of Iran, crossed the Amu Darya and, accepting the submission of Muhammad Hakim Bi which was then formalized by the acquiescence of Abulfayz Khan himself, proceeded to attack Khiva.

During the same period, Nader accused his son of being behind the assassination attempt in Mazandaran. Reza angrily protested his innocence, but Nader had him blinded as punishment, although he immediately regretted it. Soon afterwards, Nader started executing the nobles who had witnessed his son's blinding. In his last years, Nader became increasingly [[paranoia|paranoid]], ordering the assassination of large numbers of suspected enemies.\n\nWith the wealth he gained, Nader started to build a Persian [[navy]].

He wanted Persia to adopt a form of religion that would be more acceptable to Sunnis and suggested that Persia adopt a form of Shi'ism he called \"Ja'fari\", in honour of the sixth Shi'a [[imam]] [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]. He banned certain Shi'a practices which were particularly offensive to Sunnis, such as the cursing of the first three caliphs. Personally, Nader is said to have been indifferent toward religion and the French [[Jesuit]] who served as his personal [[physician]] reported that it was difficult to know which religion he followed and that many who knew him best said that he had none.<ref name=\"Axworthy p.168\">Axworthy p.168</ref> Nader hoped that \"Ja'farism\" would be accepted as a fifth school (''[[mazhab]]'') of Sunni Islam and that the Ottomans would allow its adherents to go on the [[hajj]], or pilgrimage, to [[Mecca]], which was within their territory. In the subsequent peace negotiations, the Ottomans refused to acknowledge Ja'farism as a fifth ''mazhab'' but they did allow Persian pilgrims to go on the ''hajj''. Nader was interested in gaining rights for Persians to go on the ''hajj'' in part because of revenues from the pilgrimage trade.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Iranica\"/> Nader's other primary aim in his religious reforms was to weaken the Safavids further since Shi'a Islam had always been a major element in support for the dynasty. He had the chief [[mullah]] of Persia strangled after he was heard expressing support for the Safavids. Among his reforms was the introduction of what came to be known as the ''kolah-e Naderi''. This was a hat with four peaks which symbolised the first four [[caliphs]].\n\n==Civil war and downfall of the Afsharids==\n{{see also|Khanates of the Caucasus}}\n[[File:Afsharid dynasty final stages.png|thumb|The Afsharid dynasty near its end, as its authority is reduced to the province of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]]<ref>Perry, Jonothan R.

Ebrahim decided to set himself up as a rival, defeated Adil in battle, blinded him and took the throne. Adil had reigned for less than a year. Meanwhile, a group of army officers freed Shahrokh from prison in [[Mashhad]] and proclaimed him shah in October 1748. Ebrahim was defeated and died in captivity in 1750 and Adil was also put to death at the request of Nader Shah's widow. Shahrokh was briefly deposed in favour of another puppet ruler [[Soleyman III|Soleyman II]] but, although blinded, Shahrokh was restored to the throne by his supporters. He reigned in Mashhad and from the 1750s his territory was mostly confined to Khorasan.
