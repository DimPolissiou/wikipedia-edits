Divisions arose between the integrationist and autonomous movements by 1970, with integrationist leader Raja Mahmudabad criticising the vigilantism of the latter as \"alien to the spirit and practice of [[Islam in the United Kingdom|Islam]]\" whereas PPP/PWU leader Abdul Hye stated they \"have no intention of fighting or killing anyone, but if it comes to us, we will hit back.\" It was not until the 1980s and 1990s that academics began to take racist violence seriously, partly as a result of blacks and Asians entering academic life.<ref name=\"Ashe\" />\n\nIn the 21st century, some younger [[British Pakistanis]] have attempted to reclaim the word, drawing parallels to the LGBT reclamation of the slur \"[[queer]]\" and the [[African American]] reclamation of the slur \"[[nigger]]\".<ref name=bbc /><ref name=guard>{{cite news|last1=Manzoor|first1=Sarfraz|title='I'm a paki and proud'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/25/race.world|accessdate=23 June 2015|work=The Guardian|date=25 February 2004}}</ref> [[Peterborough]] businessman Abdul Rahim, who produces merchandise reclaiming the word, equates it to more socially accepted terms such as \"[[Aussie]]\" and \"[[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]]\", saying that it is more similar to them than it is to \"nigger\", as it denotes a nationality and not a biological race.<ref name=guard /> However, other Pakistanis see use of the word as unacceptable even among members of their community, due to its historical racist use.<ref name=bbc />\n\nIn December 2000, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] published research on attitudes of the British public to pejoratives.

It contains 34 [[townland]]s. Today, the parish is split between the modern [[local administrative unit]]s of [[Fingal]] (to the west) and [[Dublin City Council]] (to the east).\n\n==Location==\nLike all civil parishes in Ireland, this civil parish is derived from, and co-extensive with, a pre-existing parish of the [[Church of Ireland]]. The [[Archdiocese of Dublin]], held a number of [[manor]]s as cross lands. The manor of Finglas contained most of the area of the parish in four distinct parcels of 4,487 acres in total.<ref>Sean Duffy, editor; ''Medieval Dublin XIII, Proceedings of the Friends of Medieval Dublin Symposium 2011'', Four Courts Press, p. 84</ref> The core of the parish is centred on the village of [[Finglas]] which lies within the barony of Castleknock. However, a substantial [[exclave]] of the parish is situated within the neighbouring barony of [[Nethercross]]. Since Kilreesk has a ''cell'' toponyn, this suggests that the church  was a pre-[[Norman invasion of Ireland|Invasion]] [[chapel of ease]].<ref>Sean Duffy, editor; ''Medieval Dublin XIII, Proceedings of the Friends of Medieval Dublin Symposium 2011'', Four Courts Press, p. 97</ref> This parcel of land contains six [[townlands]]. Additionally, within the barony of Castleknock itself, two further parcels of land, that are distinct from the core around the village, are situated to the north of the barony. The larger parcel contains six townlands around the [[Kilshane]] chapel of ease.<ref>Sean Duffy, editor; ''Medieval Dublin XIII, Proceedings of the Friends of Medieval Dublin Symposium 2011'', Four Courts Press, p. 97</ref> The smaller parcel consists of a single townland and is surrounded by the civil parishes of [[Mulhuddart]] and [[Cloghran, Castleknock|Cloghran]].\n\n==Townlands==\nFor convenience, the table below groups the parish's 34 townlands by their location in one of the modern [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] areas. Some townlands, however, straddle both areas. It also splits the townlands into those located in the core around the village, those in the Castleknock [[exclave]]s and those in the Nethercross exclave.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:80px\" | Sub Location\n! style=\"width:80px\" | Modern Local<br />[[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|Authority Area]]\n! style=\"width:120px\" | Name in English\n! style=\"width:120px\" | Name in Gaelic\n! style=\"width:120px\" | Comments\n|-\n|rowspan=\"25\" |Core village<br />in barony of<br />Castleknock\n|rowspan=\"6\" |[[Fingal]]\n|Balseskin<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Balseskin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17313.aspx |title=Baile Seiscinn/Balseskin &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Baile Seiscinn\n|Central part contains the ramps and ancillary roads of the interchange where the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]] crosses the old North Road ([[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]]) at junction 6.\n|-\n|Charlestown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Charlestown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17318.aspx |title=Baile Sh\u00e9arlais/Charlestown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Baile Sh\u00e9arlais\n|Its southern edge forms the Fingal / City boundary\n|-\n|Coldwinters<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Coldwinters\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17319.aspx |title=Buaile an Gheimhridh/Coldwinters &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Buaile an Gheimhridh\n|The most northerly point of this part of the parish.\n|-\n|Jamestown Little <small>(partly)</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Jamestown Little\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17321.aspx |title=Baile Sh\u00e9amais Beag/Jamestown Little &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Baile Sh\u00e9amais Beag\n|Located on the western side of the Jamestown Road.<br />The top half of the townland and of the Jamestown Industrial Estate is in Fingal.\n|-\n|Kildonan <small>(partly)</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Kildonan \">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17322.aspx |title=Cill D\u00f3n\u00e1in/Kildonan &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Cill D\u00f3n\u00e1in\n|Most of the land lies on the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]] ramp and north of the motorway.<br />Access is only possible from the cul-de-sac on the old [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]] at Coldwinters.\n|-\n|Stockens<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Stockens\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17560.aspx |title=Stoic\u00edn/Stockens &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Stoic\u00edn\n|Its northern edge forms the Fingal / City boundary\n|-\n|rowspan=\"19\" |[[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n|Ballyboggan North<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Ballyboggan North\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17566.aspx |title=Baile Bog\u00e1in Thuaidh/Ballyboggan North &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Baile Bog\u00e1in Thuaidh\n|Its southern border is the river Tolka.

It contains 34 [[townland]]s. Today, the parish is split between the modern [[local administrative unit]]s of [[Fingal]] (to the west) and [[Dublin City Council]] (to the east).\n\n==Location==\nLike all civil parishes in Ireland, this civil parish is derived from, and co-extensive with, a pre-existing parish of the [[Church of Ireland]]. The [[Archdiocese of Dublin]], held a number of [[manor]]s as cross lands. The manor of Finglas contained most of the area of the parish in four distinct parcels of 4,487 acres in total.<ref>Sean Duffy, editor; ''Medieval Dublin XIII, Proceedings of the Friends of Medieval Dublin Symposium 2011'', Four Courts Press, p. 84</ref> The core of the parish is centred on the village of [[Finglas]] which lies within the barony of Castleknock. However, a substantial [[exclave]] of the parish is situated within the neighbouring barony of [[Nethercross]]. Since Kilreesk has a ''cell'' toponyn, this suggests that the church  was a pre-[[Norman invasion of Ireland|Invasion]] [[chapel of ease]].<ref>Sean Duffy, editor; ''Medieval Dublin XIII, Proceedings of the Friends of Medieval Dublin Symposium 2011'', Four Courts Press, p. 97</ref> This parcel of land contains six [[townlands]]. Additionally, within the barony of Castleknock itself, two further parcels of land, that are distinct from the core around the village, are situated to the north of the barony. The larger parcel contains six townlands around the [[Kilshane]] chapel of ease.<ref>Sean Duffy, editor; ''Medieval Dublin XIII, Proceedings of the Friends of Medieval Dublin Symposium 2011'', Four Courts Press, p. 97</ref> The smaller parcel consists of a single townland and is surrounded by the civil parishes of [[Mulhuddart]] and [[Cloghran, Castleknock|Cloghran]].\n\n==Townlands==\nFor convenience, the table below groups the parish's 34 townlands by their location in one of the modern [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] areas. Some townlands, however, straddle both areas. It also splits the townlands into those located in the core around the village, those in the Castleknock [[exclave]]s and those in the Nethercross exclave.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:80px\" | Sub Location\n! style=\"width:80px\" | Modern Local<br>[[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|Authority Area]]\n! style=\"width:120px\" | Name in English\n! style=\"width:120px\" | Name in Gaelic\n! style=\"width:120px\" | Comments\n|-\n|rowspan=\"25\" |Core village<br>in barony of<br>Castleknock\n|rowspan=\"6\" |[[Fingal]]\n|Balseskin<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Balseskin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17313.aspx |title=Baile Seiscinn/Balseskin &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Baile Seiscinn\n|Central part contains the ramps and ancillary roads of the interchange where the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]] crosses the old North Road ([[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]]) at junction 6.\n|-\n|Charlestown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Charlestown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17318.aspx |title=Baile Sh\u00e9arlais/Charlestown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Baile Sh\u00e9arlais\n|Its southern edge forms the Fingal / City boundary\n|-\n|Coldwinters<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Coldwinters\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17319.aspx |title=Buaile an Gheimhridh/Coldwinters &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Buaile an Gheimhridh\n|The most northerly point of this part of the parish.\n|-\n|Jamestown Little <small>(partly)</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Jamestown Little\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17321.aspx |title=Baile Sh\u00e9amais Beag/Jamestown Little &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Baile Sh\u00e9amais Beag\n|Located on the western side of the Jamestown Road.<br>The top half of the townland and of the Jamestown Industrial Estate is in Fingal.\n|-\n|Kildonan <small>(partly)</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Kildonan \">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17322.aspx |title=Cill D\u00f3n\u00e1in/Kildonan &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Cill D\u00f3n\u00e1in\n|Most of the land lies on the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]] ramp and north of the motorway.<BR>Access is only possible from the cul-de-sac on the old [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]] at Coldwinters.\n|-\n|Stockens<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Stockens\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17560.aspx |title=Stoic\u00edn/Stockens &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Stoic\u00edn\n|Its northern edge forms the Fingal / City boundary\n|-\n|rowspan=\"19\" |[[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n|Ballyboggan North<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Ballyboggan North\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17566.aspx |title=Baile Bog\u00e1in Thuaidh/Ballyboggan North &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>\n|Baile Bog\u00e1in Thuaidh\n|Its southern border is the river Tolka.
