It is known as the NW9 area of Hendon and is known for the West Hendon Estate, which is undergoing controversial regeneration.<Ref>https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/bnky9a/west-hendon-eviction-resistance-oscar-webb-022</ref>\n\n==History==\nWest Hendon was a settlement within that part of the ancient parish of [[Hendon]] known as [[the Hyde]], and is now a part of the [[London Borough of Barnet]]. It was formally known, from 1878\u20131890, as New Hendon, a small railway development on the Edgware Road. Before the 1830s there were three farms, Upper and Lower Guttershedge (east of the road) and Cockman's in the Wood (west of the road) and an inn, The Welsh Harp. Between 1835 and 1838, the [[Brent Reservoir]] was constructed by damming the Brent and the Silk brooks and flooding much of Cockman's Farm. The  water was used to supply the [[Grand Union Canal]]. At its greatest extent, in 1853, it covered 400 acres (1.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) but was dramatically reduced to 195 acres (789,000 m\u00b2) in the 1890s. Subsequently, it has been reduced to 110 acres (445,000 m\u00b2). It contains enough water to fill 3 million baths and in 1991 was believed to contain 10,000&nbsp;lb (4,500&nbsp;kg) of fish. The residue of Cockman's Farm became Woodfield House, home to the Roman Catholic ''Passioist Fathers'' (1852 and 1858). The house was demolished in 1940 and the site used by the Borough of Hendon and its successor the [[London Borough of Barnet]] as a plant nursery.\n\nOriginally ''The Harp and Horn'' (c1750s), The Harp was rebuilt in 1859 and again in 1937, before finally being pulled down in 1970 to make way for the M1. During the 1960s, it was known as ''The Lakeside Scene'' and hosted some of the great rock and blues bands of the day, such as the Yardbirds. From 1859 until the end of the century it was run by the Warner brothers, and the reservoir became a centre for all sorts of sporting events such as ice skating, swimming and angling; it was, until 1878, the Kingsbury Race Course and the first mechanical hare in greyhound racing was used there in 1876. By 1850, there was a second public house, the ''Upper Welsh Harp''. At its height in the mid-1880s crowds in excess of 25,000 people could be expected on a Bank Holiday weekend.\n\nTwo railway stations were opened, both of the [[Midland Railway]]: Hendon (1868), and Welsh Harp (1870). A local builder called Bishop laid the first brick of a new terrace called Neeld Terrace (1881), which heralded the start of ''New Hendon''. Brent Vue was built on land originally owned by the Midland Company. In 1885, the Baptists had a mission hall and their present hall was opened in 1930. By 1886, there were 200 new houses and the Anglican church of St. John's was built.\n\nThe 1896 Ordnance Survey Map shows that most of the roads had been laid out, but with little further development beyond that of the mid-1880s. In 1896 [[Schweppes]] opened a large mineral water factory, and the present Anglican church of St. John's was established in Algernon Road. With a planned tram line along the West Hendon ''Broadway'' due to open in 1904, Welsh Harp station was closed in 1903, and West Hendon became a thriving Edwardian retail district until overshadowed by Golders Green. The Ordnance Survey Map of 1913 shows the area as being fully developed.\n\nThe reservoir was an important centre for speedboat racing in the 1920s and 1930s. C Harrison broke the outboard motorboat record at 57&nbsp;mph (92&nbsp;km/h) in 1931. During World War II, on 13 February 1941, the Luftwaffe dropped an SC2500 Maximum Heavy Explosive bomb (equivalent to two V2 rockets), killing 80 people and destroying 40 houses in an area west of the Edgware Road. (During a very hot summer in the 1960s the water levels shrank dramatically and remains of some of the destroyed houses could be seen.) This area was completely redeveloped in the 1960s. In 1984 a small Islamic Centre was established at 135 The Broadway, and was later moved to Brent View and re-opened as [[Hendon Mosque]] on 23 August 1996. Hendon Mosque  held the funeral for [[Nazia Hassan]], a pioneer of Pakistani Pop music in 2001.\n\n===Estate regeneration===\nThe West Hendon Estate was built in the late 1960s, originally made up of 680 homes.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/nov/04/jasmin-parsons-and-the-troubled-tale-of-the-west-hendon-estate</ref> Plans were made during the 2000s to regenerate the estate, which were eventually approved in 2013.<ref>https://www.quod.com/news/west-hendon-regeneration-given-the-go-ahead/</ref> As of 2019, Marsh Drive is the only remaining original block yet to be demolished.<ref>https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/residents-of-neglected-block-in-north-london-denied-secure-tenancies-64886</ref>\n\nThe regeneration has been controversial: [[Barnet London Borough Council]] has faced criticism for its regeneration of the West Hendon Estate, including the use of [[compulsory purchase]].<ref>The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/20/barnet-council-social-cleansing-barratt-homes-west-hendon</ref> It was claimed that 400 families would be forced to move off the estate.

Between 1835 and 1838, the [[Brent Reservoir]] was constructed by damming the Brent and the Silk brooks and flooding much of Cockman's Farm. The  water was used to supply the [[Grand Union Canal]]. At its greatest extent, in 1853, it covered 400 acres (1.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) but was dramatically reduced to 195 acres (789,000 m\u00b2) in the 1890s. Subsequently, it has been reduced to 110 acres (445,000 m\u00b2). It contains enough water to fill 3 million baths and in 1991 was believed to contain 10,000&nbsp;lb (4,500&nbsp;kg) of fish. The residue of Cockman's Farm became Woodfield House, home to the Roman Catholic ''Passioist Fathers'' (1852 and 1858). The house was demolished in 1940 and the site used by the Borough of Hendon and its successor the [[London Borough of Barnet]] as a plant nursery.\n\nOriginally ''The Harp and Horn'' (c1750s), The Harp was rebuilt in 1859 and again in 1937, before finally being pulled down in 1970 to make way for the M1. During the 1960s, it was known as ''The Lakeside Scene'' and hosted some of the great rock and blues bands of the day, such as the Yardbirds. From 1859 until the end of the century it was run by the Warner brothers, and the reservoir became a centre for all sorts of sporting events such as ice skating, swimming and angling; it was, until 1878, the Kingsbury Race Course and the first mechanical hare in greyhound racing was used there in 1876. By 1850, there was a second public house, the ''Upper Welsh Harp''. At its height in the mid-1880s crowds in excess of 25,000 people could be expected on a Bank Holiday weekend.\n\nTwo railway stations were opened, both of the [[Midland Railway]]: Hendon (1868), and Welsh Harp (1870). A local builder called Bishop laid the first brick of a new terrace called Neeld Terrace (1881), which heralded the start of ''New Hendon''. Brent Vue was built on land originally owned by the Midland Company. In 1885, the Baptists had a mission hall and their present hall was opened in 1930. By 1886, there were 200 new houses and the Anglican church of St. John's was built.\n\nThe 1896 Ordnance Survey Map shows that most of the roads had been laid out, but with little further development beyond that of the mid-1880s. In 1896 [[Schweppes]] opened a large mineral water factory, and the present Anglican church of St. John's was established in Algernon Road. With a planned tram line along the West Hendon ''Broadway'' due to open in 1904, Welsh Harp station was closed in 1903, and West Hendon became a thriving Edwardian retail district until overshadowed by Golders Green. The Ordnance Survey Map of 1913 shows the area as being fully developed.\n\nThe reservoir was an important centre for speedboat racing in the 1920s and 1930s. C Harrison broke the outboard motorboat record at 57&nbsp;mph (92&nbsp;km/h) in 1931. During World War II, on 13 February 1941, the Luftwaffe dropped an SC2500 Maximum Heavy Explosive bomb (equivalent to two V2 rockets), killing 80 people and destroying 40 houses in an area west of the Edgware Road. (During a very hot summer in the 1960s the water levels shrank dramatically and remains of some of the destroyed houses could be seen.) This area was completely redeveloped in the 1960s. In 1984 a small Islamic Centre was established at 135 The Broadway, and was later moved to Brent View and re-opened as [[Hendon Mosque]] on 23 August 1996. Hendon Mosque  held the funeral for [[Nazia Hassan]], a pioneer of Pakistani Pop music in 2001.\n\n===Estate regeneration===\nThe West Hendon Estate was built in the late 1960s, originally made up of 680 homes.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/nov/04/jasmin-parsons-and-the-troubled-tale-of-the-west-hendon-estate</ref> Plans were made during the 2000s to regenerate the estate, which were eventually approved in 2013.<ref>https://www.quod.com/news/west-hendon-regeneration-given-the-go-ahead/</ref> As of 2019, Marsh Drive is the only remaining original block yet to be demolished.<ref>https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/residents-of-neglected-block-in-north-london-denied-secure-tenancies-64886</ref>\n\nThe regeneration has been controversial: [[Barnet London Borough Council]] has faced criticism for its regeneration of the West Hendon Estate, including the use of [[compulsory purchase]].<ref>The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/20/barnet-council-social-cleansing-barratt-homes-west-hendon</ref> It was claimed that 400 families would be forced to move off the estate.

Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis (LAH) occurs when the [[anterior pituitary]] cells are affected by [[autoimmune]] [[inflammation]] resulting in either no symptoms, [[adrenal insufficiency]] (if the [[ACTH]] producing cells are affected), [[hypothyroidism]] (if the [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] producing cells are damaged), or [[hypogonadism]] (if the [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and/or [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] producing cells are involved). In some cases, the presence of inflammation within the pituitary gland leads to interruption of [[dopamine]] flow from the [[hypothalamus]] into the pituitary causing high levels of the hormone [[prolactin]] and, often as a consequence, milk production from the breasts (in older girls and women).  Lymphocytic Infundibuloneurohypophysitis (LINH) occurs when the [[posterior pituitary]] is affected resulting in [[diabetes insipidus]]. Both LAH and LINH may also lead to symptoms of an intracranial mass such as headache or disturbance of vision, i.e. [[bitemporal hemianopia]]. The [[pituitary]] produces multiple [[hormones]] relating to various [[Metabolism|metabolic functions]]. Sufficiently low production of certain [[pituitary hormones]] can be fatal resulting in the failure of the [[thyroid]] or [[adrenal glands]].\n\nIt is estimated that, typically, it takes from 12 to 40 years for autoimmune destruction to present symptoms.<ref name=\"pmid9691980\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Str\u00f6mberg S, Crock P, Lernmark A, Hulting AL |title=Pituitary autoantibodies in patients with hypopituitarism and their relatives|journal=J.

Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis (LAH) occurs when the [[anterior pituitary]] cells are affected by [[autoimmune]] [[inflammation]] resulting in either no symptoms, [[adrenal insufficiency]] (if the [[ACTH]] producing cells are affected), [[hypothyroidism]] (if the [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] producing cells are damaged), or [[hypogonadism]] (if the [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and/or [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] producing cells are involved). In some cases, the presence of inflammation within the pituitary gland leads to interruption of [[dopamine]] flow from the [[hypothalamus]] into the pituitary causing high levels of the hormone [[prolactin]] and, often as a consequence, milk production from the breasts (in older girls and women).  Lymphocytic Infundibuloneurohypophysitis (LINH) occurs when the [[posterior pituitary]] is affected resulting in [[diabetes insipidus]]. Both LAH and LINH may also lead to symptoms of an intracranial mass such as headache or disturbance of vision, i.e. [[bitemporal hemianopia]]. The [[pituitary]] produces multiple [[hormones]] relating to various [[Metabolism|metabolic functions]]. Sufficiently low production of certain [[pituitary hormones]] can be fatal resulting in the failure of the [[thyroid]] or [[adrenal glands]].\n\nIt is estimated that, typically, it takes from 12 to 40 years for autoimmune destruction to present symptoms.<ref name=\"pmid9691980\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Str\u00f6mberg S, Crock P, Lernmark A, Hulting AL |title=Pituitary autoantibodies in patients with hypopituitarism and their relatives|journal=J.

The [[Surrey Iron Railway]] from Croydon to [[Wandsworth]] opened in 1803 and was the world's first public railway. Later nineteenth century railway building facilitated Croydon's growth as a [[commuter town]] for London. By the early 20th century, Croydon was an important industrial area, known for car manufacture, metal working and [[Croydon Airport]]. In the mid 20th century these sectors were replaced by retailing and the [[service economy]], brought about by massive redevelopment which saw the rise of office blocks and the [[Whitgift Centre]], the largest shopping centre in Greater London until 2008. Croydon was amalgamated into Greater London in 1965.\n\nCroydon lies on a transport corridor between [[central London]] and the south coast of England, to the north of two high gaps in the [[North Downs]], one taken by the A23 Brighton Road and the main railway line through [[Purley, London|Purley]] and [[Merstham]] and the other by the A22 from Purley to the M25 [[Godstone]] interchange.

In this Anglo-Saxon document the name is spelt [here he uses [[Old English Latin alphabet|Old English]] characters] ''Crogdaene''. Crog was, and still is, the Norse or Danish word for crooked, which is expressed in Anglo-Saxon by ''crumb'', a totally different word. From the Danish came our ''crook'' and ''crooked''.

The [[market place]] was laid out on the higher ground to the east of the manor house in the triangle now bounded by High Street, Surrey Street and Crown Hill. By the 16th century the manor house had become a substantial palace, used as the main summer home of the archbishops and visited by monarchs and other dignitaries. However, the palace gradually became dilapidated and surrounded by [[slum]]s and stagnant ponds, and in 1781 the archbishops sold it, and in its place purchased a [[Addington Palace|new residence]] at nearby [[Addington, London|Addington]]. Nevertheless, many of the buildings of the original [[Croydon Palace]] survive, and are in use today as [[Old Palace School]].\n\n[[File:P1180529 Croydon Minster....07.05.14...jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Grade I listed [[Croydon Minster]] parish church]]\nThe Parish Church (now [[Croydon Minster]]) is a [[Gothic architecture|Perpendicular]]-style church, which was remodelled in 1849 but destroyed in a great fire in 1867, following which only the tower, south porch, and outer walls remained. A new church was designed by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]], one of the greatest architects of the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]], and opened in 1870. His design loosely followed the previous layout, with knapped [[flint]] facing and many of the original features, including several important tombs.

Regular meetings became established first on a course at [[Park Hill Recreation Ground|Park Hill]] in 1860 and from 1866 at [[Woodside, London|Woodside]], where particularly good prizes were offered for the races run under [[National Hunt]] rules. In that sphere its prestige was second only to that of [[Aintree]], home of the [[Grand National]]. Increasing local opposition to the presence of allegedly unruly racegoers coupled with the need to obtain a licence from the local authority led to it being closed down in 1890.<ref>Beavis, Jim: The Croydon Races</ref>\n\nThe Elizabethan [[Whitgift Foundation|Whitgift Almshouses]], the \"Hospital of the Holy Trinity\", in the centre of Croydon at the corner of North End and George Street, were erected by Archbishop John Whitgift. He petitioned for and received permission from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] to establish a hospital and school in Croydon for the \"poor, needy and impotent people\" from the parishes of Croydon and [[Lambeth]]. The foundation stone was laid in 1596 and the building was completed in 1599.\n\nThe premises included the Hospital or Almshouses, providing accommodation for between 28 and 40 people, and a nearby schoolhouse and schoolmaster's house. There was a Warden in charge of the well-being of the almoners. The building takes the form of a courtyard surrounded by the chambers of the almoners and various offices.\n\nThreatened by various reconstruction plans and road-widening schemes, the Almshouses were saved in 1923 by intervention of the [[House of Lords]]. On 21 June 1983 Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] visited the Almshouses and unveiled a plaque celebrating the recently completed reconstruction of the building. On 22 March each year the laying of the foundation stone is commemorated as Founder's Day.\n\nThe Grade II listed West Croydon Baptist Church was built in 1873 by J. Theodore Barker.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Croydon became the terminus of two pioneering commercial transport links with London. The first, opened in 1803, was the horse-drawn [[Surrey Iron Railway]] from [[Wandsworth]], which in 1805 was extended to [[Merstham]], as the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway. The second, opened in 1809, was the [[Croydon Canal]], which branched off the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] at [[Deptford]]. The [[London and Croydon Railway]] (an [[Atmospheric railway|atmospheric]] and steam-powered railway) opened between [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] and [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] in 1839, using much of the route of the canal (which had closed in 1836). Other connections to London and the south followed.\n\nThe arrival of the railways and other communications advances in the 19th century led to a 23-fold increase in Croydon's population between 1801 and 1901.<ref name=Brewer/> This rapid expansion of the town led to considerable health problems, especially in the damp and overcrowded working class district of Old Town. In response to this, in 1849 Croydon became one of the first towns in the country to acquire a [[Local board of health]]. The Board constructed [[public health]] infrastructure including a [[lake|reservoir]], [[water supply network]], [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, a pumping station and [[sewage collection and disposal|sewage disposal]] works.\n\nThe Surrey Street Pumping Station is Grade II listed; it was built in four phases. starting with the engine house in 1851, with a further engine house in 1862, a further extension in 1876-7 to house a compound horizontal engine and a further extension in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1079248&resourceID=5|title=Heritage Gateway \u2013 Results|work=heritagegateway.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== A growing town ===\n[[File:North End, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 625263.jpg|thumb|left|The Allders building in 1983]]\n[[File:Kookai Clock Croydon.jpg|thumb|upright|Shopping parade in North End, Croydon]]\n\nIn 1883 Croydon was incorporated as a borough. In 1889 it became a county borough, with a greater degree of autonomy. The new county borough council implemented the Croydon Improvement scheme in the early 1890s, which widened the High Street and cleared much of the \"Middle Row\" slum area. The remaining slums were [[gentrification|cleared]] shortly after [[Second World War]], with much of the population relocated to the isolated new settlement of [[New Addington]]. New stores opened and expanded in central Croydon, including [[Allders]], Kennards and Grade II listed [[Grants of Croydon|Grants]], as well as the first [[Sainsbury's]] self-service shop in the country.<ref name=Brewer/> There was a market on [[Surrey Street Market|Surrey Street]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surreystreetmarket.org.uk/|title=Surrey Street Market|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221114735/http://www.surreystreetmarket.org.uk/|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCroydon was the location of London's main airport until the Second World War. During the war, much of central Croydon was devastated by German [[V-1 flying bomb]]s and [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[rocket]]s, and for many years the town bore the scars of the destruction. After the war, [[Heathrow Airport]] superseded [[Croydon Airport]] as London's main airport, and Croydon Airport quickly went into a decline, finally closing in 1959.\n\nBy the 1950s, with its continuing growth, the town was becoming [[traffic congestion|congested]], and the Council decided on another major redevelopment scheme. The Croydon Corporation Act was passed in 1956. This, coupled with national government incentives for office relocation out of Central London, led to the building of new offices and accompanying road schemes through the late 1950s and 1960s, and the town boomed as a business centre in the 1960s, with many multi-storey office blocks, an [[underpass]], a [[Overpass|flyover]] and [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nIn 1960 Croydon celebrated its millennium with a pageant held at Lloyd Park and an exhibition held at the old Croydon Aerodrome.\n\n===Modern Croydon===\n{{See also|Economy of Croydon}}\n[[File:Rainbow and office block, Croydon (geograph 3851950).jpg|thumb|upright|[[No. 1 Croydon]], formerly the NLA Tower.<ref name=Three>{{cite web| title = Croydon, Route & What to See| work= London Footprints| url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/wkcroydonroute.htm| accessdate=20 March 2008}}</ref>]]\n\nThe growing town attracted many new buildings.

The locations of the crosses (recorded in 1580\u20131 and 1706) were Hand Cross (junction of Church Road and Church Street: modern [[House of Reeves|Reeves Corner]]); Crown Hill Cross (junction of Crown Hill and High Street); Stake or Stay Cross (junction of modern George Street and Park Lane); Hern Cross (junction of High Street and Coombe Road); and possibly \"at Burchall's House\", which may have been at the southern end of Old Town. In 1977 the four sites (including the supposed Burchall's House site, but excluding Crown Hill) were marked by modern plaques.</ref> These privileges set the area of the town apart from its rural hinterland, where the more usual and more restrictive rules of [[Manorialism|manorial tenure]] applied. However, Croydon did not hold any kind of formal [[Ancient borough|borough]] status.\n\nIn 1690, the leading inhabitants petitioned [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] for Croydon to be [[Ancient borough#Charters of incorporation|incorporated]] as a borough. The application was initially approved, the King authorising the drafting of a [[charter]], but the process was then abruptly halted, apparently through the intervention of Archbishop [[John Tillotson]], who probably feared a threat to his own authority over the town. The application was revived the following year, when Queen Mary again authorised a charter, but once again it was abandoned. A second petition in 1707 was effectively ignored.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43054 ''Victoria History of the County of Surrey''], vol. 4, p. 218.</ref><ref>Harris, ''Archbishops' Town'', pp. 271\u20132.</ref>\n\nCroydon's growth in the 19th century brought the issue of incorporation back on to the political agenda, and in 1883 the ancient parish of Croydon, apart from its [[exclave]] of Croydon Crook or [[Selsdon]], was created a [[municipal borough]] within Surrey. In 1889, because the population was high enough, it was made a [[county borough]], exempt from county administration.\n\nIn 1965 the [[County Borough of Croydon]] was abolished and the area was transferred to [[Greater London]] and combined with the [[Coulsdon and Purley Urban District]] to form the [[London Borough of Croydon]].\n\nIn recent decades, the borough has on several occasions sought [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]]. (This would be a purely [[honorific]] change of title, making no practical difference to the borough's governance.) A draft petition was submitted by the [[County Borough of Croydon|County Borough]] to the [[Home Office]] in 1951, a more formal petition in 1954, and two more applications in 1955 and 1958. When the [[London Borough of Croydon|London Borough]] was created in 1965, the Council endeavoured to have it styled a City, as was the [[City of Westminster]]. Further bids for city status were made in 1977, 1992, 2000, 2002, and 2012. All have failed. The borough's predominant argument has always been its size: in 2000 it pointed out that it was \"the largest town which does not have the title of City in the whole of Western Europe\". The grounds on which it has been turned down have invariably been that it is (as was stated in 1992) merely \"part of the London conurbation, rather than a place with a character and identity of its own\". Undeterred, council representatives have more than once described Croydon as \"a city in all but name\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=City Status in the British Isles, 1830\u20132002 |first=John |last=Beckett |authorlink=John Beckett (historian) |place=Aldershot |publisher=Ashgate |year=2005 |isbn=0-7546-5067-7 |pages=100, 103, 110, 122\u20134, 129, 131, 143, 146, 150, 166, 168, 175\u20136}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Results of Diamond Jubilee Civic Honours Competition announced|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/results-of-diamond-jubilee-civic-honours-competition-announced|publisher=Cabinet Office|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=14 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Modern governance===\nThe London Borough of Croydon has a Labour-controlled council with 40 Labour councillors and 30 Conservative councillors elected on 22 May 2014.{{Fix|text=out of date}}\n\nMost of the town centre lies within the [[Addiscombe (ward)|Addiscombe]] and [[Fairfield (Croydon ward)|Fairfield]] wards, which form part of the [[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]] constituency.<ref name=\"ccconstituencyfairfield\">{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf |title=London Borough of Croydon map of wards |publisher=Croydon Council |accessdate=18 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627171929/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> The rest of the town centre is in the [[Croham (ward)|Croham ward]], which is part of the [[Croydon South (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon South]] constituency.

To the north of Croydon are typical London districts, whereas a short distance southeast (such as [[Coombe, Croydon|Coombe]] and [[Selsdon]]) is green, hilly and rural land. To the west are industrial areas, part of which are in the [[London Borough of Sutton]]. The southern suburbs are mainly affluent and also hilly.\n\nThe town centre is bordered by [[Waddon]] immediately southwest of central Croydon. To the west, inside the [[London Borough of Sutton]] lies [[Beddington]]. To the north are [[Broad Green, London|Broad Green]], [[Thornton Heath]] and [[Selhurst]]. To the south lies South Croydon, and going further south are [[Purley, London|Purley]] and [[Sanderstead]]. To the east lie [[Addiscombe]] and [[Shirley, London|Shirley]].\n\nCroydon High Street runs from South Croydon up to the point where it meets the street called [[North End, Croydon|North End]]. North End is the main shopping street, while Croydon High Street is the main restaurant quarter.\n\nThe High Street is also home to Wrencote House, a [[Listed building|Grade II* listed building]]. Dating from the late 17th or early 18th centuries, and probably built as a merchant's house, it has a distinctive \"H\" plan form over its four floors (including basement and attic storey). External features include a rich red brick facade with black [[Brickwork#Orientation|headers]], and a heavily carved and enriched wooden eaves cornice.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1079291 |desc=Wrencote |grade=II* |access-date=15 August 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://planning.croydon.gov.uk/DocOnline/88608_19.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714153254/http://planning.croydon.gov.uk/DocOnline/88608_19.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Wellesley Road]] on the [[A212 road]] forms a north\u2013south axis through the town centre. In line with [[London Plan]] policy, there have been a number of proposals to create greater integration between [[East Croydon station]], which lies on one side of the A212, and the town centre of Croydon, which lies on the other side of it. [[Croydon Vision 2020]] aims to tackle this though such solutions as making the road easier for pedestrians to cross by creating a centre island pathway.\n\nTopographically, central Croydon generally lies between {{convert|50|m}} (in the north) and {{convert|70|m}} (in the south) above [[sea level]]. Elevation significantly climbs towards the east of the town - Coombe Park peaks at about {{convert|95|m}} above sea level, whereas the [[Addington Hills]], [[Coombe Wood]] and Addington Golf Course are as high as {{convert|145|m}}, with the southern end of [[New Addington]] having an elevation of over {{convert|160|m}}. To the south, [[Croham Hurst]] has a hill of {{convert|145|m}}, and the highest area of Croydon is the [[Sanderstead Plantation]] at {{convert|175|m}}. The lowest elevation is around [[Broad Green]], about {{convert|35|m}} above sea level.\n\n===River Wandle===\nThe [[River Wandle]] is a tributary of the [[River Thames]], flowing some 9 miles (14&nbsp;km) to [[Wandsworth]] and [[Putney]] from its source in Croydon. It roughly forms the borough's western boundary with the [[London Borough of Sutton]], and for part of its length also forms the boundary between the London Boroughs of Croydon and [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]]. One of its tributaries rises in [[Selhurst]].\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Fairfield Halls - London.jpg|right|thumb|The Fairfield Halls, Croydon's entertainment complex]]\n[[File:Spreadeagle, Croydon, CR0 (2353133094).jpg|thumb|The Spreadeagle, central Croydon, which also houses the theatre of the same name that opened in 2013]]\n\nThere are several arts venues. Foremost is the [[Fairfield Halls]], opened in 1962, which consists of a large concert hall frequently used for BBC recordings, the [[Ashcroft Theatre]] and the Arnhem Gallery. Fairfield is the home of the [[London Mozart Players]]. Many famous faces have appeared at the Fairfield Halls, including [[The Beatles]], [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]], [[Omid Djalili]], [[Robert Cray]], [[JLS]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[BB King]], [[Don McLean]], [[The Monkees]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Gladys Knight]], [[Morecambe and Wise]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[The Stylistics]], [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], [[Level 42]], [[A-HA]], [[John Mayall]], [[Jools Holland]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[James Last]], and [[Coolio]].

The Fairfield Halls are currently under extensive modernisation and refurbishment.\n\n[[File:Croydon clocktower.jpg|thumb|left|Croydon Clocktower Arts Centre]]\n[[Croydon Clocktower]], built by the London Borough of Croydon in the mid-1990s, houses a state-of-the-art library, a performance venue in the old reference library, the [[David Lean Cinema]] - which is a small, independent, art-house cinema and the [[Museum of Croydon]], which details Croydon's history. The building links into the Victorian Town Hall and some areas of the building, most notably the Braithwaite Hall, are part of the original town hall and library complex, built in 1892\u20131896 to a design by Charles Henman.<ref>Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner, ''London 2: South''.

It had to close because of the major [[Ruskin Square]] redevelopment, but will re-open in the future in a new larger theatre building within the new development.{{citation needed|reason=that it will reopen|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Pembroke Theatre had many productions with well-known actors before its closure in about 1962.\n\nThere are several local and small venues for comedy and community events dotted around Croydon and its districts. [[Croydon Youth Theatre Organisation]] celebrated its 40th birthday in 2005. There are several community arts groups, particularly in the large [[British Asian|Asian]] community.\n\n[[The Spread Eagle Theatre]] is a new 50-seat studio theatre. Opened in October 2013, it is situated in the town centre, 10 minutes' walk from East Croydon Station. The Spread Eagle works closely with its sister venue, the Old Joint Stock Theatre in Birmingham. Both venues champion 'big plays for small spaces' with an emphasis on new writing, supporting emerging artists and theatre companies.\n\nA calendar titled \"Rare Roundabouts of Croydon\", with a picture of a different Croydon roundabout each month, has enjoyed some success.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/hereford/worcs/3346435.stm|title=Roundabout calendar is gift hit|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Public art===\n[[File:Croydon mural.jpg|thumb|One of several new murals to have appeared in Croydon town centre in recent years]]\nAbout 60 murals were added to Croydon town centre in 2018, as part of the Rise street art festival coordinated by the Rise art gallery in Croydon.<ref>[https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/amazing-new-murals-popping-up-1989368 Croydon Advertiser]</ref><ref>[https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/stunning-new-mural-been-painted-2168416 Croydon Advertiser 1 November 2018]</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\nCroydon is the setting of two poems by British Poet Laureate [[Sir John Betjeman]], \"Croydon\" and \"Love in a Valley\".\n\nThe borough has been the residence of many renowned authors and novelists, including [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], who set up house in Norwood, [[D.H. Lawrence]], and French novelist [[\u00c9mile Zola]], who lived for a time in the Queen's Hotel, Upper Norwood. [[Cicely Mary Barker]], author and illustrator of the [[Flower Fairies]] series of books, was born in Croydon.\n\nCroydon is the setting of novels.

He grew up in Croydon and sang in the church choir at St George's and taught at the [[Crystal Palace School|Crystal Palace School of Music]] and many other schools of music. He died from [[pneumonia]] after collapsing at [[West Croydon station]]. There is an impressive grave with a touching poem at Bandon Hill Cemetery, and exhibits about him in the [[Museum of Croydon]].\n\nIn addition to the Fairfield Halls, there have been several venues in Croydon that have hosted rock acts. Established in 1976, the Cartoon was a popular live music venue that closed in 2006. The Greyhound in Park Lane, played host to acts such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[the Who]], [[David Bowie]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]], [[the Boomtown Rats]], [[A-ha]] in (1987) and others during the 1960s and '70s.

Artists such as [[Benga (musician)|Benga]] and [[Skream]], who honed their production and DJing skills whilst working at the now defunct ''Big Apple Records'' on [[Surrey Street Market|Surrey Street]], along with Norwood's [[Digital Mystikz]], [[DJ Chef]], Timi Korus and Thornton Heath's [[Plastician]], form the core roster of dubstep DJs and producers. Moreover, UK rappers and grime artists [[Stormzy]], [[Krept and Konan]], Nadia Rose and Section Boyz all hail from or can trace their roots to the London Borough of Croydon.\n\nThe band [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]] formed in Croydon.\n\nThe oldest currently surviving shop in Croydon is [[46 South End]]. Dating back to the 16th century, this Grade II listed building still retains all its original Tudor features.

The ITV police drama ''[[The Bill]]'', although set in East London, was filmed in Croydon and many of the town centre locations were filmed around Surrey Street and St George's House (the Nestle building). Sun Hill Police Station is in nearby Mitcham.  The opening credit sequence for the sitcom ''[[Terry and June]]'' featured the eponymous stars walking around the Whitgift Centre and the Fairfield Halls. In 2007, the music video for pop star [[Mika (singer)|Mika]]'s single \"[[Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)]]\" was shot in various locations around the town, including High Street and [[Surrey Street Market]].

It serves [[Mitcham]], [[Woodside, London|Woodside]], [[Addiscombe]] and the [[Purley Way]] retail and industrial area.\n\nThe system was previously known as the \"Croydon Tramlink\", having been established under the Croydon Tramlink Act 1994.\n\n===Road===\nA few miles to the south of Croydon is a small [[gap (landform)|gap]] in the [[North Downs]], a route for transport from London to the south coast.  The London to Brighton road used to pass through the town on [[North End, Croydon|North End]] before the [[A23 road|A23]] [[Purley Way]] was built to the west. [[Transport for London]] operates many bus routes in and around Croydon. Most buses serve [[West Croydon bus station]], next to the railway station and tram stop.\n\n=== Croydon's early transport links ===\nThe horse-drawn [[Surrey Iron Railway]] was the world's first public railway. It was opened in 1803, had double track, was some {{convert|8.5|mi|km|1}} long and ran from Wandsworth to Croydon, at what is now Reeves Corner. In 1805 it was extended to Merstham as the Croydon, Merstham, and Godstone Railway. The railway boom of the 1840s brought superior and faster steam lines and it closed in 1846. The route is followed in part by the modern [[Tramlink]]. The last remaining sections of rail can be seen behind railings in a corner of Rotary Field in Purley.\n\nWith the opening of the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] line to [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] in 1860 extra platforms were provided at East Croydon, which the LBSCR treated as a separate station named ''New Croydon''. The [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]] (SER) was excluded from this station, which ran exclusively LBSCR services to London at fares cheaper than those the SER offered from the original station.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">White, H.P., op. cit. p. 79.</ref> In 1864, the LBSCR obtained authorisation to construct a \u00bd-mile long branch line into the heart of the town centre near Katharine Street, where [[Croydon Central railway station|Croydon Central station]] was built. The line opened in 1868 but enjoyed little success and closed in 1871, only to reopen in 1886 under pressure from the Town Council before finally closing in 1890. The station was subsequently demolished and replaced by the [[Croydon Clocktower|Town Hall]].<ref>Treby, E., op. cit. p. 106.</ref> In 1897\u201398, East Croydon and New Croydon were merged into a single station with three [[island platform]]s, which remain today, but the two stations kept separate booking accounts until 1924.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe [[Croydon Canal]] ran for {{convert|9.5|mi|km|1}} from what is now [[West Croydon station]]. It travelled north largely along the course of the present railway line to [[New Cross Gate]], where it joined the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] and went on into the River Thames. It opened in 1809 and had 28 [[canal lock|locks]]. It had a strong competitor in the Surrey Iron Railway and was never a financial success. It sold out to the [[London & Croydon Railway]] in 1836. The lake at [[South Norwood]] is the former reservoir for the canal.\n\n[[Croydon Airport]] on Purley Way was the main airport for London until it was superseded by [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[Gatwick Airport]]. It opened on 29 March 1920 by combining two smaller airfields used for defence in World War I. It developed into one of the great airports of the world during the 1920s and 1930s. It welcomed the world's pioneer aviators in its heyday. As aviation technology progressed and aircraft became larger and more numerous, it was recognised in 1952 that the airport would be too small to cope with increasing air traffic and its role was decreased.. The last scheduled flight departed on 30 September 1959. The air terminal, now known as Airport House adjoining Purley Way to the west of the town, has been restored and has a museum open one day a month. The name \"Croydon Airport\" is still used as a landmark and as a bus stop designation.\n\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main article|List of people from Croydon}}\n[[File:Amy Winehouse f4962007 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Amy Winehouse attended the BRIT School, Croydon]]\n* [[Peggy Ashcroft]] (1907\u20131991), actress, was born in Croydon, lived in George Street as a child and attended [[Croydon High School]] (where she was a friend of Jane Drew); she is honoured in the naming of the [[Ashcroft Theatre]], part of the [[Fairfield Halls]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n* [[Jon Benjamin (Jewish leader)|Jon Benjamin]], later Chief Executive of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], was born and grew up in Croydon.\n* [[Raymond Chandler]] (1888\u20131959), American detective fiction writer, lived in [[Upper Norwood]] as a schoolboy\n* [[Anne Clark (poet)|Anne Clark]] (1960\u2013), electronic music artist and poet, was born in Croydon\n* [[Roger Ward Crosskey]] (1930-2017), entomologist, born in Croydon\n* [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] (1859\u20131930), Scottish-born fiction writer, lived at No. 12 Tennison Road, [[South Norwood]] and featured the area in some of his [[Sherlock Holmes]] detective stories\n* [[Jane Drew]] (1911\u20131996), modernist architect, was born in [[Thornton Heath]] and was head girl at Croydon High School (where she was a friend of Peggy Ashcroft)\n* [[Havelock Ellis]] (1859\u20131939), sexologist, was born in Croydon\n* [[Paul Garelli]] (1924\u20132006), French Assyriologist, was born in Croydon\n* [[Ben Haenow]] (1985\u2013), pop singer, winner of [[The X Factor (UK series 11)|''The X Factor'' (UK series 11)]], was born in Croydon\n* [[Roy Hodgson]] (1947\u2013), England football manager, was born and grew up in Croydon\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] (1996\u2013), actor in five [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films, was educated at the BRIT School\n* [[William Forster Lanchester]], [[FRSE]] (1875\u20131953), zoologist, born and raised in Croydon\n* [[Rachel Khoo]] cook, editor-in-chief of online lifestyle magazine ''Khoollect'', with her own [[BBC]] series\n* [[D.

The three sub-colleges are the Croydon Sixth Form College, Croydon Skills and Enterprise College and the Croydon Higher Education College. The Higher Education College offers university-level education in a range of subjects from Law through to Fine Art. Croydon Skills and Enterprise College delivers training and education opportunities.\n\nThe town has five fee-paying schools, three of which are part of the Whitgift Foundation. Two are boys' schools (though Trinity School has a co-educational sixth form): [[Whitgift School]] was situated near the Almshouses until 1931 when it moved to its current site in Haling Park in South Croydon, the Middle School (renamed [[Trinity School of John Whitgift]] in 1954) remained on the site until 1965 when it moved to Shirley Park.  A direct grant grammar school until 1968, it is now a member of the Headmasters' Conference. [[Old Palace School]], an independent girls' school situated in the old Summer Palace of the Archbishops of Canterbury, joined the Whitgift Foundation group of schools in 1993. [[Croham Hurst School]], an independent girls' school in South Croydon, became part of Old Palace in 2007 and its old buildings are now used as the Old Palace junior school. The site of the old Whitgift grammar school is now the Whitgift shopping centre whose freehold is owned by the Whitgift Foundation.\n\nCroydon is also home to three single-sex Catholic state schools. The formerly independent [[The John Fisher School|John Fisher School]] in Purley has not charged fees since the late 1970s, but during the 1990s was selective, choosing boys via exams, interviews, tests, previous school reports and written statements.{{CN|date=March 2016}} The school ended its selection policy in 1999, and now accepts pupils under a [[Catholic points-based admission school|points system]], which favours those who have high mass attendance and whose families are most involved in the [[Catholic Church]].{{CN|date=March 2016}} [[Coloma Convent Girls' School]] is one of England's Catholic girls' schools: formerly a [[grammar school]], it has now, like John Fisher, adopted points-based admission criteria.

The [[Surrey Iron Railway]] from Croydon to [[Wandsworth]] opened in 1803 and was the world's first public railway. Later nineteenth century railway building facilitated Croydon's growth as a [[commuter town]] for London. By the early 20th century, Croydon was an important industrial area, known for car manufacture, metal working and [[Croydon Airport]]. In the mid 20th century these sectors were replaced by retailing and the [[service economy]], brought about by massive redevelopment which saw the rise of office blocks and the [[Whitgift Centre]], the largest shopping centre in Greater London until 2008. Croydon was amalgamated into Greater London in 1965.\n\nCroydon lies on a transport corridor between [[central London]] and the south coast of England, to the north of two high gaps in the [[North Downs]], one taken by the A23 Brighton Road and the main railway line through [[Purley, London|Purley]] and [[Merstham]] and the other by the A22 from Purley to the M25 [[Godstone]] interchange. Road traffic is diverted away from a largely pedestrianised town centre, mostly consisting of [[North End, Croydon|North End]]. [[East Croydon railway station|East Croydon]] is a major hub of the national railway transport system, with frequent fast services to central London, [[Brighton]] and the south coast. The town is also at the centre of the only [[Tramlink|tramway system]] in southern England.\n\n==History==\n===Toponymy===\n[[File:Say map.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest detailed map of Croydon, drawn by the 18-year-old [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] in 1785.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Brian |last=Lancaster |title=Jean-Baptiste Say's 1785 Croydon street plan |journal=[[Croydon Natural History & Scientific Society]] Bulletin |volume=144 |date=March 2012 |pages=2\u20135 }}</ref> The early settlement of Old Town, including the [[Croydon Minster|parish church]] (marked B) lies to the west; while the triangular medieval marketplace, probably associated with [[Robert Kilwardby|Archbishop Kilwardby]]'s market charter of 1276, is clearly visible further east, although by this date it has been [[infill]]ed with buildings.]]\n\nAs the vast majority of place names in the area are of Anglo-Saxon origin, the theory accepted by most [[Philology|philologists]] is that the name Croydon derives originally from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''croh'', meaning \"[[crocus]]\", and ''denu'', \"[[valley]]\", indicating that, like [[Saffron Walden]] in Essex, it was a centre for the cultivation of [[saffron]].<ref name=\"Brewer\">{{cite book |last=Ayto |first=John |first2=Ian |last2=Crofton |title=Brewer's Britain and Ireland |year=2005 |publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] |location=|isbn= 0-304-35385-X|pages= }}<!--|accessdate= 17 July 2008--></ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=J.E.B. |last1=Gover |first2=A. |last2=Mawer |first3=F.M. |last3=Stenton |title=The Place-Names of Surrey |series=English Place-Name Society |volume=11 |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1934 |pages=47\u201348 }}</ref> It has been argued that this cultivation is likely to have taken place in the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period, when the saffron crocus would have been grown to supply the [[Roman London|London]] market, most probably for [[Phytotherapy|medicinal]] purposes, and particularly for the treatment of [[Blepharitis|granulation of the eyelids]].<ref name=Bird>{{cite journal |first=David |last=Bird |title=Croydon, Crocus and Collyrium |journal=London Archaeologist |volume=13 |issue=4 |year=2012 |pages=87\u201390 }}</ref>\n\nThere is also a plausible Brittonic origin for Croydon in the form \"Crai-din\" meaning \"settlement near fresh water\" (Cf \"Creuddyn\" Ceredigion), the name Crai (variously spelled) being found in Kent at various places even as late as the [[Domesday Book]]{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}.\n\nAlternative, although less probable, theories of the name's origin have been proposed. According to John Corbet Anderson: \"The earliest mention of Croydon is in the joint will of Beorhtric and Aelfswth, dated about the year 962. In this Anglo-Saxon document the name is spelt [here he uses [[Old English Latin alphabet|Old English]] characters] ''Crogdaene''. Crog was, and still is, the Norse or Danish word for crooked, which is expressed in Anglo-Saxon by ''crumb'', a totally different word. From the Danish came our ''crook'' and ''crooked''. This term accurately describes the locality; it is a ''crooked'' or ''winding valley'', in reference to the valley that runs in an oblique and serpentine course from [[Godstone]] to Croydon.\"<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |last=Corbet Anderson |first= J. |title=A Short Chronicle Concerning the Parish of Croydon in the County of Surrey |year=1882 |publisher=Reeves and Turner |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/shortchronicleco00andeuoft/page/19 19]\u201320 |url=https://archive.org/details/shortchronicleco00andeuoft }}</ref> Anderson challenged a claim, originally made by [[Andrew Ducarel|Andrew Coltee Ducarel]], that the name came from the Old French for \"chalk hill\", because it was in use at least a century before the French language would have been commonly used following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]. However, there was no long-term Danish occupation (see [[Danelaw]]) in Surrey, which was part of [[Wessex]], and Danish-derived nomenclature is also highly unlikely. More recently, David Bird has speculated that the name might derive from a personal name, ''Crocus'': he suggests a family connection with the documented [[Chrocus]], king of the [[Alemanni]], who allegedly played a part in the proclamation of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] as emperor at [[Eboracum|York]] in AD 306.<ref name=Bird />\n\n===Early history===\nThe town lies on the line of the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] from [[London to Brighton Way|London to Portslade]], and there is some archaeological evidence for small-scale [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlement in the area: there may have been a ''[[mansio]]'' (staging-post) here.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Muriel |last=Shaw |title=Roman Period Burials in Croydon |journal=[[CNHSS]] Archaeology Section Newsletter |date=September 1988 |pages=2\u20136 |issue=71 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Jim |last1=Davison |first2=Geoff |last2=Potter |title=Excavations at 14 Whitgift Street, Croydon, 1987\u201388 and 1995 |journal=London Archaeologist |volume=8 |year=1998 |pages=227\u2013232 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Ken |last1=Maggs |first2=Paul |last2=De'Athe |title=The Roman Roads of East Surrey and the Kent Border |publisher=North Downs Press |place=Westerham |year=1987 |pages=40\u201344 }}</ref> Later, in the 5th to 7th centuries, a large [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan]] [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] cemetery was situated on what is now Park Lane, although the extent of any associated settlement is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jacqueline I. |last=McKinley |title=The Early Saxon Cemetery at Park Lane, Croydon |journal=Surrey Archaeological Collections |volume=90 |year=2003 |pages=1\u2013116 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hines |first=John |year=2004 |chapter=''S\u016b\u00fere-g\u0113'' \u2013 the Foundations of Surrey |editor1-first=Jonathan |editor1-last=Cotton |editor2-first=Glenys |editor2-last=Crocker |editor3-first=Audrey |editor3-last=Graham |title=Aspects of Archaeology and History in Surrey: towards a Research Framework for the County |place=Guildford |publisher=Surrey Archaeological Society |isbn=0954146034 |pages=92\u201398 }}</ref>\n\nBy the late Saxon period Croydon was the hub of an estate belonging to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]].

The [[market place]] was laid out on the higher ground to the east of the manor house in the triangle now bounded by High Street, Surrey Street and Crown Hill. By the 16th century the manor house had become a substantial palace, used as the main summer home of the archbishops and visited by monarchs and other dignitaries. However, the palace gradually became dilapidated and surrounded by [[slum]]s and stagnant ponds, and in 1781 the archbishops sold it, and in its place purchased a [[Addington Palace|new residence]] at nearby [[Addington, London|Addington]]. Nevertheless, many of the buildings of the original [[Croydon Palace]] survive, and are in use today as [[Old Palace School]].\n\n[[File:P1180529 Croydon Minster....07.05.14...jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Grade I listed [[Croydon Minster]] parish church]]\nThe Parish Church (now [[Croydon Minster]]) is a [[Gothic architecture|Perpendicular]]-style church, which was remodelled in 1849 but destroyed in a great fire in 1867, following which only the tower, south porch, and outer walls remained. A new church was designed by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]], one of the greatest architects of the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]], and opened in 1870. His design loosely followed the previous layout, with knapped [[flint]] facing and many of the original features, including several important tombs. Croydon Parish Church is the burial place of six Archbishops of Canterbury: [[John Whitgift]], [[Edmund Grindal]], [[Gilbert Sheldon]], [[William Wake]], [[John Potter (Archbishop)|John Potter]] and [[Thomas Herring]].

Increasing local opposition to the presence of allegedly unruly racegoers coupled with the need to obtain a licence from the local authority led to it being closed down in 1890.<ref>Beavis, Jim: The Croydon Races</ref>\n\nThe Elizabethan [[Whitgift Foundation|Whitgift Almshouses]], the \"Hospital of the Holy Trinity\", in the centre of Croydon at the corner of North End and George Street, were erected by Archbishop John Whitgift. He petitioned for and received permission from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] to establish a hospital and school in Croydon for the \"poor, needy and impotent people\" from the parishes of Croydon and [[Lambeth]]. The foundation stone was laid in 1596 and the building was completed in 1599.\n\nThe premises included the Hospital or Almshouses, providing accommodation for between 28 and 40 people, and a nearby schoolhouse and schoolmaster's house. There was a Warden in charge of the well-being of the almoners. The building takes the form of a courtyard surrounded by the chambers of the almoners and various offices.\n\nThreatened by various reconstruction plans and road-widening schemes, the Almshouses were saved in 1923 by intervention of the [[House of Lords]]. On 21 June 1983 Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] visited the Almshouses and unveiled a plaque celebrating the recently completed reconstruction of the building. On 22 March each year the laying of the foundation stone is commemorated as Founder's Day.\n\nThe Grade II listed West Croydon Baptist Church was built in 1873 by J. Theodore Barker. It is a red brick building with stone dressings. Its three bays are divided by paired Doric pilasters supporting a triglyph frieze and panelled parapet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1358814&resourceID=5|title=Heritage Gateway \u2013 Results|work=heritagegateway.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe Parish Church of St Michael and All Angels by [[John Loughborough Pearson]] in West Croydon was built between 1880 and 1885, and is Grade I listed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1079297&resourceID=5|title=Heritage Gateway \u2013 Results|work=heritagegateway.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Industrial Revolution and the railway===\n[[File:Croydon water pumping house 21-12-14..jpg|thumb|upright|The Grade II listed Surrey Street Pumping Station, Croydon]]\nThe development of [[Brighton]] as a fashionable resort in the 1780s increased the significance of Croydon's role as a halt for [[stage coach]]es on the road south of London. At the beginning of the 19th century, Croydon became the terminus of two pioneering commercial transport links with London. The first, opened in 1803, was the horse-drawn [[Surrey Iron Railway]] from [[Wandsworth]], which in 1805 was extended to [[Merstham]], as the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway. The second, opened in 1809, was the [[Croydon Canal]], which branched off the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] at [[Deptford]]. The [[London and Croydon Railway]] (an [[Atmospheric railway|atmospheric]] and steam-powered railway) opened between [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] and [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] in 1839, using much of the route of the canal (which had closed in 1836). Other connections to London and the south followed.\n\nThe arrival of the railways and other communications advances in the 19th century led to a 23-fold increase in Croydon's population between 1801 and 1901.<ref name=Brewer/> This rapid expansion of the town led to considerable health problems, especially in the damp and overcrowded working class district of Old Town. In response to this, in 1849 Croydon became one of the first towns in the country to acquire a [[Local board of health]]. The Board constructed [[public health]] infrastructure including a [[lake|reservoir]], [[water supply network]], [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, a pumping station and [[sewage collection and disposal|sewage disposal]] works.\n\nThe Surrey Street Pumping Station is Grade II listed; it was built in four phases. starting with the engine house in 1851, with a further engine house in 1862, a further extension in 1876-7 to house a compound horizontal engine and a further extension in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1079248&resourceID=5|title=Heritage Gateway \u2013 Results|work=heritagegateway.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== A growing town ===\n[[File:North End, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 625263.jpg|thumb|left|The Allders building in 1983]]\n[[File:Kookai Clock Croydon.jpg|thumb|upright|Shopping parade in North End, Croydon]]\n\nIn 1883 Croydon was incorporated as a borough. In 1889 it became a county borough, with a greater degree of autonomy. The new county borough council implemented the Croydon Improvement scheme in the early 1890s, which widened the High Street and cleared much of the \"Middle Row\" slum area. The remaining slums were [[gentrification|cleared]] shortly after [[Second World War]], with much of the population relocated to the isolated new settlement of [[New Addington]]. New stores opened and expanded in central Croydon, including [[Allders]], Kennards and Grade II listed [[Grants of Croydon|Grants]], as well as the first [[Sainsbury's]] self-service shop in the country.<ref name=Brewer/> There was a market on [[Surrey Street Market|Surrey Street]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surreystreetmarket.org.uk/|title=Surrey Street Market|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221114735/http://www.surreystreetmarket.org.uk/|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCroydon was the location of London's main airport until the Second World War. During the war, much of central Croydon was devastated by German [[V-1 flying bomb]]s and [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[rocket]]s, and for many years the town bore the scars of the destruction. After the war, [[Heathrow Airport]] superseded [[Croydon Airport]] as London's main airport, and Croydon Airport quickly went into a decline, finally closing in 1959.\n\nBy the 1950s, with its continuing growth, the town was becoming [[traffic congestion|congested]], and the Council decided on another major redevelopment scheme. The Croydon Corporation Act was passed in 1956. This, coupled with national government incentives for office relocation out of Central London, led to the building of new offices and accompanying road schemes through the late 1950s and 1960s, and the town boomed as a business centre in the 1960s, with many multi-storey office blocks, an [[underpass]], a [[Overpass|flyover]] and [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nIn 1960 Croydon celebrated its millennium with a pageant held at Lloyd Park and an exhibition held at the old Croydon Aerodrome.\n\n===Modern Croydon===\n{{See also|Economy of Croydon}}\n[[File:Rainbow and office block, Croydon (geograph 3851950).jpg|thumb|upright|[[No. 1 Croydon]], formerly the NLA Tower.<ref name=Three>{{cite web| title = Croydon, Route & What to See| work= London Footprints| url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/wkcroydonroute.htm| accessdate=20 March 2008}}</ref>]]\n\nThe growing town attracted many new buildings. The [[Fairfield Halls]] arts centre and event venue opened in 1962. Croydon developed as an important centre for shopping, with the construction of the [[Whitgift Centre]] in 1969.  [[No. 1 Croydon]] (formerly the NLA Tower)<ref name=\"Three\"/> designed by [[Richard Seifert|Richard Seifert & Partners]] was completed in 1970. The [[Warehouse Theatre]] opened in 1977.\n\nThe 1990s saw further changes intended to give the town a more attractive image. These included the closure of [[North End, Croydon|North End]] to vehicles in 1989 and the opening of the [[Croydon Clocktower]] arts centre in 1994. An early success of the Centre was the \"[[Picasso]]'s Croydon Period\" exhibition of March\u2013May 1995. \n\nThe Croydon [[Tramlink]] began operation in May 2000 (see Transport section below).\n\nThe Prospect West office development was built in 1991 to 1992, and its remodelling planned in 2012<ref>[http://planning.croydon.gov.uk/DocOnline/107782_4.pdf Planning Croydon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090739/http://planning.croydon.gov.uk/DocOnline/107782_4.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> has now been completed.

The locations of the crosses (recorded in 1580\u20131 and 1706) were Hand Cross (junction of Church Road and Church Street: modern [[House of Reeves|Reeves Corner]]); Crown Hill Cross (junction of Crown Hill and High Street); Stake or Stay Cross (junction of modern George Street and Park Lane); Hern Cross (junction of High Street and Coombe Road); and possibly \"at Burchall's House\", which may have been at the southern end of Old Town. In 1977 the four sites (including the supposed Burchall's House site, but excluding Crown Hill) were marked by modern plaques.</ref> These privileges set the area of the town apart from its rural hinterland, where the more usual and more restrictive rules of [[Manorialism|manorial tenure]] applied. However, Croydon did not hold any kind of formal [[Ancient borough|borough]] status.\n\nIn 1690, the leading inhabitants petitioned [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] for Croydon to be [[Ancient borough#Charters of incorporation|incorporated]] as a borough. The application was initially approved, the King authorising the drafting of a [[charter]], but the process was then abruptly halted, apparently through the intervention of Archbishop [[John Tillotson]], who probably feared a threat to his own authority over the town. The application was revived the following year, when Queen Mary again authorised a charter, but once again it was abandoned. A second petition in 1707 was effectively ignored.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43054 ''Victoria History of the County of Surrey''], vol. 4, p. 218.</ref><ref>Harris, ''Archbishops' Town'', pp. 271\u20132.</ref>\n\nCroydon's growth in the 19th century brought the issue of incorporation back on to the political agenda, and in 1883 the ancient parish of Croydon, apart from its [[exclave]] of Croydon Crook or [[Selsdon]], was created a [[municipal borough]] within Surrey. In 1889, because the population was high enough, it was made a [[county borough]], exempt from county administration.\n\nIn 1965 the [[County Borough of Croydon]] was abolished and the area was transferred to [[Greater London]] and combined with the [[Coulsdon and Purley Urban District]] to form the [[London Borough of Croydon]].\n\nIn recent decades, the borough has on several occasions sought [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]]. (This would be a purely [[honorific]] change of title, making no practical difference to the borough's governance.) A draft petition was submitted by the [[County Borough of Croydon|County Borough]] to the [[Home Office]] in 1951, a more formal petition in 1954, and two more applications in 1955 and 1958. When the [[London Borough of Croydon|London Borough]] was created in 1965, the Council endeavoured to have it styled a City, as was the [[City of Westminster]]. Further bids for city status were made in 1977, 1992, 2000, 2002, and 2012. All have failed. The borough's predominant argument has always been its size: in 2000 it pointed out that it was \"the largest town which does not have the title of City in the whole of Western Europe\". The grounds on which it has been turned down have invariably been that it is (as was stated in 1992) merely \"part of the London conurbation, rather than a place with a character and identity of its own\". Undeterred, council representatives have more than once described Croydon as \"a city in all but name\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=City Status in the British Isles, 1830\u20132002 |first=John |last=Beckett |authorlink=John Beckett (historian) |place=Aldershot |publisher=Ashgate |year=2005 |isbn=0-7546-5067-7 |pages=100, 103, 110, 122\u20134, 129, 131, 143, 146, 150, 166, 168, 175\u20136}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Results of Diamond Jubilee Civic Honours Competition announced|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/results-of-diamond-jubilee-civic-honours-competition-announced|publisher=Cabinet Office|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=14 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Modern governance===\nThe London Borough of Croydon has a Labour-controlled council with 40 Labour councillors and 30 Conservative councillors elected on 22 May 2014.{{Fix|text=out of date}}\n\nMost of the town centre lies within the [[Addiscombe (ward)|Addiscombe]] and [[Fairfield (Croydon ward)|Fairfield]] wards, which form part of the [[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]] constituency.<ref name=\"ccconstituencyfairfield\">{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf |title=London Borough of Croydon map of wards |publisher=Croydon Council |accessdate=18 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627171929/http://www.croydon.gov.uk/content/departments/570770/570872/wardmap.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> The rest of the town centre is in the [[Croham (ward)|Croham ward]], which is part of the [[Croydon South (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon South]] constituency.

To the north of Croydon are typical London districts, whereas a short distance southeast (such as [[Coombe, Croydon|Coombe]] and [[Selsdon]]) is green, hilly and rural land. To the west are industrial areas, part of which are in the [[London Borough of Sutton]]. The southern suburbs are mainly affluent and also hilly.\n\nThe town centre is bordered by [[Waddon]] immediately southwest of central Croydon. To the west, inside the [[London Borough of Sutton]] lies [[Beddington]]. To the north are [[Broad Green, London|Broad Green]], [[Thornton Heath]] and [[Selhurst]]. To the south lies South Croydon, and going further south are [[Purley, London|Purley]] and [[Sanderstead]]. To the east lie [[Addiscombe]] and [[Shirley, London|Shirley]].\n\nCroydon High Street runs from South Croydon up to the point where it meets the street called [[North End, Croydon|North End]]. North End is the main shopping street, while Croydon High Street is the main restaurant quarter.\n\nThe High Street is also home to Wrencote House, a [[Listed building|Grade II* listed building]]. Dating from the late 17th or early 18th centuries, and probably built as a merchant's house, it has a distinctive \"H\" plan form over its four floors (including basement and attic storey).

In line with [[London Plan]] policy, there have been a number of proposals to create greater integration between [[East Croydon station]], which lies on one side of the A212, and the town centre of Croydon, which lies on the other side of it. [[Croydon Vision 2020]] aims to tackle this though such solutions as making the road easier for pedestrians to cross by creating a centre island pathway.\n\nTopographically, central Croydon generally lies between {{convert|50|m}} (in the north) and {{convert|70|m}} (in the south) above [[sea level]].

To the south, [[Croham Hurst]] has a hill of {{convert|145|m}}, and the highest area of Croydon is the [[Sanderstead Plantation]] at {{convert|175|m}}. The lowest elevation is around [[Broad Green]], about {{convert|35|m}} above sea level.\n\n===River Wandle===\nThe [[River Wandle]] is a tributary of the [[River Thames]], flowing some 9 miles (14&nbsp;km) to [[Wandsworth]] and [[Putney]] from its source in Croydon. It roughly forms the borough's western boundary with the [[London Borough of Sutton]], and for part of its length also forms the boundary between the London Boroughs of Croydon and [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]].

Artists such as [[Benga (musician)|Benga]] and [[Skream]], who honed their production and DJing skills whilst working at the now defunct ''Big Apple Records'' on [[Surrey Street Market|Surrey Street]], along with Norwood's [[Digital Mystikz]], [[DJ Chef]], Timi Korus and Thornton Heath's [[Plastician]], form the core roster of dubstep DJs and producers. Moreover, UK rappers and grime artists [[Stormzy]], [[Krept and Konan]], Nadia Rose and Section Boyz all hail from or can trace their roots to the London Borough of Croydon.\n\nThe band [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]] formed in Croydon.\n\nThe oldest currently surviving shop in Croydon is [[46 South End]]. Dating back to the 16th century, this Grade II listed building still retains all its original Tudor features. Records show that the premises has been a shop for at least 163 years, where street directories from 1851 give the names of E. C. Johnson & Thorpe. The building is currently in use as a music shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justflutes.com/|title=Just Flutes of London, Specialist Flute Shop|work=justflutes.com}}</ref>\n\nCroydon is home to the [[BRIT School]] for performing arts and technology, based in Selhurst, which has produced stars such as [[Adele]], [[Jessie J]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Katie Melua]], [[Katy B]], [[Kate Nash]], [[Imogen Heap]], [[Rizzle Kicks]], [[Dane Bowers]] and members of [[the Feeling]] & [[the Kooks]]. Independent of such institutions, Croydon is also the home of artists like [[Nosferatu D2]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pri.org/stories/2012-08-29/fan-releases-nosferatu-d2-s-album-again-ignites-cult-following|title=Fan Releases Nosferatu D2\"\u00b2s Album Again, Ignites Cult Following|work=Public Radio International}}</ref> [[Magic Brother]], Bad Sign, Cassettes and Grimecore band Caine.\n\n=== Media ===\nCroydon plays host to the popular [[Channel 4]] show ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]''. The ITV police drama ''[[The Bill]]'', although set in East London, was filmed in Croydon and many of the town centre locations were filmed around Surrey Street and St George's House (the Nestle building). Sun Hill Police Station is in nearby Mitcham.  The opening credit sequence for the sitcom ''[[Terry and June]]'' featured the eponymous stars walking around the Whitgift Centre and the Fairfield Halls. In 2007, the music video for pop star [[Mika (singer)|Mika]]'s single \"[[Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)]]\" was shot in various locations around the town, including High Street and [[Surrey Street Market]]. The Delta Point building, close to [[West Croydon station]] appeared in the film ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' as [[Gotham City|Gotham]] General Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/d/Dark_Knight_Rises.html#.WGeby7aLR-U|title=Filming Locations for The Dark Knight Rises}}</ref>\n\nCroydon has its own fully independent television station: it does not receive any government or local authority grant or funding and is supported by donations, sponsorship and by commercial advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croydontv.co.uk/|title=Croydon TV |work=croydontv.co.uk}}</ref> In 2012, Croydon Radio, an internet radio station, began in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croydonradio.com/|title=Croydon Radio|work=croydonradio.com}}</ref>\n\n==Sport and leisure==\n===Parks and open spaces===\n[[File:Queens Gardens.JPG|thumb|Queens Gardens in the town centre]]\nThe borough has many woods for walking in, which together account for 8.5% of Greater London's woodland resource (626.46 hectares).<ref>{{cite web|title=London Borough of Croydon:  Habitat Action Plan|url=https://www.croydon.gov.uk/sites/default/files/articles/downloads/hp-woodlands.pdf|work=croydon.gov.uk|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> These include [[Lloyd Park (Croydon)|Lloyd Park]] and [[Croham Hurst]].\n\nAmong several other parks and open spaces around Croydon, there is an area of landscaped green space in the town centre called Queens Gardens; it is adjacent to the town hall and Clocktower art centre.\n\n===Clubs and teams===\nThe most prominent sports club in the borough is [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace Football Club]], based in the purpose-built stadium of [[Selhurst Park]] in the north of the borough since 1924. Palace won promotion to the [[Premier League]] (the top tier of football in England) at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. Croydon has a [[Non-League football]] club, [[Croydon F.C.]] and Purley Saint Germain, who play at Croydon Arena.\n\n[[Streatham-Croydon RFC]], founded in 1871, is one of Greater London's oldest extant [[rugby union]] clubs, playing just north of the town centre at Frant Road in [[Thornton Heath]].\n\nCroydon Amphibians SC plays in Division 2 British Waterpolo League. In 2008, the team won the National League Division 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bwpl.org/|title=The British Water Polo League|work=bwpl.org}}</ref>\n\nThe borough also has a women's [[roller derby]] team called Croydon Roller Derby, which trains in Carshalton. The team was established in the early part of this decade and has played both national and international teams including Roller Derby Madrid, Stuttgart Valley Rollergirlz and Oxford Roller Derby. The sport is full-contact and played on quad skates with players skating round an elliptical track.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:East Croydon Railway Station - England - Electronic Information Board in the Concourse - 270404.jpg|thumb|The concourse of East Croydon station]]\n[[File:East Croydon station April 2016.jpg|thumb|East Croydon mainline station]]\n[[File:Tram 2544 at Church Street.jpg|thumb|Tram no. 2544 in Church Street, 2008]]\n\n===Rail===\nCroydon is served by [[East Croydon railway station|East Croydon]] and [[West Croydon railway station|West Croydon]].

It serves [[Mitcham]], [[Woodside, London|Woodside]], [[Addiscombe]] and the [[Purley Way]] retail and industrial area.\n\nThe system was previously known as the \"Croydon Tramlink\", having been established under the Croydon Tramlink Act 1994.\n\n===Road===\nA few miles to the south of Croydon is a small [[gap (landform)|gap]] in the [[North Downs]], a route for transport from London to the south coast.  The London to Brighton road used to pass through the town on [[North End, Croydon|North End]] before the [[A23 road|A23]] [[Purley Way]] was built to the west. [[Transport for London]] operates many bus routes in and around Croydon. Most buses serve [[West Croydon bus station]], next to the railway station and tram stop.\n\n=== Croydon's early transport links ===\nThe horse-drawn [[Surrey Iron Railway]] was the world's first public railway. It was opened in 1803, had double track, was some {{convert|8.5|mi|km|1}} long and ran from Wandsworth to Croydon, at what is now Reeves Corner. In 1805 it was extended to Merstham as the Croydon, Merstham, and Godstone Railway. The railway boom of the 1840s brought superior and faster steam lines and it closed in 1846. The route is followed in part by the modern [[Tramlink]]. The last remaining sections of rail can be seen behind railings in a corner of Rotary Field in Purley.\n\nWith the opening of the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] line to [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] in 1860 extra platforms were provided at East Croydon, which the LBSCR treated as a separate station named ''New Croydon''. The [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]] (SER) was excluded from this station, which ran exclusively LBSCR services to London at fares cheaper than those the SER offered from the original station.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">White, H.P., op. cit. p. 79.</ref> In 1864, the LBSCR obtained authorisation to construct a \u00bd-mile long branch line into the heart of the town centre near Katharine Street, where [[Croydon Central railway station|Croydon Central station]] was built. The line opened in 1868 but enjoyed little success and closed in 1871, only to reopen in 1886 under pressure from the Town Council before finally closing in 1890. The station was subsequently demolished and replaced by the [[Croydon Clocktower|Town Hall]].<ref>Treby, E., op. cit. p. 106.</ref> In 1897\u201398, East Croydon and New Croydon were merged into a single station with three [[island platform]]s, which remain today, but the two stations kept separate booking accounts until 1924.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe [[Croydon Canal]] ran for {{convert|9.5|mi|km|1}} from what is now [[West Croydon station]]. It travelled north largely along the course of the present railway line to [[New Cross Gate]], where it joined the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] and went on into the River Thames. It opened in 1809 and had 28 [[canal lock|locks]]. It had a strong competitor in the Surrey Iron Railway and was never a financial success. It sold out to the [[London & Croydon Railway]] in 1836. The lake at [[South Norwood]] is the former reservoir for the canal.\n\n[[Croydon Airport]] on Purley Way was the main airport for London until it was superseded by [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[Gatwick Airport]]. It opened on 29 March 1920 by combining two smaller airfields used for defence in World War I. It developed into one of the great airports of the world during the 1920s and 1930s. It welcomed the world's pioneer aviators in its heyday. As aviation technology progressed and aircraft became larger and more numerous, it was recognised in 1952 that the airport would be too small to cope with increasing air traffic and its role was decreased.. The last scheduled flight departed on 30 September 1959. The air terminal, now known as Airport House adjoining Purley Way to the west of the town, has been restored and has a museum open one day a month. The name \"Croydon Airport\" is still used as a landmark and as a bus stop designation.\n\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main article|List of people from Croydon}}\n[[File:Amy Winehouse f4962007 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Amy Winehouse attended the BRIT School, Croydon]]\n* [[Peggy Ashcroft]] (1907\u20131991), actress, was born in Croydon, lived in George Street as a child and attended [[Croydon High School]] (where she was a friend of Jane Drew); she is honoured in the naming of the [[Ashcroft Theatre]], part of the [[Fairfield Halls]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n* [[Jon Benjamin (Jewish leader)|Jon Benjamin]], later Chief Executive of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], was born and grew up in Croydon.\n* [[Raymond Chandler]] (1888\u20131959), American detective fiction writer, lived in [[Upper Norwood]] as a schoolboy\n* [[Anne Clark (poet)|Anne Clark]] (1960\u2013), electronic music artist and poet, was born in Croydon\n* [[Roger Ward Crosskey]] (1930-2017), entomologist, born in Croydon\n* [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] (1859\u20131930), Scottish-born fiction writer, lived at No. 12 Tennison Road, [[South Norwood]] and featured the area in some of his [[Sherlock Holmes]] detective stories\n* [[Jane Drew]] (1911\u20131996), modernist architect, was born in [[Thornton Heath]] and was head girl at Croydon High School (where she was a friend of Peggy Ashcroft)\n* [[Havelock Ellis]] (1859\u20131939), sexologist, was born in Croydon\n* [[Paul Garelli]] (1924\u20132006), French Assyriologist, was born in Croydon\n* [[Ben Haenow]] (1985\u2013), pop singer, winner of [[The X Factor (UK series 11)|''The X Factor'' (UK series 11)]], was born in Croydon\n* [[Roy Hodgson]] (1947\u2013), England football manager, was born and grew up in Croydon\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] (1996\u2013), actor in five [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films, was educated at the BRIT School\n* [[William Forster Lanchester]], [[FRSE]] (1875\u20131953), zoologist, born and raised in Croydon\n* [[Rachel Khoo]] cook, editor-in-chief of online lifestyle magazine ''Khoollect'', with her own [[BBC]] series\n* [[D.

The three sub-colleges are the Croydon Sixth Form College, Croydon Skills and Enterprise College and the Croydon Higher Education College. The Higher Education College offers university-level education in a range of subjects from Law through to Fine Art. Croydon Skills and Enterprise College delivers training and education opportunities.\n\nThe town has five fee-paying schools, three of which are part of the Whitgift Foundation. Two are boys' schools (though Trinity School has a co-educational sixth form): [[Whitgift School]] was situated near the Almshouses until 1931 when it moved to its current site in Haling Park in South Croydon, the Middle School (renamed [[Trinity School of John Whitgift]] in 1954) remained on the site until 1965 when it moved to Shirley Park.  A direct grant grammar school until 1968, it is now a member of the Headmasters' Conference. [[Old Palace School]], an independent girls' school situated in the old Summer Palace of the Archbishops of Canterbury, joined the Whitgift Foundation group of schools in 1993. [[Croham Hurst School]], an independent girls' school in South Croydon, became part of Old Palace in 2007 and its old buildings are now used as the Old Palace junior school. The site of the old Whitgift grammar school is now the Whitgift shopping centre whose freehold is owned by the Whitgift Foundation.\n\nCroydon is also home to three single-sex Catholic state schools. The formerly independent [[The John Fisher School|John Fisher School]] in Purley has not charged fees since the late 1970s, but during the 1990s was selective, choosing boys via exams, interviews, tests, previous school reports and written statements.{{CN|date=March 2016}} The school ended its selection policy in 1999, and now accepts pupils under a [[Catholic points-based admission school|points system]], which favours those who have high mass attendance and whose families are most involved in the [[Catholic Church]].{{CN|date=March 2016}} [[Coloma Convent Girls' School]] is one of England's Catholic girls' schools: formerly a [[grammar school]], it has now, like John Fisher, adopted points-based admission criteria.

By 1906 the population had grown to 140,000, a phenomenon of rapid growth that was to be repeated in the 1920s in neighbouring areas such as [[Harrow, London|Harrow]]. The Metropolitan line service was withdrawn in 1940, when the station was served by the Bakerloo line,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and later the [[Jubilee line]].\n\nThe [[First World War]] caused Willesden to change from a predominantly [[middle class]] suburb to a [[working class]] part of London. After the war, Willesden grew rapidly as many factories opened up with numerous flats and terraced houses. The local council encouraged building to prevent large unemployment and decline.\nTo the present day, Willesden has been shaped by the patterns of migration which marks it out as one of the most diverse areas in the [[United Kingdom]].

In 1923, the specialist coach builder [[Freestone and Webb]] established their base in Willesden, producing bespoke cars on [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and Bentley chassis until 1956.\n\nWillesden became a municipal borough in 1933, and it is at this time that the area became predominantly working class. A small [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] community had formed in Willesden by this time, which grew rapidly during the period of the [[Second World War]]. A small Jewish community of refugees from Europe also formed during the war, with 3.5% of the population in 1951 born in [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or [[Austria]].\nDuring the war, Willesden suffered large bombing damage due to the heavy concentration of manufacturing industry, such as munition factories, the location of 'Smiths Instruments\" (Used defensive aircraft instrumentation). Mulliner-Park Ward (Coach builders to Rolls Royce and Bentley, hand built cars).

The whole of central Willesden (bar the area by the Willesden Green station) was earmarked for redevelopment; however, this did not come to fruition.

By 1906 the population had grown to 140,000, a phenomenon of rapid growth that was to be repeated in the 1920s in neighbouring areas such as [[Harrow, London|Harrow]]. The Metropolitan line service was withdrawn in 1940, when the station was served by the Bakerloo line,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and later the [[Jubilee line]].\n\nThe [[First World War]] caused Willesden to change from a predominantly [[middle class]] suburb to a [[working class]] part of London. After the war, Willesden grew rapidly as many factories opened up with numerous flats and terraced houses.
