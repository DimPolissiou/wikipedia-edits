Its returning staff from ''[[Mother (video game)|Mother]]'' (1989) included writer/director [[Shigesato Itoi]] and lead programmer [[Satoru Iwata]], as well as composers [[Keiichi Suzuki]] and [[Hirokazu Tanaka]], who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the [[Music of the Mother series#EarthBound|soundtrack]], including [[salsa music|salsa]], [[reggae]], and [[dub music|dub]]. Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original ''Mother'', and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed around May 1994.\n\nThemed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of [[Americana]] and [[Western culture]], ''EarthBound'' subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a [[reality|real world]] setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, taxi cabs, and walking nooses. For its American release, the game was marketed with a $2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed \"this game stinks\". Additionally, the game's puns and humor were reworked by localizer [[Marcus Lindblom]], and the title was changed from ''Mother 2'' to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.\n\nInitial reviewers had little praise for ''EarthBound'' in the United States, where it sold half as many copies as in Japan. Critics attributed this to a combination of its simple graphics, satirical marketing campaign, and a lack of market interest in the genre. However, in ensuing years, a [[EarthBound fandom|dedicated fan community]] spawned which advocated for the series' recognition. Starting with the first installment in 1999, Ness has appeared as a playable character in each entry of the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], which helped popularize ''EarthBound''. By the 2000s, the game had become regarded as a \"[[sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]] amongst gaming's cognoscenti\",{{r|Eurogamer: M3 review}} with multiple reader polls and critics naming it one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. It was followed by the Japan-only sequel ''[[Mother 3]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2006. In 2013, ''EarthBound'' was given a worldwide release on the [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] following years of fan lobbying, marking its debut in territories including Europe.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File: Mother 2 Summers.png|left|thumb|Poo, Jeff, Paula, and Ness (left to right) walking the Summers beachfront]]\n''EarthBound'' features many traditional role-playing game elements: the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game's two-dimensional [[Fictional universe|world]] composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives experience points for victories.<ref name = \"EB battle\">{{cite book | title = EarthBound Player's Guide | editor = Nintendo of America | publisher = [[Nintendo of America, Inc.]] | pages = 10, 11 | year = 1995}}</ref> If enough experience points are acquired, a character's level will increase. This pseudo-randomly increases the character's attributes, such as offense, defense, and the maximum hit points (HP) and psychic points (PP) of each character. Rather than using an [[overworld]] map screen like most console RPGs of its era, the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world.{{r|Famitsu: Itoi}} Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. The game uses [[oblique projection]], while most 2D RPGs use a \"top-down\" view on a grid or an isometric perspective.<ref name=\"1UP: Retronauts 5\"/>\n\nUnlike its predecessor, ''EarthBound'' does not use random encounters. When physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen dissolves into battle mode. In combat, characters and enemies possess a certain amount of HP. Blows to an enemy reduce the amount of HP. Once an enemy's HP reaches zero, that enemy is defeated. If a specific type of enemy is defeated, there is a chance that the character will receive an item after the battle. In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. These actions can include attacking, healing, spying (reveals enemy weakness/strengths), mirroring (emulate a specific enemy), and running away. Characters can also use special PSI attacks that require PP. Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. Whenever a character receives damage, the HP box gradually \"rolls\" down, similar to an odometer. This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious.{{refn|group=nb|If the counter reaches zero as the battle is won, it will be set to 1 HP instead and the character will survive.}} If all characters are rendered unconscious, the game transitions to an endgame screen, asking if the player wants to continue. An affirmative response brings Ness, conscious, back to the last telephone he saved from, with half the money on his person at the time of his defeat, and with other party members showing as still unconscious. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind (indicated by a translucent green swirl which fills the screen), the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind (in this case, the swirl is red). Neutral priority is indicated by a black swirl. Unlike other RPGs, the enemies are not killed, but only \"made tame\" (with the exception of Giygas). Additionally, as Ness and his friends become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the battle sequence, and weaker monsters will begin to flee from Ness and his friends rather than chase them.<ref name = \"EB battle\"/>\n\nCurrency is indirectly received from Ness' father, who can also save the game's progress. Each time the party wins a battle, Ness' father deposits money in an account that can be withdrawn at [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]]. In towns, players can visit various stores where weapons, armor, and items can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items can be used for a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.<ref name = \"EB Other\">{{cite book | title = EarthBound Player's Guide | editor = Nintendo of America | publisher = [[Nintendo of America, Inc.]] | page = 12 | year = 1995}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n''EarthBound'' takes place about a decade after the events of ''Mother'', in the fictional country of Eagleland. The player starts as a young boy named Ness{{refn|group=nb|Players are asked to name their characters at the beginning of the game.<ref name=\"USgamer: the deal\"/>}} as he investigates a nearby meteorite crash<ref name=\"GameZone review\"/> with his neighbor, Pokey,<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/>{{refn|group=nb|While named Pokey in ''EarthBound'', he is named Porky in the Japanese version.

They find that an alien force, [[Giygas]], has enveloped and consumed the world in hatred and consequently turned animals, humans, and objects into malicious creatures. A small, bee-like creature from the future instructs Ness to collect melodies in a Sound Stone from eight Sanctuaries to preemptively stop the force,<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> but is killed shortly thereafter when Pokey and Picky's mother mistakes him for a pest. While visiting these eight Sanctuaries,<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/> Ness meets three other kids named Paula, Jeff, and Poo \u2013 \"a psychic girl, an eccentric inventor, and a ponytailed martial artist\", respectively<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> \u2013 who join his party.<ref name=\"GameZone review\"/> Along the way, Ness visits the cultists of Happy Happy Village, where he saves Paula, and the zombie-infested Threed, where the two of them fall prey to a trap. After Paula telepathically instructs Jeff in a Winters boarding school to rescue them, they continue to Saturn Valley, a village filled with a species of creatures called Mr. Saturn, the city of Fourside, and the seaside resort Summers. Meanwhile, Poo, the prince of Dalaam, partakes in a seemingly violent meditation called \"[[Mu (negative)|Mu]] Training\" before joining the party as well.<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/>\n\nThe party continues to travel to the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp, another village of creatures called Tenda who need a book to overcome their shyness, and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled,<ref name=\"Tilden\"/> Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side.<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/> Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots so as to not destroy their bodies through time travel. The group discovers a device that contains Giygas, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who has been aiding Giygas all along and is using alien technology. After being defeated in battle, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight{{sfn|Tilden|1995|pp=116\u2013119}} the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, and eventually the player, who pray for the children's safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness \u2013 human emotions \u2013 and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence.<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/> In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 250\n| image1 = Shigesato-Itoi-Meguro-September20-2015.jpg\n| image2 = Satoru Iwata headshot square.jpg\n| footer = ''EarthBound'' designer Shigesato Itoi and producer Satoru Iwata\n}}\n\nThe first ''Mother'' was released for the NES in 1989.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Man Who Wrote\"/> Its sequel, ''Mother 2'', or ''EarthBound'', was developed over five years<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> by Ape and [[HAL Laboratory|HAL]], and published through [[Nintendo]].<ref name=\"IGN: top SNES\"/> The game was written and designed by Japanese author, musician, and advertiser [[Shigesato Itoi]],<ref name=\"ONM review\"/> and produced by [[Satoru Iwata]], who became Nintendo's president and CEO.<ref name=\"Polygon: Quash\"/> ''Mother 2'' was made with a development team different from that of the original game,<ref name=\"1101: cancel\"/> and most of its members were unmarried and willing to work all night on the project.<ref name=\"DREAM-07\"/> ''Mother 2''{{'s}} development took much longer than planned and came under repeated threat of cancellation.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> Itoi has said that the project's dire straits were resolved when Iwata joined the team.<ref name=\"1101: cancel\"/> Ape's programming team had more members than HAL on the project. The HAL team (led by lead programmer Iwata) worked on the game programming, while the Ape team (led by lead programmer Kouji Malta) worked on specific data, such as the text and maps. They spent biweekly retreats together at the HAL office in view of [[Mount Fuji]].<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9\"/>\n\nThe game continues ''Mother''{{'s}} story in that Giygas reappears as the antagonist (and thus did not die at the end of ''Mother'') and the player has the option of choosing whether to continue the protagonist's story by choosing whether to name their player-character the same as the original.<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 June\"/> He considered interstellar and interplanetary space travel instead of the confines of a single planet in the new game. After four months, Itoi scrapped the idea as clich\u00e9. Itoi sought to make a game that would appeal to populations that were playing games less, such as girls.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/>\n\nThe [[Mother (video game series)|''Mother'' series]] titles are built on what Itoi considered \"reckless wildness\", where he would offer ideas that encouraged his staff to contribute new ways of portraying scenes in the video game medium.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> He saw the titles foremost as games and not \"big scenario scripts\".<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> Itoi has said that he wanted the player to feel emotions such as \"distraught\" when playing the game.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> The game's writing was intentionally \"quirky and goofy\" in character,<ref name=\"Kotaku: Man Who Wrote\"/> and written in the Japanese [[kana]] script so as to give dialogue a conversational feel. Itoi thought of the default player-character names when he did not like his team's suggestions. Many of the characters were based on real life personalities. For instance, the desert miners were modeled on specific executives from a Japanese construction company.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> The final battle dialogue with Giygas was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the [[Shintoho]] film ''[[Kenpei to barabara shibijin|The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty]]'' that he had accidentally seen in his childhood.<ref name=\"1101: trauma\"/> Itoi referred to the battle background animations as a \"video drug\".<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> The same specialist made nearly 200 of these animations, working solely on backgrounds for two years.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/>\n\nThe idea for the rolling HP meter began with [[pachinko]] balls that would drop balls off the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for characters with high health. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> The bicycle was one of the harder elements to implement<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9\"/>\u2014it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. They thought it would be funny to have the delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off-screen.<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9\"/> The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in [[oblique projection]] required extra attention from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map, and didn't want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/>\n\n''Mother 2'' was designed to fit within an eight megabit limit, but was expanded in size and scope twice: first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> The game was originally scheduled for release in January 1993 on a 12 megabit cartridge.<ref name=\"SFM 1992\"/> It was finished around May 1994<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9\"/> and the Japanese release was set for August 27, 1994.<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 July\"/> With the extra few months, the team played the game and added small, personal touches.<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9\"/> Itoi told ''[[Weekly Famitsu]]'' that [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] liked the game and that it was the first role-playing game that Miyamoto had completed.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> ''Mother 2'' would release in North America about a year later.<ref name=\"Shacknews: EarthBotched\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{See also|EarthBound soundtrack}}\n\n''Mother'' composers [[Keiichi Suzuki]] and [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] returned to make the ''EarthBound'' soundtrack, along with newcomers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno.<ref>{{cite web|title=EarthBound Credits|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/earthbound/credits|website=Mobygames.com|publisher=Mobygames|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"RPGFan: soundtrack\"/> In comparison with ''Mother'', Itoi said that ''EarthBound'' had more \"jazzy\" pieces.{{r|Famitsu: Itoi}} Suzuki told ''Weekly Famitsu'' that the Super NES afforded the team more creative freedom with its eight-channel [[ADPCM]] based [[SPC700]], as opposed to the old Nintendo Entertainment System's restriction of five channels of basic waveforms. This entailed higher sound quality and music that sounds closer to his regular compositions.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Suzuki\"/> Itoi believes that ''EarthBound'' may be the first video game to use vibrato, or \"string-bending\", in its music.{{r|Famitsu: Itoi}} The soundtrack was released by [[Sony Records]] on November 2, 1994.<ref name=\"RPGFan: soundtrack\"/>{{refn|group=nb|It was later reprinted by Sony Music Direct on February 18, 2004.<ref name=\"RPGFan: soundtrack\"/>}}\n\nIn Suzuki's songwriting process, he would first compose on a synthesizer before working with programmers to get it in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it was not included in the game.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Suzuki\"/> The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge\u2014about two compact discs.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/>\n\n[[File:Beach Boys 1967 (cropped).jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[The Beach Boys]] were one of many Western artists Suzuki and Tanaka drew inspiration from while developing the game's soundtrack.]]\n\nAccording to Tanaka, [[the Beach Boys]] were repeatedly referenced between him and Suzuki, and that he would often listen to co-founder [[Brian Wilson]]'s [[Brian Wilson (album)|1988 eponymous album]] while on the way to Suzuki's home.<ref name=\"1101: music\"/> Suzuki has stated that the [[Percussion notation|percussive arranging]] in the game's soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys' albums ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' (unreleased) and ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' (1967), which both contained American themes shared with [[Van Dyke Parks]]' ''[[Song Cycle (album)|Song Cycle]]'' (1968).

The second entry in the [[Mother (video game series)|''Mother'' series]], it was first released in Japan in August 1994, and in North America in June 1995. As Ness and his party of four, the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the evil alien force Giygas.\n\n''EarthBound'' had a lengthy development period that spanned five years. Its returning staff from ''[[Mother (video game)|Mother]]'' (1989) included writer/director [[Shigesato Itoi]] and lead programmer [[Satoru Iwata]], as well as composers [[Keiichi Suzuki]] and [[Hirokazu Tanaka]], who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the [[Music of the Mother series#EarthBound|soundtrack]], including [[salsa music|salsa]], [[reggae]], and [[dub music|dub]]. Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original ''Mother'', and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed around May 1994.\n\nThemed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of [[Americana]] and [[Western culture]], ''EarthBound'' subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a [[reality|real world]] setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, taxi cabs, and walking nooses. For its American release, the game was marketed with a $2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed \"this game stinks\". Additionally, the game's puns and humor were reworked by localizer [[Marcus Lindblom]], and the title was changed from ''Mother 2'' to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.\n\nInitial reviewers had little praise for ''EarthBound'' in the United States, where it sold half as many copies as in Japan. Critics attributed this to a combination of its simple graphics, satirical marketing campaign, and a lack of market interest in the genre. However, in ensuing years, a [[EarthBound fandom|dedicated fan community]] spawned which advocated for the series' recognition. Starting with the first installment in 1999, Ness has appeared as a playable character in each entry of the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], which helped popularize ''EarthBound''. By the 2000s, the game had become regarded as a \"[[sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]] amongst gaming's cognoscenti\",{{r|Eurogamer: M3 review}} with multiple reader polls and critics naming it one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. It was followed by the Japan-only sequel ''[[Mother 3]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2006. In 2013, ''EarthBound'' was given a worldwide release on the [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] following years of fan lobbying, marking its debut in territories including Europe.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File: Mother 2 Summers.png|left|thumb|Poo, Jeff, Paula, and Ness (left to right) walking the Summers beachfront]]\n''EarthBound'' features many traditional role-playing game elements: the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game's two-dimensional [[Fictional universe|world]] composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives experience points for victories.<ref name = \"EB battle\">{{cite book | title = EarthBound Player's Guide | editor = Nintendo of America | publisher = [[Nintendo of America, Inc.]] | pages = 10, 11 | year = 1995}}</ref> If enough experience points are acquired, a character's level will increase. This pseudo-randomly increases the character's attributes, such as offense, defense, and the maximum hit points (HP) and psychic points (PP) of each character. Rather than using an [[overworld]] map screen like most console RPGs of its era, the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world.{{r|Famitsu: Itoi}} Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. The game uses [[oblique projection]], while most 2D RPGs use a \"top-down\" view on a grid or an isometric perspective.<ref name=\"1UP: Retronauts 5\"/>\n\nUnlike its predecessor, ''EarthBound'' does not use random encounters. When physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen dissolves into battle mode. In combat, characters and enemies possess a certain amount of HP. Blows to an enemy reduce the amount of HP. Once an enemy's HP reaches zero, that enemy is defeated. If a specific type of enemy is defeated, there is a chance that the character will receive an item after the battle. In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. These actions can include attacking, healing, spying (reveals enemy weakness/strengths), mirroring (emulate a specific enemy), and running away. Characters can also use special PSI attacks that require PP. Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. Whenever a character receives damage, the HP box gradually \"rolls\" down, similar to an odometer. This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious.{{refn|group=nb|If the counter reaches zero as the battle is won, it will be set to 1 HP instead and the character will survive.}} If all characters are rendered unconscious, the game transitions to an endgame screen, asking if the player wants to continue. An affirmative response brings Ness, conscious, back to the last telephone he saved from, with half the money on his person at the time of his defeat, and with other party members showing as still unconscious. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind (indicated by a translucent green swirl which fills the screen), the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind (in this case, the swirl is red). Neutral priority is indicated by a black swirl. Unlike other RPGs, the enemies are not killed, but only \"made tame\" (with the exception of Giygas). Additionally, as Ness and his friends become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the battle sequence, and weaker monsters will begin to flee from Ness and his friends rather than chase them.<ref name = \"EB battle\"/>\n\nCurrency is indirectly received from Ness' father, who can also save the game's progress. Each time the party wins a battle, Ness' father deposits money in an account that can be withdrawn at [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]]. In towns, players can visit various stores where weapons, armor, and items can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items can be used for a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.<ref name = \"EB Other\">{{cite book | title = EarthBound Player's Guide | editor = Nintendo of America | publisher = [[Nintendo of America, Inc.]] | page = 12 | year = 1995}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n''EarthBound'' takes place about a decade after the events of ''Mother'', in the fictional country of Eagleland. The player starts as a young boy named Ness{{refn|group=nb|Players are asked to name their characters at the beginning of the game.<ref name=\"USgamer: the deal\"/>}} as he investigates a nearby meteorite crash<ref name=\"GameZone review\"/> with his neighbor, Pokey,<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/>{{refn|group=nb|While named Pokey in ''EarthBound'', he is named Porky in the Japanese version.

They find that an alien force, [[Giygas]], has enveloped and consumed the world in hatred and consequently turned animals, humans, and objects into malicious creatures. A small, bee-like creature from the future instructs Ness to collect melodies in a Sound Stone from eight Sanctuaries to preemptively stop the force,<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> but is killed shortly thereafter when Pokey and Picky's mother mistakes him for a pest. While visiting these eight Sanctuaries,<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/> Ness meets three other kids named Paula, Jeff, and Poo \u2013 \"a psychic girl, an eccentric inventor, and a ponytailed martial artist\", respectively<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> \u2013 who join his party.<ref name=\"GameZone review\"/> Along the way, Ness visits the cultists of Happy Happy Village, where he saves Paula, and the zombie-infested Threed, where the two of them fall prey to a trap. After Paula telepathically instructs Jeff in a Winters boarding school to rescue them, they continue to Saturn Valley, a village filled with a species of creatures called Mr. Saturn, the city of Fourside, and the seaside resort Summers. Meanwhile, Poo, the prince of Dalaam, partakes in a seemingly violent meditation called \"[[Mu (negative)|Mu]] Training\" before joining the party as well.<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/>\n\nThe party continues to travel to the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp, another village of creatures called Tenda who need a book to overcome their shyness, and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled,<ref name=\"Tilden\"/> Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side.<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/> Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots so as to not destroy their bodies through time travel. The group discovers a device that contains Giygas, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who has been aiding Giygas all along and is using alien technology. After being defeated in battle, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight{{sfn|Tilden|1995|pp=116\u2013119}} the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, and eventually the player, who pray for the children's safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness \u2013 human emotions \u2013 and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence.<ref name=\"IGN: 10 MMM\"/> In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 250\n| image1 = Shigesato-Itoi-Meguro-September20-2015.jpg\n| image2 = Satoru Iwata headshot square.jpg\n| footer = ''EarthBound'' designer Shigesato Itoi and producer Satoru Iwata\n}}\n\nThe first ''Mother'' was released for the NES in 1989.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Man Who Wrote\"/> Its sequel, ''Mother 2'', or ''EarthBound'', was developed over five years<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> by Ape and [[HAL Laboratory|HAL]], and published through [[Nintendo]].<ref name=\"IGN: top SNES\"/> The game was written and designed by Japanese author, musician, and advertiser [[Shigesato Itoi]],<ref name=\"ONM review\"/> and produced by [[Satoru Iwata]], who became Nintendo's president and CEO.<ref name=\"Polygon: Quash\"/> ''Mother 2'' was made with a development team different from that of the original game,<ref name=\"1101: cancel\"/> and most of its members were unmarried and willing to work all night on the project.<ref name=\"DREAM-07\"/> ''Mother 2''{{'s}} development took much longer than planned and came under repeated threat of cancellation.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> Itoi has said that the project's dire straits were resolved when Iwata joined the team.<ref name=\"1101: cancel\"/> Ape's programming team had more members than HAL on the project. The HAL team (led by lead programmer Iwata) worked on the game programming, while the Ape team (led by lead programmer Kouji Malta) worked on specific data, such as the text and maps. They spent biweekly retreats together at the HAL office in view of [[Mount Fuji]].<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9\"/>\n\nThe game continues ''Mother''{{'s}} story in that Giygas reappears as the antagonist (and thus did not die at the end of ''Mother'') and the player has the option of choosing whether to continue the protagonist's story by choosing whether to name their player-character the same as the original.<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 June\"/> He considered interstellar and interplanetary space travel instead of the confines of a single planet in the new game. After four months, Itoi scrapped the idea as clich\u00e9. Itoi sought to make a game that would appeal to populations that were playing games less, such as girls.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/>\n\nThe [[Mother (video game series)|''Mother'' series]] titles are built on what Itoi considered \"reckless wildness\", where he would offer ideas that encouraged his staff to contribute new ways of portraying scenes in the video game medium.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> He saw the titles foremost as games and not \"big scenario scripts\".<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> Itoi has said that he wanted the player to feel emotions such as \"distraught\" when playing the game.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Trippiest\"/> The game's writing was intentionally \"quirky and goofy\" in character,<ref name=\"Kotaku: Man Who Wrote\"/> and written in the Japanese [[kana]] script so as to give dialogue a conversational feel. Itoi thought of the default player-character names when he did not like his team's suggestions. Many of the characters were based on real life personalities. For instance, the desert miners were modeled on specific executives from a Japanese construction company.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> The final battle dialogue with Giygas was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the [[Shintoho]] film ''[[Kenpei to barabara shibijin|The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty]]'' that he had accidentally seen in his childhood.<ref name=\"1101: trauma\"/> Itoi referred to the battle background animations as a \"video drug\".<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> The same specialist made nearly 200 of these animations, working solely on backgrounds for two years.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/>\n\nThe idea for the rolling HP meter began with [[pachinko]] balls that would drop balls off the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for characters with high health. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> The bicycle was one of the harder elements to implement<ref name=\"Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9\"/>\u2014it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked.<ref name=\"Famitsu: Itoi\"/> Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player.

that \"few gaming communities are as passionate and active\" as ''EarthBound''{{'s}},{{r|Polygon: Quash}} and ''[[1UP.com]]''{{'s}} Bob Mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult

It became \"the definitive fan community for ''EarthBound'' on the web\" and had \"almost inexplicable\" growth.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p1}} ''Shacknews'' described the site's collection of fan-made media as \"absolutely massive\".{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} It also provided a place to aggregate information on the ''Mother'' series and to coordinate fan actions.{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}}\n\nThe ''EarthBound'' fan community at Starmen.net coalesced with the intent to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the ''Mother'' series.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p1}} The community drafted several thousand-person petitions for specific English-language ''Mother'' series releases,{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} but in time, their request shifted to no demand at all, wanting only their interest to be recognized by Nintendo.{{r|Ars Technica: epic}} A 2007 campaign for a ''Mother 3'' English localization led to the creation of a full-color, 270-page art book\u2014''The EarthBound Anthology''\u2014sent to Nintendo and press outlets as demonstration of consumer interest.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p2}} ''Shacknews'' called it more of a proposal than a collection of fan art, and \"the greatest gaming love letter ever created\".{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} Upon \"little\" response from Nintendo, [[Mother 3 fan translation|they decided to localize the game themselves]].{{r|1UP: Posthumous p2}} Starmen.net co-founder and professional game translator Clyde \"Tomato\" Mandelin led the project from its November 2006 announcement{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} to October 2008 finish.{{r|Kotaku: completed}} They then printed a \"professional quality strategy guide\" through [[Fangamer]], a video game merchandising site that spun off from Starmen.net.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p2}} Unlicensed Earthbound-themed merchandise produced by Fangamer contributors included t-shirts, a pin set, and a mug.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/feature_how_fangamer_changed_the_world_of_video_game_merchandise_forever|title=Feature: How Fangamer Changed The World Of Video Game Merchandise Forever|first=Nintendo|last=Life|date=October 26, 2019|website=Nintendo Life}}</ref>''[[The Verge]]'' cited the effort as proof of the fan base's dedication.{{r|The Verge: today}}\n\nOther fan efforts include ''EarthBound, USA'', a full-length documentary on Starmen.net and the fan community,{{r|IGN: EB USA}} and ''Mother 4'', a fan-produced sequel to the ''Mother'' series that went into production when Itoi definitively \"declared\" that he was done with the series.{{r|Kotaku: M4 amazing}} After following the fan community from afar, Lindblom came out to fans in mid-2012 and the press became interested in his work.

among Nintendo's highest priorities for rerelease, given the \"religious\" dedication of its fanbase.{{r|IGN: Retro Remix}} Though the game was ranked the most desired Virtual Console release by ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' readers, rated for release by the [[ESRB]],{{r|Nintendo Life: ESRB}} and able to be published with little effort,{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} the Wii version did not materialize.{{r|Polygon: Quash}} Many fans believed that music licensing or legal concerns impeded the rerelease.{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote|Kotaku: not music|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} English localizer Marcus Lindblom doubted that the game's music samples were an issue, since they were not a concern during development, and instead hypothesized that Nintendo did not realize the magnitude of the game's popular support and did not consider it a priority project.{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote}} By 2008, it was not apparent that Nintendo of America was considering a rerelease.{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} At the end of 2012, Itoi announced that the rerelease was moving forward,{{r|Digital Trends: Itoi teases}} which a January 2013 [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation confirmed.{{r|Polygon:

U Virtual Console.{{r|Polygon: Wii U Japan}} ''EarthBound'' producer Satoru Iwata soon announced a wider rerelease, citing fan interest on Nintendo's Miiverse social platform.{{r|Polygon: coming to VC}} The July 2013 American and European launch included a free, online recreation of the game's original Player's Guide, optimized for viewing on the [[Wii U Gamepad]].{{r|Polygon: now available}} The game was a top-seller on the Wii U Virtual Console, and both ''Kotaku'' users and first-time ''EarthBound'' players had an \"overwhelmingly positive\" response to the game.{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote}} Simon Parkin wrote that its rerelease was a \"momentous occasion\" as the return of \"one of Nintendo's few remaining lost classics\" after 20 years.{{r|ONM review}} The rerelease was one ''GameSpot'' editor's game of the year,{{r|GameSpot: Justin Haywald}} and ''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} Virtual Console game of the year.{{r|Nintendo Life: GOTY 2013}} The [[New Nintendo 3DS]]-specific Virtual Console received the rerelease the next year, in March 2016.{{r|3DS}} In September 2017, Nintendo released the [[Super NES Classic Edition]], which included ''EarthBound'' among its games.<ref

She attended the Schoevers Academy in [[Nijmegen]] and worked as an executive secretary from 1983 till 2000.\n\n==Writer to photographer==\nIn 2005 Henri\u00ebtte resumed writing. Her culinary erotic story ''Kalfsbraadstuk op tagliatelle met een zachte saus van witte port en kaas'' (''Veal roast on [[tagliatelle]] with a smooth sauce of white port and cheese'') was published in: ''Raadselige Roos 2005'', a collection of stories that had entered the competition for prose and poetry of the Literary Cafe for the Venray-region.\nTo illustrate the blogs that she posted online, she started to make self-portraits to go with the stories. At first she used a [[webcam]], then she switched to a simple compact camera. In 2006 the self-portraits almost completely replaced the stories and from that moment on she tells her life story with photos, using a [[single-lens reflex camera]], tripod and remote control.\n\n[[File:Let the fork do the talking.jpg|thumb|2009: Let the fork do the talking]]\n\n==Controversy==\nHenri\u00ebtte's work has caused controversy on several occasions. She has also been censored during an exhibition in the Euregio-Haus in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]], [[Germany]] and during an exhibition in the convention center (and former seminary) Rolduc in Kerkrade, The Netherlands. Her self-portrait ''Forgive me, Father, for...'' from the religious series ''I could\u2019ve had religion'' made the front page of the Dutch newspaper Sp!ts because of it.<ref>[http://www.lilithlove.eu/content/nieuws/782bb9d6.pdf Article in the Sp!ts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018013327/http://www.lilithlove.eu/content/nieuws/782bb9d6.pdf |date=2013-10-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 she was one of the ten leading artists from Limburg who were exhibited at the [[Pulchri Studio]] in [[Den Haag]], together with Ted Noten, Charles Eyck and Lei Molin. In the same year her work was also shown in the USA for the first time. During Photoville in [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]], [[New York City]] her work could be seen at two exhibitions: The Wonder of Woman and FotoFestival Naarden.\n\n==Photo documentary==\nIn 2012 she started her project ''A house is not a home'', in which the houses of complete strangers are the setting for her self-portraits. That same year she also started the photo documentary ''Risja, a story by Lilith - This is bugging me'', about Risja Steeghs a girl who lives in her village and who suffers from a severe form of [[Lyme disease]]. The 'Huis voor de Kunsten Limburg' in Roermond, The Netherlands, financially supported the travelling exhibition and the publication of a photo book with the same name. The proceeds from the book sales go to TeekOnMe, a foundation that supports the research of Lyme disease.\n\n==Private==\nPartner [[:nl:Henk Temming (zanger)|Henk Temming]].<ref>[https://edwinjanssen.photoshelter.com/image/I0000EPlLV8OO23A Henk Temming and partner Henri\u00ebtte van Gasteren]</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* 2012: ''Risja, a story by Lilith'' - This is bugging me {{ISBN|978-90-819714-0-9}}\n* 2013: ''A house is not a home'' {{ISBN|978-90-819714-1-6}}\n* 2015: ''Over hoeren & madonna\u2019s'' (met sonnetten van Paul Sterk) {{ISBN|978-90-6216-963-4}}\n* 2016: ''Skinny dipping'' {{ISBN|978-90-819714-2-3}}\n* 2020: ''HJIM, Greatest hits'' {{ISBN|978-90-819714-3-0}}\n\n==Museums==\n* [[w:nl:Museum van Bommel van Dam|Museum van Bommel van Dam (dutch)]], Venlo NL\n* [[w:nl:Museum f\u00fcr Zeitgen\u00f6ssische Kunst|Museum for modern art IKOB (dutch)]], Eupen B\n* [[w:nl:Limburgs Museum|Limburgs Museum (dutch)]], Venlo NL\n* [https://www.erfgoedhuisweert.nl Gemeentemuseum Jacob van Horne (dutch)], Weert NL\n* [[w:nl:CODA (Apeldoorn)|CODA museum (dutch)]], Apeldoorn NL\n* [[w:nl:Joods Cultureel Kwartier|Joods Cultureel Kwartier (dutch)]], Amsterdam NL\n* [[w:de:Museum Aktfotoart Dresden|Museum Aktfotoart Dresden (german)]], Dresden DE\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.hjimvangasteren.eu/ Official website]\n*[http://grungecake.com/interview-lilith-love-the-naked-truth/ Interview with GrungeCake Magazine]\n*[http://issuu.com/aortamag/docs/aorta07?e=6595143/2723781/ Article in Aorta Mag]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130717031959/http://www.kaltblut-magazine.com/lilith-love/ Interview with Kaltblut]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gasteren, HJIM van}}\n[[Category:1964 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:21st-century Dutch artists]]\n[[Category:Dutch women photographers]]\n[[Category:People from Horst aan de Maas]]\n[[Category:21st-century Dutch photographers]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Lilith Portret.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait 2011]]\n\n'''Henri\u00ebtte JIM van Gasteren''' is the [[pseudonym]] of '''Henri\u00ebtte Johanna Ignatia Maria van Gasteren''' ([[Sevenum]], September 9, 1964),  a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] photographer and artist, known for her, sometimes controversial, self-portraits.

In 2006 the self-portraits almost completely replaced the stories and from that moment on she tells her life story with photos, using a [[single-lens reflex camera]], tripod and remote control.\n\n[[File:Let the fork do the talking.jpg|thumb|2009: Let the fork do the talking]]\n\n==Controversy==\nHenri\u00ebtte's work has caused controversy on several occasions. She has also been censored during an exhibition in the Euregio-Haus in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]], [[Germany]] and during an exhibition in the convention center (and former seminary) Rolduc in Kerkrade, The Netherlands. Her self-portrait ''Forgive me, Father, for...'' from the religious series ''I could\u2019ve had religion'' made the front page of the Dutch newspaper Sp!ts because of it.<ref>[http://www.lilithlove.eu/content/nieuws/782bb9d6.pdf Article in the Sp!ts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018013327/http://www.lilithlove.eu/content/nieuws/782bb9d6.pdf |date=2013-10-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 she was one of the ten leading artists from Limburg who were exhibited at the [[Pulchri Studio]] in [[Den Haag]], together with Ted Noten, Charles Eyck and Lei Molin. In the same year her work was also shown in the USA for the first time. During Photoville in [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]], [[New York City]] her work could be seen at two exhibitions: The Wonder of Woman and FotoFestival Naarden.\n\n==Photo documentary==\nIn 2012 she started her project ''A house is not a home'', in which the houses of complete strangers are the setting for her self-portraits. That same year she also started the photo documentary ''Risja, a story by Lilith - This is bugging me'', about Risja Steeghs a girl who lives in her village and who suffers from a severe form of [[Lyme disease]]. The 'Huis voor de Kunsten Limburg' in Roermond, The Netherlands, financially supported the travelling exhibition and the publication of a photo book with the same name. The proceeds from the book sales go to TeekOnMe, a foundation that supports the research of Lyme disease.\n\n==Private==\nPartner [[:nl:Henk Temming (zanger)|Henk Temming]].<ref>[https://edwinjanssen.photoshelter.com/image/I0000EPlLV8OO23A Henk Temming and partner Henri\u00ebtte van Gasteren]</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* 2012: ''Risja, a story by Lilith'' - This is bugging me {{ISBN|978-90-819714-0-9}}\n* 2013: ''A house is not a home'' {{ISBN|978-90-819714-1-6}}\n* 2015: ''Over hoeren & madonna\u2019s'' (met sonnetten van Paul Sterk) {{ISBN|978-90-6216-963-4}}\n* 2016: ''Skinny dipping'' {{ISBN|978-90-819714-2-3}}\n* 2020: ''HJIM, Greatest hits'' {{ISBN|978-90-819714-3-0}}\n\n==Museums==\n* [[w:nl:Museum van Bommel van Dam|Museum van Bommel van Dam (dutch)]], Venlo NL\n* [[w:nl:Museum f\u00fcr Zeitgen\u00f6ssische Kunst|Museum for modern art IKOB (dutch)]], Eupen B\n* [[w:nl:Limburgs Museum|Limburgs Museum (dutch)]], Venlo NL\n* [https://www.erfgoedhuisweert.nl Gemeentemuseum Jacob van Horne (dutch)], Weert NL\n* [[w:nl:CODA (Apeldoorn)|CODA museum (dutch)]], Apeldoorn NL\n* [[w:nl:Joods Cultureel Kwartier|Joods Cultureel Kwartier (dutch)]], Amsterdam NL\n* [[w:de:Museum Aktfotoart Dresden|Museum Aktfotoart Dresden (german)]], Dresden DE\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.hjimvangasteren.eu/ Official website]\n*[http://grungecake.com/interview-lilith-love-the-naked-truth/ Interview with GrungeCake Magazine]\n*[http://issuu.com/aortamag/docs/aorta07?e=6595143/2723781/ Article in Aorta Mag]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130717031959/http://www.kaltblut-magazine.com/lilith-love/ Interview with Kaltblut]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gasteren, Henri\u00ebtte JIM van}}\n[[Category:1964 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:21st-century Dutch artists]]\n[[Category:Dutch women photographers]]\n[[Category:People from Horst aan de Maas]]\n[[Category:21st-century Dutch photographers]]\n", "name_user": "HansTunnissen", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith_Love"}
