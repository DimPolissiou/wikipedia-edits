He is depicted as a former [[Green Berets|Green Beret]] and a highly skilled [[special operations]] soldier engaged in solo stealth and [[espionage]] missions, who is often tasked with destroying models of the bipedal nuclear weapon-armed [[mecha]] known as [[Metal Gear (weapon)|Metal Gear]]. Controlled by the player, he must act alone, supported via radio by commanding officers and specialists. While his first appearances in the original ''Metal Gear'' games were references to Hollywood films, the ''Metal Gear Solid'' series has given a consistent design by artist [[Yoji Shinkawa]] alongside an established personality while also exploring his relationship with his mentor [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]].\n\nDuring the ''Metal Gear Solid'' games, the character has been voiced by voice actor [[Akio \u014ctsuka]] in the Japanese version and by actor and screenwriter [[David Hayter]] in the English version. Considered to be one of the most popular protagonists in the video game industry, Snake has been acclaimed by critics, with his personality and both \u014ctsuka's and Hayter's voice acting being noted as primary factors of the character's appeal.\n\n==Characteristics==\nIn the early games, Solid Snake's visual appearances were references to popular actors. He was given his own consistent design in ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]''. He also establishes Philanthropy, an anti-Metal Gear organization carrying the motto \"To let the world be\", with his friend [[Otacon]]. In ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', he has access to different disguises to make him look like other characters, as well as his younger self.\n\nSnake possesses an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 180, and is fluent in six languages. Solid Snake has been on the battlefield for most of his life,<ref>'''Roy Campbell''': ...You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets? '''Snake''': I was just a kid myself back then. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and says that it is the only place he feels truly alive.<ref>'''Snake''': It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield. The only time I feel truly alive. '''Meryl''': Seeing other people die makes you feel alive, huh? You love war, and don't want it to stop... Is it the same with all great soldiers throughout history? ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> He is a hardened veteran, he has his emotions buried very deep inside himself during his missions, every one of which has different motives.<ref>'''Colonel Campbell''': [Solid Snake], there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man.</ref> He is also immediately shown as a loner,<ref>'''Snake''': Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care of them. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref><ref>'''Meryl Silverburgh''': Is there anyone you like? '''Solid Snake''': I've never been interested in anyone else's life... '''Meryl Silverburgh''': So you are all alone.  Just like Mantis said. '''Solid Snake''': Other people just complicate my life.  I don't like to get involved. '''Meryl Silverburgh''': You're a sad, lonely man.''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> often with no intentions of taking orders from anyone anymore<ref>'''Solid Snake''': I'm retired from FOX-HOUND. You're not my commander anymore, and I don't have to take orders from you or anyone else. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and he shows no sign of longing for the army or the country he was part of.<ref>'''Solid Snake''': I told you, even if I do owe you I don't owe anything to this army or this country!. '''Colonel Campbell''': You will accept this assignment! '''Solid Snake''': Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> However, along with these traits he has a more human side, being flirtatious,<ref>'''Solid Snake''': ...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute. '''Mei Ling''': You're just flattering me... '''Solid Snake''': No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> self-sacrificing<ref>'''Naomi''': ...Why did you go so far out of your way to save her?  For Campbell's sake... or... maybe it's because you like her? '''Solid Snake''': I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me. '''Naomi Hunter''': Oh really? Since when did anybody's death bother you so much? '''Colonel Campbell''': Naomi!  It's true that [Solid Snake] has killed a lot of people, that doesn't mean he doesn't have a heart. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and with a strong belief that even on a battlefield friendship<ref>'''Naomi Hunter''': ...Friends? '''Solid Snake''': ...Frank Jaeger '''Naomi Hunter''': But... didn't you try to kill each other? '''Solid Snake''': That's true. We did.  In Zanzibar. But it was nothing personal. We were just professionals on opposite sides, that's all. '''Naomi Hunter''': And you still call yourselves friends? '''Solid Snake''': Hard to believe? War is no reason to end a friendship. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and love<ref>'''Otacon''': I wanna ask you... Do you think love can bloom even on a battlefield? '''Solid Snake''': Yeah...I do. I think at any time, any place... people can fall in love with each other. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> can flourish, and that violence is not glorious.<ref>'''Vulcan Raven''': Rejoice, Snake!

He is depicted as a former [[Green Berets|Green Beret]] and a highly skilled [[special operations]] soldier engaged in solo stealth and [[espionage]] missions, who is often tasked with destroying models of the bipedal nuclear weapon-armed [[mecha]] known as [[Metal Gear (weapon)|Metal Gear]]. Controlled by the player, he must act alone, supported via radio by commanding officers and specialists. While his first appearances in the original ''Metal Gear'' games were references to Hollywood films, the ''Metal Gear Solid'' series has given a consistent design by artist [[Yoji Shinkawa]] alongside an established personality while also exploring his relationship with his mentor [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]].\n\nDuring the ''Metal Gear Solid'' games, the character has been voiced by voice actor [[Akio \u014ctsuka]] in the Japanese version and by actor and screenwriter [[David Hayter]] in the English version. Considered to be one of the most popular protagonists in the video game industry, Snake has been acclaimed by critics, with his personality and both \u014ctsuka's and Hayter's voice acting being noted as primary factors of the character's appeal.\n\n==Characteristics==\nIn the early games, Solid Snake's visual appearances were references to popular actors. He was given his own consistent design in ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]''. He also establishes Philanthropy, an anti-Metal Gear organization carrying the motto \"To let the world be\", with his friend [[Otacon]]. In ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', he has access to different disguises to make him look like other characters, as well as his younger self.\n\nSnake possesses an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 180, and is fluent in six languages. Solid Snake has been on the battlefield for most of his life,<ref>'''Roy Campbell''': ...You were there too I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of Green Berets? '''Snake''': I was just a kid myself back then. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and says that it is the only place he feels truly alive.<ref>'''Snake''': It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield. The only time I feel truly alive. '''Meryl''': Seeing other people die makes you feel alive, huh? You love war, and don't want it to stop... Is it the same with all great soldiers throughout history? ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> He is a hardened veteran, he has his emotions buried very deep inside himself during his missions, every one of which has different motives.<ref>'''Colonel Campbell''': [Solid Snake], there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man.</ref> He is also immediately shown as a loner,<ref>'''Snake''': Right now my fifty huskies are my only family.

'''Meryl Silverburgh''': So you are all alone.  Just like Mantis said. '''Solid Snake''': Other people just complicate my life.  I don't like to get involved. '''Meryl Silverburgh''': You're a sad, lonely man.''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> often with no intentions of taking orders from anyone anymore<ref>'''Solid Snake''': I'm retired from FOX-HOUND. You're not my commander anymore, and I don't have to take orders from you or anyone else. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and he shows no sign of longing for the army or the country he was part of.<ref>'''Solid Snake''': I told you, even if I do owe you I don't owe anything to this army or this country!. '''Colonel Campbell''': You will accept this assignment! '''Solid Snake''': Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> However, along with these traits he has a more human side, being flirtatious,<ref>'''Solid Snake''': ...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so...cute. '''Mei Ling''': You're just flattering me... '''Solid Snake''': No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> self-sacrificing<ref>'''Naomi''': ...Why did you go so far out of your way to save her?  For Campbell's sake... or... maybe it's because you like her? '''Solid Snake''': I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me. '''Naomi Hunter''': Oh really? Since when did anybody's death bother you so much? '''Colonel Campbell''': Naomi!  It's true that [Solid Snake] has killed a lot of people, that doesn't mean he doesn't have a heart. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and with a strong belief that even on a battlefield friendship<ref>'''Naomi Hunter''': ...Friends? '''Solid Snake''': ...Frank Jaeger '''Naomi Hunter''': But... didn't you try to kill each other? '''Solid Snake''': That's true. We did.  In Zanzibar. But it was nothing personal. We were just professionals on opposite sides, that's all. '''Naomi Hunter''': And you still call yourselves friends? '''Solid Snake''': Hard to believe? War is no reason to end a friendship. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and love<ref>'''Otacon''': I wanna ask you... Do you think love can bloom even on a battlefield? '''Solid Snake''': Yeah...I do. I think at any time, any place... people can fall in love with each other. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> can flourish, and that violence is not glorious.<ref>'''Vulcan Raven''': Rejoice, Snake! Ours will be a glorious battle. '''Solid Snake''': This isn't glorious. It's just plain killing. Violence isn't a sport! (Metal Gear Solid)</ref> But Snake's perceived stance on violence may be a case of denial, as Snake's enemies and at least one of his allies have claimed that, in truth, he enjoys killing, and label him as more evil than the people he has killed.<ref>'''Solid Snake''': It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield.

When debuting in ''Metal Gear Solid'', Hayter was impressed by the game's cutscenes and the amount of dialogue. One of Snake's lines that liked Hayter was \"I just didn\u2019t expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so\u2026 cute.\" when Snake interacts with Mei Ling, believing it showed a more fun side of him. Solid Snake's English voice was inspired by Hayter's experience with Japan's storytelling, resulting in minor changes for the script. Hayter himself felt shocked when ''Sons of the Liberty'' was released as the narrative focused more on newcomer Raiden rather than him.

The courses of Communications and Transport Planning and Management, Industrial Economics, Power Electronics and Electrical Drive, International Law, Mechanical Design and Theory, Logistics Management and Engineering, Delivery Means Utilization Engineering and Port Machinery Electronics Engineering have been designated as key specialties by the Ministry of Communications and Shanghai Municipality. The specialties of Customs Logistics, International Trade and Economics and Maritime Law are classified as Shanghai's key bachelor's degree disciplines for further development. In 2004, SMU got an \u201cA\u201d in the Undergraduate Teaching Evaluation by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]].\n\nSMU has a full-time student population of near 15,000, of whom over 10,000 are studying for a bachelor's degree and over 2000 for a master's degree. for decades, SMU has been devoted to fostering qualified talents for [[shipping industry]].

The film depicts Knievel reflecting on major events in his life, particularly his relationship with his girlfriend/wife, Linda. The film opens with Knievel at the [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] in [[Ontario, California]]. Knievel is speaking directly to the camera describing his upcoming daredevil motorcycle jump:\n\n:''Ladies and gentlemen, you have no idea how good it makes me feel to be here today. It is truly an honor to risk my life for you. An honor. Before I jump this motorcycle over these 19 cars&nbsp;\u2014 and I want you to know there's not a Volkswagen or a Datsun in the row&nbsp;\u2014 before I sail cleanly over that last truck, I want to tell you that last night a kid came up to me and he said, \"Mr Knievel, are you crazy? That jump you're going to make is impossible, but I already have my tickets because I want to see you splatter.\" That's right, that's what he said. And I told that boy last night that nothing is impossible. Now they told Columbus to sail across the ocean was impossible. They told the settlers to live in a wild land was impossible. They told the [[Wright Brothers]] to fly was impossible. And they probably told [[Neil Armstrong]] a walk on the moon was impossible. They tell Evel Knievel to jump a motorcycle across the [[Grand Canyon]] is impossible, and they say that every day. A Roman General in the time of Caesar had the motto: \"If it is possible, it is done. If it is impossible, it will be done.\" And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I live by.''\n\nFollowing his introduction, the story follows a flashback narrative through Knievel's life.\n\nThe film ends with Knievel successfully completing the jump at the Ontario Motor Speedway and riding off onto a dirt road which leads to the edge of the Grand Canyon. (At the time of production, the real Evel Knievel was hyping a jump over the Grand Canyon.)\n\n==Monologue==\nAs the movie closes over the Grand Canyon, George Hamilton delivers a voice-over monologue in the Knievel character. In the monologue, he describes himself as the \"last gladiator\", which would later be used by the real Evel Knievel in his 1998 documentary, ''The Last of the Gladiators''.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the monologue from the movie:\n:''Important people in this country, celebrities like myself \u2014 [[Elvis]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[John Wayne]] \u2014 we have a responsibility. There are millions of people that look at our lives and it gives theirs some meaning. People come out from their jobs, most of which are meaningless to them, and they watch me jump 20 cars, maybe get splattered. It means something to them. They jump right alongside of me \u2014 they take the bars in their hands, and for one split second, they\u2019re all daredevils. I am the last gladiator in the new Rome. I go into the arena and I compete against destruction and I win. And next week, I go out there and I do it again. And this time \u2014 civilization being what it is and all \u2014 we have very little choice about our life. The only thing really left to us is a choice about our death.

While preparing to film it, he interviewed various stunt men for the lead role and heard about Knievel. He visited the stuntman in a San Francisco hospital and found him more fascinating than what he was writing. In 1970, Hamilton stated that:\n<blockquote>In America we've long had a theory that all men have an equal right to become everything they want. But there's a new theory being pushed on us - that every man has to be something whether he wants to or not. That's what the theory of Evil Knievel is about. He's an individual who doesn't care about establishment or hippie, both have their phony sides. I'm not sure why Evil does what he does on a motorcycle.

{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relationships between several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based [[computational complexity|complexity]]. The two most common resources considered are [[time complexity|time]] and [[space complexity|memory]]. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

In particular,\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''', '''[[MA (complexity)|MA]]''', and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\nThese are explained in greater detail below.\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a probabilistic quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. \n\nA slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. \n\nLoosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient [[randomized algorithm]]s that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. \n\nThe broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language, and a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument further demonstrates that no error is allowed for strings not in the language. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP''' (the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine) is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by an unmentioned prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\n[[File:Three_input_Boolean_circuit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example Boolean circuit computing the Boolean function <math>f_C(x_1,x_2,x_3)</math>, where <math>x_1=0</math>, <math>x_2=1</math>, and <math>x_3=0</math>. The <math>\\wedge</math> nodes are [[AND gate]]s, the <math>\\vee</math> nodes are [[OR gate]]s, and the <math>\\neg</math> nodes are [[NOT gate]]s.]]\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>x_1,x_2,...,x_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in <math>\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is, however, less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

The two most common resources considered are [[time complexity|time]] and [[space complexity|memory]]. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

In particular,\n* The classes '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''', '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''', and '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' are defined using the [[probabilistic Turing machine]]\n* The classes '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''', '''[[MA (complexity)|MA]]''', and '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' are defined using the [[interactive proof system]]\n* The class '''[[P/poly]]''' and its subclasses '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]''' are defined using the [[boolean circuit]]\n* The classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''' are defined using the [[quantum Turing machine]]\n\nThese are explained in greater detail below.\n\n====Randomized computation====\n{{Main|Probabilistic Turing machine}}\n\nA number of important complexity classes are defined using the ''[[probabilistic Turing machine]]'', a variant of the [[Turing machine]] that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\n[[File:Randomized Complexity Classes.svg|thumb|The relationships between the fundamental probabilistic complexity classes. BQP is a probabilistic quantum complexity class and is described in the quantum computing section.]]\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. \n\nA slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in '''RP''' if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine <math>M</math> such that if a string is not in the language then <math>M</math> always rejects and if a string is in the language then <math>M</math> accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class '''co-RP''' is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with [[one-sided error]]. \n\nLoosening the error requirements further to allow for [[two-sided error]] yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). '''BPP''' is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes\u2014most problems of interest in '''BPP''' have efficient [[randomized algorithm]]s that can be run quickly on real computers. '''BPP''' is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. \n\nThe broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n'''ZPP''', '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' are all subsets of '''BPP'''. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows two-sided error. '''BPP''' is a subset of '''PP'''. '''ZPP''' relates to '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' in the following way: '''ZPP'''<math>=</math>'''RP'''<math>\\cap</math>'''co-RP''', that is, '''ZPP''' consists exactly of those problems that are in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP'''. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that '''RP''' and '''co-RP''' allow only one-sided error. A problem in '''RP''' allows error only for strings in the language, and a problem in '''co-RP''' allows error only for strings not in the language, i.e. it disallows error for strings in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both '''RP''' and '''co-RP''', then there must be no error for strings in the language. A similar argument further demonstrates that no error is allowed for strings not in the language. Together, this means that no error is allowed whatsoever, which is exactly the definition of '''ZPP'''.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP''' (the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine) is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by an unmentioned prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuits====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\n[[File:Three_input_Boolean_circuit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example Boolean circuit computing the Boolean function <math>f_C(x_1,x_2,x_3)</math>, where <math>x_1=0</math>, <math>x_2=1</math>, and <math>x_3=0</math>. The <math>\\wedge</math> nodes are [[AND gate]]s, the <math>\\vee</math> nodes are [[OR gate]]s, and the <math>\\neg</math> nodes are [[NOT gate]]s]]\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>x_1,x_2,...,x_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in <math>\\mathsf{TIME}(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is, however, less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.
