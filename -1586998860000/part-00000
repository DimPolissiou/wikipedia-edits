Elections will be held to elect representatives from all 435 [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional districts]] across each of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s. The six [[Delegate (United States Congress)|non-voting delegates]] from the [[District of Columbia]] and the inhabited [[Insular area|U.S. territories]] will also be elected.

The winners of this election will serve in the [[117th United States Congress]], with seats apportioned among the states based on the [[2010 United States Census]]. Democrats have held a majority in the House of Representatives since January 3, 2019 as a result the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 elections]], when they won 235 seats.

Representatives elections''' will be held November 3, 2020, with special elections throughout the year. Elections will be held to elect representatives from all 435 [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional districts]] across each of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s. The six [[Delegate (United States Congress)|non-voting delegates]] from the [[District of Columbia]] and the inhabited [[Insular area|U.S. territories]] will also be elected. Numerous other [[2020 United States elections|federal, state, and local elections]], including the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]] and the [[2020 United States Senate elections|2020 Senate elections]], will also be held on this date. The winners of this election will serve in the [[117th United States Congress]], with seats apportioned among the states based on the [[2010 United States Census]]. Democrats have held a majority in the House of Representatives since January 3, 2019 as a result the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 elections]], when they won 235 seats. To win a majority, Republicans would need a net gain of 22 seats.\n\n==Retiring incumbents== \n\nAs of April 2020, 36 representatives are not seeking re-election either to retire or to seek other positions.\n\n=== Democrats ===\n#{{ushr|CA|53|X}}: [[Susan Davis (politician)|Susan Davis]]: Retiring\n#{{ushr|HI|2|X}}: [[Tulsi Gabbard]]: Retiring\n#{{ushr|IN|1|X}}: [[Pete Visclosky]]: Retiring\n#{{ushr|IA|2|X}}: [[Dave Loebsack]]: Retiring\n#{{ushr|MA|4|X}}: [[Joe Kennedy III]]: Retiring to [[2020 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|run for U.S. senator]].\n#{{ushr|NM|3|X}}: [[Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n]]: Retiring to [[2020 United States Senate election in New Mexico|run for U.S. senator]].\n#{{ushr|NY|15|X}}: [[Jos\u00e9 E.

As a [[comics anthology]] it serialises stories in each issue (known as \"progs\")<ref group=note>Prog: short for \"programme\" as issues are supposedly beamed directly to the printed page.</ref> and was first published by [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]] in 1977, the first issue dated 26 February. IPC then shifted the title to its [[Fleetway]] comics subsidiary, which was sold to [[Robert Maxwell]] in 1987 and then to [[Egmont UK]] in 1991. Fleetway continued to produce the title until 2000, when it was bought by [[Rebellion Developments]].\n\n''2000 AD'' is most noted for its ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories, and has been contributed to by a number of artists and writers who became renowned in the field internationally, such as [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Brian Bolland]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. Other characters in ''2000 AD'' include ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and the ''[[ABC Warriors]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1970s===\n\n====Pre-publication====\nIn December 1975, [[Kelvin Gosnell]], a sub-editor at [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]], read an article in the [[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]] about a wave of forthcoming science fiction films, and suggested that the company might get on the bandwagon by launching a science fiction comic. IPC asked [[Pat Mills]], a [[freelance]] writer and [[editing|editor]] who had created ''[[Battle Picture Weekly]]'' and ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', to develop it. Mills brought fellow freelancer [[John Wagner]] on board as script adviser and the pair began to develop characters. The then-futuristic name ''2000 AD'' was chosen by the publisher, John Sanders,<ref name=\":0\">Mills, Pat (2017) ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History'' (Millsverse Books).</ref>{{Rp|pp.25\u201326}} as no-one involved expected the comic to last that long. The original logo and overall look of the comic were designed by art assistant Doug Church.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|p.37}}\n\nMills' experiences with ''Battle'' and Action in particular had taught him that readers responded to his [[anti-authoritarian]] attitudes. Wagner, who had written a [[Dirty Harry]]-inspired tough cop called ''[[One-Eyed Jack (comics)|One-Eyed Jack]]'' for ''[[Valiant (comic)|Valiant]]'', saw that readers also responded to authority figures, and developed a character that took the concept to its logical extreme, imagining an ultra-violent lawman patrolling a future [[New York City|New York]] with the power to arrest, sentence, and if required execute criminals on the spot. Meanwhile, Mills had developed a [[horror fiction|horror]] strip, inspired by the novels of [[Dennis Wheatley]], about a [[hanging judge]], called ''Judge Dread'' (after the [[reggae]] and [[ska]] artist of the [[Judge Dread|same name]]). The idea was abandoned as unsuitable for the new comic, but the name, with a little modification, was adopted by Wagner for his ultimate lawman.\n\nThe task of visualising the newly named ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' was given to [[Carlos Ezquerra]], a Spanish artist who had previously worked with Mills on ''Battle'', on a strip called ''Major Eazy''. Wagner gave Ezquerra an advertisement for the film ''[[Death Race 2000]]'', showing the character Frankenstein clad in black leather, as a suggestion for what the character should look like. Ezquerra elaborated on this greatly, adding body-armour, zips and chains, which Wagner originally thought over the top. Wagner's initial script was rewritten by Mills and drawn up by Ezquerra, but when the art came back a rethink was necessary. The hardware and cityscapes Ezquerra had drawn were far more futuristic than the near-future setting originally intended, and Mills decided to run with it and set the strip further into the future. By this stage, however, Wagner and Ezquerra had both quit.\n\nMills was reluctant to lose ''Judge Dredd'', and farmed the strip out to a variety of freelance writers, hoping to develop it further. Their scripts were given to a variety of artists as Mills tried to find a strip which would make a good introduction to the character, all of which meant that ''Dredd'' would not be ready for the first issue. The story chosen was one written by freelancer Peter Harris,{{efn|Harris also wrote two ''Future Shocks'' and one episode of ''M.A.C.H. One''.<ref>[http://2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=thrills&Comic=2000AD&Field=Writer&choice=peterha 2000ad.org]</ref>}} extensively rewritten by Mills and including an idea suggested by Kelvin Gosnell,<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|pp.70\u201372}} and drawn by newcomer [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. The strip debuted in prog 2.\n\nIPC owned the rights to ''[[Dan Dare]]'', and Mills decided to revive the character to add immediate public recognition for the title. Paul DeSavery, who owned ''Dare'''s film rights, offered to buy the new comic and give Mills and Wagner more creative control and a greater financial stake. The deal fell through, however.\n\n====The opening line-up====\n\n''[[Dan Dare]]'' was extensively revamped to make it more futuristic. In the new stories he had been put into suspended animation and revived several centuries in the future. Several artists were tried out before Mills settled on Italian artist [[Massimo Belardinelli]], whose imaginative, hallucinatory work was fantastic at visualising aliens, although perhaps less satisfying on the hero himself. The scripts were endlessly rewritten in an attempt to make the series work, but few ''Dan Dare'' fans remember this version of the character fondly. Belardinelli and Gibbons later switched strips, with Gibbons drawing ''Dan Dare'' and Belardinelli drawing the ''Harlem Heroes'' sequel ''Inferno''. When Gibbons took over ''Dan Dare'' in prog 28 the strip was refashioned as a \"''Star Trek''\" style space opera.\n\nMills had also created ''[[Harlem Heroes]]'', about the future sport of aeroball, a futuristic, violent version of basketball with jet-packs. Similar future sport series had been a fixture of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', and the similarly-themed film [[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]] had been released the previous year. Wanting to give the new comic a distinctive look, Mills wanted to use European artists, but the work turned in on ''Harlem Heroes'' by [[Trigo (comics)|Trigo]] was disappointing. Veteran British artists [[Ron Turner (artist)|Ron Turner]] and [[Barrie Mitchell]] were tried out, but the newcomer [[Dave Gibbons]] won the editor over with his dynamic, American-influenced drawings and got the job. Mills wrote the first five episodes before handing the strip to ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'' writer [[Tom Tully (comic writer)|Tom Tully]].\n\nThe other opening strips were ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', a super-powered secret agent inspired by ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''; ''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]'', about a \"Volgan\" (thinly disguised and originally billed as Soviet, but changed before printing to a \"neutral\" antagonist) invasion of the United Kingdom opposed by tough London lorry driver turned [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter Bill Savage; and ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]'', a strip about [[Time travel|time-travelling]] cowboys farming [[dinosaur]]s for their meat.\n\nAfter 16 issues, Mills quit as editor and handed the reins to [[Kelvin Gosnell]], whose idea the comic had been in the first place. Gosnell also appeared as the fall guy in the ''[[Tharg the Mighty]]'' comedy [[Fumetti|photostrips]] that were a feature of the comic in its early years.\n\n====Early years====\nWagner returned to write ''Judge Dredd'', starting in prog 9. His \"[[The Robot Wars|Robot Wars]]\" storyline was drawn by a rotating team of artists, including McMahon, Ezquerra, Turner and [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]], and marked the point where ''Dredd'' became the most popular character in the comic, a position he has rarely relinquished.<ref>Jarman, Colin M. and Peter Acton (1995) ''Judge Dredd: The Mega-History'', Lennard Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85291-128-X}}, p. 58</ref> Dredd's city, which now covered most of the east coast of North America, became known as [[Mega-City One]]. Dredd had also been unmasked in issue 8 in a story drawn by Massimo Belardinelli, but the decision was made to make out that Dredd's face had been scarred and the panel had a 'censored' banner slapped on it. After this, there were no further attempts to show Dredd's face again.\n\nA new story format was introduced in prog 25 \u2013 ''[[Tharg's Future Shocks]]'', one-off twist-in-the-tail stories devised by writer [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]]. ''2000 AD'' still uses this format as filler and to try out new talent.\n\nWagner introduced a new character, ''[[Robo-Hunter]]'', in 1978. The hero, Sam Slade, was a [[private detective]]-type character specialising in [[robot]]-related cases. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer was the original artist, but the editorial team were not happy with his work and quickly replaced him with Ian Gibson, who redrew parts of Ferrer's episodes before taking over himself. Gibson's imaginative, cartoony art helped drive the series' style from hard-boiled detective to surreal comedy. As the series continued Sam was joined by an idiot kit-built robot assistant, Hoagy, and after a crack-down on smoking in IPC comics, a [[Cuba]]n robot [[cigar]], Stogie, designed to help him cut down on [[nicotine]].\n\nOther ongoing strips included ''The Visible Man'', detailing the misfortunes of Frank Hart, a man whose skin had been made transparent due to exposure to nuclear waste, and ''Shako'', (which followed the same formula as ''Hook Jaw'' from ''Action'' but with less success) the story of a [[polar bear]] pursued by the Army because it had swallowed a secret capsule.\n\n''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'' was killed off in 1978 but a spin-off, ''M.A.C.H. Zero'', continued into the 1980s. ''Flesh'' had a sequel in 1978, set on the prehistoric oceans, and Bill Savage appeared again in a prequel, ''Disaster 1990'', in which a nuclear explosion at the north pole had melted the polar ice-cap and flooded Britain.\n\nIn 1977 ''2000 AD'' launched the annual 48-page Summer Special, including a full length ''M.A.C.H. Zero'' story drawn by O'Neill. The yearly hardcover annual also started in 1977 and would continue till 1991.\n\nPat Mills took over writing ''Dredd'' for a six-month \"epic\" called \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]\", inspired by [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Damnation Alley]]'', which took the future lawman out of the city on a humanitarian trek across the radioactive wasteland between the Mega-Cities. McMahon drew the bulk of the stories, with occasional episodes drawn by [[Brian Bolland]]. The story saw Dredd moved to the colour centre pages for the first time while ''Dan Dare'' was given the front page.\n\nIPC had launched a second science fiction comic, ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'', which was cancelled after only 22 issues and merged into ''2000 AD'' from prog 86.<ref>[https://michaelowencarroll.wordpress.com/2018/05/26/eaglution-of-british-comics-part-1/ ''The Eaglution of British Comics''] by Michael Carroll, 26 May 2018. (Retrieved 27 May 2018.)</ref> As Gosnell was editor of ''Starlord'' and ''2000 AD'' at the same time, ''2000 AD'' sub-editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the latter comic himself during this time.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\">\"A brief history of Starlord\" from \"Watch the stars!\" website {{cite web|url=http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |title=A Brief History of Starlord |accessdate=10 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128232417/http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 }}</ref> Two ''Starlord'' strips strengthened ''2000 AD'''s line-up: ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[bounty hunter]] created by Wagner and Ezquerra, and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'', a robot disaster squad created by Mills. ''Ro-Busters'' gave O'Neill the chance to spread his artistic wings and led to the popular spin-off ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. ''Strontium Dog'' and ''ABC Warriors'' continued to feature in ''2000 AD'' for the next 40 years. (A third ''Starlord'' series, ''Timequake'', only lasted for four episodes and was not renewed.) ''Dan Dare'' was suspended while \"The Cursed Earth\" was finished in time for the merger. Wagner returned to ''Dredd'' following the merger to write \"The Day the Law Died\", another six-month epic in which Mega-City One was taken over by the insane [[Judge Cal|Chief Judge Cal]], based on the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caligula]].\n\nAnother cancelled title, ''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'', was merged with ''2000 AD'' a few months later from prog 127, contributing three stories to ''2000 AD'': ''[[Blackhawk (Tornado)|Blackhawk]]'', an historical adventure series about a Nubian slave in the Roman Empire which took a science-fictional turn in ''2000 AD'' with him becoming a gladiator in an alien world; ''[[The Mind of Wolfie Smith]]'', a coming of age/psychic story of a runaway teenager, and ''Captain Klep'', a single-page superhero parody. These stories, unlike ''Starlord's'', did not continue for very long.\n\n''2000 AD'' featured an adaptation of [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s novel ''[[The Stainless Steel Rat]]'', written by Gosnell and drawn by Ezquerra. Adaptations of two of Harrison's sequels, ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'' and ''The Stainless Steel Rat for President'', would follow later.   The appearance of the main character, galactic thief \"Slippery\" Jim DiGriz, was based on [[James Coburn]], evidently a favourite of Ezquerra's; Coburn was also the inspiration for ''[[Major Eazy]]'', which Ezquerra drew in ''Battle,'' as well as ''Cursed Earth Koburn'', a Dredd-universe reworking of the Major Eazy character, who first appeared in 2003. [[Gerry Finley-Day]] contributed ''[[The V.C.s]]'', a future war story inspired by the [[Vietnam War]], drawn by McMahon, [[Cam Kennedy]], [[Garry Leach]] and [[John Richardson (comics)|John Richardson]].\n\nA feature of the early years of ''2000 AD'' was the opportunities it gave to young British comic artists: by the time the title celebrated its 100th issue Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons, Ian Gibson, Mike McMahon and Kevin O'Neil were all established as regulars.\n\n[[Steve MacManus]] took over from Gosnell as editor in 1978.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980 ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' gained a new enemy. Writer [[John Wagner]] realised that Dredd's habit of shooting just about everybody he came up against meant that it was difficult to create a recurring villain. The solution was [[Judge Death]], an undead judge from another dimension where, since all crime was committed by the living, life itself was outlawed. The law had been thoroughly enforced on his own world, and now he had come to Mega-City One to continue his work. Judge Death first appeared in an atmospheric three-parter drawn by [[Brian Bolland]] which also introduced [[Judge Anderson]] and [[Psi Division]], a squad of judges with psychic powers.\n\nDredd soon began another epic journey in \"[[Judge Child|The Judge Child]]\". A dying Psi Division Judge had predicted disaster for Mega-City One unless it was ruled by a boy with a birthmark shaped like an eagle, so Dredd set off into the Cursed Earth, to [[Texas City]], and into deep space in search of the boy, Owen Krysler, and his kidnappers, the Angel Gang. The Angels were some of the most memorable villains Wagner had yet devised, but suffered the same mortality problem that had plagued the strip so far. All of them were killed during the course of the story, however the [[Mean Machine Angel|Mean Machine]], was later resurrected by Krysler during \"Destiny's Angels\". \"The Judge Child\" was drawn by Bolland, [[Ron Smith (artist)|Ron Smith]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] in rotation, and the later episodes marked the beginning of Wagner's long-running writing partnership with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]. The pair would go on to write ''Strontium Dog'', ''Robo-Hunter'' and many other stories for ''2000 AD'', as well as for ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' and the relaunched ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' in the United Kingdom, and a number of comics in America.\n\nWith prog 178 all current stories, with the exception of ''Judge Dredd'', were wound up, and a new set of stories was launched simultaneously, consisting of ''[[Mean Arena]]'', set around a violent high-tech street football game, ''[[Meltdown Man]]'', whose hero was transported to a genetically engineered far future by a nuclear explosion, the return of ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', featuring a mutant bounty hunter character inherited from the short-lived ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' title, and ''[[Dash Decent]]'', a  ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[parody]].\n\n[[Pat Mills]] introduced ''Comic Rock'', which was meant to be a format for short stories inspired by popular music. The first story, inspired by [[The Jam]]'s ''Going Underground'', was drawn by Kevin O'Neill and featured a complicated underground travel network on a planet called \"Termight\", in which a freedom fighter called [[Nemesis the Warlock|Nemesis]] battles the despotic [[Torquemada (comics)|Torquemada]], chief of the Tube Police. All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his vehicle, the Blitzspear. The story was a reaction to an earlier tube chase sequence Mills and O'Neill had done in ''Ro-Busters'', which management objected to.\n\nThe only other ''Comic Rock'' story was a follow-up called \"Killer Watt\", in which Nemesis and Torquemada fought on a [[Teleportation|teleport]] system. This led to a series, ''Nemesis the Warlock'', in which it was revealed that Termight was Earth in the far future, Torquemada was a despotic demagogue leading a campaign of genocide against all aliens, and Nemesis was the leader of the alien resistance. Mills and O'Neill were on a roll and produced a stream of bizarre and imaginative ideas, but ultimately O'Neill was unable to continue the level of work he was putting into it on ''2000 AD'' pay. He left to work for [[DC Comics]] in America, and was replaced on ''Nemesis'' by first [[Jesus Redondo]] and then [[Bryan Talbot]].\n\n''2000 AD'' would occasionally take a gamble on non-science fiction material. For example, ''[[Fiends of the Eastern Front]]'' was a World War II [[vampire]] story by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]] which was probably originally intended for ''Battle''. Its hero was a German soldier who discovered that some of his [[Romania]]n allies were vampires. Later in the war, when Romania changed sides, he was the only one who knew their secret.\n\nA readers' poll revealed that future war was a popular topic, so Gerry Finley-Day was asked to come up with a new war story. He, editor [[Steve MacManus]] and artists Dave Gibbons devised ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', a \"[[G.I. (comics)|Genetic Infantryman]]\" engineered to be immune to chemical warfare hunting down the traitor general who had betrayed his regiment, who debuted in 1981. He was supported by bio-chips of the personalities of three dead comrades, which, slotted into his equipment, could talk to him. Gibbons left the strip early on and was replaced by [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]], [[Brett Ewins]] and  [[Cam Kennedy]]. ''Rogue Trooper'' replaced ''Meltdown Man'', which had recently ended its run.\n\nAnother new strip in 1981, inspired by the brief [[Citizens' band radio|CB radio]] craze, was ''[[Ace Trucking Co.]]'', a comedy about pointy-headed alien space trucker Ace Garp and his crew by Wagner, Grant and Belardinelli.\n\nIn the ''Judge Dredd'' series, Mega-City One had grown too large and unwieldy: therefore authors Wagner and Grant they planned to cut it down to size.  \"[[Block Mania]]\", in which wars broke out between rival city-blocks, turned out to be a plot orchestrated by the Russian city East-Meg One, and led directly to \"[[Apocalypse War|The Apocalypse War]]\", another six-month epic and a hard-hitting satire on the concept of [[Mutually assured destruction]]. East-Meg One, protected by a warp-shield, softened up Mega-City One with nuclear warheads before invading. Dredd spearheaded the resistance, leading a small team to East-Meg territory, hijacking their nuclear bunkers and blowing East-Meg One off the face of the earth. \"The Apocalypse War\" was drawn in its entirety by Carlos Ezquerra, making a return to the character he created.\n\nA new writer, [[Alan Moore]], had started contributing ''[[Future Shocks]]'' in 1980. He wrote more than fifty one-off strips over the next three years, while also contributing to various [[Marvel UK]] titles and the independent magazine ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]''. In 1982 he gained his first series, ''[[Skizz]]'', a less sentimental take on the same basic plot used in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', set in [[Birmingham]] and influenced by [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. The series was drawn by [[Jim Baikie]].\n\nMoore wrote another series, ''[[D.R. and Quinch]]'', spun off from a one-off ''Time Twister''. Drawn by [[Alan Davis]], the strip featured a pair of alien juvenile delinquents with a penchant for mindless thermonuclear destruction. He went on to create ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]'' with artist [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]. Halo was an everywoman in the far future, born into mass unemployment on a floating housing estate, who escaped the earth and became involved in a terrible galactic war. Three books were published, and more were planned, but Moore's demands for creator's rights and his increasing commitments to American publishers meant they never materialised.\n\nA new character, ''[[Sl\u00e1ine (comics)|Sl\u00e1ine]]'', debuted in 1983, but had been in development since 1981. Created by [[Pat Mills]] and his then wife [[Angela Kincaid]], ''Sl\u00e1ine'' was a barbarian [[fantasy]] strip based on [[Celtic mythology]]. Kincaid was a children's book illustrator who had never worked in comics before, and her opening episode was drawn and redrawn several times before the editors were satisfied. Other stories were written for artists Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon, but these could not see print until Kincaid's episode was ready.\n\nIn 1985, after appearing as a supporting character in ''Judge Dredd'', ''[[Judge Anderson]]'' finally appeared in her own series, written by Wagner and Grant and initially drawn by Brett Ewins. New artist [[Glenn Fabry]] debuted on ''Sl\u00e1ine'', but due to his notorious slowness was rotated with [[David Pugh (comics)|David Pugh]]. In the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#\"Letter From a Democrat\": The martyrdom of Hester Hyman|Letter from a Democrat]]\", Wagner and Grant introduced a pro-democracy movement in Mega-City One, which is after all a [[police state]]. This would provide plotlines for years to come.\n\nIn 1986 the comic reached its 500th issue. A new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, ''Sl\u00e1ine the King'', began, entirely drawn by Fabry. [[Peter Milligan]], a writer who had been contributing ''Future Shocks'', began two series, the bleak future war story ''[[Bad Company (comics)|Bad Company]]'' and a strange, [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] series called ''The Dead''. In 1986, ''2000 AD'' was selling  150,000 copies a week.\n\nIn 1987 IPC's comics division was hived off and sold to publishing magnate [[Robert Maxwell]] as Fleetway. ''2000 AD'' was revamped, with a larger page size and full process colour on the covers and centre pages. [[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]] became editor. Kevin O'Neill returned for a short ''Nemesis'' series called \"Torquemada the God\". Not long after came the debut of ''[[Zenith (comic)|Zenith]]'', ''2000 AD'''s first serious superhero strip, by new writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Steve Yeowell]]. The title character was a shallow pop singer with superhuman powers, caught up in the intrigues of a 1960s generation of superhumans and the machinations of some [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] elder gods.\n\nWagner and Grant began a new ''Dredd'' Epic, \"[[Oz (Judge Dredd story)|Oz]]\", featuring [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]], a popular supporting character. Chopper was a skysurfer who had been imprisoned for competing in an illegal surfing competition a few years previously. A legal \"Supersurf\" race was being held in Oz, the future Australia, and Chopper escaped to compete. Dredd also went to Oz, partly to deal with Chopper, but mostly to investigate the [[Judda]], a clone army created by Mega-City One's former chief genetic engineer. The Judda were defeated, and Chopper narrowly lost the race to Jug McKenzie. Dredd was waiting at the finish line, but McKenzie distracted him and allowed Chopper to escape into the outback. This ending was apparently the cause of some dispute between Wagner and Grant, and was a contributing factor (it was ''[[The Last American]]'', a mini series for [[Epic Comics]] which would mark the end)  in ending their regular writing partnership. Wagner kept ''Dredd'', while Grant continued ''Strontium Dog'' and ''Judge Anderson''. However the pair would still come together for occasional collaborations.\n\nThe \"Oz\" storyline had some lasting implications. [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], a Judda cloned from the same genetic material as Dredd, was captured by Justice Department, who had plans for him. Chopper also spun off into his own series, written by Wagner and drawn by [[Colin MacNeil]].\n\nThe ''ABC Warriors'' finally had their own series again in 1987 as a spin-off from ''Nemesis''. This was written, as ever, by Pat Mills, and drawn by two artists in rotation, newcomer [[Simon Bisley]] and science fiction artist [[SMS (comics)|S.M.S.]].\n\nIn 1988 Grant and artist Simon Harrison began a new ''Strontium Dog'' story, \"The Final Solution\". It took nearly two years to complete, and ended with the death of Johnny Alpha, who sacrificed his life to save mutants from extermination. Original artist Carlos Ezquerra did not agree with the decision to kill the character off, and refused to draw it.\n\nThe number of colour pages was increased, allowing for one complete strip per issue to be painted. Initially the colour pages were reserved for ''Judge Dredd'', but were later given over to a new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, \"The Horned God\", fully painted by [[Simon Bisley]]. The series was collected as a series of three graphic novels, then as a single volume, and has remained in print ever since.\n\nIn 1989 the colour pages were increased again, allowing for three colour stories and two black and white in every issue. One of the colour series was ''Rogue Trooper: the War Machine'', written by Dave Gibbons and painted by [[Will Simpson (comics)|Will Simpson]]. The original ''Rogue Trooper'' series had run out of steam after the Traitor General had been dealt with, though continued with Rogue's adventures on Horst and the 'Hit' series, so Gibbons revamped the concept, creating a different genetic infantryman, [[Friday (2000 AD)|Friday]], in a different war, albeit in the same universe.\n\nOne of the black and white stories, \"[[The Dead Man]]\", was a low-key beginning for a major event. In the Cursed Earth, villagers come across a man, burnt from head to toe, with no memory of who he is or what happened to him. As he tries to piece his memories back together, he is being hunted by the evil beings who left him in that state. A creepy, atmospheric horror-western, it was drawn by [[John Ridgway (comic artist)|John Ridgway]] and written by \"Keef Ripley\", a pseudonym for John Wagner. By the end of the series the Dead Man had discovered his identity: he was Judge Dredd.\n\n===1990s===\nAs \"The Dead Man\" ended, a new ''Judge Dredd'' story, \"[[The Dead Man#Tale of the Dead Man|Tale of the Dead Man]]\", explained how Dredd had ended up in that position. Dredd was getting older and the democratic movement was causing him to doubt his role, so Justice Department had groomed [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], the former Judda cloned from his bloodline, to replace him. Kraken was now ready for his final assessment, and Dredd himself was chosen to assess him. Although Kraken performed faultlessly, Dredd thought he perceived a hint of his former allegiance to the Judda in him, and failed him. He then resigned as a judge and took the '[[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]]' into the Cursed Earth. There he met the Sisters of Death, and only barely survived the encounter. This could mean only one thing: Judge Death was back.\n\nThis set up the latest six-month epic, \"[[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]\". After Dredd had left, Justice Department had put Kraken through one final test, and given him Dredd's badge. But the Sisters of Death, spirit beings from Judge Death's dimension, were able to use Kraken's inner conflict to take control of him and use him to bring Judge Death and the other Dark Judges back from the limbo dimension Dredd had exiled them to. The Sisters possessed all the city's judges and began to enforce Death's twisted law. Out in the Cursed Earth, Dredd had recovered his memory and returned to defeat the Dark Judges. He then tried to lance the democratic boil by holding a referendum on whether the Judges should continue to govern the city. The judges won, by a small margin on a desultory turnout, and Dredd was satisfied.\n\n''2000 AD'' gained an influx of talent from other comics. [[Garth Ennis]] and [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]] had come to prominence writing for ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', a ''2000 AD'' spin-off for older readers, while artists [[Jamie Hewlett]] and [[Philip Bond]] were the stars of ''[[Deadline magazine|Deadline]]'', an independent comics and popular culture magazine founded by [[Steve Dillon]] and [[Brett Ewins]]. Smith created ''[[Indigo Prime]]'', a multi-dimensional organisation that polices reality, whose most memorable story was \"Killing Time\", a [[time travel]] story featuring [[Jack the Ripper]]. [[Garth Ennis]] and Philip Bond contributed ''Time Flies'', a time-travel comedy, and Hewlett was paired with writer [[Peter Milligan]] for the surreal ''[[Hewligan's Haircut]]''. Writer [[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] and artist [[Simon Jacob]] created ''[[Armoured Gideon]]'', an action-comedy series about a giant killer robot charged with keeping demons from invading earth.\n\nThe ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', a monthly title set in the world of Dredd, was launched in October 1990. With John Wagner focusing his attentions there, Garth Ennis became the regular writer of Dredd in the weekly.\n\nAmerican writer [[Michael Fleisher]], who had written ''[[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]]'' and ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' in the 1970s, was recruited to write the continuing adventures of the new ''Rogue Trooper'', along with several other strips, none of which went down very well. Another new writer who failed to set ''2000 AD'' on fire was [[Mark Millar]], whose revival of ''Robo-Hunter'' was particularly unpopular. Millar has since gone on to become a successful writer of American [[superhero]] comics such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]''.\n\n''2000 AD'' went all-colour about this time (prog 723, dated 23 March 1991), in response to a short-lived new colour weekly, ''[[Toxic!]]'', launched by Pat Mills and many of the core ''2000 AD'' team of creators. ''Toxic!'' only lasted 31 issues but many of the creators who had worked on the comic eventually found their way to work for ''2000 AD''. ''[[Button Man]]'', a contemporary thriller by John Wagner and [[Arthur Ranson]], was originally intended for ''Toxic!'' but ended up in ''2000 AD''.\n\nA new ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' series, written by Mills and Tony Skinner and painted by [[Kev Walker]], began in 1991, in which Deadlock took over the warriors with his \"Khaos\" philosophy.\n\nRobert Maxwell died in late 1991, and Fleetway was merged with London Editions, a Danish-owned company which owned rights to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters, to become Fleetway Editions.\n\nIn 1992, ''2000 AD'' and the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' ran their first crossover story, \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", in which [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]]s overran Mega-City One. Written by Garth Ennis and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, [[Peter Doherty (comics)|Peter Doherty]], [[Dean Ormston]] and [[Chris Cunningham|Chris Halls]], the story teamed Judge Dredd with Johnny Alpha through the medium of time travel. John Smith and artist [[Paul Marshall (comics)|Paul Marshall]] created ''[[Firekind]]'', a slow-paced story about dragons and alien societies, which was accidentally published with its episodes in the wrong order.\n\nThe ''Strontium Dog'' world was eventually spun out to encompass a wider field, gaining the plural name ''Strontium Dogs'' \u2013 characters such as female vampire [[Durham Red]], the albino Feral Jackson, and former Johnny Alpha sidekick The Gronk \u2013 the latter, normally a timid creature with weak 'heartses', became a gung-ho action character upon learning of Alpha's death. However, in the 12-parter ''The Darkest Star'', it transpires that the one to ''actually'' kill him was the Gronk himself; changed into a form designed by a cadre of Lyran necromancers to bring him endless agony, Alpha asked his friend to end his torment.\n\n{{anchor|Summer Offensive}}<!-- [[Summer Offensive (comics)]] links here -->\nThe \"Summer Offensive\" was an eight-week experiment in 1993, when new editor [[Alan McKenzie]] gave free rein to writers [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and John Smith, to a mixed reception. Morrison wrote a Dredd story, \"Inferno\", and a drug-influenced comedy adventure, ''[[Really & Truly]]''. Smith contributed ''[[Slaughterbowl]]'', in which convicted criminals on dinosaurs are pitted against each other in a deadly sport, with the survivor being paroled for a year and granted wealth \u2013 but being forced to enter the Slaughterbowl again the next year. Millar wrote ''[[Maniac 5]]'', an action-packed series about a remote controlled war-robot. During this run was a satire of British [[tabloid newspaper|tabloid]] attitudes titled ''[[Big Dave (comics)|Big Dave]]'', written by Morrison and Millar and drawn by [[Steve Parkhouse]].\n\n[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] became editor in 1994, and a second crossover between ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine'', \"[[Mechanismo|Wilderlands]]\", began. Written by Wagner and drawn by Ezquerra, [[Mick Austin]] and [[Trevor Hairsine]], it followed on from \"Mechanismo\", a series of stories in the ''Megazine'' in which Justice Department, opposed by Dredd, tried to introduce robot judges. With Wagner writing, ''Judge Dredd'' was again the flagship strip.\n\nFormer ''Megazine'' editor [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] became editor of the weekly in 1996 but sales continued to decline. Unsuccessful series were dropped, and a number of new series were tried out, some more successful than others. Writer [[Dan Abnett]] introduced ''[[Sinister Dexter]]'' in 1996, a strip about two hitmen influenced by the film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which became a regular feature. In 1997, writer [[Robbie Morrison]] and artist [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]], who had worked with Bishop on the ''Megazine'', created ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'', a swashbuckling series set in future Russia starring a thief and ladies' man who discovers he's the illegitimate scion of an aristocratic dynasty. There were also gimmicks, like the \"sex issue\", sold in a clear plastic wrapper, ''[[The Spacegirls]]'', a series attempting to cash in on the popularity of the [[Spice Girls]], ''[[M.A.C.H. 1|B.L.A.I.R. 1]]'', a parody of [[Tony Blair]] based on ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', and an adaptation of the [[Danny Boyle]] film ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]''.\n\nA new ''Dredd'' epic, \"[[The Doomsday Scenario|Doomsday]]\", appeared in 1999 and again ran in both ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine''. Wagner had been laying the foundations for this story for several years, introducing the main villain, semi-robotic gang lord Nero Narcos, and supporting characters like [[Judge Edgar]] of the Public Surveillance Unit, and [[Galen DeMarco]], a former judge who had quit after falling in love with Dredd and become a private eye.\n\n1999 also saw the return of another character, ''Nemesis the Warlock''. After a break of ten years, writer Pat Mills decided to bring the story to an end with \"The Final Conflict\". The series was drawn by [[Henry Flint]] in a style that recalled Kevin O'Neill's early work on the series, as well as Simon Bisley's ''ABC Warriors'' work.\n\nThe decade ended with a special 100-page issue called \"Prog 2000\". Behind a cover by Brian Bolland, ''Nemesis'' wrapped up for good in a final episode drawn by Kevin O'Neill. War broke out in ''Nikolai Dante'', and writer [[Gordon Rennie]] and artist [[Mark Harrison (artist)|Mark Harrison]] introduced future war story ''Glimmer Rats''. Another old favourite, ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', was revived by Wagner and Ezquerra, telling new stories of Johnny Alpha set before his death, with the conceit that previous stories had been \"folklore\" and the new stories were \"what really happened\", allowing Wagner to revise continuity.\n\n===2000s===\nThe publisher has been owned by [[Rebellion Developments]] since 2000, with editors [[Andy Diggle]] and [[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]] at the helm. Rebellion continues to develop stories (and computer games) based on classic characters such as ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' and ''[[Judge Dredd]]'', and has also introduced a roster of new series including ''[[Shakara]]'', ''[[The Red Seas]]'' and ''[[Caballistics, Inc.]]''. It has also published a tie-in to the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' in a story written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]].\n\nThe comic continues to uncover new British talents, including [[Boo Cook]], [[Dom Reardon]] and [[Al Ewing]]. It has also benefited from an improved dollar-pound [[exchange rate]] that has meant the comic can now afford to re-employ some of the talent thought lost to America.\n\nA number of shorter self-contained stories, partly created by the new wave of talent, have run including ''[[London Falling]]'', ''[[Stone Island (2000AD)|Stone Island]]'' and ''[[Zombo (comics)|Zombo]]''. Other developments include a revamping of the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' which has included a section acting as a showcase for [[British small press comics]]. Starting in program 1500 was the Judge Dredd story \"The Connection\", a 'prelude' to a 23-part Judge Dredd epic \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" which filled in a lot of the details about Dredd's past.\n\nIn prog 1526,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=prog&page=profiles&choice=1526 |title=Prog 1526 |publisher=2000ad.org |date=28 February 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref> dated 28 February 2007, ''2000 AD'' celebrated their 30th anniversary.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6390731.stm 30 years of the future], [[BBC]], 26 February 2007</ref> The issue saw the start of two new storylines: ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'' (by [[Robbie Morrison]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]) and ''[[Invasion!

In the same year, former editor Steve MacManus published his memoirs.\n\nIn 2017, founding editor Pat Mills published his memoirs, ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History''. Later in that year, [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette Partworks]] began publishing ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]'', an 80-volume fortnightly series of hardback books featuring classic stories from the first 40 years of the comic. This followed the success of ''[[Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection]]'', which had started in 2015 and later been extended to 90 volumes.\n\nIn June 2018 (July in the United States) a special issue was published, the ''2000 AD Sci-Fi Special 2018'', which contained stories written and illustrated entirely by women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/20/the-futures-female-2000ads-all-women-special \"The future's female? 2000AD's all-women special\"], by David Barnett, in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 June 2018.</ref>\n\n==Lists of stories==\n{{Main|List of 2000 AD stories}}\n*A complete index of stories published in ''2000 AD'' from February 1977 to December 2019 (#1 to #2162) is [[Media:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]] (WikiCommons).<ref>[[commons:File:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n*A more detailed list of all the ''Judge Dredd'' stories to appear in ''2000 AD'' (including specials and annuals) from March 1977 to December 2019 can be found [[Media:Dredd2AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]].<ref>[[commons:File:Dredd2AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n\n==Crossovers==\n{{main|2000 AD crossovers}}\nAlthough there is no overall [[shared universe]] containing all ''2000 AD'' stories, some stories [[2000 AD crossovers|spin-off or crossover]] into other stories. These include the numerous stories that occur in the [[Judge Dredd|Judge Dredd universe]]. Many stories by [[Pat Mills]], which are frequently interlinked, link into the Dredd universe as well, though have been partially [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] by the writer. Many stories written by [[Ian Edginton]] feature shared themes and references.\n\n==Editors==\n{{Main|Tharg the Mighty}}\nA long-running theme is that the [[editing|editor]] of ''2000 AD'' is [[Tharg the Mighty]], a green [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] from [[Betelgeuse]] who terms his readers \"Earthlets\". Tharg uses other unique alien expressions and even appears in his own comic strips. Readers sometimes play along with this; for example, in prog 201 a pair of readers wrote to Tharg claiming that they preferred to be called \"Terrans\"; the resulting controversy ended in Tharg allowing readers to vote for the preferred term in prog 229.  In prog 240 Tharg announced that the result was a draw, and \"Terran\" became an accepted term for readers' letters in the Nerve Centre.  In similar vein, Tharg used to draw distinction between male and female letter-writers with \"Eathlet\" and \"Earthlette\" until a letter was printed in Prog 314 complaining about the use, and Tharg agreed to use \"Earthlet\" (or \"Terran\") regardless of gender.  From prog 531 the term \"Earthlette\" was reintroduced.<ref>Prog 531, 18 July 1987 \u2013 \"Earthlette H Maton\"</ref>\n\nAnother running theme is Tharg's use of [[robot]]s to draw and write the strips, which bear a marked resemblance to the actual writers and artists. A fictional reason for Tharg to use mechanical assistance was given when the robots \"went on strike\" (reflecting real-life [[industrial action]] that occasionally halted IPC's comics production during the 1970s and 1980s). Tharg wrote and drew a whole issue himself, but when he ran it through the quality-control \"Thrill-meter\", the device melted down on extreme overload. The offending issue had to be taken away, by blindfolded security guards, to a lead-lined vault where there was no danger of anyone seeing it accidentally.\n<section begin=tharg />\nThe role of Tharg has been performed by the following editors:\n\n#[[Pat Mills]], #1\u201316 (1977)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=patm Pat Mills] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Kelvin Gosnell]], #17\u201385 (1977\u20131978)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=KELVING Kelvin Gosnell] at 2000ad.org</ref><br/>Assistant editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the comic himself in 1978 while Gosnell was occupied with editing new sister title ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]''.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\"/>\n#[[Steve MacManus]], #86\u2013519 (1978\u20131987)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=STEVEM Steve MacManus] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]], #520\u2013872 (1987\u20131994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=RICHARDB Richard Burton] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Alan McKenzie]], #873\u2013914 (1994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ALANMC Alan McKenzie] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]], #915\u2013977 (1994\u20131996)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=JOHNT John Tomlinson] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]], #978\u20131199 (1996\u20132000)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=DAVEB David Bishop (writer)|] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Andy Diggle]], #1200\u20131273 (2000\u20132002)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ANDYD Andy Diggle] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]], #1274\u2013present (2002\u2013present)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=MATTS Matt Smith] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n<section end=tharg />\n\n==Contributors==\n[[File:Drandquinch.jpg|thumb|200px|''D.R and Quinch'', art by [[Alan Davis]].]]\nWell known contributors to ''2000 AD'' include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[Nick Abadzis]]\n* [[Dan Abnett]]\n* [[Massimo Belardinelli]]\n* [[Simon Bisley]]\n* [[Brian Bolland]]\n* [[Philip Bond]]\n* [[Chris Cunningham]]\n* [[Alan Davis]]\n* [[Steve Dillon]]\n* [[D'Israeli (cartoonist)|D'Israeli]]\n* [[Ian Edginton]]\n* [[Garth Ennis]]\n* [[Al Ewing]]\n* [[Carlos Ezquerra]]\n* [[Gerry Finley-Day]]\n* [[Michael Fleisher]]\n* [[Henry Flint]]\n* [[Tom Frame (letterer)|Tom Frame]]\n* [[Neil Gaiman]]\n* [[Dave Gibbons]]\n* [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]\n* [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]\n* [[Trevor Hairsine]]\n* [[Jamie Hewlett]]\n* [[John Hicklenton]]\n* [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]]\n* [[David Hine]]\n* [[Frazer Irving]]\n* [[Jock (comics)|Jock]]\n* [[Cam Kennedy]]\n* [[Brendan McCarthy]]\n* [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]\n* [[Mark Millar]]\n* [[Peter Milligan]]\n* [[Pat Mills]]\n* [[Alan Moore]]\n* [[Grant Morrison]]\n* [[Robbie Morrison]]\n* [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]\n* [[Arthur Ranson]]\n* [[Gordon Rennie]]\n* [[John Ridgway (comics)|John Ridgway]]\n* [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]]\n* [[Ron Smith (comics)|Ron Smith]]\n* [[Simon Spurrier]]\n* [[Richard Starkings]]\n* [[Bryan Talbot]]\n* [[John Wagner]]\n* [[Kev Walker]]\n* [[Chris Weston]]\n{{colend}}\nMany of these have since moved on to work for American publishers such as [[DC Comics]] (especially the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] and [[Wildstorm]] imprints) and [[Marvel Comics]].\n\n==Film and TV adaptations==\n* ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Dredd]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Rogue Trooper#Film|Rogue Trooper]]'' (TBA)<ref>{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=McMillan|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/duncan-jones-teases-rogue-trooper-movie-1127099|title=Duncan Jones Teases 'Rogue Trooper' Movie|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=15 July 2018|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref>\n*''[[Judge Dredd#Television|Judge Dredd: Mega-City One]] (TBA)\n\n==Video game adaptations==\n2000AD video games for 8-bit computers include games based on [[Strontium Dog]] by [[Quicksilva]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984, ''Nemesis the Warlock'' and ''Sl\u00e1ine'' by [[Martech]] in 1987, ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' written by [[Design Design]] / published by ''Piranha'' in 1986 and ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] in 1990, all released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] platforms.

to ''2000 AD'' is the monthly  ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', which originally focused exclusively on expanding the world of Judge Dredd, but in recent years has expanded its focus to include other stories set in other universes as well.\n* The bimonthly ''2000 AD Extreme Edition'' presented reprints of classic and hard-to-find 2000AD stories, but poor sales led to its cancellation in mid-2008. Since the cancellation, a smaller reprint supplement has been packaged with the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' instead.\n*''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' was a weekly title (originally intended to be monthly) launched in 1978 following much the same format as ''2000 AD'' and included ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'' which introduced characters that would later reappear in ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. The two titles were merged later the same year and published as ''2000AD and Starlord''. A third ''Starlord'' series, ''TimeQuake'', also had a 4-week run in ''2000AD'' over a year later.\n*''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'' was a weekly title launched in 1979. There was less emphasis on Science Fiction series. It was merged with ''2000 AD'' after 22 issues, transferring the strips ''[[Blackhawk (UK comic)|Blackhawk]]'', ''The Mind of Wolfie Smith'' and ''Captain Klep''. For a while the publication was titled ''2000 AD and Tornado''.\n*''[[Diceman (comics)|Diceman]]'' was an early attempt at creating a [[role-playing]] comic featuring regular ''2000 AD'' characters such as Rogue Trooper and Slaine, as well as original characters, like Diceman. The magazine was not a success and only lasted five issues.\n*''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'' (1988\u20131991) was a sister publication that did not follow the format of ''2000 AD'', but did share many editorial staff and creative teams. Early issues featured two SF-themed stories aimed at a slightly older age group than ''2000 AD'' with strong political themes. It became a magnet for British creators who wanted to create comics for the adult market. The ''2000 AD'' series ''Finn'', begun the year after ''Crisis'' was cancelled, continued the adventures of the character from ''Third World War'', though with more of a fantasy emphasis.\n*''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]'' (1990\u20131991) joined ''Crisis'' though it only lasted for seven issues. Dan Dare was in the original line-up, and this transferred to ''Crisis'' when ''Revolver'' finished.\n*''[[Toxic!]]'' was a short-lived rival publication, established by ''2000 AD'' talent, that was published during 1991.\n*A ''Best of 2000 AD'' title was published in the mid-1980s which featured reprint material from early issues of ''2000 AD''. In the early 1990s, ''The Complete Judge Dredd'' began publication in a similar format. Both titles were relaunched as ''Classic 2000AD'' and ''Classic Judge Dredd'' in the mid-1990s but were cancelled soon after.\n*A yearly hardcover annual was published from 1977 to 1990 (though the cover dates on the annuals were always the following year). From 1991 this was replaced by a softcover ''2000AD Yearbook''; the last of these was published in 1994. There were also annuals/yearbooks dedicated to ''2000 AD'' characters such as ''Dan Dare'' (1978\u20131979, cover dated 1979\u20131980), ''Judge Dredd'' (1980\u20131994) and ''Rogue Trooper'' (1990).\n* An annual summer special was published during the summer months between 1977 and 1996, entitled the ''2000AD Sci-Fi Special'' from 1978. This was revived in 2014.\n* Other specials include the ''2000AD Winter Special'' (1988\u20131995, 2005 and 2014), ''Judge Dredd Mega Special'' (1988\u20131996) and ''Rogue Trooper Action Special'' (1996). (1996's ''Judge Dredd Action Special'' was a tie-in to the defunct ''Judge Dredd: Lawman of the Future'' rather than ''2000AD'' proper).\n* In April 1992, a ''2000AD Action Special'' featured six strips reviving classic British comics characters such as the [[Steel Claw]]. Of these only ''Kelly's Eye'' also appeared in ''2000 AD'' proper.\n* In the mid-1990s a series of ''2000 AD Poster Progs'' were published, each featuring a new strip. There were five ''Judge Dredd'' poster magazines, plus one each for four other ''2000 AD'' series: ''Nemesis the Warlock'', ''Strontium Dogs'', ''Sl\u00e1ine'' and ''Rogue Trooper''.\n* A series of American comic format reprints started in 1983 by [[Eagle Comics]] with the first issue of an ongoing monthly ''Judge Dredd'' title. Eagle Comics also reprinted other ''2000 AD'' material in other titles. The license to reprint ''2000 AD'' material in the US was later taken over by [[Quality Communications|Quality Comics]]. These reprints ended in the early 1990s.\n\n===Fanzines===\n''2000 AD'' has an extremely lively and thriving [[Fan (aficionado)|fanbase]], which has produced a number of independent [[fanzine]]s.\n\nBetween 1994\u201396, \"Fear The Badge\" was an erstwhile but overly ambitious attempt at a ''2000 AD'' fanzine based around the Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog and Robo-hunter universes. With original artwork, stories and articles, the fanzine would act as a showcase for talent wanting to break into comics.\nIts editor/creator, Paul Dick, partially disabled himself, wanted to donate some of the zine's profits to a different disability charity each month. However, the fanzine's genesis was plagued by bad luck, not least of all Dick's health worsening. Despite the good intentions and hardwork of its creator (as well as the keen interest and support from both amateur and professional ''2000 AD'' contributors), the fanzine's full potential sadly never was realised. Only a dummy run of 50 copies of issue 1 were ever produced.\n\nIn 1998 W.R. Logan, frustrated at the lack of activity from the comic's publishers both in promoting the title and also in making best use of new talents, decided to create an independent title using ''2000 AD'' copyrighted characters and situations. This was titled ''[[Class of '79]]'', named after the year of Dredd's graduation from the Academy of Law \u2013 2079. The first couple of issues contained work from now-professional comics creators [[Rufus Dayglo]], [[Boo Cook]], [[Henry Flint]] and [[PJ Holden]] and won the best Self Published/Independent Comic Award at the 1999 National Comics Awards.\n\nIn 2001, [[Andrew J. Lewis (comics)|Andrew J. Lewis]] created ''[[Zarjaz]]'' comic, with strips featuring characters from a variety of ''2000 AD'' stories. There were also interviews with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], [[Frazer Irving]] and [[Alan Moore]], as well as an extensive article on breaking into comics as a writer.\n\nAnother long-running fanzine, dedicated to the world of Johnny Alpha, is ''[[Dogbreath]]'', originally run by the pseudonymous Dr Bob it is now being produced by FutureQuake Publishing. In 2003, [[Arthur Wyatt (comics)|Arthur Wyatt]] created ''[[FutureQuake]]'', a fanzine devoted to the [[Future Shocks]] format. Although ''Class of '79'' now appears to be on hiatus, all three of the other titles are in continuous publication, ''Zarjaz'' having started up again with a new issue 1.\n\nIn addition, a number of [[British small press comics|small press]] comics have emerged from the ''2000 AD'' fanbase, including ''[[Solar Wind (comic)|Solar Wind]]'', ''Omnivistascope'' and ''[[The End Is Nigh]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of 2000 AD stories]]\n*[[List of minor 2000 AD stories]]\n*''[[Action (comic)|Action]]''\n*[[British comics]]\n*[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]], which saw a number of ''2000 AD'' artists and writers working for the big American firms during the 1980s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n*[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] (2002\u20132003), ''[[Thrill Power Overload]]!''

As a [[comics anthology]] it serialises stories in each issue (known as \"progs\")<ref group=note>Prog: short for \"programme\" as issues are supposedly beamed directly to the printed page.</ref> and was first published by [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]] in 1977, the first issue dated 26 February. IPC then shifted the title to its [[Fleetway]] comics subsidiary, which was sold to [[Robert Maxwell]] in 1987 and then to [[Egmont UK]] in 1991. Fleetway continued to produce the title until 2000, when it was bought by [[Rebellion Developments]].\n\n''2000 AD'' is most noted for its ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories, and has been contributed to by a number of artists and writers who became renowned in the field internationally, such as [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Brian Bolland]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. Other characters in ''2000 AD'' include ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and the ''[[ABC Warriors]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1970s===\n\n====Pre-publication====\nIn December 1975, [[Kelvin Gosnell]], a sub-editor at [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]], read an article in the [[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]] about a wave of forthcoming science fiction films, and suggested that the company might get on the bandwagon by launching a science fiction comic. IPC asked [[Pat Mills]], a [[freelance]] writer and [[editing|editor]] who had created ''[[Battle Picture Weekly]]'' and ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', to develop it. Mills brought fellow freelancer [[John Wagner]] on board as script adviser and the pair began to develop characters. The then-futuristic name ''2000 AD'' was chosen by the publisher, John Sanders,<ref name=\":0\">Mills, Pat (2017) ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History'' (Millsverse Books).</ref>{{Rp|pp.25\u201326}} as no-one involved expected the comic to last that long. The original logo and overall look of the comic were designed by art assistant Doug Church.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|p.37}}\n\nMills' experiences with ''Battle'' and Action in particular had taught him that readers responded to his [[anti-authoritarian]] attitudes. Wagner, who had written a [[Dirty Harry]]-inspired tough cop called ''[[One-Eyed Jack (comics)|One-Eyed Jack]]'' for ''[[Valiant (comic)|Valiant]]'', saw that readers also responded to authority figures, and developed a character that took the concept to its logical extreme, imagining an ultra-violent lawman patrolling a future [[New York City|New York]] with the power to arrest, sentence, and if required execute criminals on the spot. Meanwhile, Mills had developed a [[horror fiction|horror]] strip, inspired by the novels of [[Dennis Wheatley]], about a [[hanging judge]], called ''Judge Dread'' (after the [[reggae]] and [[ska]] artist of the [[Judge Dread|same name]]). The idea was abandoned as unsuitable for the new comic, but the name, with a little modification, was adopted by Wagner for his ultimate lawman.\n\nThe task of visualising the newly named ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' was given to [[Carlos Ezquerra]], a Spanish artist who had previously worked with Mills on ''Battle'', on a strip called ''Major Eazy''. Wagner gave Ezquerra an advertisement for the film ''[[Death Race 2000]]'', showing the character Frankenstein clad in black leather, as a suggestion for what the character should look like. Ezquerra elaborated on this greatly, adding body-armour, zips and chains, which Wagner originally thought over the top. Wagner's initial script was rewritten by Mills and drawn up by Ezquerra, but when the art came back a rethink was necessary. The hardware and cityscapes Ezquerra had drawn were far more futuristic than the near-future setting originally intended, and Mills decided to run with it and set the strip further into the future. By this stage, however, Wagner and Ezquerra had both quit.\n\nMills was reluctant to lose ''Judge Dredd'', and farmed the strip out to a variety of freelance writers, hoping to develop it further. Their scripts were given to a variety of artists as Mills tried to find a strip which would make a good introduction to the character, all of which meant that ''Dredd'' would not be ready for the first issue. The story chosen was one written by freelancer Peter Harris,{{efn|Harris also wrote two ''Future Shocks'' and one episode of ''M.A.C.H. One''.<ref>[http://2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=thrills&Comic=2000AD&Field=Writer&choice=peterha 2000ad.org]</ref>}} extensively rewritten by Mills and including an idea suggested by Kelvin Gosnell,<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|pp.70\u201372}} and drawn by newcomer [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. The strip debuted in prog 2.\n\nIPC owned the rights to ''[[Dan Dare]]'', and Mills decided to revive the character to add immediate public recognition for the title. Paul DeSavery, who owned ''Dare'''s film rights, offered to buy the new comic and give Mills and Wagner more creative control and a greater financial stake. The deal fell through, however.\n\n====The opening line-up====\n\n''[[Dan Dare]]'' was extensively revamped to make it more futuristic. In the new stories he had been put into suspended animation and revived several centuries in the future. Several artists were tried out before Mills settled on Italian artist [[Massimo Belardinelli]], whose imaginative, hallucinatory work was fantastic at visualising aliens, although perhaps less satisfying on the hero himself. The scripts were endlessly rewritten in an attempt to make the series work, but few ''Dan Dare'' fans remember this version of the character fondly. Belardinelli and Gibbons later switched strips, with Gibbons drawing ''Dan Dare'' and Belardinelli drawing the ''Harlem Heroes'' sequel ''Inferno''. When Gibbons took over ''Dan Dare'' in prog 28 the strip was refashioned as a \"''Star Trek''\" style space opera.\n\nMills had also created ''[[Harlem Heroes]]'', about the future sport of aeroball, a futuristic, violent version of basketball with jet-packs. Similar future sport series had been a fixture of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', and the similarly-themed film [[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]] had been released the previous year. Wanting to give the new comic a distinctive look, Mills wanted to use European artists, but the work turned in on ''Harlem Heroes'' by [[Trigo (comics)|Trigo]] was disappointing. Veteran British artists [[Ron Turner (artist)|Ron Turner]] and [[Barrie Mitchell]] were tried out, but the newcomer [[Dave Gibbons]] won the editor over with his dynamic, American-influenced drawings and got the job. Mills wrote the first five episodes before handing the strip to ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'' writer [[Tom Tully (comic writer)|Tom Tully]].\n\nThe other opening strips were ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', a super-powered secret agent inspired by ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''; ''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]'', about a \"Volgan\" (thinly disguised and originally billed as Soviet, but changed before printing to a \"neutral\" antagonist) invasion of the United Kingdom opposed by tough London lorry driver turned [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter Bill Savage; and ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]'', a strip about [[Time travel|time-travelling]] cowboys farming [[dinosaur]]s for their meat.\n\nAfter 16 issues, Mills quit as editor and handed the reins to [[Kelvin Gosnell]], whose idea the comic had been in the first place. Gosnell also appeared as the fall guy in the ''[[Tharg the Mighty]]'' comedy [[Fumetti|photostrips]] that were a feature of the comic in its early years.\n\n====Early years====\nWagner returned to write ''Judge Dredd'', starting in prog 9. His \"[[The Robot Wars|Robot Wars]]\" storyline was drawn by a rotating team of artists, including McMahon, Ezquerra, Turner and [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]], and marked the point where ''Dredd'' became the most popular character in the comic, a position he has rarely relinquished.<ref>Jarman, Colin M. and Peter Acton (1995) ''Judge Dredd: The Mega-History'', Lennard Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85291-128-X}}, p. 58</ref> Dredd's city, which now covered most of the east coast of North America, became known as [[Mega-City One]]. Dredd had also been unmasked in issue 8 in a story drawn by Massimo Belardinelli, but the decision was made to make out that Dredd's face had been scarred and the panel had a 'censored' banner slapped on it. After this, there were no further attempts to show Dredd's face again.\n\nA new story format was introduced in prog 25 \u2013 ''[[Tharg's Future Shocks]]'', one-off twist-in-the-tail stories devised by writer [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]]. ''2000 AD'' still uses this format as filler and to try out new talent.\n\nWagner introduced a new character, ''[[Robo-Hunter]]'', in 1978. The hero, Sam Slade, was a [[private detective]]-type character specialising in [[robot]]-related cases. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer was the original artist, but the editorial team were not happy with his work and quickly replaced him with Ian Gibson, who redrew parts of Ferrer's episodes before taking over himself. Gibson's imaginative, cartoony art helped drive the series' style from hard-boiled detective to surreal comedy. As the series continued Sam was joined by an idiot kit-built robot assistant, Hoagy, and after a crack-down on smoking in IPC comics, a [[Cuba]]n robot [[cigar]], Stogie, designed to help him cut down on [[nicotine]].\n\nOther ongoing strips included ''The Visible Man'', detailing the misfortunes of Frank Hart, a man whose skin had been made transparent due to exposure to nuclear waste, and ''Shako'', (which followed the same formula as ''Hook Jaw'' from ''Action'' but with less success) the story of a [[polar bear]] pursued by the Army because it had swallowed a secret capsule.\n\n''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'' was killed off in 1978 but a spin-off, ''M.A.C.H. Zero'', continued into the 1980s. ''Flesh'' had a sequel in 1978, set on the prehistoric oceans, and Bill Savage appeared again in a prequel, ''Disaster 1990'', in which a nuclear explosion at the north pole had melted the polar ice-cap and flooded Britain.\n\nIn 1977 ''2000 AD'' launched the annual 48-page Summer Special, including a full length ''M.A.C.H. Zero'' story drawn by O'Neill. The yearly hardcover annual also started in 1977 and would continue till 1991.\n\nPat Mills took over writing ''Dredd'' for a six-month \"epic\" called \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]\", inspired by [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Damnation Alley]]'', which took the future lawman out of the city on a humanitarian trek across the radioactive wasteland between the Mega-Cities. McMahon drew the bulk of the stories, with occasional episodes drawn by [[Brian Bolland]]. The story saw Dredd moved to the colour centre pages for the first time while ''Dan Dare'' was given the front page.\n\nIPC had launched a second science fiction comic, ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'', which was cancelled after only 22 issues and merged into ''2000 AD'' from prog 86.<ref>[https://michaelowencarroll.wordpress.com/2018/05/26/eaglution-of-british-comics-part-1/ ''The Eaglution of British Comics''] by Michael Carroll, 26 May 2018. (Retrieved 27 May 2018.)</ref> As Gosnell was editor of ''Starlord'' and ''2000 AD'' at the same time, ''2000 AD'' sub-editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the latter comic himself during this time.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\">\"A brief history of Starlord\" from \"Watch the stars!\" website {{cite web|url=http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |title=A Brief History of Starlord |accessdate=10 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128232417/http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 }}</ref> Two ''Starlord'' strips strengthened ''2000 AD'''s line-up: ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[bounty hunter]] created by Wagner and Ezquerra, and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'', a robot disaster squad created by Mills. ''Ro-Busters'' gave O'Neill the chance to spread his artistic wings and led to the popular spin-off ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. ''Strontium Dog'' and ''ABC Warriors'' continued to feature in ''2000 AD'' for the next 40 years. (A third ''Starlord'' series, ''Timequake'', only lasted for four episodes and was not renewed.) ''Dan Dare'' was suspended while \"The Cursed Earth\" was finished in time for the merger. Wagner returned to ''Dredd'' following the merger to write \"The Day the Law Died\", another six-month epic in which Mega-City One was taken over by the insane [[Judge Cal|Chief Judge Cal]], based on the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caligula]].\n\nAnother cancelled title, ''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'', was merged with ''2000 AD'' a few months later from prog 127, contributing three stories to ''2000 AD'': ''[[Blackhawk (Tornado)|Blackhawk]]'', an historical adventure series about a Nubian slave in the Roman Empire which took a science-fictional turn in ''2000 AD'' with him becoming a gladiator in an alien world; ''[[The Mind of Wolfie Smith]]'', a coming of age/psychic story of a runaway teenager, and ''Captain Klep'', a single-page superhero parody. These stories, unlike ''Starlord's'', did not continue for very long.\n\n''2000 AD'' featured an adaptation of [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s novel ''[[The Stainless Steel Rat]]'', written by Gosnell and drawn by Ezquerra. Adaptations of two of Harrison's sequels, ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'' and ''The Stainless Steel Rat for President'', would follow later.   The appearance of the main character, galactic thief \"Slippery\" Jim DiGriz, was based on [[James Coburn]], evidently a favourite of Ezquerra's; Coburn was also the inspiration for ''[[Major Eazy]]'', which Ezquerra drew in ''Battle,'' as well as ''Cursed Earth Koburn'', a Dredd-universe reworking of the Major Eazy character, who first appeared in 2003. [[Gerry Finley-Day]] contributed ''[[The V.C.s]]'', a future war story inspired by the [[Vietnam War]], drawn by McMahon, [[Cam Kennedy]], [[Garry Leach]] and [[John Richardson (comics)|John Richardson]].\n\nA feature of the early years of ''2000 AD'' was the opportunities it gave to young British comic artists: by the time the title celebrated its 100th issue Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons, Ian Gibson, Mike McMahon and Kevin O'Neil were all established as regulars.\n\n[[Steve MacManus]] took over from Gosnell as editor in 1978.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980 ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' gained a new enemy. Writer [[John Wagner]] realised that Dredd's habit of shooting just about everybody he came up against meant that it was difficult to create a recurring villain. The solution was [[Judge Death]], an undead judge from another dimension where, since all crime was committed by the living, life itself was outlawed. The law had been thoroughly enforced on his own world, and now he had come to Mega-City One to continue his work. Judge Death first appeared in an atmospheric three-parter drawn by [[Brian Bolland]] which also introduced [[Judge Anderson]] and [[Psi Division]], a squad of judges with psychic powers.\n\nDredd soon began another epic journey in \"[[Judge Child|The Judge Child]]\". A dying Psi Division Judge had predicted disaster for Mega-City One unless it was ruled by a boy with a birthmark shaped like an eagle, so Dredd set off into the Cursed Earth, to [[Texas City]], and into deep space in search of the boy, Owen Krysler, and his kidnappers, the Angel Gang. The Angels were some of the most memorable villains Wagner had yet devised, but suffered the same mortality problem that had plagued the strip so far. All of them were killed during the course of the story, however the [[Mean Machine Angel|Mean Machine]], was later resurrected by Krysler during \"Destiny's Angels\". \"The Judge Child\" was drawn by Bolland, [[Ron Smith (artist)|Ron Smith]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] in rotation, and the later episodes marked the beginning of Wagner's long-running writing partnership with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]. The pair would go on to write ''Strontium Dog'', ''Robo-Hunter'' and many other stories for ''2000 AD'', as well as for ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' and the relaunched ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' in the United Kingdom, and a number of comics in America.\n\nWith prog 178 all current stories, with the exception of ''Judge Dredd'', were wound up, and a new set of stories was launched simultaneously, consisting of ''[[Mean Arena]]'', set around a violent high-tech street football game, ''[[Meltdown Man]]'', whose hero was transported to a genetically engineered far future by a nuclear explosion, the return of ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', featuring a mutant bounty hunter character inherited from the short-lived ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' title, and ''[[Dash Decent]]'', a  ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[parody]].\n\n[[Pat Mills]] introduced ''Comic Rock'', which was meant to be a format for short stories inspired by popular music. The first story, inspired by [[The Jam]]'s ''Going Underground'', was drawn by Kevin O'Neill and featured a complicated underground travel network on a planet called \"Termight\", in which a freedom fighter called [[Nemesis the Warlock|Nemesis]] battles the despotic [[Torquemada (comics)|Torquemada]], chief of the Tube Police. All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his vehicle, the Blitzspear. The story was a reaction to an earlier tube chase sequence Mills and O'Neill had done in ''Ro-Busters'', which management objected to.\n\nThe only other ''Comic Rock'' story was a follow-up called \"Killer Watt\", in which Nemesis and Torquemada fought on a [[Teleportation|teleport]] system. This led to a series, ''Nemesis the Warlock'', in which it was revealed that Termight was Earth in the far future, Torquemada was a despotic demagogue leading a campaign of genocide against all aliens, and Nemesis was the leader of the alien resistance. Mills and O'Neill were on a roll and produced a stream of bizarre and imaginative ideas, but ultimately O'Neill was unable to continue the level of work he was putting into it on ''2000 AD'' pay. He left to work for [[DC Comics]] in America, and was replaced on ''Nemesis'' by first [[Jesus Redondo]] and then [[Bryan Talbot]].\n\n''2000 AD'' would occasionally take a gamble on non-science fiction material. For example, ''[[Fiends of the Eastern Front]]'' was a World War II [[vampire]] story by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]] which was probably originally intended for ''Battle''. Its hero was a German soldier who discovered that some of his [[Romania]]n allies were vampires. Later in the war, when Romania changed sides, he was the only one who knew their secret.\n\nA readers' poll revealed that future war was a popular topic, so Gerry Finley-Day was asked to come up with a new war story. He, editor [[Steve MacManus]] and artists Dave Gibbons devised ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', a \"[[G.I. (comics)|Genetic Infantryman]]\" engineered to be immune to chemical warfare hunting down the traitor general who had betrayed his regiment, who debuted in 1981. He was supported by bio-chips of the personalities of three dead comrades, which, slotted into his equipment, could talk to him. Gibbons left the strip early on and was replaced by [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]], [[Brett Ewins]] and  [[Cam Kennedy]]. ''Rogue Trooper'' replaced ''Meltdown Man'', which had recently ended its run.\n\nAnother new strip in 1981, inspired by the brief [[Citizens' band radio|CB radio]] craze, was ''[[Ace Trucking Co.]]'', a comedy about pointy-headed alien space trucker Ace Garp and his crew by Wagner, Grant and Belardinelli.\n\nIn the ''Judge Dredd'' series, Mega-City One had grown too large and unwieldy: therefore authors Wagner and Grant they planned to cut it down to size.  \"[[Block Mania]]\", in which wars broke out between rival city-blocks, turned out to be a plot orchestrated by the Russian city East-Meg One, and led directly to \"[[Apocalypse War|The Apocalypse War]]\", another six-month epic and a hard-hitting satire on the concept of [[Mutually assured destruction]]. East-Meg One, protected by a warp-shield, softened up Mega-City One with nuclear warheads before invading. Dredd spearheaded the resistance, leading a small team to East-Meg territory, hijacking their nuclear bunkers and blowing East-Meg One off the face of the earth. \"The Apocalypse War\" was drawn in its entirety by Carlos Ezquerra, making a return to the character he created.\n\nA new writer, [[Alan Moore]], had started contributing ''[[Future Shocks]]'' in 1980. He wrote more than fifty one-off strips over the next three years, while also contributing to various [[Marvel UK]] titles and the independent magazine ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]''. In 1982 he gained his first series, ''[[Skizz]]'', a less sentimental take on the same basic plot used in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', set in [[Birmingham]] and influenced by [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. The series was drawn by [[Jim Baikie]].\n\nMoore wrote another series, ''[[D.R. and Quinch]]'', spun off from a one-off ''Time Twister''. Drawn by [[Alan Davis]], the strip featured a pair of alien juvenile delinquents with a penchant for mindless thermonuclear destruction. He went on to create ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]'' with artist [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]. Halo was an everywoman in the far future, born into mass unemployment on a floating housing estate, who escaped the earth and became involved in a terrible galactic war. Three books were published, and more were planned, but Moore's demands for creator's rights and his increasing commitments to American publishers meant they never materialised.\n\nA new character, ''[[Sl\u00e1ine (comics)|Sl\u00e1ine]]'', debuted in 1983, but had been in development since 1981. Created by [[Pat Mills]] and his then wife [[Angela Kincaid]], ''Sl\u00e1ine'' was a barbarian [[fantasy]] strip based on [[Celtic mythology]]. Kincaid was a children's book illustrator who had never worked in comics before, and her opening episode was drawn and redrawn several times before the editors were satisfied. Other stories were written for artists Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon, but these could not see print until Kincaid's episode was ready.\n\nIn 1985, after appearing as a supporting character in ''Judge Dredd'', ''[[Judge Anderson]]'' finally appeared in her own series, written by Wagner and Grant and initially drawn by Brett Ewins. New artist [[Glenn Fabry]] debuted on ''Sl\u00e1ine'', but due to his notorious slowness was rotated with [[David Pugh (comics)|David Pugh]]. In the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#\"Letter From a Democrat\": The martyrdom of Hester Hyman|Letter from a Democrat]]\", Wagner and Grant introduced a pro-democracy movement in Mega-City One, which is after all a [[police state]]. This would provide plotlines for years to come.\n\nIn 1986 the comic reached its 500th issue. A new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, ''Sl\u00e1ine the King'', began, entirely drawn by Fabry. [[Peter Milligan]], a writer who had been contributing ''Future Shocks'', began two series, the bleak future war story ''[[Bad Company (comics)|Bad Company]]'' and a strange, [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] series called ''The Dead''. In 1986, ''2000 AD'' was selling  150,000 copies a week.\n\nIn 1987 IPC's comics division was hived off and sold to publishing magnate [[Robert Maxwell]] as Fleetway. ''2000 AD'' was revamped, with a larger page size and full process colour on the covers and centre pages. [[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]] became editor. Kevin O'Neill returned for a short ''Nemesis'' series called \"Torquemada the God\". Not long after came the debut of ''[[Zenith (comic)|Zenith]]'', ''2000 AD'''s first serious superhero strip, by new writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Steve Yeowell]]. The title character was a shallow pop singer with superhuman powers, caught up in the intrigues of a 1960s generation of superhumans and the machinations of some [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] elder gods.\n\nWagner and Grant began a new ''Dredd'' Epic, \"[[Oz (Judge Dredd story)|Oz]]\", featuring [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]], a popular supporting character. Chopper was a skysurfer who had been imprisoned for competing in an illegal surfing competition a few years previously. A legal \"Supersurf\" race was being held in Oz, the future Australia, and Chopper escaped to compete. Dredd also went to Oz, partly to deal with Chopper, but mostly to investigate the [[Judda]], a clone army created by Mega-City One's former chief genetic engineer. The Judda were defeated, and Chopper narrowly lost the race to Jug McKenzie. Dredd was waiting at the finish line, but McKenzie distracted him and allowed Chopper to escape into the outback. This ending was apparently the cause of some dispute between Wagner and Grant, and was a contributing factor (it was ''[[The Last American]]'', a mini series for [[Epic Comics]] which would mark the end)  in ending their regular writing partnership. Wagner kept ''Dredd'', while Grant continued ''Strontium Dog'' and ''Judge Anderson''. However the pair would still come together for occasional collaborations.\n\nThe \"Oz\" storyline had some lasting implications. [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], a Judda cloned from the same genetic material as Dredd, was captured by Justice Department, who had plans for him. Chopper also spun off into his own series, written by Wagner and drawn by [[Colin MacNeil]].\n\nThe ''ABC Warriors'' finally had their own series again in 1987 as a spin-off from ''Nemesis''. This was written, as ever, by Pat Mills, and drawn by two artists in rotation, newcomer [[Simon Bisley]] and science fiction artist [[SMS (comics)|S.M.S.]].\n\nIn 1988 Grant and artist Simon Harrison began a new ''Strontium Dog'' story, \"The Final Solution\". It took nearly two years to complete, and ended with the death of Johnny Alpha, who sacrificed his life to save mutants from extermination. Original artist Carlos Ezquerra did not agree with the decision to kill the character off, and refused to draw it.\n\nThe number of colour pages was increased, allowing for one complete strip per issue to be painted. Initially the colour pages were reserved for ''Judge Dredd'', but were later given over to a new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, \"The Horned God\", fully painted by [[Simon Bisley]]. The series was collected as a series of three graphic novels, then as a single volume, and has remained in print ever since.\n\nIn 1989 the colour pages were increased again, allowing for three colour stories and two black and white in every issue. One of the colour series was ''Rogue Trooper: the War Machine'', written by Dave Gibbons and painted by [[Will Simpson (comics)|Will Simpson]]. The original ''Rogue Trooper'' series had run out of steam after the Traitor General had been dealt with, though continued with Rogue's adventures on Horst and the 'Hit' series, so Gibbons revamped the concept, creating a different genetic infantryman, [[Friday (2000 AD)|Friday]], in a different war, albeit in the same universe.\n\nOne of the black and white stories, \"[[The Dead Man]]\", was a low-key beginning for a major event. In the Cursed Earth, villagers come across a man, burnt from head to toe, with no memory of who he is or what happened to him. As he tries to piece his memories back together, he is being hunted by the evil beings who left him in that state. A creepy, atmospheric horror-western, it was drawn by [[John Ridgway (comic artist)|John Ridgway]] and written by \"Keef Ripley\", a pseudonym for John Wagner. By the end of the series the Dead Man had discovered his identity: he was Judge Dredd.\n\n===1990s===\nAs \"The Dead Man\" ended, a new ''Judge Dredd'' story, \"[[The Dead Man#Tale of the Dead Man|Tale of the Dead Man]]\", explained how Dredd had ended up in that position. Dredd was getting older and the democratic movement was causing him to doubt his role, so Justice Department had groomed [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], the former Judda cloned from his bloodline, to replace him. Kraken was now ready for his final assessment, and Dredd himself was chosen to assess him. Although Kraken performed faultlessly, Dredd thought he perceived a hint of his former allegiance to the Judda in him, and failed him. He then resigned as a judge and took the '[[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]]' into the Cursed Earth. There he met the Sisters of Death, and only barely survived the encounter. This could mean only one thing: Judge Death was back.\n\nThis set up the latest six-month epic, \"[[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]\". After Dredd had left, Justice Department had put Kraken through one final test, and given him Dredd's badge. But the Sisters of Death, spirit beings from Judge Death's dimension, were able to use Kraken's inner conflict to take control of him and use him to bring Judge Death and the other Dark Judges back from the limbo dimension Dredd had exiled them to. The Sisters possessed all the city's judges and began to enforce Death's twisted law. Out in the Cursed Earth, Dredd had recovered his memory and returned to defeat the Dark Judges. He then tried to lance the democratic boil by holding a referendum on whether the Judges should continue to govern the city. The judges won, by a small margin on a desultory turnout, and Dredd was satisfied.\n\n''2000 AD'' gained an influx of talent from other comics. [[Garth Ennis]] and [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]] had come to prominence writing for ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', a ''2000 AD'' spin-off for older readers, while artists [[Jamie Hewlett]] and [[Philip Bond]] were the stars of ''[[Deadline magazine|Deadline]]'', an independent comics and popular culture magazine founded by [[Steve Dillon]] and [[Brett Ewins]]. Smith created ''[[Indigo Prime]]'', a multi-dimensional organisation that polices reality, whose most memorable story was \"Killing Time\", a [[time travel]] story featuring [[Jack the Ripper]]. [[Garth Ennis]] and Philip Bond contributed ''Time Flies'', a time-travel comedy, and Hewlett was paired with writer [[Peter Milligan]] for the surreal ''[[Hewligan's Haircut]]''. Writer [[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] and artist [[Simon Jacob]] created ''[[Armoured Gideon]]'', an action-comedy series about a giant killer robot charged with keeping demons from invading earth.\n\nThe ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', a monthly title set in the world of Dredd, was launched in October 1990. With John Wagner focusing his attentions there, Garth Ennis became the regular writer of Dredd in the weekly.\n\nAmerican writer [[Michael Fleisher]], who had written ''[[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]]'' and ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' in the 1970s, was recruited to write the continuing adventures of the new ''Rogue Trooper'', along with several other strips, none of which went down very well. Another new writer who failed to set ''2000 AD'' on fire was [[Mark Millar]], whose revival of ''Robo-Hunter'' was particularly unpopular. Millar has since gone on to become a successful writer of American [[superhero]] comics such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]''.\n\n''2000 AD'' went all-colour about this time (prog 723, dated 23 March 1991), in response to a short-lived new colour weekly, ''[[Toxic!]]'', launched by Pat Mills and many of the core ''2000 AD'' team of creators. ''Toxic!'' only lasted 31 issues but many of the creators who had worked on the comic eventually found their way to work for ''2000 AD''. ''[[Button Man]]'', a contemporary thriller by John Wagner and [[Arthur Ranson]], was originally intended for ''Toxic!'' but ended up in ''2000 AD''.\n\nA new ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' series, written by Mills and Tony Skinner and painted by [[Kev Walker]], began in 1991, in which Deadlock took over the warriors with his \"Khaos\" philosophy.\n\nRobert Maxwell died in late 1991, and Fleetway was merged with London Editions, a Danish-owned company which owned rights to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters, to become Fleetway Editions.\n\nIn 1992, ''2000 AD'' and the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' ran their first crossover story, \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", in which [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]]s overran Mega-City One. Written by Garth Ennis and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, [[Peter Doherty (comics)|Peter Doherty]], [[Dean Ormston]] and [[Chris Cunningham|Chris Halls]], the story teamed Judge Dredd with Johnny Alpha through the medium of time travel. John Smith and artist [[Paul Marshall (comics)|Paul Marshall]] created ''[[Firekind]]'', a slow-paced story about dragons and alien societies, which was accidentally published with its episodes in the wrong order.\n\nThe ''Strontium Dog'' world was eventually spun out to encompass a wider field, gaining the plural name ''Strontium Dogs'' \u2013 characters such as female vampire [[Durham Red]], the albino Feral Jackson, and former Johnny Alpha sidekick The Gronk \u2013 the latter, normally a timid creature with weak 'heartses', became a gung-ho action character upon learning of Alpha's death. However, in the 12-parter ''The Darkest Star'', it transpires that the one to ''actually'' kill him was the Gronk himself; changed into a form designed by a cadre of Lyran necromancers to bring him endless agony, Alpha asked his friend to end his torment.\n\n{{anchor|Summer Offensive}}<!-- [[Summer Offensive (comics)]] links here -->\nThe \"Summer Offensive\" was an eight-week experiment in 1993, when new editor [[Alan McKenzie]] gave free rein to writers [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and John Smith, to a mixed reception. Morrison wrote a Dredd story, \"Inferno\", and a drug-influenced comedy adventure, ''[[Really & Truly]]''. Smith contributed ''[[Slaughterbowl]]'', in which convicted criminals on dinosaurs are pitted against each other in a deadly sport, with the survivor being paroled for a year and granted wealth \u2013 but being forced to enter the Slaughterbowl again the next year. Millar wrote ''[[Maniac 5]]'', an action-packed series about a remote controlled war-robot. During this run was a satire of British [[tabloid newspaper|tabloid]] attitudes titled ''[[Big Dave (comics)|Big Dave]]'', written by Morrison and Millar and drawn by [[Steve Parkhouse]].\n\n[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] became editor in 1994, and a second crossover between ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine'', \"[[Mechanismo|Wilderlands]]\", began. Written by Wagner and drawn by Ezquerra, [[Mick Austin]] and [[Trevor Hairsine]], it followed on from \"Mechanismo\", a series of stories in the ''Megazine'' in which Justice Department, opposed by Dredd, tried to introduce robot judges. With Wagner writing, ''Judge Dredd'' was again the flagship strip.\n\nFormer ''Megazine'' editor [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] became editor of the weekly in 1996 but sales continued to decline. Unsuccessful series were dropped, and a number of new series were tried out, some more successful than others. Writer [[Dan Abnett]] introduced ''[[Sinister Dexter]]'' in 1996, a strip about two hitmen influenced by the film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which became a regular feature. In 1997, writer [[Robbie Morrison]] and artist [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]], who had worked with Bishop on the ''Megazine'', created ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'', a swashbuckling series set in future Russia starring a thief and ladies' man who discovers he's the illegitimate scion of an aristocratic dynasty. There were also gimmicks, like the \"sex issue\", sold in a clear plastic wrapper, ''[[The Spacegirls]]'', a series attempting to cash in on the popularity of the [[Spice Girls]], ''[[M.A.C.H. 1|B.L.A.I.R. 1]]'', a parody of [[Tony Blair]] based on ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', and an adaptation of the [[Danny Boyle]] film ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]''.\n\nA new ''Dredd'' epic, \"[[The Doomsday Scenario|Doomsday]]\", appeared in 1999 and again ran in both ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine''. Wagner had been laying the foundations for this story for several years, introducing the main villain, semi-robotic gang lord Nero Narcos, and supporting characters like [[Judge Edgar]] of the Public Surveillance Unit, and [[Galen DeMarco]], a former judge who had quit after falling in love with Dredd and become a private eye.\n\n1999 also saw the return of another character, ''Nemesis the Warlock''. After a break of ten years, writer Pat Mills decided to bring the story to an end with \"The Final Conflict\". The series was drawn by [[Henry Flint]] in a style that recalled Kevin O'Neill's early work on the series, as well as Simon Bisley's ''ABC Warriors'' work.\n\nThe decade ended with a special 100-page issue called \"Prog 2000\". Behind a cover by Brian Bolland, ''Nemesis'' wrapped up for good in a final episode drawn by Kevin O'Neill. War broke out in ''Nikolai Dante'', and writer [[Gordon Rennie]] and artist [[Mark Harrison (artist)|Mark Harrison]] introduced future war story ''Glimmer Rats''. Another old favourite, ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', was revived by Wagner and Ezquerra, telling new stories of Johnny Alpha set before his death, with the conceit that previous stories had been \"folklore\" and the new stories were \"what really happened\", allowing Wagner to revise continuity.\n\n===2000s===\nThe publisher has been owned by [[Rebellion Developments]] since 2000, with editors [[Andy Diggle]] and [[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]] at the helm. Rebellion continues to develop stories (and computer games) based on classic characters such as ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' and ''[[Judge Dredd]]'', and has also introduced a roster of new series including ''[[Shakara]]'', ''[[The Red Seas]]'' and ''[[Caballistics, Inc.]]''. It has also published a tie-in to the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' in a story written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]].\n\nThe comic continues to uncover new British talents, including [[Boo Cook]], [[Dom Reardon]] and [[Al Ewing]]. It has also benefited from an improved dollar-pound [[exchange rate]] that has meant the comic can now afford to re-employ some of the talent thought lost to America.\n\nA number of shorter self-contained stories, partly created by the new wave of talent, have run including ''[[London Falling]]'', ''[[Stone Island (2000AD)|Stone Island]]'' and ''[[Zombo (comics)|Zombo]]''. Other developments include a revamping of the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' which has included a section acting as a showcase for [[British small press comics]]. Starting in program 1500 was the Judge Dredd story \"The Connection\", a 'prelude' to a 23-part Judge Dredd epic \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" which filled in a lot of the details about Dredd's past.\n\nIn prog 1526,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=prog&page=profiles&choice=1526 |title=Prog 1526 |publisher=2000ad.org |date=28 February 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref> dated 28 February 2007, ''2000 AD'' celebrated their 30th anniversary.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6390731.stm 30 years of the future], [[BBC]], 26 February 2007</ref> The issue saw the start of two new storylines: ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'' (by [[Robbie Morrison]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]) and ''[[Invasion!

In the same year, former editor Steve MacManus published his memoirs.\n\nIn 2017, founding editor Pat Mills published his memoirs, ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History''. Later in that year, [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette Partworks]] began publishing ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]'', an 80-volume fortnightly series of hardback books featuring classic stories from the first 40 years of the comic. This followed the success of ''[[Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection]]'', which had started in 2015 and later been extended to 90 volumes.\n\nIn June 2018 (July in the United States) a special issue was published, the ''2000 AD Sci-Fi Special 2018'', which contained stories written and illustrated entirely by women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/20/the-futures-female-2000ads-all-women-special \"The future's female? 2000AD's all-women special\"], by David Barnett, in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 June 2018.</ref>\n\n==Lists of stories==\n{{Main|List of 2000 AD stories}}\n*A complete index of stories published in ''2000 AD'' from February 1977 to December 2019 (#1 to #2162) is [[Media:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]] (WikiCommons).<ref>[[commons:File:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n*A more detailed list of all the ''Judge Dredd'' stories to appear in ''2000 AD'' (including specials and annuals) from March 1977 to December 2019 can be found [[Media:Dredd2AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]].<ref>[[commons:File:Dredd2AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n\n==Crossovers==\n{{main|2000 AD crossovers}}\nAlthough there is no overall [[shared universe]] containing all ''2000 AD'' stories, some stories [[2000 AD crossovers|spin-off or crossover]] into other stories. These include the numerous stories that occur in the [[Judge Dredd|Judge Dredd universe]]. Many stories by [[Pat Mills]], which are frequently interlinked, link into the Dredd universe as well, though have been partially [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] by the writer. Many stories written by [[Ian Edginton]] feature shared themes and references.\n\n==Editors==\n{{Main|Tharg the Mighty}}\nA long-running theme is that the [[editing|editor]] of ''2000 AD'' is [[Tharg the Mighty]], a green [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] from [[Betelgeuse]] who terms his readers \"Earthlets\". Tharg uses other unique alien expressions and even appears in his own comic strips. Readers sometimes play along with this; for example, in prog 201 a pair of readers wrote to Tharg claiming that they preferred to be called \"Terrans\"; the resulting controversy ended in Tharg allowing readers to vote for the preferred term in prog 229.  In prog 240 Tharg announced that the result was a draw, and \"Terran\" became an accepted term for readers' letters in the Nerve Centre.  In similar vein, Tharg used to draw distinction between male and female letter-writers with \"Eathlet\" and \"Earthlette\" until a letter was printed in Prog 314 complaining about the use, and Tharg agreed to use \"Earthlet\" (or \"Terran\") regardless of gender.  From prog 531 the term \"Earthlette\" was reintroduced.<ref>Prog 531, 18 July 1987 \u2013 \"Earthlette H Maton\"</ref>\n\nAnother running theme is Tharg's use of [[robot]]s to draw and write the strips, which bear a marked resemblance to the actual writers and artists. A fictional reason for Tharg to use mechanical assistance was given when the robots \"went on strike\" (reflecting real-life [[industrial action]] that occasionally halted IPC's comics production during the 1970s and 1980s). Tharg wrote and drew a whole issue himself, but when he ran it through the quality-control \"Thrill-meter\", the device melted down on extreme overload. The offending issue had to be taken away, by blindfolded security guards, to a lead-lined vault where there was no danger of anyone seeing it accidentally.\n<section begin=tharg />\nThe role of Tharg has been performed by the following editors:\n\n#[[Pat Mills]], #1\u201316 (1977)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=patm Pat Mills] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Kelvin Gosnell]], #17\u201385 (1977\u20131978)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=KELVING Kelvin Gosnell] at 2000ad.org</ref><br/>Assistant editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the comic himself in 1978 while Gosnell was occupied with editing new sister title ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]''.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\"/>\n#[[Steve MacManus]], #86\u2013519 (1978\u20131987)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=STEVEM Steve MacManus] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]], #520\u2013872 (1987\u20131994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=RICHARDB Richard Burton] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Alan McKenzie]], #873\u2013914 (1994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ALANMC Alan McKenzie] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]], #915\u2013977 (1994\u20131996)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=JOHNT John Tomlinson] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]], #978\u20131199 (1996\u20132000)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=DAVEB David Bishop (writer)|] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Andy Diggle]], #1200\u20131273 (2000\u20132002)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ANDYD Andy Diggle] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]], #1274\u2013present (2002\u2013present)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=MATTS Matt Smith] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n<section end=tharg />\n\n==Contributors==\n[[File:Drandquinch.jpg|thumb|200px|''D.R and Quinch'', art by [[Alan Davis]].]]\nWell known contributors to ''2000 AD'' include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[Nick Abadzis]]\n* [[Dan Abnett]]\n* [[Massimo Belardinelli]]\n* [[Simon Bisley]]\n* [[Brian Bolland]]\n* [[Philip Bond]]\n* [[Chris Cunningham]]\n* [[Alan Davis]]\n* [[Steve Dillon]]\n* [[D'Israeli (cartoonist)|D'Israeli]]\n* [[Ian Edginton]]\n* [[Garth Ennis]]\n* [[Al Ewing]]\n* [[Carlos Ezquerra]]\n* [[Gerry Finley-Day]]\n* [[Michael Fleisher]]\n* [[Henry Flint]]\n* [[Tom Frame (letterer)|Tom Frame]]\n* [[Neil Gaiman]]\n* [[Dave Gibbons]]\n* [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]\n* [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]\n* [[Trevor Hairsine]]\n* [[Jamie Hewlett]]\n* [[John Hicklenton]]\n* [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]]\n* [[David Hine]]\n* [[Frazer Irving]]\n* [[Jock (comics)|Jock]]\n* [[Cam Kennedy]]\n* [[Brendan McCarthy]]\n* [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]\n* [[Mark Millar]]\n* [[Peter Milligan]]\n* [[Pat Mills]]\n* [[Alan Moore]]\n* [[Grant Morrison]]\n* [[Robbie Morrison]]\n* [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]\n* [[Arthur Ranson]]\n* [[Gordon Rennie]]\n* [[John Ridgway (comics)|John Ridgway]]\n* [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]]\n* [[Ron Smith (comics)|Ron Smith]]\n* [[Simon Spurrier]]\n* [[Richard Starkings]]\n* [[Bryan Talbot]]\n* [[John Wagner]]\n* [[Kev Walker]]\n* [[Chris Weston]]\n{{colend}}\nMany of these have since moved on to work for American publishers such as [[DC Comics]] (especially the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] and [[Wildstorm]] imprints) and [[Marvel Comics]].\n\n==Film and TV adaptations==\n* ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Dredd]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Rogue Trooper#Film|Rogue Trooper]]'' (TBA)<ref>{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=McMillan|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/duncan-jones-teases-rogue-trooper-movie-1127099|title=Duncan Jones Teases 'Rogue Trooper' Movie|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=15 July 2018|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref>\n*''[[Judge Dredd#Television|Judge Dredd: Mega-City One]] (TBA)\n\n==Video game adaptations==\n2000AD video games for 8-bit computers include games based on [[Strontium Dog]] by [[Quicksilva]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984, ''Nemesis the Warlock'' and ''Sl\u00e1ine'' by [[Martech]] in 1987, ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' written by [[Design Design]] / published by ''Piranha'' in 1986 and ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] in 1990, all released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] platforms.

to ''2000 AD'' is the monthly  ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', which originally focused exclusively on expanding the world of Judge Dredd, but in recent years has expanded its focus to include other stories set in other universes as well.\n* The bimonthly ''2000 AD Extreme Edition'' presented reprints of classic and hard-to-find 2000AD stories, but poor sales led to its cancellation in mid-2008. Since the cancellation, a smaller reprint supplement has been packaged with the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' instead.\n*''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' was a weekly title (originally intended to be monthly) launched in 1978 following much the same format as ''2000 AD'' and included ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'' which introduced characters that would later reappear in ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. The two titles were merged later the same year and published as ''2000AD and Starlord''. A third ''Starlord'' series, ''TimeQuake'', also had a 4-week run in ''2000AD'' over a year later.\n*''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'' was a weekly title launched in 1979. There was less emphasis on Science Fiction series. It was merged with ''2000 AD'' after 22 issues, transferring the strips ''[[Blackhawk (UK comic)|Blackhawk]]'', ''The Mind of Wolfie Smith'' and ''Captain Klep''. For a while the publication was titled ''2000 AD and Tornado''.\n*''[[Diceman (comics)|Diceman]]'' was an early attempt at creating a [[role-playing]] comic featuring regular ''2000 AD'' characters such as Rogue Trooper and Slaine, as well as original characters, like Diceman. The magazine was not a success and only lasted five issues.\n*''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'' (1988\u20131991) was a sister publication that did not follow the format of ''2000 AD'', but did share many editorial staff and creative teams. Early issues featured two SF-themed stories aimed at a slightly older age group than ''2000 AD'' with strong political themes. It became a magnet for British creators who wanted to create comics for the adult market. The ''2000 AD'' series ''Finn'', begun the year after ''Crisis'' was cancelled, continued the adventures of the character from ''Third World War'', though with more of a fantasy emphasis.\n*''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]'' (1990\u20131991) joined ''Crisis'' though it only lasted for seven issues. Dan Dare was in the original line-up, and this transferred to ''Crisis'' when ''Revolver'' finished.\n*''[[Toxic!]]'' was a short-lived rival publication, established by ''2000 AD'' talent, that was published during 1991.\n*A ''Best of 2000 AD'' title was published in the mid-1980s which featured reprint material from early issues of ''2000 AD''. In the early 1990s, ''The Complete Judge Dredd'' began publication in a similar format. Both titles were relaunched as ''Classic 2000AD'' and ''Classic Judge Dredd'' in the mid-1990s but were cancelled soon after.\n*A yearly hardcover annual was published from 1977 to 1990 (though the cover dates on the annuals were always the following year). From 1991 this was replaced by a softcover ''2000AD Yearbook''; the last of these was published in 1994. There were also annuals/yearbooks dedicated to ''2000 AD'' characters such as ''Dan Dare'' (1978\u20131979, cover dated 1979\u20131980), ''Judge Dredd'' (1980\u20131994) and ''Rogue Trooper'' (1990).\n* An annual summer special was published during the summer months between 1977 and 1996, entitled the ''2000AD Sci-Fi Special'' from 1978. This was revived in 2014.\n* Other specials include the ''2000AD Winter Special'' (1988\u20131995, 2005 and 2014), ''Judge Dredd Mega Special'' (1988\u20131996) and ''Rogue Trooper Action Special'' (1996). (1996's ''Judge Dredd Action Special'' was a tie-in to the defunct ''Judge Dredd: Lawman of the Future'' rather than ''2000AD'' proper).\n* In April 1992, a ''2000AD Action Special'' featured six strips reviving classic British comics characters such as the [[Steel Claw]]. Of these only ''Kelly's Eye'' also appeared in ''2000 AD'' proper.\n* In the mid-1990s a series of ''2000 AD Poster Progs'' were published, each featuring a new strip. There were five ''Judge Dredd'' poster magazines, plus one each for four other ''2000 AD'' series: ''Nemesis the Warlock'', ''Strontium Dogs'', ''Sl\u00e1ine'' and ''Rogue Trooper''.\n* A series of American comic format reprints started in 1983 by [[Eagle Comics]] with the first issue of an ongoing monthly ''Judge Dredd'' title. Eagle Comics also reprinted other ''2000 AD'' material in other titles. The license to reprint ''2000 AD'' material in the US was later taken over by [[Quality Communications|Quality Comics]]. These reprints ended in the early 1990s.\n\n===Fanzines===\n''2000 AD'' has an extremely lively and thriving [[Fan (aficionado)|fanbase]], which has produced a number of independent [[fanzine]]s.\n\nBetween 1994\u201396, \"Fear The Badge\" was an erstwhile but overly ambitious attempt at a ''2000 AD'' fanzine based around the Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog and Robo-hunter universes. With original artwork, stories and articles, the fanzine would act as a showcase for talent wanting to break into comics.\nIts editor/creator, Paul Dick, partially disabled himself, wanted to donate some of the zine's profits to a different disability charity each month. However, the fanzine's genesis was plagued by bad luck, not least of all Dick's health worsening. Despite the good intentions and hardwork of its creator (as well as the keen interest and support from both amateur and professional ''2000 AD'' contributors), the fanzine's full potential sadly never was realised. Only a dummy run of 50 copies of issue 1 were ever produced.\n\nIn 1998 W.R. Logan, frustrated at the lack of activity from the comic's publishers both in promoting the title and also in making best use of new talents, decided to create an independent title using ''2000 AD'' copyrighted characters and situations. This was titled ''[[Class of '79]]'', named after the year of Dredd's graduation from the Academy of Law \u2013 2079. The first couple of issues contained work from now-professional comics creators [[Rufus Dayglo]], [[Boo Cook]], [[Henry Flint]] and [[PJ Holden]] and won the best Self Published/Independent Comic Award at the 1999 National Comics Awards.\n\nIn 2001, [[Andrew J. Lewis (comics)|Andrew J. Lewis]] created ''[[Zarjaz]]'' comic, with strips featuring characters from a variety of ''2000 AD'' stories. There were also interviews with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], [[Frazer Irving]] and [[Alan Moore]], as well as an extensive article on breaking into comics as a writer.\n\nAnother long-running fanzine, dedicated to the world of Johnny Alpha, is ''[[Dogbreath]]'', originally run by the pseudonymous Dr Bob it is now being produced by FutureQuake Publishing. In 2003, [[Arthur Wyatt (comics)|Arthur Wyatt]] created ''[[FutureQuake]]'', a fanzine devoted to the [[Future Shocks]] format. Although ''Class of '79'' now appears to be on hiatus, all three of the other titles are in continuous publication, ''Zarjaz'' having started up again with a new issue 1.\n\nIn addition, a number of [[British small press comics|small press]] comics have emerged from the ''2000 AD'' fanbase, including ''[[Solar Wind (comic)|Solar Wind]]'', ''Omnivistascope'' and ''[[The End Is Nigh]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of 2000 AD stories]]\n*[[List of minor 2000 AD stories]]\n*''[[Action (comic)|Action]]''\n*[[British comics]]\n*[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]], which saw a number of ''2000 AD'' artists and writers working for the big American firms during the 1980s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n*[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] (2002\u20132003), ''[[Thrill Power Overload]]!''

He was born in [[Denton Burn]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], but now lives in [[Chester-le-Street]], [[County Durham]]. His other occupation during his refereeing career was as a [[Telecommunication]]s [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]], and he now works for [[the Football Association]] as a [[region]]al [[Management|manager]] for referees in [[North East England]].<ref>[http://www.thefa.com/GrassrootsNew/Referee/FAMOA/Postings/2006/06/12013 Regional Refereeing Manager (North East)] for the Football Association: [[The Football Association|TheFA.com]] Official website.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nWilkie became a Class 3 referee in 1977, at the age of 26,<sup>\u2020</sup> when a serious knee injury meant him having to give up playing football in local leagues. In 1981<sup>\u2020</sup> he was selected as a [[Assistant referee (association football)|linesman]] for the [[Northern League (football)|Northern League]],<ref name=\"northernecho\">[http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2002/11/15/114514.html More biographical detail]: article at ''The Northern Echo'' website.</ref> and went on to referee in that league a year later. In 1984, he was appointed to the list of linesmen for [[the Football League]], then became a supplementary referee for that league in 1985. He was further promoted to the full Football League list in 1988. His first match after this promotion was in the old [[Football League Third Division]] on 27 August 1988, the game between [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] and [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], which finished 1-1.<sup>\u2020</sup>\n\nIn September 1987 he had been given duties as linesman for a [[UEFA Cup]] match in [[Dundee]], and in 1991 was selected to run the line for [[Keith Hackett]] in the [[European Cup 1990-91|European Cup]] [[semi-final]] first leg at the [[Stade V\u00e9lodrome]] between [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]. This finished 3-1, with Marseille progressing to the Final after the second leg. Wilkie would step up to handle his first European game as referee in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] tie between [[A.C. Ancona|Ancona]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]] in November 1993.<sup>\u2020</sup>\n\nHe was included in the list of [[Premier League]] referees towards the end of the [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93 season]], handling his first game in that competition (and sending off his first Premiership player, the away side's [[Tony Cascarino]]) on 24 March 1993, when [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] drew 1-1 at home to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Elland Road]].<ref>[http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=300767 First ever Premiership match], Leeds v.

Wilkie at the time had no idea what had gone on, as he was talking to United's [[Andrew Cole|Andy Cole]] at the time: \"It was only in the dressing room that one of the assistants told me what he (Cantona) had done.\"<ref name=\"northernecho\" />\n\nAt the end of that season, on 6 May 1995, Wilkie found it necessary to report the entire [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] team, including its substitutes, after a \"mass protest\" following the award of a [[Penalty kick (football)|penalty]] to Leeds United in the 80th minute of a match which would determine whether City were relegated from the Premier League or not. If successful, the spot kick would mean that a draw was likely, not enough for Norwich to stay up.

One of the leading Ukrainian institutions for higher education, it was founded in 1875 as the '''Franz-Josephs-Universit\u00e4t Czernowitz''' when Chernivtsi (Czernowitz) was the capital of the [[Duchy of Bukovina]], a [[Cisleithania]]n crown land of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Today the university is based at the [[Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans]] building complex, a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] since 2011.\n\n==History==\nIn 1775, the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] had obtained the territory of [[Bukovina]], which from 1786 was administrated within the Chernivtsi district of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]]. Under the rule of Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the sparsely populated territory was settled by [[Germans|German]] colonists, mainly from [[Danube Swabians|Swabia]]. Together with the Austrian administrative officials they formed a separate population group and by the late 19th century, several institutes of higher education arose with the [[German language]] of instruction, including ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasien]]'' in Chernivtsi and [[Suceava]]. As the graduates still had to leave Bukovina to study in the western parts of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the local administration developed plans to found an own university.\n\n===Franz-Josephs-Universit\u00e4t===\n[[File:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0446\u0456.jpg|thumb|Archiepiscopal residence, postcard, {{circa|1900}}]]\n{{See also|Franz Joseph University (disambiguation)}}\nIn 1866, the [[Austrian Empire]] had lost the [[Austro-Prussian War|war against Prussia]] ending the [[German Confederation]], followed by the foundation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871. In turn, the Habsburg emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] concentrated on strength and displays of power in his eastern crown lands. Plans for a Germanophone university were modelled on the 1872 establishment of the Stra\u00dfburg ''[[University of Strasbourg|Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]]'', named after German Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], in annexed [[Alsace-Lorraine]].\n\nAfter the [[Lviv University]] had declared [[Polish language|Polish]] teaching language in 1871, a Bukovina committee led by the jurist and [[Liberalism in Austria|liberal]] politician Constantin Tomashchuk (1840\u20131889), a member of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]], called for the foundation of a German college in multilingual Czernowitz about {{convert|740|km|mi}} \"beyond\" [[Vienna]]. In 1874 they addressed a petition to the Austrian Minister of Education [[Karl Ritter von Stremayr|Karl von Stremayr]], on whose proposal Emperor Francis Joseph finally resolved upon the establishment of a university, decided on by the two houses of the Imperial Council on 13 and 20 March 1875. Other cities applying for the creation of a college, such as [[Trieste]], [[Olomouc]], [[Brno]], [[Ljubljana]] or [[Salzburg]], were left empty-handed\n\nOne hundred years after the affiliation of Bukovina to the Austrian monarchy, the ''Franz-Josephs-Universit\u00e4t'' was inaugurated on 4 October 1875 (the name day of the emperor) on the basis of the Czernowitz Higher Theological School and Constantin Tomashchuk was appointed its first [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. The ensemble of the Residence, combining elements of national, Byzantine, Gothic and Baroque architecture, is an outstanding example of 19th century historicist architecture, design and planning, expressing the cultural identity of the Orthodox Church within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1330/|title=Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the main language of instruction was [[German language|German]] with separate departments for [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and literature.{{fact|date=June 2019}} German was the primary language even though the region it was located in, Bukovina, was not German-speaking, and other Austro-Hungarian universities outside of German-speaking areas were shifting away from German-medium teaching.<ref name=\"StraussPT196197\">Strauss, Johann. \"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire\" (Chapter 7).

To pursue the study of medicine, the Bukovina graduates still had to go to Lviv or to the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n\nThough the general language of instruction was German, professorships on [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Ruthenian language]] were also established. At the time of Austro-Hungarian rule, the majority of the Czernowitz students were [[Jews|Jewish]] and German Austrians, while [[Ukrainians]] and [[Romanians]] comprised for about 20%&ndash;25% of the student body. At times, there were more than 40 German, Ukrainian, Romanian, Polish, Jewish, and Catholic fraternities (''[[Studentenverbindung]]en'') in the city, reflecting its lingual and religious diversity.\n\nIn [[World War I]], Czernowitz on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] was embattled by [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Imperial Russian Army|Imperial Russian]] forces, severely affecting the university. Nevertheless, plans for a relocation to Salzburg in the west met with protests by academics like [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]. In June 1918 teaching activities were resumed upon the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]].\n\n===Universitatea Regele Carol I===\nAfter the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, Bukovina became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the university was renamed ''Universitatea [[Carol I of Romania|Regele Carol I]] din Cern\u0103u\u0163i''. The current building of the university dates from 1920&ndash;22, and was commissioned by the Romanian government. From 1919 to 1940 the university was largely [[Romanianization|Romanized]]; the Ukrainian department was abolished, Ukrainian professors were dismissed and instruction was fully switched to [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. In 1933, of 3,247 students, there were 2,117 Romanians, 679 Jews, 199 Germans, 155 Ukrainians (decreasing from 239 out of 1671 students in 1920), 57 Poles, 26 Russians and 4 of other nationalities. [[Ion Nistor]], a prominent Romanian historian and one of the most vocal proponents of [[Greater Romania]]n nationalism was the university rector for many years.\n\n===Chernivtsi State University===\nUpon the 1940 [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet takeover of northern Bukovina]], the territory was attached to the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the primary language in the university was switched to [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].  At that time the original shaped wooden ceiling of the Synod Hall was lost to fire and was replaced in the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1330/|title=Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> The roof has been gradually replaced using quality colour-glazed roof tiles manufactured according to the original patterns and imported from Austria. The change of function of the ensemble, initially being the Residence of Metropolitans and becoming a university did not unduly affect its authenticity.   \n\nThe university, renamed ''Chernivtsi State University'', was significantly expanded and reorganized. In 1976-1977, the university had 10,000 students and about 500 teachers, 26 specialists and doctors of sciences, about 290 associate professors and candidates of sciences.  Teaching of science was greatly increased and the theological department was dissolved and then reopened in 1996.

One of the leading Ukrainian institutions for higher education, it was founded in 1875 as the '''Franz-Josephs-Universit\u00e4t Czernowitz''' when Chernivtsi (Czernowitz) was the capital of the [[Duchy of Bukovina]], a [[Cisleithania]]n crown land of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Today the university is based at the [[Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans]] building complex, a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] since 2011.\n\n==History==\nIn 1775, the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] had obtained the territory of [[Bukovina]], which from 1786 was administrated within the Chernivtsi district of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]]. Under the rule of Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the sparsely populated territory was settled by [[Germans|German]] colonists, mainly from [[Danube Swabians|Swabia]]. Together with the Austrian administrative officials they formed a separate population group and by the late 19th century, several institutes of higher education arose with the [[German language]] of instruction, including ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasien]]'' in Chernivtsi and [[Suceava]]. As the graduates still had to leave Bukovina to study in the western parts of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the local administration developed plans to found an own university.\n\n===Franz-Josephs-Universit\u00e4t===\n[[File:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0446\u0456.jpg|thumb|Archiepiscopal residence, postcard, {{circa|1900}}]]\n{{See also|Franz Joseph University (disambiguation)}}\nIn 1866, the [[Austrian Empire]] had lost the [[Austro-Prussian War|war against Prussia]] ending the [[German Confederation]], followed by the foundation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871. In turn, the Habsburg emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] concentrated on strength and displays of power in his eastern crown lands. Plans for a Germanophone university were modelled on the 1872 establishment of the Stra\u00dfburg ''[[University of Strasbourg|Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]]'', named after German Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], in annexed [[Alsace-Lorraine]].\n\nAfter the [[Lviv University]] had declared [[Polish language|Polish]] teaching language in 1871, a Bukovina committee led by the jurist and [[Liberalism in Austria|liberal]] politician Constantin Tomashchuk (1840\u20131889), a member of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]], called for the foundation of a German college in multilingual Czernowitz about {{convert|740|km|mi}} \"beyond\" [[Vienna]]. In 1874 they addressed a petition to the Austrian Minister of Education [[Karl Ritter von Stremayr|Karl von Stremayr]], on whose proposal Emperor Francis Joseph finally resolved upon the establishment of a university, decided on by the two houses of the Imperial Council on 13 and 20 March 1875. Other cities applying for the creation of a college, such as [[Trieste]], [[Olomouc]], [[Brno]], [[Ljubljana]] or [[Salzburg]], were left empty-handed\n\nOne hundred years after the affiliation of Bukovina to the Austrian monarchy, the ''Franz-Josephs-Universit\u00e4t'' was inaugurated on 4 October 1875 (the name day of the emperor) on the basis of the Czernowitz Higher Theological School and Constantin Tomashchuk was appointed its first [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. The ensemble of the Residence, combining elements of national, Byzantine, Gothic and Baroque architecture, is an outstanding example of 19th century historicist architecture, design and planning, expressing the cultural identity of the Orthodox Church within the Austro-Hungarian Empire<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1330/|title=Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>.\n\nOriginally, the main language of instruction was [[German language|German]] with separate departments for [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and literature.{{fact|date=June 2019}} German was the primary language even though the region it was located in, Bukovina, was not German-speaking, and other Austro-Hungarian universities outside of German-speaking areas were shifting away from German-medium teaching.<ref name=\"StraussPT196197\">Strauss, Johann. \"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire\" (Chapter 7).

To pursue the study of medicine, the Bukovina graduates still had to go to Lviv or to the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n\nThough the general language of instruction was German, professorships on [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Ruthenian language]] were also established. At the time of Austro-Hungarian rule, the majority of the Czernowitz students were [[Jews|Jewish]] and German Austrians, while [[Ukrainians]] and [[Romanians]] comprised for about 20%&ndash;25% of the student body. At times, there were more than 40 German, Ukrainian, Romanian, Polish, Jewish, and Catholic fraternities (''[[Studentenverbindung]]en'') in the city, reflecting its lingual and religious diversity.\n\nIn [[World War I]], Czernowitz on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] was embattled by [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Imperial Russian Army|Imperial Russian]] forces, severely affecting the university. Nevertheless, plans for a relocation to Salzburg in the west met with protests by academics like [[Eugen Ehrlich]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]. In June 1918 teaching activities were resumed upon the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]].\n\n===Universitatea Regele Carol I===\nAfter the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, Bukovina became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the university was renamed ''Universitatea [[Carol I of Romania|Regele Carol I]] din Cern\u0103u\u0163i''. The current building of the university dates from 1920&ndash;22, and was commissioned by the Romanian government. From 1919 to 1940 the university was largely [[Romanianization|Romanized]]; the Ukrainian department was abolished, Ukrainian professors were dismissed and instruction was fully switched to [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. In 1933, of 3,247 students, there were 2,117 Romanians, 679 Jews, 199 Germans, 155 Ukrainians (decreasing from 239 out of 1671 students in 1920), 57 Poles, 26 Russians and 4 of other nationalities. [[Ion Nistor]], a prominent Romanian historian and one of the most vocal proponents of [[Greater Romania]]n nationalism was the university rector for many years.\n\n===Chernivtsi State University===\nUpon the 1940 [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet takeover of northern Bukovina]], the territory was attached to the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the primary language in the university was switched to [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].  At that time the original shaped wooden ceiling of the Synod Hall was lost to fire and was replaced in the 1950s<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1330/|title=Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>. The roof has been gradually replaced using quality colour-glazed roof tiles manufactured according to the original patterns and imported from Austria. The change of function of the ensemble, initially being the Residence of Metropolitans and becoming a university did not unduly affect its authenticity.   \n\nThe university, renamed ''Chernivtsi State University'', was significantly expanded and reorganized. In 1976-1977, the university had 10,000 students and about 500 teachers, 26 specialists and doctors of sciences, about 290 associate professors and candidates of sciences.  Teaching of science was greatly increased and the theological department was dissolved and then reopened in 1996. In 1989 the university was named to honor [[Yuriy Fedkovych]], a prominent [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian writer]], a native of [[Bukovina]]. In the Soviet years, the number of Romanian students at the university declined sharply. In 1991&ndash;92, the last year of Soviet rule, the number of Romanian students was only 4.44% (434 out of 9,769).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID%3D149%26document%3D19. |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027141344/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&document=19. |archivedate=2007-10-27 }}</ref> Among teaching faculty, the breakdown by nationalities is as follows: Ukrainian teachers 465 (77.1%), Russians 102 (16.9%), Moldovans 9 (1.4%), Romanians 7 (1.1%), Belarusians 6 (0.9%), etc.  \n\n===Yuriy Fedkovych Chernivtsi National University===\nSince 2000, when the university was awarded National status, it operates under its current name, ''Yuriy Fedkovych Chernivtsi National University''.\n\nBy decision of Session of Council of European University Association, held in Brussels on 15 January 2009, Yuriy Fedkovich Chernivtsi National University was granted a full individual membership in [[European University Association]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.chnu.edu.ua/university/facts-history-media/uni-history|title=http://en.chnu.edu.ua/university/facts-history-media/uni-history|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>.

The [[Extreme points of Russia|westernmost point of Russia]] is located on the Vistula Spit. The Polish part contains a number of tourist resorts, incorporated administratively as the town of [[Krynica Morska]].\n\n== History ==\nUntil the 13th century, the spit had navigable straits in the middle, which allowed the city of [[Elbing]], part of the [[monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]], direct access to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The natural closing of the straits in the late 13th century reduced Elbing's status as an important trading [[seaport]]. This and the [[Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)]] and [[Gda\u0144sk Pomerania|Polish Pomerania]] in 1308 led to the increased importance of [[Gda\u0144sk]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], it became the last holdout of the remaining German soldiers in East Prussia, although the Soviets simply bypassed the spit after the [[East Prussian Offensive]] was decisively concluded, training their sights on the more important goal of capturing [[Berlin]]. The last [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers laid down their arms after the [[German Instrument of Surrender]] was signed.\n\n===Kursenieki===\n{{details|Kursenieki}}\n[[Image:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|right|150px|Curonian-populated area in 1649]]\n\nWhile today the [[Kursenieki]], also known as Kur\u0161ininkai are a nearly extinct [[Balts|Baltic]] ethnic group living along the [[Curonian Spit]], in 1649 Kur\u0161ininkai settlement spanned from [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel (Klaip\u0117da)]] to [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)]]. The Kur\u0161ininkai were eventually assimilated by the [[Germans]], except along the Curonian Spit where some still live.

The border between [[Poland]] ([[Pomeranian Voivodeship]]) and [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], an exclave of [[Russia]], bisects it, [[Poland\u2013Russia border|politically dividing the spit in half between the two countries]]. The [[Extreme points of Russia|westernmost point of Russia]] is located on the Vistula Spit. The Polish part contains a number of tourist resorts, incorporated administratively as the town of [[Krynica Morska]].\n\n== History ==\nUntil the 13th century, the spit had navigable straits in the middle, which allowed the city of [[Elbing]], part of the [[monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]], direct access to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The natural closing of the straits in the late 13th century reduced Elbing's status as an important trading [[seaport]]. This and the [[Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)]] and [[Gda\u0144sk Pomerania|Polish Pomerania]] in 1308 led to the increased importance of [[Gda\u0144sk]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], it became the last holdout of the remaining German soldiers in East Prussia, although the Soviets simply bypassed the spit after the [[East Prussian Offensive]] was decisively concluded, training their sights on the more important goal of capturing [[Berlin]]. The last [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers laid down their arms after the [[German Instrument of Surrender]] was signed.\n\n===Kursenieki===\n{{details|Kursenieki}}\n[[Image:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|right|150px|Curonian-populated area in 1649]]\n\nWhile today the [[Kursenieki]], also known as Kur\u0161ininkai are a nearly extinct [[Balts|Baltic]] ethnic group living along the [[Curonian Spit]], in 1649 Kur\u0161ininkai settlement spanned from [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel (Klaip\u0117da)]] to [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig (Gda\u0144sk)]]. The Kur\u0161ininkai were eventually assimilated by the [[Germans]], except along the Curonian Spit where some still live.

{"title_page": "Virtual cinematography", "text_new": "{{3D computer graphics}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2017}}\n'''Virtual cinematography''' refers to the set of [[Cinematography|cinematographic]] techniques performed in a [[computer graphics]] environment. It includes a wide variety of subjects like [[Photograph|photographing]] real objects, often with [[Stereo camera|stereo]] or [[multi-camera setup]], for the purpose of recreating them as three-dimensional objects and [[Algorithm|algorithms]] for the automated creation of real and [[Computer simulation|simulated]] [[Camera angle|camera angles]]. Virtual cinematography can be used to shoot scenes from otherwise impossible camera angles, create the photography of animated films, and manipulate the appearance of computer-generated effects.\n\n==History==\n=== Early Stages ===\nAn early example of a film integrating a virtual environment is the 1998 film, [[What Dreams May Come (film)|''What Dreams May Come'']], starring [[Robin Williams]]. The film\u2019s special effects team used actual building blueprints to generate scale wireframe models that were then used to generate the virtual world.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Silberman|first=Steve|url=https://www.wired.com/2003/05/matrix2/|title=MATRIX2|date=2003-05-01|work=Wired|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-US|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> The film went on to garner numerous nominations and awards including the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and the [[ADG Excellence in Production Design Award|Art Directors Guild Award]] for Excellence in Production Design.<ref>{{Citation|title=What Dreams May Come - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/awards|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The term \"virtual cinematography\" emerged in 1999 when special effects artist [[John Gaeta]] and his team wanted to name the new cinematic technologies they had created.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040318114836/http://www.uemedia.net/CPC/vfxpro/article_7062.shtml|title=VFXPro - The Daily Visual Effects Resource|date=2004-03-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern Virtual Cinematography ===\n[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix trilogy]] ([[The Matrix|''The Matrix'']], [[The Matrix Reloaded|''The Matrix Reloaded'']], and [[The Matrix Revolutions|''The Matrix Revolutions'']]) used early Virtual Cinematography techniques to develop virtual \"filming\" of realistic computer-generated imagery. The result of John Gaeta and his crew at ESC Entertainment's work was the creation of photo-realistic CGI versions of the performers, sets, and actions. Their work was based on [[Paul Debevec]] et al.'s findings on the acquisition and subsequent simulation of the reflectance field over the human face acquired using the simplest of light stages in 2000.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/344779.344855|title=Acquiring the reflectance field of a human face {{!}} Proceedings of the 27th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques|website=dl.acm.org|language=EN|doi=10.1145/344779.344855|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Famous scenes that would have been impossible or exceedingly time consuming to produce within the context of traditional cinematography include the burly brawl in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' (2003) where [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] fights up-to-100 [[Agent Smith]]<nowiki/>s and the beginning of the final showdown in ''The Matrix Revolutions'' (2003), where Agent Smith's cheekbone gets punched in by Neo<ref>George Borshukov, Presented at Imagina\u201904.

[[Bill Pope]], the [[Cinematographer|Director of Photography]], used this tool in a much more subtle manner. Nonetheless, these scenes still managed to reach a high level of realism and made it difficult for the audience to notice that they were actually watching a shot created entirely by visual effects artists using 3D computer graphics tools.<ref>{{Citation|title=David Fincher - Invisible Details|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QChWIFi8fOY|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Spider-Man 2|''Spider-Man 2'']] (2004), the filmmakers manipulated the cameras to make the audience feel as if they are swinging together with [[Spider-Man]] through New York City. Using [[motion capture]] camera radar, the cameraman moves simultaneously with the displayed animation.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Virtual Cinematography|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YILJNoxKmVM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> This makes the audience experience Spider-Man's perspective and heightens the sense of reality. In [[Avengers: Infinity War|''Avengers: Infinity War'']] (2018), the Titan sequence scenes were created using virtual cinematography. To make the scene more realistic, the producers decided to shoot the entire scene again with a different camera so that it would travel according to the movement of the Titan.<ref>{{Citation|title=Avengers: Infinity War VFX {{!}} Breakdown - Cinematography {{!}} Weta Digital|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YviKYEqy6JI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The filmmakers produced what is known as a synthetic lens flare, making the flare very akin to originally produced footage. When the classic animated film [[The Lion King (2019 film)|''The'' ''Lion King'']] was remade in 2019, the producers used virtual cinematography to make a realistic animation. In the final battle scene between [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] and [[Simba]], the cameraman again moves the camera according to the movements of the characters.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Lion King - virtual cinematography and VFX|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw96ZN6e9vw|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The goal of this technology is to further immerse the audience in the scene.\n\n==Methods==\n=== Virtual Cinematography in Post-Production ===\nIn [[post-production]], advanced technologies are used to modify, re-direct, and enhance scenes captured on set. [[Stereo camera|Stereo]] or [[Multiple-camera setup|multi-camera setups]] photograph real objects in such a way that they can be recreated as 3D objects and algorithms. [[Motion capture]] equipment such as tracking dots and [[Helmet camera|helmet cameras]] can be used on set to facilitate the retroactive data collection in post-production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/the-de-aging-technology-that-could-change-acting-forever|title=The Irishman, Avengers: Endgame, and the De-aging Technology That Could Change Acting Forever|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Machine vision]] technology called [[photogrammetry]] uses [[3D scanning|3D scanners]] to capture 3D geometry. For example, the Arius 3D scanner used for the Matrix sequels was able to acquire details like fine wrinkles and skin pores as small as 100 \u00b5m<ref name=\":13\" />.\n\nFilmmakers have also experimented with [[Multiple-camera setup|multi-camera]] rigs to capture motion data without any on set motion capture equipment. For example, a m[[Motion capture#Markerless|arkerless motion capture]] and multi-camera setup photogrammetric capture technique called [[optical flow]] was used to make digital look-alikes for the Matrix movies<ref name=\":13\" />.\n\nMore recently, [[Martin Scorsese]]\u2019s crime film ''[[The Irishman]]'' utilized an entirely new [[Facial motion capture|facial capture]] system developed by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) that used a special rig consisting of two [[Digital camera|digital cameras]] positioned on both sides of the main camera to capture motion data in real time with the main performances.

It includes a wide variety of subjects like [[Photograph|photographing]] real objects, often with [[Stereo camera|stereo]] or [[multi-camera setup]], for the purpose of recreating them as three-dimensional objects and [[Algorithm|algorithms]] for the automated creation of real and [[Computer simulation|simulated]] [[Camera angle|camera angles]]. Virtual cinematography can be used to shoot scenes from otherwise impossible camera angles, create the photography of animated films, and manipulate the appearance of computer-generated effects.\n\n==History==\n=== Early Stages ===\nAn early example of a film integrating a virtual environment is the 1998 film, [[What Dreams May Come (film)|''What Dreams May Come'']], starring [[Robin Williams]]. The film\u2019s special effects team used actual building blueprints to generate scale wireframe models that were then used to generate the virtual world<ref>{{Cite news|last=Silberman|first=Steve|url=https://www.wired.com/2003/05/matrix2/|title=MATRIX2|date=2003-05-01|work=Wired|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-US|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>. The film went on to garner numerous nominations and awards including the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and the [[ADG Excellence in Production Design Award|Art Directors Guild Award]] for Excellence in Production Design<ref>{{Citation|title=What Dreams May Come - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/awards|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. The term \"virtual cinematography\" emerged in 1999 when special effects artist [[John Gaeta]] and his team wanted to name the new cinematic technologies they had created<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040318114836/http://www.uemedia.net/CPC/vfxpro/article_7062.shtml|title=VFXPro - The Daily Visual Effects Resource|date=2004-03-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>.\n\n=== Modern Virtual Cinematography ===\n[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix trilogy]] ([[The Matrix|''The Matrix'']], [[The Matrix Reloaded|''The Matrix Reloaded'']], and [[The Matrix Revolutions|''The Matrix Revolutions'']]) used early Virtual Cinematography techniques to develop virtual \"filming\" of realistic computer-generated imagery. The result of John Gaeta and his crew at ESC Entertainment's work was the creation of photo-realistic CGI versions of the performers, sets, and actions. Their work was based on [[Paul Debevec]] et al.'s findings on the acquisition and subsequent simulation of the reflectance field over the human face acquired using the simplest of light stages in 2000<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/344779.344855|title=Acquiring the reflectance field of a human face {{!}} Proceedings of the 27th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques|website=dl.acm.org|language=EN|doi=10.1145/344779.344855|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. Famous scenes that would have been impossible or exceedingly time consuming to produce within the context of traditional cinematography include the burly brawl in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' (2003) where [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] fights up-to-100 [[Agent Smith]]<nowiki/>s and the beginning of the final showdown in ''The Matrix Revolutions'' (2003), where Agent Smith's cheekbone gets punched in by Neo<ref>George Borshukov, Presented at Imagina\u201904.

[[Bill Pope]], the [[Cinematographer|Director of Photography]], used this tool in a much more subtle manner. Nonetheless, these scenes still managed to reach a high level of realism and made it difficult for the audience to notice that they were actually watching a shot created entirely by visual effects artists using 3D computer graphics tools<ref>{{Citation|title=David Fincher - Invisible Details|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QChWIFi8fOY|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>.\n\nIn [[Spider-Man 2|''Spider-Man 2'']] (2004), the filmmakers manipulated the cameras to make the audience feel as if they are swinging together with [[Spider-Man]] through New York City. Using [[motion capture]] camera radar, the cameraman moves simultaneously with the displayed animation<ref>{{Citation|title=The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Virtual Cinematography|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YILJNoxKmVM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. This makes the audience experience Spider-Man's perspective and heightens the sense of reality. In [[Avengers: Infinity War|''Avengers: Infinity War'']] (2018), the Titan sequence scenes were created using virtual cinematography. To make the scene more realistic, the producers decided to shoot the entire scene again with a different camera so that it would travel according to the movement of the Titan<ref>{{Citation|title=Avengers: Infinity War VFX {{!}} Breakdown - Cinematography {{!}} Weta Digital|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YviKYEqy6JI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. The filmmakers produced what is known as a synthetic lens flare, making the flare very akin to originally produced footage. When the classic animated film [[The Lion King (2019 film)|''The'' ''Lion King'']] was remade in 2019, the producers used virtual cinematography to make a realistic animation. In the final battle scene between [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] and [[Simba]], the cameraman again moves the camera according to the movements of the characters<ref>{{Citation|title=The Lion King - virtual cinematography and VFX|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw96ZN6e9vw|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. The goal of this technology is to further immerse the audience in the scene.\n\n==Methods==\n=== Virtual Cinematography in Post-Production ===\nIn [[post-production]], advanced technologies are used to modify, re-direct, and enhance scenes captured on set. [[Stereo camera|Stereo]] or [[Multiple-camera setup|multi-camera setups]] photograph real objects in such a way that they can be recreated as 3D objects and algorithms. [[Motion capture]] equipment such as tracking dots and [[Helmet camera|helmet cameras]] can be used on set to facilitate the retroactive data collection in post-production<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/the-de-aging-technology-that-could-change-acting-forever|title=The Irishman, Avengers: Endgame, and the De-aging Technology That Could Change Acting Forever|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>.\n\n[[Machine vision]] technology called [[photogrammetry]] uses [[3D scanning|3D scanners]] to capture 3D geometry. For example, the Arius 3D scanner used for the Matrix sequels was able to acquire details like fine wrinkles and skin pores as small as 100 \u00b5m<ref name=\":13\" />.\n\nFilmmakers have also experimented with [[Multiple-camera setup|multi-camera]] rigs to capture motion data without any on set motion capture equipment. For example, a m[[Motion capture#Markerless|arkerless motion capture]] and multi-camera setup photogrammetric capture technique called [[optical flow]] was used to make digital look-alikes for the Matrix movies<ref name=\":13\" />.\n\nMore recently, [[Martin Scorsese]]\u2019s crime film ''[[The Irishman]]'' utilized an entirely new [[Facial motion capture|facial capture]] system developed by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) that used a special rig consisting of two [[Digital camera|digital cameras]] positioned on both sides of the main camera to capture motion data in real time with the main performances.

[[Barboursville Vineyards]] served as a catalyst in the 1970s, alongside the now defunct Oakencroft Vineyards. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many other vineyards and wineries joined the mix and by 2009, over 163 wineries were operating in Virginia. By 2012 there were over 230 wineries operating in Virginia. Almost all of these are small, family-owned vineyards and wineries, and only the very largest have developed distribution networks. As a result, the wineries rely on wine tourism and direct sales for most of their revenue. To encourage visitors, they often play host to special events with music, food, and other activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginiawine.org/system/datas/370/original/Sommelier_India_Virginia.pdf?1355757621 |title=Realising Jefferson's Wine Vision |publisher=Sommelier India|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref>\nAs Virginia wines sold in Virginia have the requirement that the majority of the grapes used must be grown in Virginia, and since Virginia is not growing enough grapes to support the number of wineries, one Floyd County winery has expanded its operation in a five-year contract to export its wines to China.

[[Barboursville Vineyards]] served as a catalyst in the 1970s, alongside the now defunct Oakencroft Vineyards. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many other vineyards and wineries joined the mix and by 2009, over 163 wineries were operating in Virginia. By 2012 there were over 230 wineries operating in Virginia. Almost all of these are small, family-owned vineyards and wineries, and only the very largest have developed distribution networks. As a result, the wineries rely on wine tourism and direct sales for most of their revenue. To encourage visitors, they often play host to special events with music, food, and other activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginiawine.org/system/datas/370/original/Sommelier_India_Virginia.pdf?1355757621 |title=Realising Jefferson's Wine Vision |publisher=Sommelier India|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref>\nAs Virginia wines sold in Virginia have the requirement that the majority of the grapes used must be grown in Virginia, and since Virginia is not growing enough grapes to support the number of wineries, one Floyd County winery has expanded its operation in a five-year contract to export its wines to China.  Chateau Morrisette, with the help of Governor Bob McDonnell's office, will be exporting its Merlot to China, and plans to add other wines later.<ref>''[[The Roanoke Times]]'', July 7, 2013</ref>\n\n==Wine industry==\nA growing number of for-profit and non-profit organizations have been established since the 1980's to help promote Virginia Wine. Two of the more well known organizations are the [https://www.vwdc.org/ Virginia Vineyards Association] (VVA) and the [https://vawine.site-ym.com/ Virginia Wineries Association] (VWA). The state of Virginia has taken an active role in helping promote the wine industry in the state even to the extent of managing a state wide distributor company for Virginia wineries called [https://www.vwdc.org/ Virginia Winery Distribution Company] (VWDC) that was established by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vwdc.org/|title=Index {{!}} VWDC|website=www.vwdc.org|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>. The intent of the VWDC is to provide wholesale wine distribution services for Virginia farm wineries, many of which are too small to manage on their own. \n\nThe number of vineyards and wineries in Virginia grow each year. As of 2019 there are over 250 registered vineyards and wineries in the state.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Virginia Vineyards/Wineries <ref>{{Cite

With expansions in 1999, the camp property is now {{convert|454|acre|km2}} located on the eastern slope of Little North Mountain. The west side of the camp borders on the [[George Washington and Jefferson National Forests|George Washington National Forest]] and north, east and south sides bordering on agricultural areas of Swoope. A hunter access road runs through the camp. Three creeks run through the camp, supplying the small man-made Hope Lake. A portion of the new property on the north side has been placed into the [[CREP|Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program]] and is being restored from an agricultural to a natural state. The camp suffered major damage during the [[June 2012 North American derecho]], resulting in the temporary closure of the camp. Due to the fortunate circumstance of the entirety of the camp's staffers and attendees already being gathered in the dining hall, no one was injured.\n\nThe camp is primarily used by units within the council, but is available to other Scouting units and youth groups and is used year-round.\n\nCamp Shenandoah is recognized as a nationally accredited summer camp by BSA National Camp Accreditation Program.\n\n===Facilities===\nThe camp ranger has a house just outside the camp entrance. The camp office includes the health lodge where emergency health care is provided during summer camp. The dining hall seats up to 300 people and includes the kitchen and food storage facilities, a staff lounge and restrooms for visitors. The trading post is a camp store that sells snacks, souvenirs, craft materials, and other items during summer camp; attached is a storage room. The maintenance area includes the workshop, quartermaster storage, a shed for tractor and equipment storage, and equipment for the welding merit badge. The parade field provides an area where campers assemble for flag ceremonies and other activities. The Lockridge Chapel is open-air with benches for seating. The shower house has facilities for male and female, youth and adult campers. Water is provided from a well-fed water tower and sewage is processed on-site. There is a campfire ring by the lake that provides uncovered seating for the Sunday and Friday night campfires. There is also a campfire ring solely used for Order of the Arrow activities and ceremonies.\n\nThe camp has 14 tent campsites, each with running water and a latrine and most with a small pavilion. Unimproved areas are available for outpost camping. The 14<sup>th</sup> campsite, Ridgway, is considered \"primitive\" and guests must bring their own tents.\n\nThe Colonel Morris T. Warner, Jr. Rifle Range, the shotgun range and the archery range are located on OA Ridge; a separate black powder range can be set up as needed. As of 2015 handguns have been integrated, and concealed carry certification is offered to adults attending camp. The climbing area has a climbing tower and has high and low ropes courses, which are no longer in use due to old equipment. The waterfront has a swim area, canoes, and rowboats.\n\n===Summer camp===\nThe summer camp program provides opportunities for a range of [[merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badges]] in the areas of [[Scoutcraft]], [[Handicraft]], aquatics, nature, [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM,]] Timber Mountain, and shooting sports. Other programs include hikes to [[Elliott Knob]] and a high adventure program. Scout leaders can take supplemental training in aquatics and boating safety and CPR. New Scouts can participate in Timber Mountain, which is designed to help work towards First Class Scout.\n\n===Activities===\nThe camp has been used as a base for the [[Grindstone 100 Miler]] ultramarathon since 2008.\n\n===2009 Fire===\nIn the early morning of August 7, 2009, a fire destroyed the wooden trading post, killing one adult.

The west side of the camp borders on the [[George Washington and Jefferson National Forests|George Washington National Forest]] and north, east and south sides bordering on agricultural areas of Swoope. A hunter access road runs through the camp. Three creeks run through the camp, supplying the small man-made Hope Lake. A portion of the new property on the north side has been placed into the [[CREP|Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program]] and is being restored from an agricultural to a natural state. The camp suffered major damage during the [[June 2012 North American derecho]], resulting in the temporary closure of the camp. Due to the fortunate circumstance of the entirety of the camp's staffers and attendees already being gathered in the dining hall, no one was injured.\n\nThe camp is primarily used by units within the council, but is available to other Scouting units and youth groups and is used year-round.\n\nCamp Shenandoah is recognized as a nationally accredited summer camp by BSA National Camp Accreditation Program.\n\n===Facilities===\nThe camp ranger has a house just outside the camp entrance. The camp office includes the health lodge where emergency health care is provided during summer camp. The dining hall seats up to 300 people and includes the kitchen and food storage facilities, a staff lounge and restrooms for visitors. The trading post is a camp store that sells snacks, souvenirs, craft materials, and other items during summer camp; attached is a storage room. The maintenance area includes the workshop, quartermaster storage, a shed for tractor and equipment storage, and equipment for the welding merit badge. The parade field provides an area where campers assemble for flag ceremonies and other activities. The Lockridge Chapel is open-air with benches for seating. The shower house has facilities for male and female, youth and adult campers. Water is provided from a well-fed water tower and sewage is processed on-site. There is a campfire ring by the lake that provides uncovered seating for the Sunday and Friday night campfires. There is also a campfire ring solely used for Order of the Arrow activities and ceremonies.\n\nThe camp has 14 tent campsites, each with running water and a latrine and most with a small pavilion. Unimproved areas are available for outpost camping. The 14<sup>th</sup> campsite, Ridgway, is considered \"primitive\" and guests must bring their own tents.\n\nThe Colonel Morris T. Warner, Jr. Rifle Range, the shotgun range and the archery range are located on OA Ridge; a separate black powder range can be set up as needed. As of 2015 handguns have been integrated, and concealed carry certification is offered to adults attending camp. The climbing area has a climbing tower and has high and low ropes courses, which are no longer in use due to old equipment. The waterfront has a swim area, canoes, and rowboats.\n\n===Summer camp===\nThe summer camp program provides opportunities for a range of [[merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badges]] in the areas of [[Scoutcraft]], [[Handicraft]], aquatics, nature, [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM,]] Timber Mountain, and shooting sports. Other programs include hikes to [[Elliott Knob]] and a high adventure program. Scout leaders can take supplemental training in aquatics and boating safety and CPR. New Scouts can participate in Timber Mountain, which is designed to help work towards First Class Scout.\n\n===Activities===\nThe camp has been used as a base for the [[Grindstone 100 Miler]] ultramarathon since 2008.\n\n===2009 Fire===\nIn the early morning of August 7, 2009, a fire destroyed the wooden trading post, killing one adult. Since then, a new metal trading post has been built and no staff sleep in the building<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gonzalez |first=Tony |date=2009-08-07 |title=Camp Shenandoah blaze claims a life|journal=The News Virginian |url=http://www2.newsvirginian.com/wnv/news/local/swoope/article/camp_shenandoah_blaze_claims_a_life/43759/ |accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==Shenandoah Lodge==\n{{Infobox WorldScouting\n|name=Shenandoah Lodge\n|image=Shenandoah Lodge.png\n|imagesize=70px\n|location=\n|coords=\n|f-date=\n|defunct=\n|founders=\n|founder=\n|members=\n|chiefscouttitle=Lodge Chief\n|chiefscout=Eli Hattersley\n|chiefscouttitle2=Lodge Adviser\n|chiefscout2=Roger Burke\n|chiefscouttitle3=Staff Adviser\n|chiefscout3=Tom Greenwood\n|website={{URL|http://shenandoahlodge.org/}}\n|portal=no\n}}\nThe [[Order of the Arrow]] is represented by the Shenandoah Lodge.
