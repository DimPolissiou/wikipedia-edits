Inland posts [[Asleep by the frozen sea|were not built]] until 1774.

Called \"factories\" (because the \"[[Factor (agent)|factor]],\" i.e., a person acting as a mercantile agent did business from there), these posts operated in the manner of the Dutch fur trading operations in [[New Netherland]]s. By adoption of the Standard of Trade in the 18th century, the HBC ensured consistent pricing throughout Rupert's Land. A means of exchange arose based on the \"[[Made Beaver]]\" (MB); a prime pelt, worn for a year and ready for processing: \"the prices of all trade goods were set in values of Made Beaver (MB) with other animal pelts, such as squirrel, otter and moose quoted in their MB (made beaver) equivalents.

They established an extensive system of inland posts at native villages, and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region, learning their languages and often forming alliances through marriages with indigenous women. In March 1686, the French sent a [[Hudson Bay expedition (1686)|raiding party]] under the [[Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes|Chevalier des Troyes]] more than {{convert|1300|km|abbr=on}} to capture the HBC posts along James Bay. The French appointed [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], who had shown great heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts. In 1687 an English attempt to [[Battle of Fort Albany|resettle Fort Albany]] failed due to strategic deceptions by d'Iberville. After 1688 England and France [[King William's War|were officially at war]], and the conflict played out in North America as well. D'Iberville raided Fort Severn in 1690 but did not attempt to raid the well-defended local headquarters at York Factory.

On the way to the fort, he defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Hudson's Bay]] (5 September 1697), the largest naval battle in the history of the North American Arctic. D'Iberville's depleted French force captured York Factory by laying siege to the fort and pretending to be a much larger army. The French retained all of the outposts except Fort Albany until 1713.

Sayer, a [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] trapper and trader, was accused of illegal trading in furs. The Court of [[Assiniboia]] brought Sayer to trial, before a jury of HBC officials and supporters. During the trial, a crowd of armed M\u00e9tis men led by [[Louis Riel, Sr.]] gathered outside the courtroom. Although Sayer was found guilty of illegal trade, having evaded the HBC monopoly, Judge [[Adam Thom]] did not levy a fine or punishment. Some accounts attributed that to the intimidating armed crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, ''Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre!'' (\"Trade is free! Trade is free!\"), the M\u00e9tis loosened the HBC's previous control of the courts, which had enforced their monopoly on the settlers of Red River.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAnother factor was the findings of the [[Palliser Expedition]] of 1857 to 1860, led by Captain [[John Palliser]]. He surveyed the area of the prairies and wilderness from Lake Superior to the southern passes of the Rocky Mountains. Although he recommended against settlement of the region, the report sparked a debate. It ended the myth publicized by Hudson's Bay Company: that the Canadian West was unfit for agricultural settlement.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1863, the [[International Financial Society]] bought controlling interest in the HBC, signalling a shift in the company's outlook: most of the new shareholders were less interested in the fur trade than in real estate speculation and economic development in the West. The Society floated \u00a32 million in public shares on non-ceded land held ostensibly by the Hudson's Bay Company as an asset and leveraged this asset for collateral for these funds. These funds allowed the Society the financial means to weather the financial collapse of 1866 which destroyed many competitors and invest in railways in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb50-udfs|title=Records of the International Finance Society|work=Archives Hub|publisher=[[Jisc]]|accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SketchesGrizzly.jpeg|thumb|left|''A rough and tumble with a [[grizzly]]'' (Harry Bullock-Webster)]]\n\nIn 1869, after rejecting the American government offer of {{CAD|10,000,000}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/Politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405101925/http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/Politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2007 |title=John A.

In 1974, Hudson's Bay Company Archives (HBCA) were transferred from London and placed on deposit with the Manitoba archives in Winnipeg.

This hierarchy essentially broke down into two levels; the officers and the servants.  Comprising the officers were the factors, masters and chief traders, clerks and surgeons. The servants were the tradesmen, boatmen, and labourers. The officers essentially ran the fur trading posts.  They had many duties which included supervising the workers in their trade posts, valuing the furs, and keeping trade and post records.  In 1821, when Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company merged, the hierarchy became even stricter and the lines between officers and servants became virtually impossible to cross. Officers in charge of individual trading posts had much responsibility because they were directly in charge of enforcing the policies made by the governor and committee (the board) of the company. One of these policies was the price of particular furs and trade goods.  These prices were called the Official and Comparative Standards. [[Made Beaver|Made-Beaver]], the quality measurement of the pelt, was the means of exchange used by Hudson's Bay Company to define the Official and Comparative Standards. Because the governor was stationed in London, England, they needed to have reliable officers managing the trade posts halfway around the world. Because the fur trade was a very dynamic market, HBC needed to have some form of flexibility when dealing with prices and traders. Price fluctuation was deferred to the officers in charge of the trade posts, and the head office recorded any difference between the company's standard and that set by the individual officers. Overplus, or any excess revenue gained by officers was strictly documented to insure that it wasn't being pocketed and taken from the company. This strict yet flexible hierarchy exemplifies how Hudson's Bay Company was able to be so successful while still having its central management and trade posts located so far apart.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |first2=Frank D. |last2=Lewis |title=Indians, the Beaver, and the Bay: The Economics of Depletion in the Lands of Hudson's Bay Company, 1700\u20131763 |journal=Journal of Economic History |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=465\u2013494 |date=September 1993 |jstor=2122402 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700013450}}</ref><ref name=\"Judd\">{{cite journal |last=Judd |first=Carol |title=Native labour and social stratification in Hudson's Bay Company's Northern Department, 1770\u20131870 |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=305\u2013314 |date=November 1980 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.1980.tb00707.x }}</ref>\n\n;Hierarchichal order pre-1821<ref name=\"Judd\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\"\n! align=\"center\" width=\"50\" | #\n! align=\"center\" width=\"360\" | Job Title\n|-\n|||''' ''OFFICERS'' ''' \n|-\n| 1 || ''Chief Factor'' \n|-\n| 2|| ''Second'' [Factor] \n|-\n|3|| ''Master'' [of a trading station]\n|-\n| 4|| ''Sloopmaster'' <br /> ''Surgeon'' \n|-\n| 5|| ''Writer'' \n|-\n|6|| ''Apprentice'' \n|-\n|||''' ''SERVANTS'' ''' \n|-\n|1|| ''Tradesman'' <br /> ''Steersman'' \n|-\n|2|| ''Canoeman'' <br /> ''Bowsman'' \n|-\n|3|| ''Middleman''\n|-\n|4|| ''Labourer''  \n|}\n\n;Hierarchical order 1821\u20131871<ref name=\"Judd\"/><ref>Tach\u00e9, Alexandre Antonin & Cameron, Donald Roderick (1870).

The Bostonians agreed on the plan's merits but their speculative voyage in 1663 failed when their ship ran into [[Sea ice|pack ice]] in [[Hudson Strait]]. Boston-based English commissioner Colonel George Cartwright learned of the expedition and brought the two to England to raise financing.<ref name=\"Newman 64\"/> Radisson and Groseilliers arrived in London in 1665 at the height of the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]].

Inland posts [[Asleep by the frozen sea|were not built]] until 1774. After 1774, York Factory became the main post because of its convenient access to the vast interior waterway systems of the [[Saskatchewan River|Saskatchewan]] and [[Red River of the North|Red]] rivers. Called \"factories\" (because the \"[[Factor (agent)|factor]],\" i.e., a person acting as a mercantile agent did business from there), these posts operated in the manner of the Dutch fur trading operations in [[New Netherland]]s. By adoption of the Standard of Trade in the 18th century, the HBC ensured consistent pricing throughout Rupert's Land. A means of exchange arose based on the \"[[Made Beaver]]\" (MB); a prime pelt, worn for a year and ready for processing: \"the prices of all trade goods were set in values of Made Beaver (MB) with other animal pelts, such as squirrel, otter and moose quoted in their MB (made beaver) equivalents.

They established an extensive system of inland posts at native villages, and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region, learning their languages and often forming alliances through marriages with indigenous women. In March 1686, the French sent a [[Hudson Bay expedition (1686)|raiding party]] under the [[Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes|Chevalier des Troyes]] more than {{convert|1300|km|abbr=on}} to capture the HBC posts along James Bay. The French appointed [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], who had shown great heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts. In 1687 an English attempt to [[Battle of Fort Albany|resettle Fort Albany]] failed due to strategic deceptions by d'Iberville. After 1688 England and France [[King William's War|were officially at war]], and the conflict played out in North America as well. D'Iberville raided Fort Severn in 1690 but did not attempt to raid the well-defended local headquarters at York Factory.

On the way to the fort, he defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Hudson's Bay]] (5 September 1697), the largest naval battle in the history of the North American Arctic. D'Iberville's depleted French force captured York Factory by laying siege to the fort and pretending to be a much larger army. The French retained all of the outposts except Fort Albany until 1713. (A small French and Indian force attacked Fort Albany again [[Battle of Fort Albany (1709)|in 1709]] during [[Queen Anne's War]] but was unsuccessful.

Sayer, a [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] trapper and trader, was accused of illegal trading in furs. The Court of [[Assiniboia]] brought Sayer to trial, before a jury of HBC officials and supporters. During the trial, a crowd of armed M\u00e9tis men led by [[Louis Riel, Sr.]] gathered outside the courtroom. Although Sayer was found guilty of illegal trade, having evaded the HBC monopoly, Judge [[Adam Thom]] did not levy a fine or punishment. Some accounts attributed that to the intimidating armed crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, ''Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre!'' (\"Trade is free! Trade is free!\"), the M\u00e9tis loosened the HBC's previous control of the courts, which had enforced their monopoly on the settlers of Red River.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAnother factor was the findings of the [[Palliser Expedition]] of 1857 to 1860, led by Captain [[John Palliser]]. He surveyed the area of the prairies and wilderness from Lake Superior to the southern passes of the Rocky Mountains.

It ended the myth publicized by Hudson's Bay Company: that the Canadian West was unfit for agricultural settlement.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1863, the [[International Financial Society]] bought controlling interest in the HBC, signalling a shift in the company's outlook: most of the new shareholders were less interested in the fur trade than in real estate speculation and economic development in the West. The Society floated \u00a32 million in public shares on non-ceded land held ostensibly by the Hudson's Bay Company as an asset and leveraged this asset for collateral for these funds. These funds allowed the Society the financial means to weather the financial collapse of 1866 which destroyed many competitors and invest in railways in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb50-udfs|title=Records of the International Finance Society|work=Archives Hub|publisher=[[Jisc]]|accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SketchesGrizzly.jpeg|thumb|left|''A rough and tumble with a [[grizzly]]'' (Harry Bullock-Webster)]]\n\nIn 1869, after rejecting the American government offer of {{CAD|10,000,000}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/Politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405101925/http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/Politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2007 |title=John A.

Saw several cases at Godhavn, Etah, Port Burwell, Arctic Bay\"; that \"an epidemic resembling influenza killed a considerable proportion of population at Port Burwell\"; and that \"the gravest danger faces the Eskimo in his transfer from a race-long hunter to a dependent trapper. White flour, sea-biscuits, tea and tobacco do not provide sufficient fuel to warm and nourish him\". Furthermore, he discouraged the establishment of an Arctic hospital. The \"proposed hospital at Pangnirtung would be a waste of money, as it could be reached by only a few natives\". Banting's report contrasted starkly with the bland descriptions provided by the ship's physician, F. H. Stringer.</blockquote>\n\n====Retail expansion====\n[[File:HBC Logo.svg|thumb|HBC's coat of arms logo]]\n\nIn 1960, the company acquired [[Morgan's]] allowing it to expand into Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa.

The company granted public access to the collection the following year.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn 27 January 1994, the company's archives were formally donated to the Archives of Manitoba.<ref>{{cite web |title=HBCA History |website=Hudson's Bay Company Archives |publisher=Government of Manitoba |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/archives/hbca/about/hbca_history.html |access-date=6 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925004135/http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/archives/hbca/about/hbca_history.html |archive-date=25 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the donation, the appraised value of the records was nearly $60 million. A foundation, Hudson's Bay Company History Foundation funded through the tax savings resulting from the donation, was established to support the operations of the HBC Archive as a division of the Archives of Manitoba, along with other activities and programs.<ref>{{cite web |title=HBC History Foundation |website=Hudson's Bay Company |url=http://www3.hbc.com/hbc/socialresponsibility/hbc-history-foundation/ |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> More than {{convert|2|km|spell=in}} of filed documents and hundreds of microfilm reels are now stored in a special climate-controlled vault in the Manitoba Archives Building.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 2007, Hudson's Bay Company Archives became part of the United Nations \"[[Memory of the World Programme]]\" project, under [[UNESCO]].

This hierarchy essentially broke down into two levels; the officers and the servants.  Comprising the officers were the factors, masters and chief traders, clerks and surgeons. The servants were the tradesmen, boatmen, and labourers. The officers essentially ran the fur trading posts.  They had many duties which included supervising the workers in their trade posts, valuing the furs, and keeping trade and post records.  In 1821, when Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company merged, the hierarchy became even stricter and the lines between officers and servants became virtually impossible to cross. Officers in charge of individual trading posts had much responsibility because they were directly in charge of enforcing the policies made by the governor and committee (the board) of the company. One of these policies was the price of particular furs and trade goods.  These prices were called the Official and Comparative Standards. [[Made Beaver|Made-Beaver]], the quality measurement of the pelt, was the means of exchange used by Hudson's Bay Company to define the Official and Comparative Standards. Because the governor was stationed in London, England, they needed to have reliable officers managing the trade posts halfway around the world. Because the fur trade was a very dynamic market, HBC needed to have some form of flexibility when dealing with prices and traders. Price fluctuation was deferred to the officers in charge of the trade posts, and the head office recorded any difference between the company's standard and that set by the individual officers. Overplus, or any excess revenue gained by officers was strictly documented to insure that it wasn't being pocketed and taken from the company. This strict yet flexible hierarchy exemplifies how Hudson's Bay Company was able to be so successful while still having its central management and trade posts located so far apart.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |first2=Frank D. |last2=Lewis |title=Indians, the Beaver, and the Bay: The Economics of Depletion in the Lands of Hudson's Bay Company, 1700\u20131763 |journal=Journal of Economic History |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=465\u2013494 |date=September 1993 |jstor=2122402 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700013450}}</ref><ref name=\"Judd\">{{cite journal |last=Judd |first=Carol |title=Native labour and social stratification in Hudson's Bay Company's Northern Department, 1770\u20131870 |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=305\u2013314 |date=November 1980 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.1980.tb00707.x }}</ref>\n\n;Hierarchichal order pre-1821<ref name=\"Judd\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\"\n! align=\"center\" width=\"50\" | #\n! align=\"center\" width=\"360\" | Job Title\n|-\n|||''' ''OFFICERS'' ''' \n|-\n| 1 || ''Chief Factor'' \n|-\n| 2|| ''Second'' [Factor] \n|-\n|3|| ''Master'' [of a trading station]\n|-\n| 4|| ''Sloopmaster'' <br /> ''Surgeon'' \n|-\n| 5|| ''Writer'' \n|-\n|6|| ''Apprentice'' \n|-\n|||''' ''SERVANTS'' ''' \n|-\n|1|| ''Tradesman'' <br /> ''Steersman'' \n|-\n|2|| ''Canoeman'' <br /> ''Bowsman'' \n|-\n|3|| ''Middleman''\n|-\n|4|| ''Labourer''  \n|}\n\n;Hierarchical order 1821\u20131871<ref name=\"Judd\"/><ref>Tach\u00e9, Alexandre Antonin & Cameron, Donald Roderick (1870).

The environment along and ahead of this front was anticipated to be favorable for severe weather, featuring dewpoints as high as the low 70s Fahrenheit, mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy on the order of 1,000\u20132,000&nbsp;J/kg, and a {{convert|40\u201360|kn|mph|abbr=on}} contributing to large hodographs and strong cyclonic updraft potential. In addition, advection of drier air aloft was predicted to inhibit convective development until later in the day. Given the general alignment of the cold front and wind shear aloft, the SPC was uncertain early on December&nbsp;16 over whether numerous discrete supercells would exist in the highest threat area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day1otlk_20191216_1300.html|title=Storm Prediction Center Dec 16, 2019 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref> By later in the day, however, a consistent signal for sustained warm-sector supercells from available model guidance lent credibility to the potential for multiple significant tornadoes.<ref name=\"SPC1630\" /> At 16:40&nbsp;UTC, the SPC issued their first tornado watch, the first of four during the day as the severe weather threat spread eastward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2019/ww0700.html|title=Storm Prediction Center Tornado Watch 700|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref> Discrete supercells soon developed within the warm sector across Louisiana, while a line of thunderstorms congealed along the encroaching cold front.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md2209.html|title=Storm Prediction Center Mesoscale Discussion 2209|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref> Numerous tornadoes, some strong to intense, were observed across Louisiana and Mississippi throughout the afternoon hours.

The tornado was initially weak, causing minor EF0 to EF1 tree and roof damage in DeRidder. The tornado exited DeRidder, widening and strengthening as it continued northeastward into [[Vernon Parish, Louisiana|Vernon Parish]] and reaching EF3 strength as it passed to the southeast of [[Rosepine, Louisiana|Rosepine]]. Severe damage occurred along Mac Sterling Road, John Brewer Road, and Borel Road, where a couple of manufactured homes were obliterated with the debris scattered long distances through nearby fields. Outbuildings were destroyed, many large trees were snapped or uprooted, and some frame homes sustained partial to total roof loss. A few of these frame homes sustained some collapse of exterior walls as well. A 59-year old woman was killed in her home by the tornado in this area. The tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it continued to the northeast, crossing [[Louisiana Highway 10]], where a church lost a portion of its metal roof and outbuildings were destroyed. Numerous trees were snapped as well. EF2 damage occurred beyond this point as the tornado moved through forested areas of [[Fort Polk]], snapping and uprooting countless trees. A structure sustained loss of its metal roof and collapse of brick facade in this area as well.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> Exiting Fort Polk, the tornado narrowed and weakened again, causing EF0 to EF1 tree damage is it moved through unpopulated areas. Additional minor EF0 and EF1 tree damage occurred as the tornado continued into [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]], moving to the northeast as it passed near [[Hineston, Louisiana|Hineston]] and [[Otis, Louisiana|Otis]]. Restrengthening then occurred as extensive EF2 tree damage occurred near the Kincaid Reservoir. Numerous trees were snapped and denuded, and a few sustained some low-end debarking. Maintaining EF2 strength, the strong tornado then entered the west side of [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. Numerous mobile homes were thrown and destroyed at a mobile home sales business along Ross Lane, while nearby homes sustained significant roof damage. A few outbuildings were destroyed as well. The tornado strengthened and widened further just past this location, producing EF3 damage along Stovall Road. Several large metal buildings were completely destroyed in this area, and a large portion of the nearby Hope Baptist School was destroyed at EF3 intensity as well, with large amounts of debris was scattered throughout the area. The tornado then crossed [[Louisiana Highway 28]] and heavily damaged a sports complex along the north side of the highway. Continuing to the east-northeast, additional EF3 damage occurred as a convenience store was destroyed, and a nearby large metal-framed warehouse building was destroyed as well along John Allison Drive.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> A manufactured home was overturned in this area as well. In a nearby residential area, the tornado weakened to EF2 strength as large trees were downed, and homes had large portions of their roofs torn off. Continuing to the northeast through Alexandria, the tornado narrowed and weakened to EF1 strength, damaging trees and power poles as it crossed Bayou Rapides Road. Along Enterprise Road, a warehouse building sustained EF1 damage to its roof and doors. The tornado proceeded to cross the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and entered [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]], first causing EF1 damage to structures at the Pineville Municipal Airport. The tornado moved along a northeasterly path through residential areas of Pineville, snapping and uprooting numerous large trees. Some of these trees fell onto houses and caused heavy damage. A majority of the damage in Pineville was rated EF1, though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along Edgewood Drive, where a house sustained considerable structural damage. Past this area, the tornado continued to narrow and weaken, eventually dissipating after producing some EF0 tree limb damage along Donahue Ferry Road in Pineville.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref>\n\nOverall, this EF3 tornado caused one fatality along its 62-mile long path. It had a peak width of {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}.<ref>{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Lake Charles, Louisiana|title=NWS Damage Survey for 12/16/19 Tornado Event|url=https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=PNSLCH&e=201912182057|publisher=Iowa Environmental Mesonet|date=December 18, 2019|accessdate=December 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref>\n\n===Laurel \u2013 Sandersville \u2013 Shubuta \u2013 Mannassa, Mississippi/Lisman, Alabama===\n[[File:LaurelMississippiEF3tornado2019.jpg|thumb|left|EF3 damage to the Wade Services manufacturing plant near Laurel, Mississippi.]]\nThis strong, long-tracked tornado touched down during the late evening hours of December 16, at Hesler Noble Field in southwestern [[Laurel, Mississippi]]. Past the airport, the tornado caused EF0 to EF1 damage at the Dixie Golf Club, where trees and tree limbs were snapped and fencing was blown over. The tornado moved along a northeastward path through the southwest side of Laurel, downing trees and causing minor roof damage to homes. Metal roofing was torn off of a three-story motel along Jefferson street as well. Damage along this section of the path was rated EF0 to EF1 in intensity. Crossing South 16th Avenue, the tornado reached EF2 strength, where a small brick office building sustained roof and exterior wall loss, and a strip mall was heavily damaged. The roof of a hotel was lifted up and dropped back down onto the building, and a semi-truck and flatbed trailer carrying automobiles was flipped over and dragged. Continuing to the northeast through Laurel, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as numerous homes, warehouses, apartment buildings, and other structures sustained minor to moderate roof damage. One large building lost roughly 20% of its metal roof, and sustained collapse of brick facade. A [[Piggly Wiggly]] grocery store also sustained minor EF0 roof and exterior damage in this area as well, and numerous trees and a few power poles were downed. The tornado continued to the northeast through residential neighborhoods at EF1 intensity, snapping and uprooting trees and causing roof damage to additional homes. Some trees fell onto houses and cars as well. A metal self-storage building was partially destroyed along North 1st Avenue, and a large warehouse building near North Railroad Avenue sustained considerable roof damage. The tornado reached EF2 intensity again as moved through the eastern part of Laurel, where a house had its roof torn off and other homes sustained lesser roof damage. The Nora Davis Magnet school also lost much of its roof in this area. The tornado then reached EF3 intensity as it exited Laurel and crossed [[Interstate 59]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees, and toppling several large metal truss transmission towers to the ground. EF3 damage continued as the tornado then completely destroyed the Wade Services manufacturing plant, along with several other metal buildings and an office building on the property. Northeast of this area, the tornado momentarily weakened and caused EF1 tree damage as it moved along the east side of Interstate 59. The tornado became strong again as it then impacted the southern fringes of [[Sandersville, Mississippi|Sandersville]] at EF2 strength, where a house sustained loss of much of its roof, along with some second floor exterior walls. Another home sustained major roof damage, outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted, and two people sustained minor injuries in the Sandersville area.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> Past Sandersville, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it struck the Mississippi Choctaw Reservation, where homes sustained roof and garage damage, a small pavilion collapsed, trees were downed, and headstones were tipped over at a cemetery. EF0 and EF1 damage to trees and homes continued through the extreme northwestern corner of [[Wayne County, Mississippi|Wayne County]] and into the southwestern corner of [[Clarke County, Mississippi|Clarke County]], though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along County Road 223, where numerous large trees were snapped and a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Additional EF2 damage occurred as the tornado crossed [[U.S. Route 45]] north of [[Shubuta, Mississippi|Shubuta]], where a well-built home had most if its roof torn off. Northeast of Shubuta, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted at EF1 strength as the tornado moved through rural areas. A few outbuildings and mobile homes were damaged as well. A final area of EF2 damage occurred to the southwest of the small community of [[Mannassa, Mississippi|Mannassa]], where a well-built home along County Road 664 sustained destruction of its attached garage, and had a large portion of its roof torn off. A nearby mobile home was rolled and destroyed as well. Northeast of Mannassa, the tornado weakened to EF0 strength as it approached the Alabama border, causing only tree limb damage in rural areas. The tornado then regained EF1 strength as it crossed into [[Choctaw County, Alabama]], downing trees and destroying a mobile home. Additional trees were snapped or uprooted, and a house sustained partial removal of its roof before the tornado dissipated to the west-northwest of [[Lisman, Alabama]] after traveling {{convert|61.31|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref>\n\nThe tornado was rated EF3 and injured two people.

At the surface, a cold front was expected to progress across the Southeast United States while an intensifying area of low pressure propagated northeast along the boundary. The environment along and ahead of this front was anticipated to be favorable for severe weather, featuring dewpoints as high as the low 70s Fahrenheit, mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy on the order of 1,000\u20132,000&nbsp;J/kg, and a {{convert|40\u201360|kn|mph|abbr=on}} contributing to large hodographs and strong cyclonic updraft potential. In addition, advection of drier air aloft was predicted to inhibit convective development until later in the day. Given the general alignment of the cold front and wind shear aloft, the SPC was uncertain early on December&nbsp;16 over whether numerous discrete supercells would exist in the highest threat area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day1otlk_20191216_1300.html|title=Storm Prediction Center Dec 16, 2019 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref> By later in the day, however, a consistent signal for sustained warm-sector supercells from available model guidance lent credibility to the potential for multiple significant tornadoes.<ref name=\"SPC1630\" /> At 16:40&nbsp;UTC, the SPC issued their first tornado watch, the first of four during the day as the severe weather threat spread eastward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2019/ww0700.html|title=Storm Prediction Center Tornado Watch 700|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref> Discrete supercells soon developed within the warm sector across Louisiana, while a line of thunderstorms congealed along the encroaching cold front.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md2209.html|title=Storm Prediction Center Mesoscale Discussion 2209|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref> Numerous tornadoes, some strong to intense, were observed across Louisiana and Mississippi throughout the afternoon hours.

The tornado was initially weak, causing minor EF0 to EF1 tree and roof damage in DeRidder. The tornado exited DeRidder, widening and strengthening as it continued northeastward into [[Vernon Parish, Louisiana|Vernon Parish]] and reaching EF3 strength as it passed to the southeast of [[Rosepine, Louisiana|Rosepine]]. Severe damage occurred along Mac Sterling Road, John Brewer Road, and Borel Road, where a couple of manufactured homes were obliterated with the debris scattered long distances through nearby fields. Outbuildings were destroyed, many large trees were snapped or uprooted, and some frame homes sustained partial to total roof loss. A few of these frame homes sustained some collapse of exterior walls as well. A 59-year old woman was killed in her home by the tornado in this area. The tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it continued to the northeast, crossing [[Louisiana Highway 10]], where a church lost a portion of its metal roof and outbuildings were destroyed. Numerous trees were snapped as well. EF2 damage occurred beyond this point as the tornado moved through forested areas of [[Fort Polk]], snapping and uprooting countless trees. A structure sustained loss of its metal roof and collapse of brick facade in this area as well.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> Exiting Fort Polk, the tornado narrowed and weakened again, causing EF0 to EF1 tree damage is it moved through unpopulated areas. Additional minor EF0 and EF1 tree damage occurred as the tornado continued into [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]], moving to the northeast as it passed near [[Hineston, Louisiana|Hineston]] and [[Otis, Louisiana|Otis]]. Restrengthening then occurred as extensive EF2 tree damage occurred near the Kincaid Reservoir. Numerous trees were snapped and denuded, and a few sustained some low-end debarking. Maintaining EF2 strength, the strong tornado then entered the west side of [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. Numerous mobile homes were thrown and destroyed at a mobile home sales business along Ross Lane, while nearby homes sustained significant roof damage. A few outbuildings were destroyed as well. The tornado strengthened and widened further just past this location, producing EF3 damage along Stovall Road. Several large metal buildings were completely destroyed in this area, and a large portion of the nearby Hope Baptist School was destroyed at EF3 intensity as well, with large amounts of debris was scattered throughout the area. The tornado then crossed [[Louisiana Highway 28]] and heavily damaged a sports complex along the north side of the highway. Continuing to the east-northeast, additional EF3 damage occurred as a convenience store was destroyed, and a nearby large metal-framed warehouse building was destroyed as well along John Allison Drive.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> A manufactured home was overturned in this area as well. In a nearby residential area, the tornado weakened to EF2 strength as large trees were downed, and homes had large portions of their roofs torn off. Continuing to the northeast through Alexandria, the tornado narrowed and weakened to EF1 strength, damaging trees and power poles as it crossed Bayou Rapides Road. Along Enterprise Road, a warehouse building sustained EF1 damage to its roof and doors. The tornado proceeded to cross the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and entered [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]], first causing EF1 damage to structures at the Pineville Municipal Airport. The tornado moved along a northeasterly path through residential areas of Pineville, snapping and uprooting numerous large trees. Some of these trees fell onto houses and caused heavy damage. A majority of the damage in Pineville was rated EF1, though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along Edgewood Drive, where a house sustained considerable structural damage. Past this area, the tornado continued to narrow and weaken, eventually dissipating after producing some EF0 tree limb damage along Donahue Ferry Road in Pineville.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref>\n\nOverall, this EF3 tornado caused one fatality along its 62-mile long path.

Past the airport, the tornado caused EF0 to EF1 damage at the Dixie Golf Club, where trees and tree limbs were snapped and fencing was blown over. The tornado moved along a northeastward path through the southwest side of Laurel, downing trees and causing minor roof damage to homes. Metal roofing was torn off of a three-story motel along Jefferson street as well. Damage along this section of the path was rated EF0 to EF1 in intensity. Crossing South 16th Avenue, the tornado reached EF2 strength, where a small brick office building sustained roof and exterior wall loss, and a strip mall was heavily damaged. The roof of a hotel was lifted up and dropped back down onto the building, and a semi-truck and flatbed trailer carrying automobiles was flipped over and dragged. Continuing to the northeast through Laurel, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as numerous homes, warehouses, apartment buildings, and other structures sustained minor to moderate roof damage. One large building lost roughly 20% of its metal roof, and sustained collapse of brick facade. A [[Piggly Wiggly]] grocery store also sustained minor EF0 roof and exterior damage in this area as well, and numerous trees and a few power poles were downed. The tornado continued to the northeast through residential neighborhoods at EF1 intensity, snapping and uprooting trees and causing roof damage to additional homes. Some trees fell onto houses and cars as well. A metal self-storage building was partially destroyed along North 1st Avenue, and a large warehouse building near North Railroad Avenue sustained considerable roof damage. The tornado reached EF2 intensity again as moved through the eastern part of Laurel, where a house had its roof torn off and other homes sustained lesser roof damage. The Nora Davis Magnet school also lost much of its roof in this area. The tornado then reached EF3 intensity as it exited Laurel and crossed [[Interstate 59]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees, and toppling several large metal truss transmission towers to the ground. EF3 damage continued as the tornado then completely destroyed the Wade Services manufacturing plant, along with several other metal buildings and an office building on the property. Northeast of this area, the tornado momentarily weakened and caused EF1 tree damage as it moved along the east side of Interstate 59. The tornado became strong again as it then impacted the southern fringes of [[Sandersville, Mississippi|Sandersville]] at EF2 strength, where a house sustained loss of much of its roof, along with some second floor exterior walls. Another home sustained major roof damage, outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted, and two people sustained minor injuries in the Sandersville area.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref> Past Sandersville, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it struck the Mississippi Choctaw Reservation, where homes sustained roof and garage damage, a small pavilion collapsed, trees were downed, and headstones were tipped over at a cemetery. EF0 and EF1 damage to trees and homes continued through the extreme northwestern corner of [[Wayne County, Mississippi|Wayne County]] and into the southwestern corner of [[Clarke County, Mississippi|Clarke County]], though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along County Road 223, where numerous large trees were snapped and a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Additional EF2 damage occurred as the tornado crossed [[U.S. Route 45]] north of [[Shubuta, Mississippi|Shubuta]], where a well-built home had most if its roof torn off. Northeast of Shubuta, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted at EF1 strength as the tornado moved through rural areas. A few outbuildings and mobile homes were damaged as well. A final area of EF2 damage occurred to the southwest of the small community of [[Mannassa, Mississippi|Mannassa]], where a well-built home along County Road 664 sustained destruction of its attached garage, and had a large portion of its roof torn off. A nearby mobile home was rolled and destroyed as well. Northeast of Mannassa, the tornado weakened to EF0 strength as it approached the Alabama border, causing only tree limb damage in rural areas. The tornado then regained EF1 strength as it crossed into [[Choctaw County, Alabama]], downing trees and destroying a mobile home. Additional trees were snapped or uprooted, and a house sustained partial removal of its roof before the tornado dissipated to the west-northwest of [[Lisman, Alabama]] after traveling {{convert|61.31|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref>\n\nThe tornado was rated EF3 and injured two people.

However, the club surrendered the Premier League title to unbeaten champions [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], with a second-half dip in league form coinciding with [[Rio Ferdinand]] starting an eight-month ban from football due to a missed drugs test and restricting United to a third-place finish.\n\nNew to the United side were Portuguese winger [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], Brazilian [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]-winning midfielder [[Jos\u00e9 Kl\u00e9berson|Kl\u00e9berson]], American goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]], Cameroonian midfielder [[Eric Djemba-Djemba]] and French striker [[David Bellion]].\n\nUnited's [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] dreams ended in the last 16, with the European exit being particularly painful as a last minute goal by eventual champions [[FC Porto|Porto]] put them out of the competition and denied them an eighth successive Champions League quarter-final.\n\n==Pre-season and friendlies==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

and their 29th consecutive season in the top division of [[Football in England|English football]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/seasons/season2004.html |title=Manchester United Season 2003/04 |accessdate=8 October 2007 |publisher=StretfordEnd.co.uk }}</ref>\n\nUnited started the season by winning the [[2003 FA Community Shield]] and then secured a record eleventh [[FA Cup]] with a 3\u20130 win over [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]]. However, the club surrendered the Premier League title to unbeaten champions [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], with a second-half dip in league form coinciding with [[Rio Ferdinand]] starting an eight-month ban from football due to a missed drugs test and restricting United to a third-place finish.\n\nNew to the United side were Portuguese winger [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], Brazilian [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]-winning midfielder [[Jos\u00e9 Kl\u00e9berson|Kl\u00e9berson]], American goalkeeper [[Tim Howard]], Cameroonian midfielder [[Eric Djemba-Djemba]] and French striker [[David Bellion]].\n\nUnited's [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] dreams ended in the last 16, with the European exit being particularly painful as a last minute goal by eventual champions [[FC Porto|Porto]] put them out of the competition and denied them an eighth successive Champions League quarter-final.\n\n==Pre-season and friendlies==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

Chetnik commanders [[Zaharije Ostoji\u0107]] and [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]], and ideologue [[Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107]] joined him. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 made a deal with the NDH authorities and Montenegrin separatist and NDH ally [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]] for safe passage through the territory of the NDH, for which Mihailovi\u0107 denounced him as a traitor. Under the agreement, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's troops were supposed to join Drljevi\u0107's [[Montenegrin National Army]] and recognize Drljevi\u0107 as the Montenegrin leader.\n\nThe HOS and Drljevi\u0107 apparently intended to use the agreement as a trap for \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, who also did not plan stick to the agreement and kept moving on his own. This led to open conflict with the HOS. The first clashes occurred on 30 March around the town of [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka]]. The entire Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, strengthened with several other Chetnik Corps, crossed the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] River by 1 April. The HOS assembled a large force that was better organized and had a significant advantage in heavy weapons, under the command of General [[Vladimir Metiko\u0161]]. They attacked the Chetnik forward units and forced them to withdraw towards the Lijev\u010de field, north of Banja Luka. The HOS then attacked \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's forces on the Lijev\u010de field and blocked their path to the west. The Chetnik attempts of a breakthrough were unsuccessful, and most of the army surrendered during a large HOS attack on 7 and 8 April. A smaller detachment led by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 tried to break through the HOS lines by moving south. Due to the desertion of his troops and the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] forces on his way, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 agreed to another deal with the HOS, but was subsequently executed along with other Chetnik officers. \n\nThe bulk of the Montenegrin Chetniks were recruited into Drljevi\u0107's army and placed under the command of the HOS.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kretanje snaga jvuo 1945 (en).png|thumb|250px|Retreat of \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's (1) forces.]]\nFollowing the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]] in September 1943, German forces [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied]] the area of the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]]. The Germans cooperated with local Montenegrin separatists, local [[Chetniks]], and the [[Sand\u017eak Muslim militia]] in controlling Montenegro. As these forces did not prove to be sufficient, the Germans released the imprisoned Chetnik Commander [[Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]] and organized the [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]], with the assistance of [[Government of National Salvation|Nedi\u0107's government]], to fight against the [[Yugoslav Partisans]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=147-148}}\n\nIn late 1944, with the German withdrawal from the Balkans and the advance of the [[Red Army]] and the Partisans, the situation for the Chetniks in [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|Serbia]] and Montenegro became increasingly difficult. Mihailovi\u0107, who favoured continued cooperation with the Germans to obtain weapons and ammunition, ordered all Chetnik forces, including those under \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's command in Montenegro, to head towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. While the Chetniks assisted the Germans in keeping control of the communication lines, Mihailovi\u0107 at the same time tried to win back the support of the Western Allies.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|pp=377-378}} The Germans withdrew from Montenegro in early December 1944, together with \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's troops.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=147}} The Montenegrin Chetniks were at this point reorganized into three divisions, and included the Sand\u017eak Chetniks of [[Vuk Kalaitovi\u0107]]. They numbered 8,700 men and were accompanied by around 3,000 civilians, mostly family members. After a 35-day march, suffering from cold, hunger and diseases, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's army reached the [[Trebava]] mountain in northeast Bosnia in mid-February 1945.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=87-89}} Upon joining the rest of the Chetniks, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 criticized Mihailovi\u0107's leadership and advocated a retreat to Slovenia, where they would join other Chetnik units and await the arrival of Western Allies, as opposed to Mihailovi\u0107's insistence on returning to Serbia. He decided to split from Mihailovi\u0107 and move toward the [[Slovene Littoral]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=148}} \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was joined by [[Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107]], one of the chief Chetnik ideologues, the detachments of [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]], leader of the Herzegovina Chetniks, and of [[Zaharije Ostoji\u0107]], leader of the Eastern Bosnian Chetniks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|p=395}} Just before his departure, on 18 March, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was joined by a part of the Chetniks from Serbia.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=95}}\n\n\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 made contact with [[Milan Nedi\u0107]], head of the puppet government in German-occupied Serbia, and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]], who agreed with his idea of gathering the Chetniks in Slovenia. With the help of the German Special Envoy in Belgrade, [[Hermann Neubacher]], Nedi\u0107 and Ljoti\u0107 secured accommodation for \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's troops and refugees in Slovenia. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 had to reach [[Biha\u0107]] in western Bosnia on his own, where Ljoti\u0107's forces would meet him and assist his further movement.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=93-94}}\n\nThe area from Northeastern Bosnia to Slovenia was within the borders of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-sh|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}, NDH), an Axis puppet state. This territory was partially under the control of German and NDH forces, and partially under the Partisans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|p=390}} The Germans favoured increased collaboration with the Chetniks after the capitulation of Italy, despite protests from the NDH government which saw in it a danger to the existence of the state. The NDH government proposed restricting the collaboration to those Chetniks that recognize the NDH and are its citizens, and the limiting of their activities to Serb-majority areas, but the Germans did not accept such complaints.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=308-310}} The military forces of the NDH, the [[Ustashe Militia]] and the [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]], were in November 1944 reorganized into the [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Armed Forces]] ({{lang-sh|Hrvatske oru\u017eane snage}}, HOS).{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan|1995|p=17}}\n\n==\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107-Drljevi\u0107 agreement==\nIn late December 1944, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 sent his aide Du\u0161an Arsovi\u0107 to [[Sarajevo]] to explore the possibility of a joint withdrawal with the Germans. Arsovi\u0107 tried to make contact with [[Ljubomir Vuksanovi\u0107]], a Montenegrin that collaborated with the Germans, but Vuksanovi\u0107 opposed \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and refused to talk to him. Arsovi\u0107 then made contact with representatives of Montenegrin separatist [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]],{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=95-96}} who spent most of the war in the NDH and wanted to create an independent Montenegrin state with German and [[Ustashe]] assistance.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|pp=394-395}} The Ustashe held close contacts with Montenegrin nationalists since the proclamation of the NDH in 1941, when the Montenegrin National Committee, headed by Montenegrin writer [[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], was opened in [[Zagreb]], the capital of the NDH.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=9}} In the spring of 1944, Drljevi\u0107 relocated from [[Zemun]] to Zagreb, where he created an interim government called the Montenegrin State Council. The NDH supported the creation of a Montenegrin state rather than it joining Nedi\u0107's Serbia in the planned [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]] of Europe,{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=95-96}} which was proposed by Neubacher in October 1943.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=222}}\n\nTalks intensified between Drljevi\u0107's and \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's representatives, after the split with Mihailovi\u0107. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 saw this as an opportunity to secure a safe passage for his army to Slovenia. At a meeting in [[Doboj]], Drljevi\u0107's negotiators demanded the recognition of Drljevi\u0107 as the political leader of Montenegrins, the recognition of the Montenegrin State Council, and the joining of the Montenegrin Chetniks into the [[Montenegrin National Army]]. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 decided to accept all of Drljevi\u0107's demands, on the condition that the wounded would be accommodated. He also retained operational command of the new army. The agreement was signed on 22 March in Zagreb by representatives of both sides.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=96-97}}\n\nNeither party was sincere in their commitments. Drljevi\u0107's motive was breaking up the Chetnik organization and creating the illusion of his strength to the Germans, thus giving legitimacy to his idea of Montenegrin independence.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=97-98}} He also had a motive to use the agreement as a trap for \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, who supported the unification of Serbia and Montenegro. The Ustashe motive to capture \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was revenge for massacres against Muslims of Southeastern Bosnia and Sand\u017eak, that were committed by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's [[Lim\u2013Sand\u017eak Chetnik detachment]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|pp=395-396}} On the other hand, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 did not want Drljevi\u0107 to have any real control over his army. On 22 March, Drljevi\u0107 sent him a leaflet for distribution among his soldiers. In it were details on the agreement, and Drljevi\u0107 referred to himself as the \"supreme commander of the Montenegrin National Army\", but \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 refused to spread it to his troops.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=10}}\n\nDrljevi\u0107 arranged the accommodation of wounded and sick with the NDH authorities. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 handed them over in [[Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanski Brod]], and the wounded were from there transferred to [[Stara Gradi\u0161ka]].{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=97}} Estimates of their number range from 800 to 2,700.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=10}} The rest of the army was resting outside Bosanski Brod. On 23 March, Mihailovi\u0107 found out about the deal and immediately informed other Chetnik commanders that \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 committed treason and ordered them not to help him in the retreat. He deprived \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 of his rank, announced a court trial for treason, and said that he would inform the Western Allies of \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's siding with the Ustashe and Montenegrin separatists. Having heard of Mihailovi\u0107's reaction, without consulting with Drljevi\u0107, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 ordered the movement of the army to the west.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=97-98}} \n\nUnder the agreement, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's army was obliged to cross the [[Sava]] River into [[Slavonia]], and from [[Slavonski Brod]] continue the march in the direction of Zagreb as the Montenegrin National Army.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=96}} Instead, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 kept moving on a route south of the river, towards the [[Motajica]] mountain and the [[Lijev\u010de]] field, a large plain between the [[Bosna river|Bosna]], [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] and Sava Rivers.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=10}} Drljevi\u0107 qualified this action as a violation of the agreement and informed the HOS leadership of it. The HOS issued an order to secure the [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka]]-[[Banja Luka]] road, where \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's army was heading.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=98}} The NDH leadership considered that Mihailovi\u0107 was behind \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's action, and that his ultimate goal was to unite with Ljoti\u0107's [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] and the [[Serbian State Guard]] in Slovenia and then attack Zagreb. This move would have allegedly bring them back the support of the Western Allies.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Croatian Armed Forces===\nNortheast Bosnia was within the area of responsibility of the 4th Ustashe Corps under the command of [[Josip Metzger]]. The Corps included the 4th Croatian Division of the HOS, stationed in [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]], that numbered 7,000 troops and was commanded by Colonel Zdenko Begi\u0107, and the 6th Croatian Division in Banja Luka under General [[Vladimir Metiko\u0161]], with 4,000 troops. These forces were assisted by local militias and the Ustasha Defence.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=11}} It is estimated that a total of around 10-12,000 troops, under the overall command of Vladimir Metiko\u0161, were involved in military operations at the Lijev\u010de field.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=11}} Colonel Marko Pavlovi\u0107, commander of the Ustasha Defence units,{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr\u010di\u0107|Ravli\u0107|Stupari\u0107|1997|p=314}} also participated in the battle.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=12}}\n\n===Chetniks===\nUpon leaving Montenegro, in January 1945, the Chetnik units were reformed into divisions and regiments. The Montenegrin Chetniks were organized into the 1st, 5th and 8th Divisions, each having two regiments, and the independent Youth Regiment and Staff Battalion. The Mile\u0161eva Corps from Sand\u017eak, led by [[Vuk Kalaitovi\u0107]], was not reformed and remained an independent unit. The 1st Division numbered 2,000 soldiers, the 5th Division 2,400, the 8th Division 2,200, the Staff Battalion 600, the Youth Regiment 300, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's Personal Escort, Security and Logistics had 800, while the Mile\u0161eva Corps had 400.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=88}} The Drina Corps of Baja Niki\u0107 was with \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 from 1943.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=68}} In March 1945, this force was strengthened with the Romanija Corps and Chetniks from Herzegovina, as well as elements of three Corps from Serbia: the Mlava Corps, led by Captain Jago\u0161 \u017divkovi\u0107, the Kosovo Corps, led by Major General Bla\u017eo Brajovi\u0107, and the Rudnik Corps, commanded by Captain Dragomir Topalovi\u0107 \"Gaga\".{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=95}} A part of the Mile\u0161eva Corps, around 200 men, split from the main group that returned to Sand\u017eak and remained with \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=10}} The Middle-Bosnian Corps arrived in the later part of the battle.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=542}}\n\nThe main army was referred to as the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, and Chetniks from Herzegovina formed the 9th division.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan|1995|p=23}} The HOS Headquarters estimated that \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's army, on the way to the Lijev\u010de field, numbered a total of 10-12,000 troops. Partisan reports estimated that \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 had around 10,000 troops once he reached eastern Bosnia in mid-February 1945.{{sfn|Basta|1986|p=450}}\n\n==Initial skirmishes==\n{{Location map+\n| NDH\n| AlternativeMap =Independent State Of Croatia 1943 Locator Map.png\n| float = right\n| caption = \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 planned to reach Biha\u0107 from the Lijev\u010de field, which spans over Gradi\u0161ka\n| width=300\n| places =\n{{Location map~ | NDH | label = [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradi\u0161ka]] | lat = 45.145833 | long = 17.253889 | region = HR | label_size = 75 | marksize = 6 | position = right| mark= Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | NDH | label = [[Banja Luka]] | lat = 44.790780 | long = 17.201775 | region = HR | label_size = 75 | marksize = 6 | position = right| mark= Blue pog.svg }}\n{{Location map~ | NDH | label = [[Sarajevo]] | lat = 43.852531 | long = 18.364953 | region = HR | label_size = 75 | marksize = 6 | position = right| mark= Blue pog.svg }}\n{{Location map~ | NDH | label = [[Zagreb]] | lat = 45.815879 | long = 15.978241 | region = HR | label_size = 75 | marksize = 6 | position = right | mark= Blue pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | NDH | label = [[Biha\u0107]] | lat = 44.814038 | long = 15.869437 | region = HR | label_size = 75 | marksize = 6 | position = right| mark= Blue pog.svg }}\n}}\nOn 30 March, the Chetnik forces passed the Vrbas River and took the village of Razboj. From there, the Mile\u0161eva Corps attacked the village of Doline on the right bank of the Sava River. The local militia in Doline was forced to retreat, and the bulk of \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's forces continued their march. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 planned to capture the town of Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka and secure supplies for his army.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=11}} By 1 April, all of his units crossed the Vrbas and reached Razboj. The army was given a two days' rest while they waited for reinforcements from the Middle-Bosnian Corps.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=542}}\n\nUnits of the 6th Croatian Division and the Ustashe Defence, commanded by General Metiko\u0161, were sent to stop the advance of \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's forward units. On 2 April, Metiko\u0161's forces attacked the Mile\u0161eva and the Drina Corps. The Chetniks suffered heavy casualties and many were taken prisoner, including Captain Sima Miju\u0161kovi\u0107, who was a supporter of Drljevi\u0107's idea of Montenegrin independence. He gave the HOS officers information about the number and the distribution of Chetnik forces. A large group of Chetniks, who presented themselves as Montenegrin nationalists and supporters od Drljevi\u0107, surrendered to the HOS on the night of 2/3 April. At the same time, there was turmoil between Chetnik officers in the main group, due to the heavy losses of their forward units. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 gave up the planned attack on Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka, and instead directed his forces towards the village of [[Nova Topola, Gradi\u0161ka|Topola]], south of the town.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=12}}\n\nThe [[Croatian Air Force (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Air Force]] dropped leaflets urging the Montenegrins to abandon \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and join them and Drljevi\u0107 in the fight against the Partisans. Units of the Partisan 2nd Yugoslav Army were positioned east of the Vrbas, and Metiko\u0161 wanted to finish the battle as soon as possible to prevent a possible Partisan attack on Banja Luka. He gathered a strong force that had a significant advantage in heavy artillery and tanks. Metiko\u0161 also ordered the building and strengthening of bunkers on the Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka-Banja Luka road.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|pp=12-13}}\n\n==Main battle==\nOn the morning of 4 April, the HOS attacked \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's troops on the Lijev\u010de field. A battalion under Major Antun Vrban was set aside towards the [[Kozara]] mountain to guard against any possible Partisan attacks. After a short battle, the HOS defeated the Gacko Brigade of the Herzegovina Chetniks and encamped in occupied positions, blocking the path to the west. The Commander of the Gacko Brigade, [[Radojica Peri\u0161i\u0107]], was killed in the attack. The Chetnik leadership prepared for a quick counterattack. The 5th division was sent to capture the village of Aleksandrovac and stop the HOS advance from Banja Luka. The 1st division was tasked with capturing the village of Topola to the north, while the rest of the force was supposed to make a breakthrough at the village of \u0160ibi\u0107a Han. All three villages were situated on the Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka-Banja Luka road, heavily guarded with bunkers. Their further plan was to secure a path through Partisan-held Kozara.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=13}}\n\n\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 tried to negotiate a truce with the HOS and a free passage towards Kozara, but the request was rejected. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 ordered an all-out attack on the following night.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=98}} Equipped with small arms and light weapons, the Chetniks began a frontal assault on HOS positions at around 2am on 5 April. Initially, the attack achieved some success. Aleksandrovac was captured and held briefly until HOS troops from Banja Luka, reinforced with tanks, recaptured it at dawn. By then, the Chetnik attack was largely repelled by HOS artillery and bunkers. Several smaller Chetnik detachments managed to pass through the HOS lines and threatened the isolated Vrban's battalion. At the same time, the battalion came under artillery fire from the Partisan 2nd Army, so a tank company was sent to assist them. Chetnik units also came under Partisan bombardment. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's attempts of entering into negotiations with Metiko\u0161 were unsuccessful as Metiko\u0161 demanded unconditional surrender. Fighting lasted throughout the night of 5/6 April, during which additional HOS reinforcements arrived.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=13}}\n\nThe Chetniks of the Gacko and Nevesinje Brigades, that made a breakthrough, reached the slopes of the Kozara mountain. As the main Chetnik attack failed, these units found themselves isolated between the Partisans and the HOS, and soon under attack from both. They were forced to retreat back to the main group. From around 800 troops, only 220 made it back. Its commander, Milorad Popovi\u0107, was among the dead.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=544}} In the meantime, the entire 1st Regiment of the 1st Division surrendered and switched allegiance to Drljevi\u0107.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=544}}\n\nDue to the Partisan troop build-up near Banja Luka, whose 6th Croatian Division was largely involved in the fighting on the Lijev\u010de field, the HOS decided to launch a final attack on the demoralized \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's forces. Faced with desertions and an epidemic of typhus, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 abandoned the idea of a full breakthrough.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}} He formed a detachment of several hundred troops under his command, crossed the Vrbas again, and started moving towards Banja Luka, intending to bypass it from the south. The rest were supposed to feign the acceptance of an agreement with Drljevi\u0107 and try to reach Slovenia.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=99}}\n\nThe attempt of the main army failed and in the morning of 7 April, the HOS amassed its forces near Razboj and began an artillery bombardment of Chetnik positions at around 11 AM, followed by a combined tank-infantry assault. The tanks and armoured vehicles broke the Chetnik right flank, held by the Drina Corps, and circled to their rear. Unable to hold their lines and surrounded on all sides, the Chetniks began surrendering. At the same time, a spoiling attack was ongoing on the Partisans of [[Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107]], east of Vrbas, to disrupt them while the main battle took place, which ended on 8 April.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}}\n\n\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's 500-600 strong detachment included the entire Mile\u0161eva Corps of 200 soldiers. With him were, among others, Vasi\u0107, Ostoji\u0107 and Ba\u0107ovi\u0107. When the detachment approached Banja Luka, Kalaitovi\u0107's Mile\u0161eva Corps split from \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and turned for Sand\u017eak. On 10 April, the detachment crossed the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja]] River and in [[\u010celinac]] met with leaders of the Middle-Bosnian Chetniks, Slavoljub Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 and [[Lazar Te\u0161anovi\u0107]]. The two were ready to join \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, but their troops did not want to leave their villages.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=545}} \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 kept moving down the right bank of the Vrbas and crossed it at the village of Gornji \u0160eher, south of Banja Luka, on 17 April. He was intercepted by the HOS on the Banja Luka-[[Mrkonji\u0107 Grad]] road and given an option to return to the original agreement he had with Drljevi\u0107. The Partisans cut off the rout westwards and endangered his detachment, so \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 accepted the proposal. The detachment was immediately disarmed and sent to Stara Gradi\u0161ka, where the rest of the surrendered forces were located.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=99-100}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe number of casualties is difficult to determine. Chetnik sources mention several hundred killed Chetniks, while HOS General [[Vjekoslav Luburi\u0107]] after the war mentioned thousands of killed, which historian Domagoj Novosel consideres exaggerated. Based on a German report from 9 April, 5,500 Chetniks surrendered in the area of Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe surrendered Chetniks and refugees accompanying them were moved to a barracks in Stara Gradi\u0161ka. They were allowed to keep their weapons, but were heavily guarded. Two days later, Drljevi\u0107 visited the barracks and gave a speech in which he urged them to be loyal to an independent Montenegro. A selection of Serbs from Montenegrins was then made by a commission set up by Drljevi\u0107, with NDH assistance. Soldiers that were not from Montenegro or Herzegovina were set aside and imprisoned by the NDH authorities,{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}} including those that were recognized as enemies of Montenegrin separatists.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=100}} The rest were placed into three brigades of the Montenegrin National Army. Colonel Bo\u0161ko Agram, a member of the [[Montenegrin Federalist Party]], was named its commander. The officers that were admitted to the new army had to pledge allegiance to Independent Montenegro. The new army was then transferred to the area of the 2nd Ustashe Corps in [[Sisak]], under General Luburi\u0107, and the 5th Ustashe Corps in [[Karlovac]], under General Ivan Heren\u010di\u0107.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}} On 17 April, Drljevi\u0107 outlined his agenda as the fight against a new Yugoslavia, the Chetniks of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107, and Soviet influence. Achieving Montenegrin statehood was outlined as the main war objective.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=547}}\n\nWhile events after the capture of \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 are unclear, sources agree that he and his officers were executed in the area of the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]].{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=15}} Among the killed were Ostoji\u0107, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107, and Vasi\u0107, and around 150 others.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=100}}\n\nIn May 1945, the Montenegrin National Army retreated towards Austria together with the HOS. A large number of its troops defied Drljevi\u0107 and Agram once they crossed the border into Slovenia. Only a small number remained loyal to Drljevi\u0107. They attempted to surrender to the British Forces at Bleiburg, but were refused and were instead [[Bleiburg repatriations|repatriated to Yugoslavia]]. Many were then killed by the Partisans. Drljevi\u0107 managed to evade capture and was interned at a camp in Austria. He was killed in the fall of 1945 by former members of the Montenegrin Chetniks.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|pp=14-15}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military history of Croatia]]\n* [[World War II in Yugoslavia]]\n*

Armed Forces]] (HOS, the amalgamated [[Ustashe Militia]] and [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]] forces) and [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] forces on the [[Lijev\u010de]] field near [[Banja Luka]] in what was then the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH).\n\nIn December 1944, the Montenegrin Chetniks of Lieutenant Colonel [[Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]] began withdrawing from [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|German occupied Montenegro]] towards Northeastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], where a meeting was convened with [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] and other Chetnik leaders. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was critical of Mihailovi\u0107's leadership, and decided to move west to Slovenia and seek Allied protection, contrary to Mihailovi\u0107's conception of returning to Serbia. Chetnik commanders [[Zaharije Ostoji\u0107]] and [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]], and ideologue [[Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107]] joined him. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 made a deal with the NDH authorities and Montenegrin separatist and NDH ally [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]] for safe passage through the territory of the NDH, for which Mihailovi\u0107 denounced him as a traitor. Under the agreement, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's troops were supposed to join Drljevi\u0107's [[Montenegrin National Army]] and recognize Drljevi\u0107 as the Montenegrin leader.\n\nThe HOS and Drljevi\u0107 apparently intended to use the agreement as a trap for \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, who also did not plan stick to the agreement and kept moving on his own. This led to opet conflict with the HOS. The first clashes occurred on 30 March around the town of [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka]]. The entire Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, strengthened with several other Chetnik Corps, crossed the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] River by 1 April. The HOS assembled a large force that was better organized and had a significant advantage in heavy weapons, under the command of General [[Vladimir Metiko\u0161]]. They attacked the Chetnik forward units and forced them to withdraw towards the Lijev\u010de field, north of Banja Luka. The HOS then attacked \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's forces on the Lijev\u010de field and blocked their path to the west. The Chetnik attempts of a breakthrough were unsuccessful, and most of the army surrendered during a large HOS attack on 7 and 8 April. A smaller detachment led by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 tried to break through the HOS lines by moving south. Due to the desertion of his troops and the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] forces on his way, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 agreed to another deal with the HOS, but was subsequently executed along with other Chetnik officers. \n\nThe bulk of the Montenegrin Chetniks were recruited into Drljevi\u0107's army and placed under the command of the HOS.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kretanje snaga jvuo 1945 (en).png|thumb|250px|Retreat of \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's (1) forces.]]\nFollowing the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian surrender]] in September 1943, German forces [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied]] the area of the [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]]. The Germans cooperated with local Montenegrin separatists, local [[Chetniks]], and the [[Sand\u017eak Muslim militia]] in controlling Montenegro. As these forces did not prove to be sufficient, the Germans released the imprisoned Chetnik Commander [[Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]] and organized the [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]], with the assistance of [[Government of National Salvation|Nedi\u0107's government]], to fight against the [[Yugoslav Partisans]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=147-148}}\n\nIn late 1944, with the German withdrawal from the Balkans and the advance of the [[Red Army]] and the Partisans, the situation for the Chetniks in [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|Serbia]] and Montenegro became increasingly difficult. Mihailovi\u0107, who favoured continued cooperation with the Germans to obtain weapons and ammunition, ordered all Chetnik forces, including those under \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's command in Montenegro, to head towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. While the Chetniks assisted the Germans in keeping control of the communication lines, Mihailovi\u0107 at the same time tried to win back the support of the Western Allies.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|pp=377-378}} The Germans withdrew from Montenegro in early December 1944, together with \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's troops.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=147}} The Montenegrin Chetniks were at this point reorganized into three divisions, and included the Sand\u017eak Chetniks of [[Vuk Kalaitovi\u0107]]. They numbered 8,700 men and were accompanied by around 3,000 civilians, mostly family members. After a 35-day march, suffering from cold, hunger and diseases, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's army reached the [[Trebava]] mountain in northeast Bosnia in mid-February 1945.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=87-89}} Upon joining the rest of the Chetniks, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 criticized Mihailovi\u0107's leadership and advocated a retreat to Slovenia, where they would join other Chetnik units and await the arrival of Western Allies, as opposed to Mihailovi\u0107's insistence on returning to Serbia. He decided to split from Mihailovi\u0107 and move toward the [[Slovene Littoral]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=148}} \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was joined by [[Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107]], one of the chief Chetnik ideologues, the detachments of [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]], leader of the Herzegovina Chetniks, and of [[Zaharije Ostoji\u0107]], leader of the Eastern Bosnian Chetniks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|p=395}} Just before his departure, on 18 March, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was joined by a part of the Chetniks from Serbia.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=95}}\n\n\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 made contact with [[Milan Nedi\u0107]], head of the puppet government in German-occupied Serbia, and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]], who agreed with his idea of gathering the Chetniks in Slovenia. With the help of the German Special Envoy in Belgrade, [[Hermann Neubacher]], Nedi\u0107 and Ljoti\u0107 secured accommodation for \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's troops and refugees in Slovenia. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 had to reach [[Biha\u0107]] in western Bosnia on his own, where Ljoti\u0107's forces would meet him and assist his further movement.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=93-94}}\n\nThe area from Northeastern Bosnia to Slovenia was within the borders of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-sh|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}, NDH), an Axis puppet state. This territory was partially under the control of German and NDH forces, and partially under the Partisans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|p=390}} The Germans favoured increased collaboration with the Chetniks after the capitulation of Italy, despite protests from the NDH government which saw in it a danger to the existence of the state. The NDH government proposed restricting the collaboration to those Chetniks that recognize the NDH and are its citizens, and the limiting of their activities to Serb-majority areas, but the Germans did not accept such complaints.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=308-310}} The military forces of the NDH, the [[Ustashe Militia]] and the [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]], were in November 1944 reorganized into the [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Armed Forces]] ({{lang-sh|Hrvatske oru\u017eane snage}}, HOS).{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan|1995|p=17}}\n\n==\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107-Drljevi\u0107 agreement==\nIn late December 1944, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 sent his aide Du\u0161an Arsovi\u0107 to [[Sarajevo]] to explore the possibility of a joint withdrawal with the Germans. Arsovi\u0107 tried to make contact with [[Ljubomir Vuksanovi\u0107]], a Montenegrin that collaborated with the Germans, but Vuksanovi\u0107 opposed \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and refused to talk to him. Arsovi\u0107 then made contact with representatives of Montenegrin separatist [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]],{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=95-96}} who spent most of the war in the NDH and wanted to create an independent Montenegrin state with German and [[Ustashe]] assistance.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|pp=394-395}} The Ustashe held close contacts with Montenegrin nationalists since the proclamation of the NDH in 1941, when the Montenegrin National Committee, headed by Montenegrin writer [[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], was opened in [[Zagreb]], the capital of the NDH.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=9}} In the spring of 1944, Drljevi\u0107 relocated from [[Zemun]] to Zagreb, where he created an interim government called the Montenegrin State Council. The NDH supported the creation of a Montenegrin state rather than it joining Nedi\u0107's Serbia in the planned [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]] of Europe,{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=95-96}} which was proposed by Neubacher in October 1943.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=222}}\n\nTalks intensified between Drljevi\u0107's and \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's representatives, after the split with Mihailovi\u0107. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 saw this as an opportunity to secure a safe passage for his army to Slovenia. At a meeting in [[Doboj]], Drljevi\u0107's negotiators demanded the recognition of Drljevi\u0107 as the political leader of Montenegrins, the recognition of the Montenegrin State Council, and the joining of the Montenegrin Chetniks into the [[Montenegrin National Army]]. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 decided to accept all of Drljevi\u0107's demands, on the condition that the wounded would be accommodated. He also retained operational command of the new army. The agreement was signed on 22 March in Zagreb by representatives of both sides.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=96-97}}\n\nNeither party was sincere in their commitments. Drljevi\u0107's motive was breaking up the Chetnik organization and creating the illusion of his strength to the Germans, thus giving legitimacy to his idea of Montenegrin independence.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=97-98}} He also had a motive to use the agreement as a trap for \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, who supported the unification of Serbia and Montenegro. The Ustashe motive to capture \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was revenge for massacres against Muslims of Southeastern Bosnia and Sand\u017eak, that were committed by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's [[Lim\u2013Sand\u017eak Chetnik detachment]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1979|pp=395-396}} On the other hand, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 did not want Drljevi\u0107 to have any real control over his army. On 22 March, Drljevi\u0107 sent him a leaflet for distribution among his soldiers. In it were details on the agreement, and Drljevi\u0107 referred to himself as the \"supreme commander of the Montenegrin National Army\", but \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 refused to spread it to his troops.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=10}}\n\nDrljevi\u0107 arranged the accommodation of wounded and sick with the NDH authorities. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 handed them over in [[Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanski Brod]], and the wounded were from there transferred to [[Stara Gradi\u0161ka]].{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=97}} Estimates of their number range from 800 to 2,700.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=10}} The rest of the army was resting outside Bosanski Brod. On 23 March, Mihailovi\u0107 found out about the deal and immediately informed other Chetnik commanders that \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 committed treason and ordered them not to help him in the retreat. He deprived \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 of his rank, announced a court trial for treason, and said that he would inform the Western Allies of \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's siding with the Ustashe and Montenegrin separatists. Having heard of Mihailovi\u0107's reaction, without consulting with Drljevi\u0107, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 ordered the movement of the army to the west.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=97-98}} \n\nUnder the agreement, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's army was obliged to cross the [[Sava]] River into [[Slavonia]], and from [[Slavonski Brod]] continue the march in the direction of Zagreb as the Montenegrin National Army.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=96}} Instead, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 kept moving on a route south of the river, towards the [[Motajica]] mountain and the [[Lijev\u010de]] field, a large plain between the [[Bosna river|Bosna]], [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] and Sava Rivers.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=10}} Drljevi\u0107 qualified this action as a violation of the agreement and informed the HOS leadership of it. The HOS issued an order to secure the [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka]]-[[Banja Luka]] road, where \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's army was heading.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=98}} The NDH leadership considered that Mihailovi\u0107 was behind \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's action, and that his ultimate goal was to unite with Ljoti\u0107's [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] and the [[Serbian State Guard]] in Slovenia and then attack Zagreb. This move would have allegedly bring them back the support of the Western Allies.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Croatian Armed Forces===\nNortheast Bosnia was within the area of responsibility of the 4th Ustashe Corps under the command of [[Josip Metzger]].

The Montenegrin Chetniks were organized into the 1st, 5th and 8th Divisions, each having two regiments, and the independent Youth Regiment and Staff Battalion. The Mile\u0161eva Corps from Sand\u017eak, led by [[Vuk Kalaitovi\u0107]], was not reformed and remained an independent unit. The 1st Division numbered 2,000 soldiers, the 5th Division 2,400, the 8th Division 2,200, the Staff Battalion 600, the Youth Regiment 300, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's Personal Escort, Security and Logistics had 800, while the Mile\u0161eva Corps had 400.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=88}} The Drina Corps of Baja Niki\u0107 was with \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 from 1943.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=68}} In March 1945, this force was strengthened with the Romanija Corps and Chetniks from Herzegovina, as well as elements of three Corps from Serbia: the Mlava Corps, led by Captain Jago\u0161 \u017divkovi\u0107, the Kosovo Corps, led by Major General Bla\u017eo Brajovi\u0107, and the Rudnik Corps, commanded by Captain Dragomir Topalovi\u0107 \"Gaga\".{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=95}} A part of the Mile\u0161eva Corps, around 200 men, split from the main group that returned to Sand\u017eak and remained with \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=10}} The Middle-Bosnian Corps arrived in the later part of the battle.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=542}}\n\nThe main army was referred to as the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, and Chetniks from Herzegovina formed the 9th division.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan|1995|p=23}} The HOS Headquarters estimated that \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's army, on the way to the Lijev\u010de field, numbered a total of 10-12,000 troops.

On 2 April, Metiko\u0161's forces attacked the Mile\u0161eva and the Drina Corps. The Chetniks suffered heavy casualties and many were taken prisoner, including Captain Sima Miju\u0161kovi\u0107, who was a supporter of Drljevi\u0107's idea of Montenegrin independence. He gave the HOS officers information about the number and the distribution of Chetnik forces. A large group of Chetniks, who presented themselves as Montenegrin nationalists and supporters od Drljevi\u0107, surrendered to the HOS on the night of 2/3 April.

Units of the Partisan 2nd Yugoslav Army were positioned east of the Vrbas, and Metiko\u0161 wanted to finish the battle as soon as possible to prevent a possible Partisan attack on Banja Luka. He gathered a strong force that had a significant advantage in heavy artillery and tanks.

A battalion under Major Antun Vrban was set aside towards the [[Kozara]] mountain to guard against any possible Partisan attacks. After a short battle, the HOS defeated the Gacko Brigade of the Herzegovina Chetniks and encamped in occupied positions, blocking the path to the west. The Commander of the Gacko Brigade, [[Radojica Peri\u0161i\u0107]], was killed in the attack. The Chetnik leadership prepared for a quick counterattack. The 5th division was sent to capture the village of Aleksandrovac and stop the HOS advance from Banja Luka. The 1st division was tasked with capturing the village of Topola to the north, while the rest of the force was supposed to make a breakthrough at the village of \u0160ibi\u0107a Han. All three villages were situated on the Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka-Banja Luka road, heavily guarded with bunkers. Their further plan was to secure a path through Partisan-held Kozara.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=13}}\n\n\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 tried to negotiate a truce with the HOS and a free passage towards Kozara, but the request was rejected. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 ordered an all-out attack on the following night.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=98}} Equipped with small arms and light weapons, the Chetniks began a frontal assault on HOS positions at around 2am on 5 April. Initially, the attack achieved some success. Aleksandrovac was captured and held briefly until HOS troops from Banja Luka, reinforced with tanks, recaptured it at dawn. By then, the Chetnik attack was largely repelled by HOS artillery and bunkers. Several smaller Chetnik detachments managed to pass through the HOS lines and threatened the isolated Vrban's battalion. At the same time, the battalion came under artillery fire from the Partisan 2nd Army, so a tank company was sent to assist them. Chetnik units also came under Partisan bombardment. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's attempts of entering into negotiations with Metiko\u0161 were unsuccessful as Metiko\u0161 demanded unconditional surrender. Fighting lasted throughout the night of 5/6 April, during which additional HOS reinforcements arrived.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=13}}\n\nThe Chetniks of the Gacko and Nevesinje Brigades, that made a breakthrough, reached the slopes of the Kozara mountain. As the main Chetnik attack failed, these units found themselves isolated between the Partisans and the HOS, and soon under attack from both. They were forced to retreat back to the main group. From around 800 troops, only 220 made it back. Its commander, Milorad Popovi\u0107, was among the dead.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=544}} In the meantime, the entire 1st Regiment of the 1st Division surrendered and switched allegiance to Drljevi\u0107.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=544}}\n\nDue to the Partisan troop build-up near Banja Luka, whose 6th Croatian Division was largely involved in the fighting on the Lijev\u010de field, the HOS decided to launch a final attack on the demoralized \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's forces. Faced with desertions and an epidemic of typhus, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 abandoned the idea of a full breakthrough.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}} He formed a detachment of several hundred troops under his command, crossed the Vrbas again, and started moving towards Banja Luka, intending to bypass it from the south. The rest were supposed to feign the acceptance of an agreement with Drljevi\u0107 and try to reach Slovenia.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=99}}\n\nThe attempt of the main army failed and in the morning of 7 April, the HOS amassed its forces near Razboj and began an artillery bombardment of Chetnik positions at around 11 AM, followed by a combined tank-infantry assault. The tanks and armoured vehicles broke the Chetnik right flank, held by the Drina Corps, and circled to their rear. Unable to hold their lines and surrounded on all sides, the Chetniks began surrendering. At the same time, a spoiling attack was ongoing on the Partisans of [[Ko\u010da Popovi\u0107]], east of Vrbas, to disrupt them while the main battle took place, which ended on 8 April.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}}\n\n\u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's 500-600 strong detachment included the entire Mile\u0161eva Corps of 200 soldiers. With him were, among others, Vasi\u0107, Ostoji\u0107 and Ba\u0107ovi\u0107. When the detachment approached Banja Luka, Kalaitovi\u0107's Mile\u0161eva Corps split from \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and turned for Sand\u017eak. On 10 April, the detachment crossed the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja]] River and in [[\u010celinac]] met with leaders of the Middle-Bosnian Chetniks, Slavoljub Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 and [[Lazar Te\u0161anovi\u0107]]. The two were ready to join \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, but their troops did not want to leave their villages.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=545}} \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 kept moving down the right bank of the Vrbas and crossed it at the village of Gornji \u0160eher, south of Banja Luka, on 17 April. He was intercepted by the HOS on the Banja Luka-[[Mrkonji\u0107 Grad]] road and given an option to return to the original agreement he had with Drljevi\u0107. The Partisans cut off the rout westwards and endangered his detachment, so \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 accepted the proposal. The detachment was immediately disarmed and sent to Stara Gradi\u0161ka, where the rest of the surrendered forces were located.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|pp=99-100}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe number of casualties is difficult to determine. Chetnik sources mention several hundred killed Chetniks, while HOS General [[Vjekoslav Luburi\u0107]] after the war mentioned thousands of killed, which historian Domagoj Novosel consideres exaggerated. Based on a German report from 9 April, 5,500 Chetniks surrendered in the area of Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe surrendered Chetniks and refugees accompanying them were moved to a barracks in Stara Gradi\u0161ka. They were allowed to keep their weapons, but were heavily guarded. Two days later, Drljevi\u0107 visited the barracks and gave a speech in which he urged them to be loyal to an independent Montenegro. A selection of Serbs from Montenegrins was then made by a commission set up by Drljevi\u0107, with NDH assistance. Soldiers that were not from Montenegro or Herzegovina were set aside and imprisoned by the NDH authorities,{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}} including those that were recognized as enemies of Montenegrin separatists.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=100}} The rest were placed into three brigades of the Montenegrin National Army. Colonel Bo\u0161ko Agram, a member of the [[Montenegrin Federalist Party]], was named its commander. The officers that were admitted to the new army had to pledge allegiance to Independent Montenegro. The new army was then transferred to the area of the 2nd Ustashe Corps in [[Sisak]], under General Luburi\u0107, and the 5th Ustashe Corps in [[Karlovac]], under General Ivan Heren\u010di\u0107.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=14}} On 17 April, Drljevi\u0107 outlined his agenda as the fight against a new Yugoslavia, the Chetniks of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107, and Soviet influence. Achieving Montenegrin statehood was outlined as the main war objective.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1977|p=547}}\n\nWhile events after the capture of \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 are unclear, sources agree that he and his officers were executed in the area of the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]].{{sfn|Novosel|2015|p=15}} Among the killed were Ostoji\u0107, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107, and Vasi\u0107, and around 150 others.{{sfn|Pajovi\u0107|1987|p=100}}\n\nIn May 1945, the Montenegrin National Army retreated towards Austria together with the HOS. A large number of its troops defied Drljevi\u0107 and Agram once they crossed the border into Slovenia. Only a small number remained loyal to Drljevi\u0107. They attempted to surrender to the British Forces at Bleiburg, but were refused and were instead [[Bleiburg repatriations|repatriated to Yugoslavia]]. Many were then killed by the Partisans. Drljevi\u0107 managed to evade capture and was interned at a camp in Austria. He was killed in the fall of 1945 by former members of the Montenegrin Chetniks.{{sfn|Novosel|2015|pp=14-15}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military history of Croatia]]\n* [[World War II in Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Basta|first=Milan|title=Rat je zavr\u0161en 7 dana kasnije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zT0rAAAAMAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Privredni pregled}}\n* {{cite book|last1 = Dizdar|first1 = Zdravko|last2 = Gr\u010di\u0107|first2 = Marko|last3 = Ravli\u0107|first3 = Slaven|authorlink3 = Slaven Ravli\u0107|last4 = Stupari\u0107|first4 = Darko|year = 1997|title = Tko je tko u NDH|publisher = Minerva|location = [[Zagreb]]|isbn = 978-953-6377-03-9|language = Croatian|ref = harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Novosel|first=Domagoj|url=|title=Bitka na Lijev\u010de polju|trans-title=Battle of Lijev\u010de Field|journal=VP: Magazin za vojnu povijest|publisher=[[Ve\u010dernji list]]|location=Zagreb, Croatia|year=2015|volume=52|issue=|pages=6\u201315|language=Croatian|issn=|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Pajovi\u0107\n  | first = Radoje\n  | year = 1977\n  | title = Kontrarevolucija u Crnoj Gori: \u010cetni\u010dki i federalisti\u010dki pokret 1941\u20131945\n  | language = Serbo-Croatian\n  | publisher = Obod\n  | location = [[Cetinje]], Yugoslavia\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t0yBAAAAIAAJ\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Pajovi\u0107\n  | first = Radoje\n  | year = 1987\n  | title = Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107\n  | publisher = Centar za informacije i publicitet\n  | location = Zagreb, Yugoslavia\n  | isbn=978-86-7125-006-1\n  | language = Serbo-Croatian\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n|first=Stevan K.\n|last=Pavlowitch\n|title=Hitler's New Disorder: The Second World War in Yugoslavia\n|publisher=Columbia University Press\n|location=New York\n|year=2007\n|isbn=1-85065-895-1\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Thomas\n  | first1 = Nigel\n  | last2 = Mikulan\n  | first2 = Krunoslav\n  | year = 1995\n  | title = Axis Forces in Yugoslavia 1941\u201345\n  | publisher = Osprey Publishing\n  | location = New York, New York\n  | isbn = 978-1-85532-473-2\n  | url = \n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book|last=Tomasevich|first=Jozo|authorlink=Jozo Tomasevich|title=\u010cetnici u Drugom svjetskom ratu: 1941\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GvUCAAAAMAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber |language=Serbo-Croatian|ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book  | last = Tomasevich  | first = Jozo  | authorlink = Jozo Tomasevich  | year = 2001  | title = War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941\u20131945: Occupation and Collaboration  | volume = 2  | publisher = Stanford University Press  | location = San Francisco  | isbn = 978-0-8047-3615-2  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fqUSGevFe5MC  | ref = harv  }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{Wars and battles involving Croatia|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Wars and battles involving Serbs}}\n{{Campaignbox Yugofront}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lijevce Field, Battle of}}\n[[Category:1945 in Yugoslavia]]\n[[Category:April 1945 events]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Independent State of Croatia]]\n[[Category:Battles of World War II involving Chetniks]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1945]]\n[[Category:March 1945 events]]\n", "name_user": "Tzowu", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling mistake", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lijev%C4%8De_Field"}
{"title_page": "Parity (physics)", "text_new": "{{short description|Physical property}}\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], a '''parity transformation''' (also called '''parity inversion''') is the flip in the sign of ''one'' [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] [[coordinate]]. In three dimensions, it can also refer to the simultaneous flip in the sign of all three spatial coordinates (a [[point reflection]]):\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}: \\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix}-x\\\\-y\\\\-z\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nIt can also be thought of as a test for [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] of a physical phenomenon, in that a parity inversion transforms a phenomenon into its mirror image. All fundamental interactions of [[elementary particle]]s, with the exception of the [[weak interaction]], are symmetric under parity. The weak interaction is chiral and thus provides a means for probing chirality in physics. In interactions that are symmetric under parity, such as electromagnetism in atomic and molecular physics, parity serves as a powerful controlling principle underlying quantum transitions.\n\nA matrix representation of '''P''' (in any number of dimensions) has [[determinant]] equal to \u22121, and hence is distinct from a [[rotation]], which has a determinant equal to 1. In a two-dimensional plane, a simultaneous flip of all coordinates in sign is ''not'' a parity transformation; it is the same as a 180\u00b0-[[rotation]].\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], wave functions that are unchanged by a parity transformation are described as [[Even and odd functions|even]] functions, while those that change sign under a parity transformation are odd functions.\n\n==Simple symmetry relations==\nUnder [[rotation]]s, classical geometrical objects can be classified into [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, and [[tensor]]s of higher rank. In [[classical physics]], physical configurations need to transform under [[group representation|representation]]s of every symmetry group.\n\n[[quantum mechanics|Quantum theory]] predicts that states in a [[Hilbert space]] do not need to transform under representations of the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations, but only under [[projective representation]]s.  The word ''projective'' refers to the fact that if one projects out the phase of each state, where we recall that the overall phase of a quantum state is not an observable, then a projective representation reduces to an ordinary representation.  All representations are also projective representations, but the converse is not true, therefore the projective representation condition on quantum states is weaker than the representation condition on classical states.\n\nThe projective representations of any group are isomorphic to the ordinary representations of a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of the group.  For example, [[projective representation]]s of the 3-dimensional rotation group, which is the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(3), are ordinary representations of the [[special unitary group]] SU(2) (see [[Representation theory of SU(2)]]).  Projective representations of the rotation group that are not representations are called [[spinor]]s, and so quantum states may transform not only as tensors but also as spinors.\n\nIf one adds to this a classification by parity, these can be extended, for example, into notions of\n*''scalars'' ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = +1}}) and ''[[pseudoscalar (physics)|pseudoscalar]]s'' ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = \u22121}}) which are rotationally invariant.\n*''vectors'' ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = \u22121}}) and ''axial vectors'' (also called ''[[pseudovector]]s'') ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = +1}}) which both transform as vectors under rotation.\n\nOne can define '''reflections''' such as\n\n:<math>V_x: \\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix}-x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix},</math>\n\nwhich also have negative determinant and form a valid parity transformation. Then, combining them with rotations (or successively performing ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-reflections) one can recover the particular parity transformation defined earlier. The first parity transformation given does not work in an even number of dimensions, though, because it results in a positive determinant. In even dimensions only the latter example of a parity transformation (or any reflection of an odd number of coordinates) can be used.\n\nParity forms the [[abelian group]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> due to the relation <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}^2 = \\hat{1}</math>. All Abelian groups have only one-dimensional [[irreducible representations]]. For <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math>, there are two irreducible representations: one is even under parity, <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}\\phi = +\\phi</math>, the other is odd, <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}\\phi = -\\phi</math>. These are useful in [[quantum mechanics]].  However, as is elaborated below, in quantum mechanics states need not transform under actual representations of parity but only under projective representations and so in principle a parity transformation may rotate a state by any [[phase (waves)|phase]].\n\n==Classical mechanics==\n\nNewton's equation of motion <math>\\vec{F} = m\\,\\vec{a}</math> (if the mass is constant) equates two vectors, and hence is invariant under parity. The law of gravity also involves only vectors and is also, therefore, invariant under parity.\n\nHowever, angular momentum <math>\\vec{L}</math> is an [[axial vector]],\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                      \\vec{L} &= \\vec{r}\\times\\vec{p} \\\\\n  \\hat{P}\\left(\\vec{L}\\right) &= -\\vec{r} \\times -\\vec{p} = \\vec{L}\n\\end{align}</math>.\n\nIn classical [[electrodynamics]], the charge density <math>\\rho</math> is a scalar, the electric field, <math>\\vec{E}</math>, and current <math>\\vec{j}</math> are vectors, but the magnetic field, <math>\\vec{H}</math> is an axial vector. However, [[Maxwell's equations]] are invariant under parity because the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of an axial vector is a vector.\n\n==Effect of spatial inversion on some variables of classical physics==\n\n===Even===\nClassical variables, predominantly scalar quantities, which do not change upon spatial inversion include:\n:<math>t</math>, the [[time]] when an event occurs\n:<math>m</math>, the [[mass]] of a particle\n:<math>E</math>, the [[energy]] of the particle\n:<math>P</math>, [[Power (physics)|power]] (rate of [[work (physics)|work]] done)\n:<math>\\rho</math>, the electric [[charge density]]\n:<math>V</math>, the [[electric potential]] ([[volt]]age)\n:<math>\\rho</math>, [[energy density]] of the [[electromagnetic field]]\n:<math>\\mathbf L</math>, the [[angular momentum]] of a particle (both [[orbital motion|orbital]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]])  (axial vector)\n:<math>\\mathbf B</math>, the [[magnetic field]] (axial vector)\n:<math>\\mathbf H</math>, the [[magnetic field#The Difference between B and H|auxiliary magnetic field]]\n:<math>\\mathbf M</math>, the [[magnetization]]\n:<math>T_{ij}</math>, [[Maxwell stress tensor]].\n:All masses, charges, coupling constants, and other physical constants, except those associated with the weak force\n\n===Odd===\nClassical variables, predominantly vector quantities, which have their sign flipped by spatial inversion include:\n:<math>h</math>, the [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]]\n:<math>\\Phi</math>, the [[magnetic flux]]\n:<math>\\mathbf x</math>, the [[position (vector)|position]] of a particle in three-space\n:<math>\\mathbf v</math>, the [[velocity]] of a particle\n:<math>\\mathbf a</math>, the [[acceleration]] of the particle\n:<math>\\mathbf p</math>, the [[linear momentum]] of a particle\n:<math>\\mathbf F</math>, the [[force (physics)|force]] exerted on a particle\n:<math>\\mathbf J</math>, the electric [[current density]]\n:<math>\\mathbf E</math>, the [[electric field]]\n:<math>\\mathbf D</math>, the [[electric displacement field]]\n:<math>\\mathbf P</math>, the [[electric polarization]]\n:<math>\\mathbf A</math>, the electromagnetic [[vector potential]]\n:<math>\\mathbf S</math>, [[Poynting vector]].\n\n==Quantum mechanics==\n\n===Possible eigenvalues===\n\n[[Image:parity 1drep.png|thumb|200px|right|Two dimensional representations of parity are given by a pair of quantum states which go into each other under parity. However, this representation can always be reduced to linear combinations of states, each of which is either even or odd under parity. One says that all [[irreducible representation]]s of parity are one-dimensional.]]\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], spacetime transformations act on [[quantum states]]. The parity transformation, <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}</math>, is a [[unitary operator]], in general acting on a state <math>\\psi</math> as follows: <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}\\, \\psi_{\\left(r\\right)} = e^{\\frac{i\\phi}{2}}\\psi_{\\left(-r\\right)}</math>.\n\nOne must then have <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}^2\\, \\psi_{\\left(r\\right)} = e^{i\\phi}\\psi_{\\left(r\\right)}</math>, since an overall phase is unobservable. The operator <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}^2</math>, which reverses the parity of a state twice, leaves the spacetime invariant, and so is an internal symmetry which rotates its eigenstates by phases <math>e^{i\\phi}</math>.  If <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}^2</math> is an element <math>e^{iQ}</math> of a continuous U(1) symmetry group of phase rotations, then  <math>e^{-iQ}</math>is part of this U(1) and so is also a symmetry.  In particular, we can define <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}' \\equiv \\hat{\\mathcal P}\\, e^{-\\frac{iQ}{2}}</math>, which is also a symmetry, and so we can choose to call <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}'</math> our parity operator, instead of <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}^2</math>.  Note that <math>{\\hat{\\mathcal P}'}^2 = 1</math> and so <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}'</math> has eigenvalues <math>\\pm 1</math>. Wave functions with eigenvalue +1 under a parity transformation are [[even and odd functions|even functions]], while eigenvalue \u22121 corresponds to odd functions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Ira N. |date=1991 |title=Quantum Chemistry |edition=4th |publisher=Prentice-Hall |page=163 |isbn=0-205-12770-3}}</ref> However, when no such symmetry group exists, it may be that all parity transformations have some eigenvalues which are phases other than  <math>\\pm 1</math>.\n\nFor electronic wavefunctions, even states are usually indicated by a subscript g for ''gerade'' (German: even) and odd states by a subscript u for ''ungerade'' (German: odd).

Thus the parity of such states is \u00b11. The parity of a multiparticle state is the product of the parities of each state; in other words parity is a multiplicative quantum number.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]s are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] (symmetric) under a parity transformation if <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}</math> [[commutator|commutes]] with the Hamiltonian. In non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]], this happens for any scalar potential, i.e., <math> V = V{\\left(r\\right)}</math>, hence the potential is spherically symmetric. The following facts can be easily proven:\n*If <math>\\left| \\varphi \\right\\rangle</math> and <math>\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle</math> have the same parity, then <math>\\left\\langle \\varphi \\left| \\hat{X} \\right| \\psi \\right\\rangle = 0</math> where <math>\\hat{X}</math> is the [[position operator]].\n*For a state <math>\\left|\\vec{L}, L_z\\right\\rangle</math> of orbital angular momentum <math>\\vec{L}</math> with z-axis projection <math>L_z</math>, then <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{P}} \\left|\\vec{L}, L_z\\right\\rangle = \\left(-1\\right)^{L} \\left|\\vec{L}, L_z\\right\\rangle</math>.\n*If <math>\\left[\\hat{H},\\hat{P}\\right] = 0 </math>, then atomic dipole transitions only occur between states of opposite parity.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last1=Bransden |first1=B.

It is \u22121 if an odd number of particles are in odd-parity states, and +1 otherwise. Different notations are in use to denote the parity of nuclei, atoms, and molecules.\n\n===Atoms===\n[[Atomic orbital]]s have parity (\u22121)<sup>\u2113</sup>, where the exponent \u2113 is the [[azimuthal quantum number]]. The parity is odd for orbitals p, f, \u2026 with \u2113 = 1, 3, \u2026, and an atomic state has odd parity if an odd number of electrons occupy these orbitals. For example, the ground state of the nitrogen atom has the electron configuration 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup>, and is identified by the term symbol <sup>4</sup>S<sup>o</sup>, where the superscript o denotes odd parity. However the third excited term at about 83,300&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> above the ground state has electron configuration 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>3s has even parity since there are only two 2p electrons, and its term symbol is <sup>4</sup>P (without an o superscript).<ref name=NIST>[http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/levels_form.html NIST Atomic Spectrum Database] To read the nitrogen atom energy levels, type \"N I\" in the Spectrum box and click on Retrieve data.</ref>\n\n===Molecules===\nOnly some molecules have a centre of symmetry, including all homonuclear [[diatomic molecule]]s as well as certain symmetric molecules such as [[ethylene]],  [[benzene]], [[xenon tetrafluoride]] and [[sulphur hexafluoride]]. For such centrosymmetric molecules, the parity of each [[molecular orbital]] is either g (gerade or even) or u (ungerade or odd). An electronic state is u if and only if it contains an odd number of electrons in u orbitals.\n\nFor molecules with no centre of symmetry, including all heteronuclear diatomics as well as the majority of polyatomics, inversion is not a symmetry operation and the orbitals and states cannot be described as even or odd.\n\n===Nuclei===\nIn atomic nuclei, the state of each nucleon (proton or neutron) has even or odd parity, and nucleon configurations can be predicted using the [[nuclear shell model]]. As for electrons in atoms, the nucleon state has odd overall parity if and only if the number of nucleons in odd-parity states is odd. The parity is usually written as a + (even) or \u2212 (odd) following the nuclear spin value. For example, the [[isotopes of oxygen]] include <sup>17</sup>O(5/2+), meaning that the spin is 5/2 and the parity is even. The shell model explains this because the first 16 nucleons are paired so that each pair has spin zero and even parity, and the last nucleon is in the 1d<sub>5/2</sub> shell, which has even parity since \u2113 = 2 for a d orbital.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cottingham |first1=W.N. |last2=Greenwood |first2=D.A. |date=1986 |title=An introduction to nuclear physics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-31960-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontonu0000cott/page/57 57] |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontonu0000cott/page/57 }}</ref>\n\n==Quantum field theory==\n:''The intrinsic parity assignments in this section are true for relativistic quantum mechanics as well as quantum field theory.''\n\nIf we can show that the [[vacuum state]] is invariant under parity, <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle = \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle</math>, the Hamiltonian is parity invariant <math>\\left[\\hat{H},\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}\\right]</math> and the quantization conditions remain unchanged under parity, then it follows that every state has [[good quantum number|good]] parity, and this parity is conserved in any reaction.\n\nTo show that [[quantum electrodynamics]] is invariant under parity, we have to prove that the action is invariant and the quantization is also invariant. For simplicity we will assume that [[canonical quantization]] is used; the vacuum state is then invariant under parity by construction.

The invariance of the canonical quantization procedure can be worked out, and turns out to depend on the transformation of the annihilation operator{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}:\n:'''Pa'''('''p''', \u00b1)'''P'''<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212'''a'''(\u2212'''p''', \u00b1)\nwhere '''p''' denotes the momentum of a photon and \u00b1 refers to its polarization state. This is equivalent to the statement that the photon has odd [[intrinsic parity]].

(''Details of [[spinor]]s are dealt with in the article on the ''[[Dirac equation]]'', where it is shown that [[fermion]]s and antifermions have opposite intrinsic parity.'')\n\nWith [[fermion]]s, there is a slight complication because there is more than one [[spin group]].\n\n==Parity in the standard model==\n\n===Fixing the global symmetries===\n{{See also|(\u22121)F|l1=(\u22121)<sup>F</sup>}}\nIn the [[Standard Model]] of fundamental interactions there are precisely three global internal [[U(1)]] symmetry groups available, with charges equal to the [[baryon]] number ''B'', the [[lepton]] number ''L'' and the [[electric charge]] ''Q''.  The product of the parity operator with any combination of these rotations is another parity operator.  It is conventional to choose one specific combination of these rotations to define a standard parity operator, and other parity operators are related to the standard one by internal rotations.  One way to fix a standard parity operator is to assign the parities of three particles with linearly independent charges ''B'', ''L'' and ''Q''.  In general, one assigns the parity of the most common massive particles, the [[proton]], the [[neutron]] and the [[electron]], to be +1.\n\n[[Steven Weinberg]] has shown that if {{nowrap|1='''P'''<sup>2</sup> = (\u22121)<sup>''F''</sup>}}, where ''F'' is the [[fermion]] [[number operator]], then, since the fermion number is the sum of the lepton number plus the baryon number, {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''B'' + ''L''}}, for all particles in the Standard Model and since lepton number and baryon number are charges ''Q'' of continuous symmetries ''e''<sup>''iQ''</sup>, it is possible to redefine the parity operator so that {{nowrap|1='''P'''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}.  However, if there exist [[Majorana fermion|Majorana]] [[neutrino]]s, which experimentalists today believe is possible, their fermion number is equal to one because they are neutrinos while their baryon and lepton numbers are zero because they are Majorana, and so (\u22121)<sup>''F''</sup> would not be embedded in a continuous symmetry group.  Thus Majorana neutrinos would have parity \u00b1''i''.\n\n===Parity of the pion===\nIn 1954, a paper by William Chinowsky and [[Jack Steinberger]] demonstrated that the [[pion]] has negative parity.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Chinowsky |first1=W.\n |last2=Steinberger |first2=J.\n |year=1954\n |title=Absorption of Negative Pions in Deuterium: Parity of the Pion\n |journal=[[Physical Review]]\n |volume=95 |issue= 6|pages=1561\u20131564\n |bibcode=1954PhRv...95.1561C\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.95.1561\n}}</ref> They studied the decay of an \"atom\" made from a [[deuteron]] ({{nuclide|hydrogen|2|charge=+|link=yes}}) and a negatively charged pion ({{subatomic particle|pion-}}) in a state with zero orbital [[angular momentum]] <math>L=0</math> into two [[neutron]]s (<math>n</math>).\n\nNeutrons are [[fermion]]s and so obey [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]], which implies that the final state is antisymmetric.  Using the fact that the deuteron has spin one and the pion spin zero together with the antisymmetry of the final state they concluded that the two neutrons must have orbital angular momentum <math>L=1</math>.  The total parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles and the extrinsic parity of the spherical harmonic function <math>\\left(-1\\right)^L</math>.  Since the orbital momentum changes from zero to one in this process,  if the process is to conserve the total parity then the products of the intrinsic parities of the initial and final particles must have opposite sign.  A deuteron nucleus is made from a proton and a neutron, and so using the aforementioned convention that protons and neutrons have intrinsic parities equal to <math>+1</math> they argued that the parity of the pion is equal to minus the product of the parities of the two neutrons divided by that of the proton and neutron in the deuteron, explicitly <math>\\frac{(-1)(1)^2}{(1)^2} = -1</math>.

In three dimensions, it can also refer to the simultaneous flip in the sign of all three spatial coordinates (a [[point reflection]]):\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}: \\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix}-x\\\\-y\\\\-z\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nIt can also be thought of as a test for [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] of a physical phenomenon, in that a parity inversion transforms a phenomenon into its mirror image. All fundamental interactions of [[elementary particle]]s, with the exception of the [[weak interaction]], are symmetric under parity. The weak interaction is chiral and thus provides a means for probing chirality in physics. In interactions that are symmetric under parity, such as electromagnetism in atomic and molecular physics, parity serves as a powerful controlling principle underlying quantum transitions.\n\nA matrix representation of '''P''' (in any number of dimensions) has [[determinant]] equal to \u22121, and hence is distinct from a [[rotation]], which has a determinant equal to 1. In a two-dimensional plane, a simultaneous flip of all coordinates in sign is ''not'' a parity transformation; it is the same as a 180\u00b0-[[rotation]].\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], wave functions that are unchanged by a parity transformation are described as [[Even and odd functions|even]] functions, while those that change sign under a parity transformation are odd functions.\n\n==Simple symmetry relations==\nUnder [[rotation]]s, classical geometrical objects can be classified into [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, and [[tensor]]s of higher rank. In [[classical physics]], physical configurations need to transform under [[group representation|representation]]s of every symmetry group.\n\n[[quantum mechanics|Quantum theory]] predicts that states in a [[Hilbert space]] do not need to transform under representations of the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations, but only under [[projective representation]]s.  The word ''projective'' refers to the fact that if one projects out the phase of each state, where we recall that the overall phase of a quantum state is not an observable, then a projective representation reduces to an ordinary representation.  All representations are also projective representations, but the converse is not true, therefore the projective representation condition on quantum states is weaker than the representation condition on classical states.\n\nThe projective representations of any group are isomorphic to the ordinary representations of a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of the group.  For example, [[projective representation]]s of the 3-dimensional rotation group, which is the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(3), are ordinary representations of the [[special unitary group]] SU(2) (see [[Representation theory of SU(2)]]).  Projective representations of the rotation group that are not representations are called [[spinor]]s, and so quantum states may transform not only as tensors but also as spinors.\n\nIf one adds to this a classification by parity, these can be extended, for example, into notions of\n*''scalars'' ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = +1}}) and ''[[pseudoscalar (physics)|pseudoscalar]]s'' ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = \u22121}}) which are rotationally invariant.\n*''vectors'' ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = \u22121}}) and ''axial vectors'' (also called ''[[pseudovector]]s'') ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = +1}}) which both transform as vectors under rotation.\n\nOne can define '''reflections''' such as\n\n:<math>V_x: \\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix}-x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix},</math>\n\nwhich also have negative determinant and form a valid parity transformation. Then, combining them with rotations (or successively performing ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-reflections) one can recover the particular parity transformation defined earlier. The first parity transformation given does not work in an even number of dimensions, though, because it results in a positive determinant. In even dimensions only the latter example of a parity transformation (or any reflection of an odd number of coordinates) can be used.\n\nParity forms the [[abelian group]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> due to the relation <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}^2 = \\hat{1}</math>. All Abelian groups have only one-dimensional [[irreducible representations]]. For <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math>, there are two irreducible representations: one is even under parity, <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}\\phi = +\\phi</math>, the other is odd, <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}\\phi = -\\phi</math>. These are useful in [[quantum mechanics]].  However, as is elaborated below, in quantum mechanics states need not transform under actual representations of parity but only under projective representations and so in principle a parity transformation may rotate a state by any [[phase (waves)|phase]].\n\n==Classical mechanics==\n\nNewton's equation of motion <math>\\vec{F} = m\\,\\vec{a}</math> (if the mass is constant) equates two vectors, and hence is invariant under parity. The law of gravity also involves only vectors and is also, therefore, invariant under parity.\n\nHowever, angular momentum <math>\\vec{L}</math> is an [[axial vector]],\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                      \\vec{L} &= \\vec{r}\\times\\vec{p} \\\\\n  \\hat{P}\\left(\\vec{L}\\right) &= -\\vec{r} \\times -\\vec{p} = \\vec{L}\n\\end{align}</math>.\n\nIn classical [[electrodynamics]], the charge density <math>\\rho</math> is a scalar, the electric field, <math>\\vec{E}</math>, and current <math>\\vec{j}</math> are vectors, but the magnetic field, <math>\\vec{H}</math> is an axial vector.

The operator <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}^2</math>, which reverses the parity of a state twice, leaves the spacetime invariant, and so is an internal symmetry which rotates its eigenstates by phases <math>e^{i\\phi}</math>.  If <math>\\hat{\\mathcal P}^2</math> is an element <math>e^{iQ}</math> of a continuous U(1) symmetry group of phase rotations, then  <math>e^{-iQ}</math>is part of this U(1) and so is also a symmetry.

In non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]], this happens for any scalar potential, i.e., <math> V = V{\\left(r\\right)}</math>, hence the potential is spherically symmetric. The following facts can be easily proven:\n*If <math>\\left| \\varphi \\right\\rangle</math> and <math>\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle</math> have the same parity, then <math>\\left\\langle \\varphi \\left| \\hat{X} \\right| \\psi \\right\\rangle = 0</math> where <math>\\hat{X}</math> is the [[position operator]].\n*For a state <math>\\left|\\vec{L}, L_z\\right\\rangle</math> of orbital angular momentum <math>\\vec{L}</math> with z-axis projection <math>L_z</math>, then <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{P}} \\left|\\vec{L}, L_z\\right\\rangle = \\left(-1\\right)^{L} \\left|\\vec{L}, L_z\\right\\rangle</math>.\n*If <math>\\left[\\hat{H},\\hat{P}\\right] = 0 </math>, then atomic dipole transitions only occur between states of opposite parity.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last1=Bransden |first1=B.

It is \u22121 if an odd number of particles are in odd-parity states, and +1 otherwise. Different notations are in use to denote the parity of nuclei, atoms, and molecules.\n\n===Atoms===\n[[Atomic orbital]]s have parity (\u22121)<sup>\u2113</sup>, where the exponent \u2113 is the [[azimuthal quantum number]]. The parity is odd for orbitals p, f, \u2026 with \u2113 = 1, 3, \u2026, and an atomic state has odd parity if an odd number of electrons occupy these orbitals. For example, the ground state of the nitrogen atom has the electron configuration 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup>, and is identified by the term symbol <sup>4</sup>S<sup>o</sup>, where the superscript o denotes odd parity. However the third excited term at about 83,300&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> above the ground state has electron configuration 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>3s has even parity since there are only two 2p electrons, and its term symbol is <sup>4</sup>P (without an o superscript).<ref name=NIST>[http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/levels_form.html NIST Atomic Spectrum Database] To read the nitrogen atom energy levels, type \"N I\" in the Spectrum box and click on Retrieve data.</ref>\n\n===Molecules===\nOnly some molecules have a centre of symmetry, including all homonuclear [[diatomic molecule]]s as well as certain symmetric molecules such as [[ethylene]],  [[benzene]], [[xenon tetrafluoride]] and [[sulphur hexafluoride]]. For such centrosymmetric molecules, the parity of each [[molecular orbital]] is either g (gerade or even) or u (ungerade or odd). An electronic state is u if and only if it contains an odd number of electrons in u orbitals.\n\nFor molecules with no centre of symmetry, including all heteronuclear diatomics as well as the majority of polyatomics, inversion is not a symmetry operation and the orbitals and states cannot be described as even or odd.\n\n===Nuclei===\nIn atomic nuclei, the state of each nucleon (proton or neutron) has even or odd parity, and nucleon configurations can be predicted using the [[nuclear shell model]]. As for electrons in atoms, the nucleon state has odd overall parity if and only if the number of nucleons in odd-parity states is odd. The parity is usually written as a + (even) or \u2212 (odd) following the nuclear spin value. For example, the [[isotopes of oxygen]] include <sup>17</sup>O(5/2+), meaning that the spin is 5/2 and the parity is even. The shell model explains this because the first 16 nucleons are paired so that each pair has spin zero and even parity, and the last nucleon is in the 1d<sub>5/2</sub> shell, which has even parity since \u2113 = 2 for a d orbital.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cottingham |first1=W.N. |last2=Greenwood |first2=D.A. |date=1986 |title=An introduction to nuclear physics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-31960-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontonu0000cott/page/57 57] |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontonu0000cott/page/57 }}</ref>\n\n==Quantum field theory==\n:''The intrinsic parity assignments in this section are true for relativistic quantum mechanics as well as quantum field theory.''\n\nIf we can show that the [[vacuum state]] is invariant under parity, <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle = \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle</math>, the Hamiltonian is parity invariant <math>\\left[\\hat{H},\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}\\right]</math> and the quantization conditions remain unchanged under parity, then it follows that every state has [[good quantum number|good]] parity, and this parity is conserved in any reaction.\n\nTo show that [[quantum electrodynamics]] is invariant under parity, we have to prove that the action is invariant and the quantization is also invariant. For simplicity we will assume that [[canonical quantization]] is used; the vacuum state is then invariant under parity by construction. The invariance of the action follows from the classical invariance of Maxwell's equations. The invariance of the canonical quantization procedure can be worked out, and turns out to depend on the transformation of the annihilation operator{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}:\n:'''Pa'''('''p''', \u00b1)'''P'''<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212'''a'''(\u2212'''p''', \u00b1)\nwhere '''p''' denotes the momentum of a photon and \u00b1 refers to its polarization state. This is equivalent to the statement that the photon has odd [[intrinsic parity]]. Similarly all [[vector boson]]s can be shown to have odd intrinsic parity, and all [[pseudovector meson|axial-vectors]] to have even intrinsic parity.\n\nA straightforward extension of these arguments to scalar field theories shows that scalars have even parity, since\n:'''Pa'''('''p''')'''P'''<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''a'''(\u2212'''p''').\nThis is true even for a complex scalar field. (''Details of [[spinor]]s are dealt with in the article on the ''[[Dirac equation]]'', where it is shown that [[fermion]]s and antifermions have opposite intrinsic parity.'')\n\nWith [[fermion]]s, there is a slight complication because there is more than one [[spin group]].\n\n==Parity in the standard model==\n\n===Fixing the global symmetries===\n{{See also|(\u22121)F|l1=(\u22121)<sup>F</sup>}}\nIn the [[Standard Model]] of fundamental interactions there are precisely three global internal [[U(1)]] symmetry groups available, with charges equal to the [[baryon]] number ''B'', the [[lepton]] number ''L'' and the [[electric charge]] ''Q''.  The product of the parity operator with any combination of these rotations is another parity operator.  It is conventional to choose one specific combination of these rotations to define a standard parity operator, and other parity operators are related to the standard one by internal rotations.  One way to fix a standard parity operator is to assign the parities of three particles with linearly independent charges ''B'', ''L'' and ''Q''.  In general, one assigns the parity of the most common massive particles, the [[proton]], the [[neutron]] and the [[electron]], to be +1.\n\n[[Steven Weinberg]] has shown that if {{nowrap|1='''P'''<sup>2</sup> = (\u22121)<sup>''F''</sup>}}, where ''F'' is the [[fermion]] [[number operator]], then, since the fermion number is the sum of the lepton number plus the baryon number, {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''B'' + ''L''}}, for all particles in the Standard Model and since lepton number and baryon number are charges ''Q'' of continuous symmetries ''e''<sup>''iQ''</sup>, it is possible to redefine the parity operator so that {{nowrap|1='''P'''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}.  However, if there exist [[Majorana fermion|Majorana]] [[neutrino]]s, which experimentalists today believe is possible, their fermion number is equal to one because they are neutrinos while their baryon and lepton numbers are zero because they are Majorana, and so (\u22121)<sup>''F''</sup> would not be embedded in a continuous symmetry group.  Thus Majorana neutrinos would have parity \u00b1''i''.\n\n===Parity of the pion===\nIn 1954, a paper by William Chinowsky and [[Jack Steinberger]] demonstrated that the [[pion]] has negative parity.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Chinowsky |first1=W.\n |last2=Steinberger |first2=J.\n |year=1954\n |title=Absorption of Negative Pions in Deuterium: Parity of the Pion\n |journal=[[Physical Review]]\n |volume=95 |issue= 6|pages=1561\u20131564\n |bibcode=1954PhRv...95.1561C\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.95.1561\n}}</ref> They studied the decay of an \"atom\" made from a [[deuteron]] ({{nuclide|hydrogen|2|charge=+|link=yes}}) and a negatively charged pion ({{subatomic particle|pion-}}) in a state with zero orbital [[angular momentum]] <math>L=0</math> into two [[neutron]]s (<math>n</math>).\n\nNeutrons are [[fermion]]s and so obey [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]], which implies that the final state is antisymmetric.  Using the fact that the deuteron has spin one and the pion spin zero together with the antisymmetry of the final state they concluded that the two neutrons must have orbital angular momentum <math>L=1</math>.  The total parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles and the extrinsic parity of the spherical harmonic function <math>\\left(-1\\right)^L</math>.  Since the orbital momentum changes from zero to one in this process,  if the process is to conserve the total parity then the products of the intrinsic parities of the initial and final particles must have opposite sign.  A deuteron nucleus is made from a proton and a neutron, and so using the aforementioned convention that protons and neutrons have intrinsic parities equal to <math>+1</math> they argued that the parity of the pion is equal to minus the product of the parities of the two neutrons divided by that of the proton and neutron in the deuteron, explicitly <math>\\frac{(-1)(1)^2}{(1)^2} = -1</math>. Thus they concluded that the pion is a [[pseudoscalar particle]].\n\n===Parity violation===<!-- This section is linked from [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] -->\n{{See also|Wu experiment}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Parity clocks - P-conservation.svg<!-- file name only; no \"File:\" or \"Image:\" prefix -->\n| width1    = 300\n| image2    = Parity clocks - P-violation.svg<!-- file name only; no \"File:\" or \"Image:\" prefix -->\n| width2    = 300\n| footer = '''Top:''' P-symmetry: A clock built like its mirrored image behaves like the mirrored image of the original clock.<br>'''Bottom:''' P-asymmetry: A clock built like its mirrored image does ''not'' behave like the mirrored image of the original clock.\n}}\n\nAlthough parity is conserved in  [[electromagnetism]], [[strong interactions]] and [[gravity]], it is violated in [[weak interactions]]. The Standard Model incorporates '''parity violation''' by expressing the weak interaction as a [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] gauge interaction.

This implies that parity is not a symmetry of our universe, unless a [[Mirror matter|hidden mirror sector]] exists in which parity is violated in the opposite way.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, it had been suggested by several scientists that parity might not be conserved (in different contexts), but without solid evidence these suggestions were not considered important.

When used on their own without such context, the codes are often assumed to refer to the class of [[Elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]], two-state one-dimensional cellular automata with a (contiguous) three-cell neighbourhood, which Wolfram extensively investigates in his book.  Notable rules in this class include [[rule 30]], [[rule 110]], and [[rule 184]]. [[Rule 90]] is also interesting because it creates [[Pascal's Triangle]] modulo 2.

For example, rule 110 above is isomorphic with the rules 124, 137 and 193, <!-- I think I got these right, please fix if not --> which can be obtained from the original by left-right reflection and by renumbering the states.  By convention, each such isomorphism class is represented by the rule with the lowest code number in it.

Following its online premiere in March 2014, it was released independently on April 22, 2014 before being re-released in conjunction with [[300 Entertainment]] on December 15, 2014. The song was well received by critics who praised the vocals and production for being cheery and infectious.\n\n\"Trap Queen\" was a [[sleeper hit]], becoming Fetty Wap's first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in mid-2015 and ultimately went on to be a top ten hit, peaking at number two; the song spent 25 consecutive weeks in the top ten. Outside the United States, \"Trap Queen\" peaked within the top ten of the charts in Denmark and the United Kingdom. An accompanying [[music video]] for the song, directed by Nitt Da Gritt, was released on his [[YouTube]] page that features Wap and his girlfriend partying at their apartment. The song was written about his close friend, Mira Ginor, the real \"Trap Queen\". He first performed the song on television at the [[2015 MTV Movie Awards]] with [[Fall Out Boy]] and would make later appearances at ''[[The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon]]'', ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', ''[[Nick Cannon Presents Wild 'n Out]]'' and the [[BET Awards 2015]] to perform the song.
