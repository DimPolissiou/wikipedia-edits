In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers)<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.</ref>. \n\nThe Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n===County of Toulouse===\n{{further|County of Toulouse}}\n[[File:Raymond IV of Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]] was a leader of the [[First Crusade]]]]\nThe town became the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] during the [[Carolingian era]].\n\nIn 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.\n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started.

The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Within the Kingdom of France===\n\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the [[kingdom of France]] and declared a \"[[Crown lands of France#Reign of Philip III|royal city]]\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1323 the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] was created in Toulouse to preserve the [[Lyric poetry|lyric art]] of the [[troubadour]]s by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of [[Occitania|Occitan]] literary culture for the next hundred years. The [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated [[Leys d'amor|treatise]] on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the [[Floral Games]] (''Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux''), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\n\nThe 14th century brought a [[pogrom]] against Toulouse's Jewish population by [[crusades|Crusaders]] in 1320,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/.\" | title=Goldberg, Jeffrey. \"Is it Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?\" The Atlantic.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) \n\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched.

Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.\n\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].\n\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n===Mayors===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by [[Charlemagne]] to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\n\n[[Toulouse Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Stephen]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse]]. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of [[Southern French Gothic]], at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the largest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\n\nThe [[Church of the Jacobins|convent of the Jacobins]] (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the [[Albi Cathedral]], the pinnacle of [[Southern French Gothic]] architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the [[Dominican order]], for not having obtained the relics of [[Saint Dominic]] kept in Bologna, [[Pope Urban V]] made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n===Civilian buildings===\n[[File:Vx-raisin_(2).jpg|thumb|Renaissance windows at the [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] (16th C.)]]\n\nThe [[Capitole de Toulouse]] (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole]] (opera house). It is located on the [[Place du Capitole]], a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (''place royale''). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (''le donjon''), which housed the archives of the [[Capitouls]]; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\n\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier|h\u00f4tels particuliers]]'') or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the [[H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]], the [[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]], the [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]], the [[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]]...\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n[[File:Le_pont_Neuf_\u00e0_Toulouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]] (16th-17th c.)]]\n\nThe banks of the [[Garonne|Garonne river]] offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]], it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the [[Bazacle]] is a ford across the [[Garonne]] river, in the 12th century the [[Bazacle Milling Company]] was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the [[H\u00f4pital de La Grave]]. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\n\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the [[Canal du Midi]] bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996.\n\nThe ''[[Jardin des Plantes, Toulouse|Jardin des Plantes]]'' is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a [[botanical garden]] (early 19th century). \n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 de l'espace]] (Space City) is a [[theme park]] of space exploration.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Sights and monuments of Toulouse\">\nSaint_Sernin.jpg|[[Saint-Sernin basilica]] and [[church of the Jacobins]]\nBasilique Saint-Sernin de Toulouse - exposition ouest-1-.jpg|[[Saint-Sernin basilica]] (11th\u201313th c.)\nChevet de St Sernin.jpg|[[Saint-Sernin basilica]] (11th\u201313th c.)\nFa\u00e7ade nord de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Toulouse.jpg|[[Toulouse Cathedral|Saint \u00c9tienne cathedral]] (13th\u201317th c.)\nNef-jacobins-toulouse.jpg|[[Church of the Jacobins]] (13th c.)\nEglise des Jacobins toulouse.jpg|[[Church of the Jacobins]] \"palm tree\" vault (13th c.)\nClo\u00eetre et clocher des Jacobins.jpg|[[Church of the Jacobins]] bell tower (13th c.) and cloister (14th c.)\nImmeuble dit Maison romano-gothique - Toulouse.jpg|Romano-gothic house (14th c.)\nAugustins - Grand clo\u00eetre et clocher des Augustins de Toulouse.jpg|[[Mus\u00e9e des Augustins]] former convent (14th c.) housing a fine arts museum \nAugustins - Gargouilles de l'ancienne \u00e9glise des Cordeliers.jpg|[[Mus\u00e9e des Augustins]] cloister (14th c.) with display of [[gargoyles]] salvaged from demolished churches\nEglise Notre-Dame du Taur - Facade.jpg|Church of [[Notre-Dame du Taur]]: clocher-mur facade (14th c.)\n2 rue Saint-Rome - Tour Serta.jpg|Serta tower (15th\u201316th c.)\nToulouse - Maison Pierre Delfau - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|H\u00f4tel Delfau (15th c.)\nMus\u00e9e_Saint-Raymond_-_Toulouse.jpg|Saint-Raymond museum, former college of the university (1523)\nCapitole Toulouse - Le donjon.jpg|Former tower of the [[Capitouls]] (1525)\nBachelier - H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat - Toulouse - La cour d'honneur.jpg|Renaissance courtyard of the[[H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]] (16th c.)\nAssezat-02(12).jpg|Renaissance portal of the [[h\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]] (16th c.)\nFelzins-facade.jpg|Renaissance portal of the [[H\u00f4tel de Felzins|h\u00f4tel Molinier]](16th c.)\nAncien petit S\u00e9minaire de l'Esquile.jpg|Renaissance portal (16th c.) of a college of the [[University of Toulouse|University]]\nToulouse-portail-dalbade.jpg|Renaissance Portal of the Dalbade Church (16th c.)\nHotel_de_Bagis_-_Porte_des_vieillards.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]]' Renaissance door (16th or 17th c.)\nCapitole de Toulouse - Cour Henri IV - portail de Nicolas Bachelier.jpg|[[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]]'s Renaissance portal in the courtyard (16th-17th c.)\nToulouse-portail-Fermat.jpg|Renaissance portal of the former Jesuit college (1605)\nToulouse-portail-bernuy.jpg|Gothic and Renaissance portal of the [[h\u00f4tel de Bernuy]] (16th c.)\nCour de Bernuy.jpg|Renaissance courtyard of the [[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]] (16th c.)\nBernuy-tour1.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]] tower (16th c.)\nH\u00f4tel d'Arnaud de Brucelles - La tour.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel de Brucelles]] tower (16th c.)\nH\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] (16th c.)\nL'h\u00f4tel du vieux raisin.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] Renaissance courtyard (16th c.)\nLe Pont-Neuf de Toulouse.jpg|[[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont neuf]] (16th\u201317th c.)\nH\u00f4tel Pierre Com\u00e8re.jpg|H\u00f4tel Com\u00e8re (17th c.)\nHotel de Caulet-Resseguier (Toulouse).jpg|H\u00f4tel de Resseguier (17th c.)\nBonfontan-06(1).jpg|H\u00f4tel de Bonfontan (18th c.)\nH\u00f4tel d'Espie.JPG|H\u00f4tel d'Espie (18th c.)\nCapitole-27.jpg|[[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]] \u2013 city hall (18th c.)\nJuin 012(1).jpg|Capitole square (19th c.)\nMaison en terre cuite de Virebent, rue des Marchands.jpg|Immeuble des Cariatides, terracotta fa\u00e7ade by [[:fr:Auguste Virebent]] (19th c.)\nMaison Lamothe (Toulouse).jpg|Lamothe house, terracotta fa\u00e7ade (19th c.)\nHalle aux grains Toulouse.jpg|Halle aux Grains concert hall (19th c.)

The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n===County of Toulouse===\n{{further|County of Toulouse}}\n[[File:Raymond IV of Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]] was a leader of the [[First Crusade]]]]\nThe town became the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] during the [[Carolingian era]].\n\nIn 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.\n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started. They found home in [[Church of the Jacobins|''Les Jacobins'']]. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Within the Kingdom of France===\n\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the [[kingdom of France]] and declared a \"[[Crown lands of France#Reign of Philip III|royal city]]\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1323 the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] was created in Toulouse to preserve the [[Lyric poetry|lyric art]] of the [[troubadour]]s by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of [[Occitania|Occitan]] literary culture for the next hundred years. The [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated [[Leys d'amor|treatise]] on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the [[Floral Games]] (''Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux''), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\n\nThe 14th century brought a [[pogrom]] against Toulouse's Jewish population by [[crusades|Crusaders]] in 1320,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/.\" | title=Goldberg, Jeffrey. \"Is it Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?\" The Atlantic.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) \n\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the [[Rapid transit|underground]] was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourlafrance.com/france-city/toulouse-france/toulouse-politics.htm |title=Toulouse politics information |publisher=Bonjourlafrance.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (''[[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel]]'') in Paris, the French equivalent of the American [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].\n\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.\n\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].\n\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n===Mayors===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by [[Charlemagne]] to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\n\n[[Toulouse Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Stephen]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse]]. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of [[Southern French Gothic]], at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the largest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\n\nThe [[Church of the Jacobins|convent of the Jacobins]] (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the [[Albi Cathedral]], the pinnacle of [[Southern French Gothic]] architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the [[Dominican order]], for not having obtained the relics of [[Saint Dominic]] kept in Bologna, [[Pope Urban V]] made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n===Civilian buildings===\n[[File:Vx-raisin_(2).jpg|thumb|Renaissance windows at the [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] (16th C.)]]\n\nThe [[Capitole de Toulouse]] (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole]] (opera house). It is located on the [[Place du Capitole]], a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (''place royale''). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (''le donjon''), which housed the archives of the [[Capitouls]]; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\n\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier|h\u00f4tels particuliers]]'') or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the [[H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]], the [[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]], the [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]], the [[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]]...\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n[[File:Le_pont_Neuf_\u00e0_Toulouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]] (16th-17th c.)]]\n\nThe banks of the [[Garonne|Garonne river]] offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]], it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the [[Bazacle]] is a ford across the [[Garonne]] river, in the 12th century the [[Bazacle Milling Company]] was the first recorded European joint-stock company.

It is divided into three groups: [[Austrian Regional League East|East]] ({{lang|de|Ost}}), covering the [[States of Austria|states]] of [[Vienna]], [[Lower Austria]] and [[Burgenland]]; [[Austrian Regional League Central|Central]] ({{lang|de|Mitte}}), covering the states of [[Styria]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Upper Austria]] and the exclave of [[East Tyrol]]; and [[Austrian Regional League West|Eliteliga West]], covering the states of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] (with the exception of East Tyrol) and [[Vorarlberg]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Tauernliga and Arlbergliga ===\nWith introduction of the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Staatsliga A]] as the first division and the [[Austrian Football Second League|Staatsliga B]] as the second division of Austrian football in the 1949\u201350 season, also the teams from the Austrian states were allowed to play for the first time again in the highest leagues since the end of the second world war. This entailed also a change of the categorization in the amateur football. While Central and Eastern Austrian football teams played in the respective national leagues, from which the champions got promoted either directly or by play-offs (Relegationsspiele) to the Staatsliga B, the Western states did not participate in the Staatsliga B.\n\nIn 1949\u201350 the teams from Carinthia state ({{lang-de|K\u00e4rnten}}) and Salzburg already played in the again-created Tauernliga and from 1955\u201356 to 1958\u201359 season in the Tauernliga South (Carinthia) and Tauernliga North (Salzburg). Besides the Arlbergliga consisted from 1950\u201351 to 1959\u201360 the clubs from Tyrol state ({{lang-de|Tirol}}) and Vorarlberg state. These leagues can be regarded as second divisions (apart from the Staatsliga B) since their champions played in direct duels for promotion to the Staatsliga A.\n\n===Champions===\n<div style=\"float:left;text-align:center;padding-right:15px\">\n{| style=\"border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#808080;background-color:#EFEFEF\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"800px\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n!

For this reason the champion of the Salzburger Landesliga  was entitled to deny the qualification matches against the champion of the Arlbergliga.\n\n===The Regionalliga and the Alpenliga===\n[[File:RL Einteilung AT.PNG|thumb|right|Each Regionalligas coverage.]]\nIn the season of 1959\u201360, the [[Austrian Regionalliga East|Eastern]] and [[Austrian Regionalliga Central|Central Regionalligen]] were established and one year later the [[Austrian Regionalliga West|Western Regionalliga]]. The Regionalligen counted up to the season of 1973\u201374 as football's second division in Austria. The respective champions were allowed to get promoted directly to the top level. In 1974\u201375 the introduction of the first and second [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] happened, with in each case 10 clubs and to the abolish of the Western and Central Regionalligen. For the promotion to the 2nd Bundesliga, the champion of the Eastern Regionalliga, which was allowed to move upwards directly, and which the champions of the State Leagues ({{lang-de|Landesligen}}) of Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Carinthia, Upper Austria ({{lang-de|Ober\u00f6sterreich}}) and Styria ({{lang-de|Steiermark}}) those Play Offs ({{lang-de|Relegationsspiele}}) had to complete in each case. In the 1977\u201378 season, the states of  Salzburg, Tirol and Vorarlberg merged their Landesligen to [[Alpenliga (football)|Alpenliga]] as the 3rd division. In the 1980\u201381 season, the Western Regionalliga was once again introduced as the third division. The Eastern Regionalliga championship was not held from 1980\u201381 to 1983\u201384 and it would not be until the 1984\u201385 season that it would be reintroduced. Up until the 1995\u201396 season, the champions of the Western and Eastern Regionalligen earned a direct promotion to the 2nd Bundesliga. The Central Regionalliga, however, would not be reintroduced until the 1994\u201395 season. The champions of the regional organizations, the state football associations ({{lang-de|Landesverb\u00e4nde}}) of Upper Austria, Carinthia (with East Tyrol ({{lang-de|Osttirol}})) and Styria had their only promotional spot to the 2nd division decided in play off matches.\n\nBetween the 1996\u201397 and 2003\u201304 seasons, the three champions of the Regionalligen together with the last one of the First Division (since the renaming of the First Division as [[Austrian Football Second League|Erste Liga]] the second highest division in Austria) played those Play Off matches to accomplish the two remaining promotional/relegation spots. After an expansion of the First Division to twelve clubs it was decided that - from the 2005\u201306 season - due to deprivation of pro league licenses ({{lang-de|Lizenzentz\u00fcgen}}) (at the time there were 10 slots), the winners of the regional leagues went up directly again. The First Division contracted back to ten teams in 2009\u201310, thus the number of promotions to and relegations from the second tier were reduced to two. Until 2013\u201314 one conference winner played the bottom First Division team, while the other conference winners contested the other promotion spot.\n\nUntil 2014\u201315 two teams are relegated from and promoted to the First Division. In 2014\u201315 the Western champions were directly promoted while those from the East and Central contested the other promotion place. In 2015\u201316 all three division winners were promoted to fill vacancies in the second tier<ref>{{cite news|title=Lizenz: Entscheidung bei Austria Klagenfurt gefallen|url=http://sportnet.at/home/fussball/ersteliga/4999142/Lizenz_Entscheidung-bei-Austria-Klagenfurt-gefallen|work=sportnet.at|date=30 May 2016|language=German}}</ref> and 2016\u201317 only the Central winners were promoted as the Eastern and Western champions declined promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysportaustria.at/bundesliga-at/lizenzierungsverfahren-201718-22-lizenzantraege-eingegangen/ |title=Lizensierungsverfahren 2017/18 \u2013 22 Lizenzantr\u00e4ge eingegangen |date=16 March 2017 |publisher=Sky Sports Austria |language=German}}</ref> At the end of 2017\u201318 all three Regionalliga champions and six other licensed teams went up when the second division, now the Second League, expanded from 10 to 16 clubs.\n\n===Champions (1960\u20132019)===\n<div style=\"float:left;text-align:center;padding-right:15px\">\n{| style=\"border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#808080;background-color:#EFEFEF\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"800px\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n!

It is divided into three groups: [[Austrian Regional League East|East]] ({{lang|de|Ost}}), covering the [[States of Austria|states]] of [[Vienna]], [[Lower Austria]] and [[Burgenland]]; [[Austrian Regional League Central|Central]] ({{lang|de|Mitte}}), covering the states of [[Styria]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Upper Austria]] and the exclave of [[East Tyrol]]; and [[Austrian Regional League West|Eliteliga West]], covering the states of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] (with the exception of East Tyrol) and [[Vorarlberg]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Tauernliga and Arlbergliga ===\nWith introduction of the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Staatsliga A]] as the first division and the [[Austrian Football Second League|Staatsliga B]] as the second division of Austrian football in the 1949\u201350 season, also the teams from the Austrian states were allowed to play for the first time again in the highest leagues since the end of the second world war. This entailed also a change of the categorization in the amateur football. While Central and Eastern Austrian football teams played in the respective national leagues, from which the champions got promoted either directly or by play-offs (Relegationsspiele) to the Staatsliga B, the Western states did not participate in the Staatsliga B.\n\nIn 1949\u201350 the teams from Carinthia state ({{lang-de|K\u00e4rnten}}) and Salzburg already played in the again-created Tauernliga and from 1955\u201356 to 1958\u201359 season in the Tauernliga South (Carinthia) and Tauernliga North (Salzburg). Besides the Arlbergliga consisted from 1950\u201351 to 1959\u201360 the clubs from Tyrol state ({{lang-de|Tirol}}) and Vorarlberg state. These leagues can be regarded as second divisions (apart from the Staatsliga B) since their champions played in direct duels for promotion to the Staatsliga A.\n\n===Champions===\n<div style=\"float:left;text-align:center;padding-right:15px\">\n{| style=\"border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#808080;background-color:#EFEFEF\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"800px\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n!

For this reason the champion of the Salzburger Landesliga  was entitled to deny the qualification matches against the champion of the Arlbergliga.\n\n===The Regionalliga and the Alpenliga===\n[[File:RL Einteilung AT.PNG|thumb|right|Each Regionalligas coverage.]]\nIn the season of 1959\u201360, the [[Austrian Regionalliga East|Eastern]] and [[Austrian Regionalliga Central|Central Regionalligen]] were established and one year later the [[Austrian Regionalliga West|Western Regionalliga]]. The Regionalligen counted up to the season of 1973\u201374 as football's second division in Austria. The respective champions were allowed to get promoted directly to the top level. In 1974\u201375 the introduction of the first and second [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] happened, with in each case 10 clubs and to the abolish of the Western and Central Regionalligen. For the promotion to the 2nd Bundesliga, the champion of the Eastern Regionalliga, which was allowed to move upwards directly, and which the champions of the State Leagues ({{lang-de|Landesligen}}) of Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Carinthia, Upper Austria ({{lang-de|Ober\u00f6sterreich}}) and Styria ({{lang-de|Steiermark}}) those Play Offs ({{lang-de|Relegationsspiele}}) had to complete in each case. In the 1977\u201378 season, the states of  Salzburg, Tirol and Vorarlberg merged their Landesligen to [[Alpenliga (football)|Alpenliga]] as the 3rd division. In the 1980\u201381 season, the Western Regionalliga was once again introduced as the third division. The Eastern Regionalliga championship was not held from 1980\u201381 to 1983\u201384 and it would not be until the 1984\u201385 season that it would be reintroduced. Up until the 1995\u201396 season, the champions of the Western and Eastern Regionalligen earned a direct promotion to the 2nd Bundesliga. The Central Regionalliga, however, would not be reintroduced until the 1994\u201395 season. The champions of the regional organizations, the state football associations ({{lang-de|Landesverb\u00e4nde}}) of Upper Austria, Carinthia (with East Tyrol ({{lang-de|Osttirol}})) and Styria had their only promotional spot to the 2nd division decided in play off matches.\n\nBetween the 1996\u201397 and 2003\u201304 seasons, the three champions of the Regionalligen together with the last one of the First Division (since the renaming of the First Division as [[Austrian Football Second League|Erste Liga]] the second highest division in Austria) played those Play Off matches to accomplish the two remaining promotional/relegation spots. After an expansion of the First Division to twelve clubs it was decided that - from the 2005\u201306 season - due to deprivation of pro league licenses ({{lang-de|Lizenzentz\u00fcgen}}) (at the time there were 10 slots), the winners of the regional leagues went up directly again. The First Division contracted back to ten teams in 2009\u201310, thus the number of promotions to and relegations from the second tier were reduced to two. Until 2013\u201314 one conference winner played the bottom First Division team, while the other conference winners contested the other promotion spot.\n\nUntil 2014\u201315 two teams are relegated from and promoted to the First Division. In 2014\u201315 the Western champions were directly promoted while those from the East and Central contested the other promotion place. In 2015\u201316 all three division winners were promoted to fill vacancies in the second tier<ref>{{cite news|title=Lizenz: Entscheidung bei Austria Klagenfurt gefallen|url=http://sportnet.at/home/fussball/ersteliga/4999142/Lizenz_Entscheidung-bei-Austria-Klagenfurt-gefallen|work=sportnet.at|date=30 May 2016|language=German}}</ref> and 2016\u201317 only the Central winners were promoted as the Eastern and Western champions declined promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysportaustria.at/bundesliga-at/lizenzierungsverfahren-201718-22-lizenzantraege-eingegangen/ |title=Lizensierungsverfahren 2017/18 \u2013 22 Lizenzantr\u00e4ge eingegangen |date=16 March 2017 |publisher=Sky Sports Austria |language=German}}</ref> At the end of 2017\u201318 all three Regionalliga champions and six other licensed teams went up when the second division, now the Second League, expanded from 10 to 16 clubs.\n\n===Champions (1960\u20132019)===\n<div style=\"float:left;text-align:center;padding-right:15px\">\n{| style=\"border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#808080;background-color:#EFEFEF\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"800px\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n!

It is believed therefore that the name Hikkaduwa means ''sword of knowledge''.\nThere is an alternative meaning for the name Hikkaduwa as it also means \"crushing coral reefs\". In Hikkaduwa, a layer of fossilized coral reefs is present below several feet of the soil surface. Before the tourism industry, many people used to extract quicklime by burning fossil corals. Even though the live coral reef was saved due to eco-tourism, nearby villages similar to Paralliya, not only fossilized corral but live corals in the ocean also had been used to extract quicklime.\n\n==Transport==\nHikkaduwa is located on the [[Coastal Line (Sri Lanka)|Coastal]] or Southern Rail Line (connecting [[Colombo]] through to [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]]). \nIt is also located on the [[A2 highway (Sri Lanka)|A2 highway]], connecting [[Colombo]] to [[Wellawaya]], which runs mostly parallel to the shore, through the town.\n\n==Economy==\nHikkaduwa's economy was traditionally based on fishing and coconut cultivation. This was replaced by tourism when its golden sandy beaches were discovered. It is a well-known international destination for board-surfing. The town was featured in an episode of Anthony Bourdain's television show ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations|No Reservations]]''.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nHikkaduwa was affected by the [[tsunami]] caused by the [[Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Sri Lanka|2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] along with nearby villages Telwatta, Paraliya ([[Queen of the Sea rail disaster]]), Dodanduwa, Kahawa and [[Rathgama]].

According to Stuart\u2019s later account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, who died three years later.

{"title_page": "Politics of Vatican City", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n{{Politics of Vatican City}}\n{{Vatican City sidebar}}\nThe '''politics of Vatican City''' take place in a framework of a [[Theocracy#Holy See (Vatican City)|theocratic]] [[Absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[elective monarchy]], in which the Pope, religiously speaking, the leader of the [[Catholic Church]] and Bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], exercises [[ex officio]] supreme legislative, executive, and judicial power over the [[Vatican City]]<ref>[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 1, No. 1</ref> (an entity distinct from the [[Holy See]]), a rare case of non-hereditary monarchy.\n\nThe pope is elected in the [[papal election|Conclave]], composed of all the [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal elector]]s (now limited to all the cardinals below the age of 80), [[sede vacante|after the death]] or [[papal resignation|resignation]] of the previous Pope. The Conclave is held in the [[Sistine Chapel]], where all the electors are locked in (Latin ''cum clave'') until the election for which a two-thirds majority is required. The faithful can follow the results of the polls (usually two in the morning and two in the evening, until election) by a chimney-top, visible from [[St. Peter's Square]]: in a stove attached to the chimney are burnt the voting papers, and additives make the resulting smoke black (''fumata nera'') in case of no election, white (''fumata bianca'') when the new pope is finally elected. The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals|Dean of the Sacred College]] (''Cardinale Decano'') will then ask the freshly elected pope to choose his pastoral name, and as soon as the pope is dressed with the white [[cassock]], the [[Cardinal protodeacon#Catholic Church|Senior Cardinal-Deacon]] (''Cardinale Protodiacono'') appears on the major balcony of St. Peter's fa\u00e7ade to introduce the new pope<ref>Ap. Const. Universi Dominici Gregis n. 89</ref> with the famous [[Latin]] sentence\n''Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum: [[habemus papam]].''(I announce to you a great joy: We have a Pope) The term \"Holy See\" refers to the composite of the authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his advisers to direct the worldwide [[Catholic Church]]. It is therefore quite distinct from the Vatican City state, which was created in 1929, through the [[Lateran treaties]] between the Holy See and Italy. As the \"central government\" of the Catholic Church, the Holy See has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic representatives. It has formal diplomatic relations with 179 nations.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-34102?l=english ZENIT news agency, \"179 states have full diplomatic relations with the Holy See\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116144434/http://www.zenit.org/article-34102?l=english |date=16 January 2012 }}</ref> The State of Vatican City, for its part, is recognized under international law as a sovereign territory. Unlike the Holy See, it does not receive or send diplomatic representatives, and the Holy See acts on its behalf in international affairs.\n\n==Administration of Vatican City==\n[[File:Flag of the Vatican City.svg|left|thumb|100px|Vatican City flag]]\nAs with almost all monarchies, the executive, legislative and judicial power of government reside in the crown, in this case in the office of the [[Bishop of Rome]] (the pope). However, as with many monarchies, the pope exercises this power through other organs which act on his behalf and in his name.\n\nThe pope commonly delegates the internal administration of [[Vatican City]] to various bodies and officials. However, according to the [[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State#Article One|Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], \"The [[Supreme Pontiff]], [[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]] of [[Vatican City State]], has the fullness of legislative, executive, and judicial powers\"<ref>[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 1, \u00a7 1</ref> for [[Vatican City]].\n\nThe pope delegates [[legislative]] authority for the state to the [[unicameral]] [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]]. This commission was established in 1939 by [[Pope Pius XII]]. It consists of seven [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s appointed by the pope for five-year terms. Laws passed by the Commission must be approved by the pope through the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Secretariat of State]] prior to being published and taking effect.\n\nThe President of the Pontifical Commission is also the [[President of the Governorate of Vatican City]], to whom the pope delegates executive authority for the state. The president is assisted by a Secretary General and a Vice Secretary General. Each of these officers is appointed by the pope for a five-year term. Actions of the President must be approved by the Commission.

The Conclave is held in the [[Sistine Chapel]], where all the electors are locked in (Latin ''cum clave'') until the election for which a two-thirds majority is required. The faithful can follow the results of the polls (usually two in the morning and two in the evening, until election) by a chimney-top, visible from [[St. Peter's Square]]: in a stove attached to the chimney are burnt the voting papers, and additives make the resulting smoke black (''fumata nera'') in case of no election, white (''fumata bianca'') when the new pope is finally elected. The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals|Dean of the Sacred College]] (''Cardinale Decano'') will then ask the freshly elected pope to choose his pastoral name, and as soon as the pope is dressed with the white [[cassock]], the [[Cardinal protodeacon#Catholic Church|Senior Cardinal-Deacon]] (''Cardinale Protodiacono'') appears on the major balcony of St. Peter's fa\u00e7ade to introduce the new pope<ref>Ap. Const. Universi Dominici Gregis n. 89</ref> with the famous [[Latin]] sentence\n''Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum: [[habemus papam]].''(I announce to you a great joy: We have a Pope) The term \"Holy See\" refers to the composite of the authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his advisers to direct the worldwide [[Catholic Church]]. It is therefore quite distinct from the Vatican City state, which was created in 1929, through the [[Lateran treaties]] between the Holy See and Italy. As the \"central government\" of the Catholic Church, the Holy See has a legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic representatives. It has formal diplomatic relations with 179 nations.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-34102?l=english ZENIT news agency, \"179 states have full diplomatic relations with the Holy See\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116144434/http://www.zenit.org/article-34102?l=english |date=16 January 2012 }}</ref> The State of Vatican City, for its part, is recognized under international law as a sovereign territory. Unlike the Holy See, it does not receive or send diplomatic representatives, and the Holy See acts on its behalf in international affairs.\n\n==Administration of Vatican City==\n[[File:Flag of the Vatican City.svg|left|thumb|100px|Vatican City flag]]\nAs with almost all monarchies, the executive, legislative and judicial power of government reside in the crown, in this case in the office of the [[Bishop of Rome]] (the pope). However, as with many monarchies, the pope exercises this power through other organs which act on his behalf and in his name.\n\nThe pope commonly delegates the internal administration of [[Vatican City]] to various bodies and officials. However, according to the [[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State#Article One|Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], \"The [[Supreme Pontiff]], [[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]] of [[Vatican City State]], has the fullness of legislative, executive, and judicial powers\"<ref>[[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], Art. 1, \u00a7 1</ref> for [[Vatican City]].\n\nThe pope delegates [[legislative]] authority for the state to the [[unicameral]] [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]]. This commission was established in 1939 by [[Pope Pius XII]]. It consists of seven [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s appointed by the pope for five-year terms. Laws passed by the Commission must be approved by the pope through the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Secretariat of State]] prior to being published and taking effect.\n\nThe President of the Pontifical Commission is also the [[President of the Governorate of Vatican City]], to whom the pope delegates executive authority for the state. The president is assisted by a Secretary General and a Vice Secretary General. Each of these officers is appointed by the pope for a five-year term. Actions of the President must be approved by the Commission. Various departments and offices report to the Governorate, handling such issues as communications, internal security, fire protection, and the [[Vatican Museums]]. The [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Corpo della Gendarmeria]] is the state's security and police force, not the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard]], which is an organ of the Holy See, not Vatican City.\n\n==Executive== <!--linked from [[Template:Vatican City topics]]-->\n[[File:Vatican Gardens 4.jpg|thumb|right|Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State]]\n{{office-table}}\n| [[Monarch|Sovereign]] || [[Pope Francis]] || || 13 March 2013 </tr>\n| [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State|President of the Governorate]] || [[Giuseppe Bertello]] || || 1 October 2011\n|}\n\nThe Pope is ''[[ex officio]]'' [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] of the Vatican City State since 1929.

Formed in 1957, it was modelled on the [[Special Air Service|British SAS]] sharing the motto, \"Who Dares Wins\". The regiment is based at [[Campbell Barracks (Western Australia)|Campbell Barracks]], in [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]], a suburb of [[Perth, Western Australia]], and is a direct command unit of the [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]]. It has taken part in operations in [[Military history of Australia during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation|Borneo]], [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Operation Solace|Somalia]], [[International Force East Timor|East Timor]], [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Operation Slipper|Afghanistan]], as well as many other peacekeeping missions. The SASR also provides a counter-terrorist capability, and has been involved in a number of domestic security operations.\n\n==Role==\n===Tasks and capabilities===\nA direct command unit of [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]],{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=338}} the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) is a special forces unit of the [[Australian Army]] and \"is tasked to provide special-operations capabilities in support of the Australian Defence Force.

SASR soldiers also direct fire support including [[air support|air strikes]] to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, [[parachute]] or [[High-altitude military parachuting|high altitude parachute]]), land (on foot or by vehicle) or water (including by [[submarine]], small boats, kayaks or diving) and have proved capable of covering long distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=197}}{{sfn|Micheletti|2003|p=133}} SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=13}}\n\n===Counter-terrorism and special recovery===\nOne of the primary roles of the regiment is to provide a counter-terrorist capability,{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=507}} with an element of the SASR designated as the [[Tactical Assault Group|Tactical Assault Group (West)]] to respond to domestic incidents on the west coast of Australia and also for international operations.<ref name=\"Mike Hannan\">{{cite press release|author=Brigadier Mike Hannan|title=Media Briefing Australia's Commitment to the International Coalition Against Terrorism (MECC 668/02)|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=2096|archive-url=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20150625102229/http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=2096|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2015|publisher=Department of Defence|date=21 November 2002}}</ref><ref name=Hill>{{cite web|last1=Hill|first=Robert|url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/HillSpeechTpl.cfm?CurrentId=3845|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315195834/http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/HillSpeechtpl.cfm?CurrentId=3845|title=Australia's Response to Terrorism|publisher=Department of Defence|date=25 May 2004|archivedate=15 March 2011|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> TAG (West) maintains a short-notice capability to conduct military operations beyond the scope of state/territory and federal [[Police tactical group|Police Tactical Groups]].

Small numbers of SASR personnel were involved in [[Operation Habitat]] in Turkey and Northern Iraq as medics to assist Kurdish refugees between May and June 1991.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=455}} Personnel were also provided by the regiment as part of the Australian contribution to the UN Special Commission established to oversee the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction between 1991 and 2000.

Known as \"the Gerbils\", the small team operated from Toyota Landcruisers and Datsun utility vehicles and two M-113 APCs. They were subsequently involved in a number of actions, including an incident on 21 May when they were flown to the scene of a downed Canadian civilian helicopter {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of Mogadishu to protect the crew, and another on 16 August when they were involved in a skirmish during a convoy which resulted in two Somalis being killed after one of them aimed an AK-47 at the Australians. They returned to Australia in November 1994.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=456\u2013462}} In August 1994 SASR-qualified medical personnel were also deployed as part of the contribution to the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]], some of whom were present during the [[Kibeho Massacre]] in April 1995, for which one SASR soldier and two other Australians were awarded the [[Medal for Gallantry]] for their actions.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=463}} In addition, individual members of the SASR have been attached to a wide range of Australian peacekeeping deployments as observers, including in Kashmir, Lebanon and in the [[Multinational Force and Observers|Sinai]].{{sfn|Wright|2003|p=25}}\n\n===Black Hawk accident===\nDeaths during training accidents make up the majority of the SASR's fatalities. The worst accident in the regiment's history occurred on the evening of 12 June 1996 when two [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|S-70-A9 Black Hawk]] [[helicopter]]s from the [[5th Aviation Regiment (Australia)|5th Aviation Regiment]] carrying SASR troopers collided during a live-fire counter-terrorism/special-recovery operation exercise at [[Fire support base|Fire Support Base]] Barbara in the High Range Training Area near [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]].<ref>{{cite AV media|author1=Jackson, Liz (Reporter)|author2=Janine Cohen (Producer)|author3=Jacquelyn Hole (Researcher)|date=24 March 1997|title=Where Does the Buck Stop?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/s72779.htm|medium=Television production|work=Four Corners|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=20 August 2016}}</ref> This activity was part of Exercise Day Rotor 96 and took place on the second day of the exercise, sometime after 18:30, requiring the pilots to use [[night vision goggles]].{{sfn|McLucas|2003|p=43}} Six aircraft had been approaching the target area when, 30 seconds from the [[landing zone]], one of the helicopters veered to the right, clipping the [[tail rotor]] of another helicopter. One Black Hawk crashed immediately killing 12 personnel on board, while the other was able to make a crash landing but burst into flames, killing six. Crash survivors, soldiers from the other helicopters and exercise staff risked the flames and exploding ammunition to rescue their comrades and retrieve the bodies of the dead.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=468}} Fifteen members of the SASR and three from the 5th Aviation Regiment lost their lives in the accident. Fourteen personnel were later officially recognised for their part in the rescue and evacuation operation.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=468\u2013469}}\n\n===Cambodia and Bougainville===\nIn July 1997 an eight-man SASR team deployed at short notice to [[RMAF Butterworth|Butterworth]] in Malaysia to provide close protection and communications to the Australian ambassador and embassy staff in Cambodia if required, in preparation for the evacuation of Australian nationals in the wake of civil unrest which occurred following a [[1997 clashes in Cambodia|coup]] in that country. The evacuation operation was subsequently completed successfully, with RAAF C-130s supported by [[Airfield Defence Guards]] and other military personnel evacuating 455 Australians and other nationals from Cambodia as part of Operation Vista.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=474}}{{sfn|Horner|Connor|2014|pp=254\u2013258}} Later, following the agreement of a truce in October 1997 which ended the conflict in [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], Australian personnel were deployed as part of the New Zealand-led Truce Monitoring Group, with an SASR officer being included in the reconnaissance party and later serving on its headquarters. In April 1998, Australia took over leadership of the mission, which was renamed the Peace Monitoring Group. Numerous SASR personnel served in Bougainville over a four-year period as part of [[Operation Bel Isi]], both in headquarters positions and as part of the monitoring teams.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=474}}\n\n===Kuwait===\nIn 1998, the SASR made its first squadron-strength deployment since Vietnam when 1 Squadron, with an attached New Zealand SAS troop, was deployed to [[Kuwait]] in February as part of the American-led [[Operation Desert Thunder]]. The force, known as Anzac Special Operations Force (ANZAC SOF), was fully integrated, with the New Zealanders providing the squadron's third troop. While the crisis was resolved peacefully, if military action had been taken the SASR would have been used in the [[Combat Search and Rescue]] (CSAR) role to recover aircrew shot down by Iraqi air defences. The force returned to Australia in June 1998. Regardless, the operation represented the first time that SASR tactical headquarters had been deployed outside of Australia.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=474\u2013477}}\n\n===East Timor===\nThe SASR played a key role in the Australian-led [[INTERFET|international peacekeeping force]] (INTERFET) in [[East Timor]] between September 1999 and February 2000.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=483}}<ref>{{cite

INTERFET's special forces element, known as Response Force (RESPFOR).{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=490}} The SASR spearheaded most operations conducted by the international force during the early days of the intervention in East Timor and, as in Vietnam, served as the eyes and ears of the force, patrolling extensively through militia-controlled areas in vehicles and on foot as INTERFET expanded to take control of the rest of East Timor.{{sfn|Lord|Tennant|2000|pp=24\u201325}} It was involved in a number of significant contacts with pro-Indonesian militia, including at Suai on 6 October 1999 during

formed a key element of [[Joint Task Force Gold|the security force]] in place for the [[Sydney Olympic Games]] in 2000, and in the lead-up to the event the regiment underwent a period of modernisation, acquiring new equipment and capabilities, including the ability to respond to chemical, biological and radiological threats, as well as developing techniques for the clandestine boarding of moving ships at night. During the Games two SASR squadrons were available for counter-terrorist operations, with one designated to respond to incidents in Sydney and Canberra, while the other was on standby for incidents elsewhere.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=513\u2013514}} Defence involvement in domestic security increased after the terrorist attacks in the United States on [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], and the unit has since formed part of the security force for a range of international sporting and political events held in Australia,{{sfn|Head|2009|pp=11\u201312}} including the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2002|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] at [[Coolum, Queensland]] in March 2002,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/media_files/s20040609353.pdf|title=Address by His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery on the Parade and Presentation of the Unit Citation for Gallantry to the 1 Squadron Group, Special Air Service Regiment Campbell Barracks, Perth 9 June 2004 |publisher=Governor General of Australia|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> and the visit of US President [[George W.

On 29 March, the [[Togo]] registered ''South Tomi'' fled the [[Australian Fisheries Management Authority|AFMA]] fisheries patrol vessel ''Southern Supporter'' after being detected poaching [[Patagonian toothfish]] near [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] in the [[Southern Ocean]]. The ''South Tomi'' fled towards Africa with the South African government agreeing to a request to provide a South African Navy vessel for an intercept. The SASR troop was flown on a commercial flight to South Africa. ''South Tomi'' was boarded after a pursuit of {{convert|6,100|km|mi|adj=on}} by the ''Southern Supporter''.{{sfn|Davis|2001}}{{sfn|Gibson|2001}}{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=122}}\n\nIn August 2001, the SASR was involved in the [[Tampa affair]] when its counter-terrorist squadron was ordered to [[Christmas Island]] and to board the [[MV Tampa|MV ''Tampa'']] once it illegally entered Australian waters.

After staging through Kuwait, 1 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan in December 2001 with the other SASR squadrons rotating in at approximately six-monthly intervals.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=145\u2013152}} The SASR's main role in Afghanistan was to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance of al-Qaeda and [[Taliban]] positions, activities and capabilities. SASR force elements also conducted some offensive operations.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|pp=x\u2013xi}} After arriving at FOB Rhino, the SASR initially operated in southern Afghanistan with [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] from Task Force 58, conducting long-range vehicle mounted patrols over several hundred kilometres around [[Kandahar]] and into the [[Helmand River|Helmand Valley]] near the Iranian-border.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=153\u2013158}} On 16 February 2002 Sergeant [[Andrew Russell (Australian soldier)|Andrew Russell]] was killed when the [[Long Range Patrol Vehicle]] (LRPV) he was travelling in hit a [[land mine]] during an operation in the Helmand Valley.

Up to 300 al Qaeda fighters were later estimated to have been killed as a result of the airstrikes they called-in.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=202}} Two SASR advisory and liaison officers were attached with the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|US 10th Mountain Division]] to help plan the division's air assault operations, and were subsequently involved in heavy fighting after the unit they were with became pinned down and took a number of casualties. Supported by heavy close air support they were evacuated by helicopter that evening.{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|pp=196\u2013202}}\n\nFour days into the operation, SASR elements identified a potential escape route for the al-Qaeda leadership. Other coalition special forces had attempted to establish observation posts, but had quickly been discovered by shepherds or villagers. The Australians inserted a patrol undetected to monitor the escape route. From more than {{convert|1,200|m|yd}} high on a mountain, the patrol spotted a group of al-Qaeda figures dressed in Russian camouflage and wearing black balaclavas. They carried more advanced weapons than normal insurgents, and appeared to be guarding a white-robed older man with a cane as they fled the battlefield. US intelligence at first believed it was [[Osama bin Laden]] but later revised the identification to his second-in-command, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]]. An airstrike was called in; however, there was later doubt about whether it was successful.{{sfn|Callinan|2005|p=}} Australian forces later uncovered a number of arms caches and destroyed an anti-aircraft piece, while other elements were tasked with screening possible escape routes to the south and killed a number of fighters as they attempted to withdraw.{{sfn|Callinan|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Pugliese|2003|p=92}} The initial task group was replaced by another squadron in March and April 2002, while a third squadron rotated into Afghanistan in August 2002.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|p=xi}} The SASR withdrew from Afghanistan in November 2002 after all three sabre squadrons had served in the country.{{sfn|Neville|2008|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nA Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was deployed to Afghanistan in August or September 2005, operating in the southern province of [[Uruzgan Province|Uruzgan]].

Formed in 1957, it was modelled on the [[Special Air Service|British SAS]] sharing the motto, \"Who Dares Wins\". The regiment is based at [[Campbell Barracks (Western Australia)|Campbell Barracks]], in [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]], a suburb of [[Perth, Western Australia]], and is a direct command unit of the [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]]. It has taken part in operations in [[Military history of Australia during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation|Borneo]], [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Operation Solace|Somalia]], [[International Force East Timor|East Timor]], [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Operation Slipper|Afghanistan]], as well as many other peacekeeping missions. The SASR also provides a counter-terrorist capability, and has been involved in a number of domestic security operations.\n\n==Role==\n===Tasks and capabilities===\nA direct command unit of [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]],{{sfn|McPhedran|2005|p=338}} the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) is a special forces unit of the [[Australian Army]] and \"is tasked to provide special-operations capabilities in support of the Australian Defence Force.

During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the enemy. SASR soldiers also direct fire support including [[air support|air strikes]] to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces whenever possible.

Instead, the Australian military's new focus was on the [[Defence of Australia Policy|defence of continental Australia]] against external attack. In line with this change, the SASR took the lead in developing the Australian Army's capability to conduct patrol operations in [[Northern Australia]].{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=393}} It was later recognised that this role required dedicated units with the Army forming three [[Regional Force Surveillance Units]] in the early 1980s trained by the SASR.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=415\u2013417}} In July 1977 two SASR patrols were deployed to north [[Irian Jaya]] with the approval of Indonesian authorities to provide first aid to the survivors of an RAAF Iroquois helicopter which had crashed in the remote jungle during survey operations, and to secure the wreckage from possibly being captured by members of the [[Free Papua Movement|OPM independence movement]].{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=413\u2013414}} During this time the SASR also continued to train overseas with other special forces units. On one such exercise in the Philippines, a US special forces [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] crashed into the South China Sea shortly after take-off from [[Subic Bay]] on 26 February 1981, killing 23 passengers including three Australians from the SASR, as well as a number of Americans, Filipinos, and New Zealanders.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=417}} Meanwhile, following the [[Sydney Hilton bombing]] in February 1978, the SASR was assigned the responsibility of developing a military counter-terrorism response force in August 1979 with the unit to be designated as the Tactical Assault Group (TAG), and later, in July 1980 the TAG was also tasked with developing a maritime capabillity with an emphasis on offshore oil and gas rigs.{{sfn|Horner|1989|pp=424-429}} Navy divers from the [[Clearance Diving Branch (RAN)|Clearance Diving Branch]] were tasked with assisting the TAG to develop the capabillity as the regiment did not have sufficient divers in the water troops at the time.{{sfn|Linton|Donohue|2015|p=284}}{{sfn|Horner|1989|pp=431}} There was initial animosity the first year between badged troopers and the clearance divers who after having completed five months of training had only five out of eighteen applicants selected.{{sfn|Linton|Donohue|2015|p=285}}{{sfn|Horner|1989|pp=431}} In 1981, the divers completed a modified SASR selection course.{{sfn|Linton|Donohue|2015|p=287}} Towards the end of 1981, 2 Squadron was re-raised due to war roles being impacted as a consequence of the large commitment by the regiment to establishing the TAG.{{sfn|Horner|1989|pp=431}} In 1987, 1 Squadron who had been tasked with establishing the TAG was rotated with the now full strength 2 Squadron.{{sfn|Horner|1989|pp=444}} In 1995, Navy clearance divers stopped supporting the TAG with many divers having passed the full SASR selection over the years.{{sfn|Linton|Donohue|2015|p=294}} In May 1987 a squadron from the SASR was alerted for a possible deployment to Fiji as part of [[Operation Morris Dance]], but did not leave Australia.{{sfn|Horner|Thomas|2009|p=286}} The regiment was not involved in operations during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 although two troops were again placed on standby for deployment at short notice,{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=453}} while other elements remained on high alert to respond to a terrorist incident in Australia if required.{{sfn|Horner|1992|p=175}}\n\n===Peacekeeping===\nThe first SASR units to deploy on active service after the [[Vietnam War]] did so as part of Australian [[peacekeeping]] deployments. Small numbers of SASR personnel were involved in [[Operation Habitat]] in Turkey and Northern Iraq as medics to assist Kurdish refugees between May and June 1991.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=455}} Personnel were also provided by the regiment as part of the Australian contribution to the UN Special Commission established to oversee the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction between 1991 and 2000.

Known as \"the Gerbils\", the small team operated from Toyota Landcruisers and Datsun utility vehicles and two M-113 APCs. They were subsequently involved in a number of actions, including an incident on 21 May when they were flown to the scene of a downed Canadian civilian helicopter {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of Mogadishu to protect the crew, and another on 16 August when they were involved in a skirmish during a convoy which resulted in two Somalis being killed after one of them aimed an AK-47 at the Australians. They returned to Australia in November 1994.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=456\u2013462}} In August 1994 SASR-qualified medical personnel were also deployed as part of the contribution to the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]], some of whom were present during the [[Kibeho Massacre]] in April 1995, for which one SASR soldier and two other Australians were awarded the [[Medal for Gallantry]] for their actions.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=463}} In addition, individual members of the SASR have been attached to a wide range of Australian peacekeeping deployments as observers, including in Kashmir, Lebanon and in the [[Multinational Force and Observers|Sinai]].{{sfn|Wright|2003|p=25}}\n\n===Black Hawk accident===\nDeaths during training accidents make up the majority of the SASR's fatalities. The worst accident in the regiment's history occurred on the evening of 12 June 1996 when two [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|S-70-A9 Black Hawk]] [[helicopter]]s from the [[5th Aviation Regiment (Australia)|5th Aviation Regiment]] carrying SASR troopers collided during a live-fire counter-terrorism/special-recovery operation exercise at [[Fire support base|Fire Support Base]] Barbara in the High Range Training Area near [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]].<ref>{{cite AV media|author1=Jackson, Liz (Reporter)|author2=Janine Cohen (Producer)|author3=Jacquelyn Hole (Researcher)|date=24 March 1997|title=Where Does the Buck Stop?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/s72779.htm|medium=Television production|work=Four Corners|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=20 August 2016}}</ref> This activity was part of Exercise Day Rotor 96 and took place on the second day of the exercise, sometime after 18:30, requiring the pilots to use [[night vision goggles]].{{sfn|McLucas|2003|p=43}} Six aircraft had been approaching the target area when, 30 seconds from the [[landing zone]], one of the helicopters veered to the right, clipping the [[tail rotor]] of another helicopter. One Black Hawk crashed immediately killing 12 personnel on board, while the other was able to make a crash landing but burst into flames, killing six. Crash survivors, soldiers from the other helicopters and exercise staff risked the flames and exploding ammunition to rescue their comrades and retrieve the bodies of the dead.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=468}} Fifteen members of the SASR and three from the 5th Aviation Regiment lost their lives in the accident. Fourteen personnel were later officially recognised for their part in the rescue and evacuation operation.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=468\u2013469}}\n\n===Cambodia and Bougainville===\nIn July 1997 an eight-man SASR team deployed at short notice to [[RMAF Butterworth|Butterworth]] in Malaysia to provide close protection and communications to the Australian ambassador and embassy staff in Cambodia if required, in preparation for the evacuation of Australian nationals in the wake of civil unrest which occurred following a [[1997 clashes in Cambodia|coup]] in that country. The evacuation operation was subsequently completed successfully, with RAAF C-130s supported by [[Airfield Defence Guards]] and other military personnel evacuating 455 Australians and other nationals from Cambodia as part of Operation Vista.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=474}}{{sfn|Horner|Connor|2014|pp=254\u2013258}} Later, following the agreement of a truce in October 1997 which ended the conflict in [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], Australian personnel were deployed as part of the New Zealand-led Truce Monitoring Group, with an SASR officer being included in the reconnaissance party and later serving on its headquarters. In April 1998, Australia took over leadership of the mission, which was renamed the Peace Monitoring Group. Numerous SASR personnel served in Bougainville over a four-year period as part of [[Operation Bel Isi]], both in headquarters positions and as part of the monitoring teams.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=474}}\n\n===Kuwait===\nIn 1998, the SASR made its first squadron-strength deployment since Vietnam when 1 Squadron, with an attached New Zealand SAS troop, was deployed to [[Kuwait]] in February as part of the American-led [[Operation Desert Thunder]]. The force, known as Anzac Special Operations Force (ANZAC SOF), was fully integrated, with the New Zealanders providing the squadron's third troop. While the crisis was resolved peacefully, if military action had been taken the SASR would have been used in the [[Combat Search and Rescue]] (CSAR) role to recover aircrew shot down by Iraqi air defences. The force returned to Australia in June 1998. Regardless, the operation represented the first time that SASR tactical headquarters had been deployed outside of Australia.{{sfn|Horner|2002|pp=474\u2013477}}\n\n===East Timor===\nThe SASR played a

Examples are \nthe Ein Prat Midrasha<ref>[http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html Ein Prat Midrasha Bogrim.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101012427/http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html |date=2007-11-01 }}</ref> in Israel, \nand the [[Florence Melton|Melton School]]'s ''Midrasha'' in [[Cape Town]] <ref>[https://meltoncapetown.org/midrasha/ meltoncapetown.org]</ref>\nWithin the Orthodox community, programs of this type are also offered, \nfor example by  [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]]. <ref>[https://www.matan.org.il/en/learn-en/lessons/ Classes], matan.org.il</ref>\nIn the [[United States]], the term also refers to programs for high school students continuing their Jewish education post [[bar mitzvah|bar]] / [[bat mitzvah]]. <ref>[https://www.midrasha.org/ midrasha.org]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\n==Structure==\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' vary in curriculum and [[Orthodox Judaism#Social and philosophic differences|philosophy]]. \n<ref name=\"Lilith\">[https://www.lilith.org/blog/2014/09/a-modest-year-in-israel-when-young-women-go-to-seminary/ A Modest Year in Israel: When Young Women go to \u201cSeminary\u201d].

[[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\nMost Haredi and Hasidic institutions likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education. The two year certificates are through the [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05e0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4 \u05e1\u05d0\u05dc\u05d3 |Szold Institute]], and are recognized by the [[Israel Ministry of Education]] as equivalent to the [[bagrut|national matriculation]].<ref>[https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/1395928/ministry-education-recognizes-teaching-certificates-matriculation-paves-way-charedi-women-pursue-college-israel.html discussion in the theyeshivaworld.com]</ref>\nSee also [[The Haredi Campus - The Academic College Ono]].\n\nMany diaspora-based Orthodox Jewish girls attend a ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}'', or \u201csem\u201d, in Israel for a year or more following high school, for example [[Midreshet HaRova]].\nSome ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' also accommodate [[baal teshuva|the newly observant]]; well known are [[Neve Yerushalayim]], [[Mayanot]], and [[Machon Roni]].\nMost ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' for English-speaking students are accredited by American colleges; see [[Yeshiva #College credit]]. \nSome ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' offer second-year programs with religious-studies classes in the morning and general-studies classes in the afternoons, allowing students to pursue a religious education and a general-studies education leading to a college degree simultaneously.\nThe Modern Orthodox [[Stern College for Women]] - in Manhattan, New York - combines Torah and University studies, as at Bar-Ilan;\nthe Haredi [[Touro_College_and_University_System#Undergraduate_schools|Lander College for Women]] similarly.\n<!-- \n==Coed high school Midrashot==\nWhile a [[Hebrew school]] program typically handles [[Jewish education]] for youths before their [[Bar/Bat Mitzvah]], students who wish to continue their Jewish education through high school enroll in a Midrasha.\n -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Beis Yaakov]]\n* [[List of Midrashot]]\n* [[Female seminary]]\n* [[Women in Judaism]] and esp.
