It differs from the other UK intelligence agencies ([[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], [[GCHQ]] and [[MI5]]) in that it is an integral part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) rather than a stand-alone organisation. The organisation employs a mixture of civilian and military staff and is funded within the UK's defence budget. The organisation was formerly known as the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS), but changed its name in 2009.\n\nThe primary role of Defence Intelligence is that of '[[All-source intelligence|all-source]]' [[intelligence analysis]]. This discipline draws information from a variety of overt and covert sources to provide the intelligence needed to support military operations, contingency planning, and to inform defence policy and procurement decisions. The maintenance of the ability to give timely strategic warning of politico-military and scientific and technical developments with the potential to affect UK interests is a vital part of the process. DI's assessments are used outside the MoD to support the work of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC)]] and to assist the work of other Government departments (OGDs) and international partners (such as [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]). It is this 'all-source' function which distinguishes Defence Intelligence from other organisations such as SIS and GCHQ which focus on the collection of 'single-source' Human Intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) and Signals Intelligence ([[SIGINT]]) respectively. As such Defence Intelligence occupies a unique position within the UK intelligence community.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early Years ===\nDefence Intelligence can trace its history back to 1873 and the formation Intelligence Branch of the British [[War Office]], which later became the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]]. The [[Admiralty]], responsible for the command of the [[Royal Navy]], subsequently formed the Foreign Intelligence Committee in 1882, which evolved into the [[Naval Intelligence Department (United Kingdom)|Naval Intelligence Department]] (NID) in 1887 while the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]], established in 1902, was responsible for co-ordination between the different armed services of on issues of [[military strategy]] intelligence assessments and estimates. During [[World War I]], British [[Secret service|secret services]] were divided into numbered sections named ''Military Intelligence'' together with a department number, such as MI1 for the secretariat of the Director of Military Intelligence. Many of the original MI departments, such as MI4 (Aerial Photography) were eventually subsumed into Defence Intelligence, while the more famous [[MI5]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] denoted the liaison sections with the Security Service and Secret Intelligence Service respectively.\n\n=== Post-war years ===\nShortly after the Second World War, the topographical department of the [[War Office]] was transformed into the Joint Intelligence Bureau (JIB), and its director, [[Kenneth Strong|Sir Kenneth Strong]], became a full member of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] (JIC) in January 1947.\u00a0 The JIB was a high-powered research unit collating topographic and economic intelligence with political background so as to serve possible future military operations. It was not loved by the armed services, where its mingling of services and uniformed and civilian experts was seen as a threat to the traditional forms of service intelligence but it represented a first step in the direction of full integration of defence intelligence<ref>{{Cite book|last=Craddock|first=Percy|title=Know Your Enemy: How the Joint Intelligence Committee Saw the World.|publisher=John Murray Ltd|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=p.261}}</ref>.\n\n==Organisation==\nDefence Intelligence is headed by the Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) who is a serving [[three-star rank|three-star military officer]] and who, as the MOD's 'intelligence process owner', is also responsible for the overall co-ordination of intelligence activities throughout the Armed Forces and single Service Commands.

Examples of the support DI has provided to operations are:<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n* Coalition action in Iraq\n* NATO led forces in Afghanistan and Bosnia\n* UN humanitarian and peace-support operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cyprus, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo\nDI has deployed intelligence analysts, linguists and reservists overseas, and provide geographic support by supplying both standard and specialised mapping to overseas theatres.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Support to contingency planning for operations''': DI provides intelligence data and all source assessments that assist in preparations for future situations with the potential to require the commitment of UK Armed Forces. These products, which cover political and military developments, country and cultural information, critical infrastructure and internal security, all aid contingency planning.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of early warning''': A fundamental responsibility of Defence Intelligence is to alert ministers, chiefs of staff, senior officials and defence planners to impending crises around the world. Such warning is vital for short and medium term planning. DI meets this responsibility by focusing on current areas and topics of concern, highlighting the effects of changing circumstances, predicting security and stability trends, and assessing how these trends may develop. The assessments are distributed to decision-makers throughout the MOD, the Armed Forces, other government departments, allies, and UK Embassies and High Commissions.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of longer-term analysis of emerging threats''': Defence Intelligence provides longer-term assessments of likely scenarios around the world where UK Armed Forces might need to operate and of the equipment that they might face. It also provides technical support to the development of future military equipment and to the development of countermeasures against potentially hostile systems.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n==How Defence Intelligence carries out its work==\n'''Direction''': The Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) receives direction from the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) on MOD's Intelligence needs and draws national guidance from the Cabinet Office Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).\n\n'''Analysis and production''': Intelligence assessments are written to meet the needs of customers and must be timely and relevant. The assessment process involves judging the authenticity and reliability of new information and its relevance to existing intelligence. Assessments focus on probable and possible outcomes, to provide the best available advice for developing a response or resolution. They are continually adjusted in light of new intelligence or events.\n\n==Chiefs of Defence Intelligence==\nThe Chiefs have been as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |title=Ministry of Defence Senior Posts |accessdate=7 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033054/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2015 }}</ref><br>\n'''Director-General Intelligence'''\n* Major-General Sir [[Kenneth Strong]], 1964\u20131966\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Alfred Earle]], rtd 1966\u20131968\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Harold Maguire]], rtd 1968\u20131972\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Louis Le Bailly]] rtd 1972\u20131975\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[David Willison]], rtd 1975\u20131978\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[John Aiken (RAF officer)|John Aiken]], rtd 1978\u20131981\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Roy Halliday]], rtd 1981\u20131984\n\n'''Chiefs of Defence Intelligence'''\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Michael Armitage (RAF officer)|Michael Armitage]] 1984\u20131986\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Derek Boorman]] 1986\u20131988\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[John Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|John Kerr]] 1988\u20131991\n* Air Marshal Sir [[John Walker (RAF officer)|John Walker]], 1991\u20131994\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[John Foley (British Army general)|John Foley]], 1994\u20131997\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan West, Baron West of Spithead|Sir Alan West]], 1997\u20132000\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Joe French]], 2000\u20132003\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Andrew Ridgway]], 2003\u20132006\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Stuart Peach]] 2006\u20132009\n* Air Marshal [[Chris Nickols|Christopher Nickols]] 2009\u20132012\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan Richards]] 2012\u20132015\n* Air Marshal [[Philip Osborn]] 2015\u20132018\n* Lieutenant-General [[James Hockenhull]] 2018\u2013present\n\n==See also==\n* [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] \u2013 United States counterpart\n* [[JARIC]]\n* [[List of intelligence agencies]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]\n* [[Operation Rockingham]]\n* [[RAF Intelligence]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Dylan|first=Huw |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sSTSBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=twopage&q&f=false|title=Defence Intelligence and the Cold War: Britain's Joint Intelligence Bureau 1945\u20131964|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0199657025}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/defence-intelligence#defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence Staff] (last updated 2012)\n* [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/caboff/nim/0114301808.pdf/ National Intelligence Machinery]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence-services#defence-geospatial-intelligence-fusion-centre/ Defence Intelligence] (last updated 2012;

Examples of the support DI has provided to operations are:<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n* Coalition action in Iraq\n* NATO led forces in Afghanistan and Bosnia\n* UN humanitarian and peace-support operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cyprus, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo\nDI has deployed intelligence analysts, linguists and reservists overseas, and provide geographic support by supplying both standard and specialised mapping to overseas theatres.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Support to contingency planning for operations''': DI provides intelligence data and all source assessments that assist in preparations for future situations with the potential to require the commitment of UK Armed Forces. These products, which cover political and military developments, country and cultural information, critical infrastructure and internal security, all aid contingency planning.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of early warning''': A fundamental responsibility of Defence Intelligence is to alert ministers, chiefs of staff, senior officials and defence planners to impending crises around the world. Such warning is vital for short and medium term planning. DI meets this responsibility by focusing on current areas and topics of concern, highlighting the effects of changing circumstances, predicting security and stability trends, and assessing how these trends may develop. The assessments are distributed to decision-makers throughout the MOD, the Armed Forces, other government departments, allies, and UK Embassies and High Commissions.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of longer-term analysis of emerging threats''': Defence Intelligence provides longer-term assessments of likely scenarios around the world where UK Armed Forces might need to operate and of the equipment that they might face. It also provides technical support to the development of future military equipment and to the development of countermeasures against potentially hostile systems.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n==How Defence Intelligence carries out its work==\n'''Direction''': The Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) receives direction from the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) on MOD's Intelligence needs and draws national guidance from the Cabinet Office Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).\n\n'''Analysis and production''': Intelligence assessments are written to meet the needs of customers and must be timely and relevant. The assessment process involves judging the authenticity and reliability of new information and its relevance to existing intelligence. Assessments focus on probable and possible outcomes, to provide the best available advice for developing a response or resolution. They are continually adjusted in light of new intelligence or events.\n\n==Chiefs of Defence Intelligence==\nThe Chiefs have been as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |title=Ministry of Defence Senior Posts |accessdate=7 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033054/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2015 }}</ref><br>\n'''Director-General Intelligence'''\n* Major-General Sir [[Kenneth Strong]], 1964\u20131966\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Alfred Earle]], rtd 1966\u20131968\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Harold Maguire]], rtd 1968\u20131972\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Louis Le Bailly]] rtd 1972\u20131975\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[David Willison]], rtd 1975\u20131978\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[John Aiken (RAF officer)|John Aiken]], rtd 1978\u20131981\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Roy Halliday]], rtd 1981\u20131984\n\n'''Chiefs of Defence Intelligence'''\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Michael Armitage (RAF officer)|Michael Armitage]] 1984\u20131986\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Derek Boorman]] 1986\u20131988\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[John Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|John Kerr]] 1988\u20131991\n* Air Marshal Sir [[John Walker (RAF officer)|John Walker]], 1991\u20131994\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[John Foley (British Army general)|John Foley]], 1994\u20131997\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan West, Baron West of Spithead|Sir Alan West]], 1997\u20132000\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Joe French]], 2000\u20132003\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Andrew Ridgway]], 2003\u20132006\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Stuart Peach]] 2006\u20132009\n* Air Marshal [[Chris Nickols|Christopher Nickols]] 2009\u20132012\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan Richards]] 2012\u20132015\n* Air Marshal [[Philip Osborn]] 2015\u20132018\n* Lieutenant-General [[James Hockenhull]] 2018\u2013present\n\n==See also==\n* [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] \u2013 United States counterpart\n* [[JARIC]]\n* [[List of intelligence agencies]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]\n* [[Operation Rockingham]]\n* [[RAF Intelligence]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Dylan|first=Huw |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sSTSBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=twopage&q&f=false|title=Defence Intelligence and the Cold War: Britain's Joint Intelligence Bureau 1945\u20131964|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0199657025}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/defence-intelligence#defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence Staff] (last updated 2012)\n* [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/caboff/nim/0114301808.pdf/ National Intelligence Machinery]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence-services#defence-geospatial-intelligence-fusion-centre/ Defence Intelligence] (last updated 2012; withdrawn 2014)\n\n{{Military intelligence agencies}}\n{{UK_Intelligence_Agencies}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:British intelligence agencies]]\n[[Category:Huntingdonshire]]\n[[Category:Military communications of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Military intelligence agencies]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1964]]\n[[Category:Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Cambridgeshire]]\n", "name_user": "Kenstrong", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Intelligence"}

Together they had ten illegitimate children, all of whom took the surname ''[[FitzClarence]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nDorothea (often called '''Dorothy''' or '''Dora''') Bland was born near [[Waterford]] City in [[Ireland]] on 22 November 1761<ref> \"Dorothea Jordan\", Encyclopeadia Britannica Online. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dorothea-Jordan Retrieved 11th February, 2020.</ref>, and was baptised at [[St Martin in the Fields]], Middlesex, on 5 December of that year.<ref name =\"Camp\">[http://anthonyjcamp.com/page13.htm Anthony J. Camp: ''Ancestry of Mrs Jordan''] [retrieved 4 December 2014].</ref> She was the third of six children born from Francis Bland (b. 1736{{snd}}d. Dover, 2 January 1778) and his mistress, Grace Phillips (b. ca. 1740{{snd}}d. Edinburgh, 1789). Her older siblings are George Bland ({{circa|1758}}{{snd}}Boston, Massachusetts, 1807; actor and singer) and Hester Bland (baptised at St Anne Soho, Middlesex, 2 March 1760{{snd}}buried at St David's, as of Trelethin, 8 March 1848), and her younger siblings are Lucy Bland (1763/64{{snd}}Trelethin, St David's, 1778, aged 14), Francis Bland ({{fl.|1813}}; a captain, unmarried and without issue) and Nathaniel Phillips Bland (born 1766/67{{snd}}buried at St David's, Pembrokeshire, 3 June 1830, aged 63).<ref name =\"Camp\"/>\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Nathaniel Bland (Killarney, co. Kerry, 1695/96{{snd}}1760), [[Vicar General]] of [[Ardfert]] and [[Aghada]], and Judge of the [[Prerogative Court]] of [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], and his second wife Lucy (n\u00e9e Heaton).<ref name =\"Camp\"/> The reports about Dorothea's maternal ancestry  are very sketchy, although it is generally stated that Grace Phillips was probably the daughter of a Welsh clergyman (who lived in the early 1750s in Bristol) but he has not been identified with certainty.<ref name =\"Camp\"/>\n\nBefore April 1774, when she was 13, Dorothea's father, who worked as a stagehand, abandoned the family<ref name =\"Camp\"/> to marry an Irish actress. However, he continued to support the family by sending them meagre sums of money. This allowance was on the condition that the children would not use his last name. <ref name=\"odnb\">{{Cite ODNB|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15119|title=Jordan, Dorothy [real name Dorothy Phillips] (1761\u20131816), actress {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15119|access-date=2019-10-24|year=2004}}</ref> Dorothea then adopted her mother's maiden name, Phillips. This situation forced Dorothea to work to help her siblings. Her mother, an actress by profession, saw potential in Dorothea and put her on the stage. Dora became a famous actress and was said to have the most beautiful legs ever seen on the stage.\n\n\n==Theatrical career ==\nThe historical record of Jordan's first stage appearance is not clear. Some sources claim that Jordan made her debut in 1777 in [[Dublin]], as Phoebe in ''[[As You Like It]],'' whilst others that suggest she premiered as Lucy in the Interlude ''The Virgin Unmask'd,'' on the 3rd November 1779.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A biographical dictionary of actors, actresses, musicians, dancers, managers & other stage personnel in London, 1660-1800.

Documentation shows her last appearance in Dublin came on the 16th May 1782 when she spoke the ''The Maid of Oaks'''  Prologue''.'' At the time she was pregnant with the illegitimate child of the married theatre manager of the Smock Alley Theatre, Richard Daly.  \n\nRumours spread and she fled to England, specifically [[Leeds]], where she was employed by [[Tate Wilkinson]], manager of the York Company.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life of Mrs Jordan, Volume 2 : Including Original Private Correspondence, and Numerous Anecdotes of her Contemporaries|last=James|first=Boaden|isbn=9781139452915|location=Cambridge|oclc=967377202}}</ref> It was during this move that she adopted the surname 'Jordan,' and like all the other women in the company (both unmarried and married), adopted the title \"Mrs.\" Her first performance in England was the tragic role of Calista in ''[[The Fair Penitent]],''  on 11 July 1782 for which she had been tutored for by the scholar Cornelious Swan.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Mrs Jordan's profession|last=Claire.|first=Tomalin|date=2012|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780241963296|location=London|oclc=779244420}}</ref> Wilkinson paid her 15 shillings a week and she quickly won over the favour of her audiences, packing theatres.  Despite the actresses versatile acting talents, the critics were not pleased with her performing tragedy roles. Dora was faced harsh criticism from these roles as she was not considered socially acceptable to play women of a higher standing.<ref>Mrs Jordan (Dorothy Jordan).

In her first few months, she was given the role of Fanny in ''The Clandestine Marriage'', which only made her more unpopular with the women in the company.  \n\nDuring this first tour, while in Hull, Jordan gave birth to her first daughter Frances. After the delivery, while Jordan cared for the baby, the actresses of the company \"blackened her character among the people of Hull.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> When Jordan returned to the stage on Boxing Day playing Calista in ''The Fair Penitent'', she was met with strong disapproval. Audiences felt that the similarities between Jordan and Calista were too similar. However, Wilkinson came to Jordan's aid to distill the gossip, painting Jordan as a mild mannered victim. Through Wilkinson's support and Jordan's hard work and good nature, she was eventually able to win over the people before they returned to York.  \n\nSome time later, while in York, [[Sarah Siddons]] came to visit with Wilkinson and see Dora Jordan perform in one of her popular [[breeches role]]s. Siddons however, was not impressed with Jordan's performance, and said that Jordan should remain on the Yorkshire Circuit, for she was \"not up to London.\" <ref name=\":5\" /> This remark was soon discounted when William Smith came from London and offered Jordan a salary of \u00a34 a week at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]]. She took the offer and performed for Wilkinson's company for a final time on 9 September 1785 before departing to London with her mother, two-year-old daughter and sister Hester.  \n\nThough no specific dates can be sourced, Dora is believed to have performed the role of Lady Teazle in Sheridan's [[The School for Scandal]] before she arrived in London.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Piozzi letters : correspondence of Hester Lynch Piozzi, 1784-1821 (formerly Mrs. Thrale)|last=Piozzi|first= Hester Lynch|date=|publisher=University of Delaware Press|others=Bloom, Edward A.

In her first few months, she was given the role of Fanny in ''The Clandestine Marriage'', which only made her more unpopular with the women in the company.  \n\nDuring this first tour, while in Hull, Jordan gave birth to her first daughter Frances. After the delivery, while Jordan cared for the baby, the actresses of the company \"blackened her character among the people of Hull.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> When Jordan returned to the stage on Boxing Day playing Calista in ''The Fair Penitent'', she was met with strong disapproval. Audiences felt that the similarities between Jordan and Calista were too similar. However, Wilkinson came to Jordan's aid to distill the gossip, painting Jordan as a mild mannered victim. Through Wilkinson's support and Jordan's hard work and good nature, she was eventually able to win over the people before they returned to York.  \n\nSome time later, while in York, [[Sarah Siddons]] came to visit with Wilkinson and see Dora Jordan perform in one of her popular [[breeches role]]s. Siddons however, was not impressed with Jordan's performance, and said that Jordan should remain on the Yorkshire Circuit, for she was \"not up to London.\" <ref name=\":5\" /> This remark was soon discounted when William Smith came from London and offered Jordan a salary of \u00a34 a week at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].

Before 1976, the highway terminated in the north at [[Kelsey Bay, British Columbia|Kelsey Bay]], where BC Ferries originally began its northern route to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] until moving its southern terminus north to Port Hardy after the highway was extended. Between 1996 and 2001, an express route was built further inland between Parksville and Campbell River, while another express route was built as a western bypass of Nanaimo, extending the highway further south to the Duke Point ferry terminal.  This makes Highway 19 the only numbered highway in B.C. to have ferry terminals at both ends.\n\n[[File:Maximum 120 sign in BC.JPG|thumb|right|In 2014 the speed limit on the Inland Island Highway stretch of Highway 19 was raised to {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} north of [[Parksville, British Columbia|Parksville]]; this was the [[speed limits in Canada|highest signed speed limit in Canada]].  In November 2018 the provincial government reduced the speed limit on this section back to {{convert|110|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} after a safety review.]]\n\n==Route details==\n[[Image:Qb interchange.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Highway 19, Exit 60 interchange with Highway 4 at Qualicum Beach looking WSW]]\nHighway 19's northern end is located at the Bear Cove ferry terminal, across the bay from Port Hardy. The highway proceeds southwest from the ferry dock for 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) to a junction with the main road to the centre of Port Hardy, then turns southeast, travelling for 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi) to Highway [[British Columbia Highway 30|30]], and then further east for 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) to the main road to [[Port McNeill, British Columbia|Port McNeill]]. The highway then follows the eastern shore of [[Nimpkish Lake]] and the [[Nimpkish River]] through a long stretch of dense forest terrain for 64&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) southeast, until reaching a junction with the community of [[Woss, British Columbia|Woss]], then travelling another 65&nbsp;km east (40&nbsp;mi), through the boundary between the Regional Districts of [[Regional District of Mount Waddington|Mount Waddington]] and [[Strathcona Regional District|Strathcona]], to a junction with [[Sayward, British Columbia|Sayward]], and finally entering the city of Campbell River another 64&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) southeast, at a junction with Highways [[British Columbia Highway 28|28]] and [[British Columbia Highway 19A|19A]], just past the river that the city is named for.\n\nThe entire stretch of Highway 19 north of Campbell River is an undivided two-lane configuration. Once at the junction with Highways 28 and 19A, Highway 19 separates into an expressway configuration, built between 1996 and 2001. In Campbell River, the expressway shares its northbound lanes with Tamarac Street, and its southbound lanes with Willow Street.  The entire stretch of Highway 19 between Campbell River and the city of [[Parksville, British Columbia|Parksville]] alternates between a divided four-lane expressway and freeway, with a nominal speed limit of {{convert|110|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and is referred to as the \"Inland Island Highway\".\n\nSouth from Campbell River, Highway 19 is divided primarily by a concrete wall, and goes through a series of six at-grade intersections, five of them possessing exit numbers. 52&nbsp;km (32&nbsp;mi) south of Campbell River, Highway 19 reaches its first interchange, with a four-lane arterial highway that goes west to the village of [[Cumberland, British Columbia|Cumberland]] and east to the communities of [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay]] and [[Comox, British Columbia|Comox]]. Past the Courtenay Interchange, Highway 19 is divided by a grass median. 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi) later, Highway 19 reaches another interchange, this time with a two-lane road that goes a short distance east to the B.C. Ferry terminal at Buckley Bay. There are two more at-grade intersections on Highway 19 in the 41&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) between the Buckley Bay Interchange and the interchange with [[British Columbia Highway 4|Highway 4]], which goes north into [[Qualicum Beach]]. 9&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) later, Highway 19 goes through another interchange, this time with Highway 4A, which goes east into Parksville.  The next interchange, at Craig's Crossing, is another 5&nbsp;km south (3&nbsp;mi).\n\nPast the Craig's Crossing Interchange, Highway 19 resumes its 1953 alignment, which today is a 4-lane, divided arterial highway with a concrete median barrier mostly constructed during the 1970s. The highway passes southeast through the communities of [[Nanoose Bay, British Columbia|Nanoose Bay]] and [[Lantzville, British Columbia|Lantzville]] before finally entering the north part of Nanaimo. Highway 19 then veers south onto a 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) long four-lane expressway known as the \"Nanaimo Parkway\", which has five at-grade intersections along its length.  Highway 19's Nanaimo Parkway portion ends at an interchange with the Trans Canada and Cedar Road. At the interchange with Cedar Road, Highway 19 proceeds to share an alignment with the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] south for 2&nbsp;km (1\u00bc&nbsp;mi) before turning eastward at another interchange (Duke Point Highway). Highway 19 then crosses over the Nanaimo River 2&nbsp;km (1\u00bc&nbsp;mi) later, passes through an interchange at Maughan Rd and then goes northward for 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi), finally terminating at the B.C. Ferry terminal at [[Duke Point, British Columbia|Duke Point]].\n\nThe 5&nbsp;km-long stretch of Highway 19 between Capilano Road and Northwest Bay Road in Nanoose Bay is a [[single point of failure]] in Vancouver Island's highway system.  If a major incident resulted in the total closure of any part of that stretch of road, traffic travelling between the north Island and the south Island would have to take a very long detour involving no less than four separate ferry routes. You would have to take the Comox-Powell River Ferry, drive 30+ kilometres to the Saltery Bay Ferry Terminal, take the ferry to Earl\u2019s Cove, then drive 80+ kilometres to the Langdale Ferry Terminal, and take the ferry to Horseshoe Bay. Then, you need to drive out to Exit 4 along the Trans-Canada Hwy, make a U-turn, drive back, and go through the toll booth once again, which is another 10+ kilometres. You would then take the ferry to Departure Bay ferry terminal, located in Central Nanaimo. Total trip time: around 10-20 hours extra, depending on your luck with the ferry schedules\n{{-}}\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{BCinttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=length>{{cite report\n |title=Landmark Kilometre Inventory\n |url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/driving-and-transportation/transportation-infrastructure/engineering-standards-and-guidelines/traffic-engineering-and-safety/highway-safety/lki/lki_bc_201607.pdf\n |pages=285-305\n |website=British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure\n |publisher=Cypher Consulting\n |date=July 2016\n |access-date=2017-03-14\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311044605/http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/driving-and-transportation/transportation-infrastructure/engineering-standards-and-guidelines/traffic-engineering-and-safety/highway-safety/lki/lki_bc_201607.pdf\n |archivedate=2017-03-11\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref>}}\n{{Jctplace|exit\n|division_special=[[Nanaimo Regional District|Nanaimo]]\n|dspan=26\n|location_special=[[Duke Point, British Columbia|Duke Point]]<br />([[Nanaimo]])\n|lspan=3\n|type=toll\n|km=0.00\n|place={{jct|state=BC|extra=ferry}} [[Duke Point ferry terminal]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[BC Ferries]] to {{jctname|state=BC|Hwy|17|dir1=east|noshield1=yes|name1=[[Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal]]}}\n}}\n{{BCint|exit\n|type=incomplete\n|exit=(0)\n|km=0.27\n|road=''private road''&nbsp;\u2013 Harmac Sawmill\n|notes=At grade, traffic signals;

The highway then follows the eastern shore of [[Nimpkish Lake]] and the [[Nimpkish River]] through a long stretch of dense forest terrain for 64&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) southeast, until reaching a junction with the community of [[Woss, British Columbia|Woss]], then travelling another 65&nbsp;km east (40&nbsp;mi), through the boundary between the Regional Districts of [[Regional District of Mount Waddington|Mount Waddington]] and [[Strathcona Regional District|Strathcona]], to a junction with [[Sayward, British Columbia|Sayward]], and finally entering the city of Campbell River another 64&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi) southeast, at a junction with Highways [[British Columbia Highway 28|28]] and [[British Columbia Highway 19A|19A]], just past the river that the city is named for.\n\nThe entire stretch of Highway 19 north of Campbell River is an undivided two-lane configuration. Once at the junction with Highways 28 and 19A, Highway 19 separates into an expressway configuration, built between 1996 and 2001. In Campbell River, the expressway shares its northbound lanes with Tamarac Street, and its southbound lanes with Willow Street.  The entire stretch of Highway 19 between Campbell River and the city of [[Parksville, British Columbia|Parksville]] alternates between a divided four-lane expressway and freeway, with a nominal speed limit of {{convert|110|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and is referred to as the \"Inland Island Highway\".\n\nSouth from Campbell River, Highway 19 is divided primarily by a concrete wall, and goes through a series of six at-grade intersections, five of them possessing exit numbers. 52&nbsp;km (32&nbsp;mi) south of Campbell River, Highway 19 reaches its first interchange, with a four-lane arterial highway that goes west to the village of [[Cumberland, British Columbia|Cumberland]] and east to the communities of [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay]] and [[Comox, British Columbia|Comox]]. Past the Courtenay Interchange, Highway 19 is divided by a grass median. 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi) later, Highway 19 reaches another interchange, this time with a two-lane road that goes a short distance east to the B.C. Ferry terminal at Buckley Bay. There are two more at-grade intersections on Highway 19 in the 41&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) between the Buckley Bay Interchange and the interchange with [[British Columbia Highway 4|Highway 4]], which goes north into [[Qualicum Beach]]. 9&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) later, Highway 19 goes through another interchange, this time with Highway 4A, which goes east into Parksville.  The next interchange, at Craig's Crossing, is another 5&nbsp;km south (3&nbsp;mi).\n\nPast the Craig's Crossing Interchange, Highway 19 resumes its 1953 alignment, which today is a 4-lane, divided arterial highway with a concrete median barrier mostly constructed during the 1970s. The highway passes southeast through the communities of [[Nanoose Bay, British Columbia|Nanoose Bay]] and [[Lantzville, British Columbia|Lantzville]] before finally entering the north part of Nanaimo. Highway 19 then veers south onto a 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) long four-lane expressway known as the \"Nanaimo Parkway\", which has five at-grade intersections along its length.  Highway 19's Nanaimo Parkway portion ends at an interchange with the Trans Canada and Cedar Road. At the interchange with Cedar Road, Highway 19 proceeds to share an alignment with the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] south for 2&nbsp;km (1\u00bc&nbsp;mi) before turning eastward at another interchange (Duke Point Highway). Highway 19 then crosses over the Nanaimo River 2&nbsp;km (1\u00bc&nbsp;mi) later, passes through an interchange at Maughan Rd and then goes northward for 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi), finally terminating at the B.C. Ferry terminal at [[Duke Point, British Columbia|Duke Point]].\n\nThe 5&nbsp;km-long stretch of Highway 19 between Capilano Road and Northwest Bay Road in Nanoose Bay is a [[single point of failure]] in Vancouver Island's highway system.  If a major incident resulted in the total closure of any part of that stretch of road, traffic travelling between the north Island and the south Island would have to take a very long detour involving no less than four separate ferry routes. You would have to take the Comox-Powell River Ferry, drive 30+ kilometres to the Saltery Bay Ferry Terminal, take the ferry to Earl\u2019s Cove, then drive 80+ kilometres to the Langdale Ferry Terminal, and take the ferry to Horseshoe Bay. Then, you need to drive out to Exit 4 along the Trans-Canada Hwy, make a U-turn, drive back, and go through the toll booth once again. You would then take the ferry to Departure Bay ferry terminal, located in Central Nanaimo.\n{{-}}\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{BCinttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=length>{{cite report\n |title=Landmark Kilometre Inventory\n |url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/driving-and-transportation/transportation-infrastructure/engineering-standards-and-guidelines/traffic-engineering-and-safety/highway-safety/lki/lki_bc_201607.pdf\n |pages=285-305\n |website=British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure\n |publisher=Cypher Consulting\n |date=July 2016\n |access-date=2017-03-14\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311044605/http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/driving-and-transportation/transportation-infrastructure/engineering-standards-and-guidelines/traffic-engineering-and-safety/highway-safety/lki/lki_bc_201607.pdf\n |archivedate=2017-03-11\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref>}}\n{{Jctplace|exit\n|division_special=[[Nanaimo Regional District|Nanaimo]]\n|dspan=26\n|location_special=[[Duke Point, British Columbia|Duke Point]]<br />([[Nanaimo]])\n|lspan=3\n|type=toll\n|km=0.00\n|place={{jct|state=BC|extra=ferry}} [[Duke Point ferry terminal]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[BC Ferries]] to {{jctname|state=BC|Hwy|17|dir1=east|noshield1=yes|name1=[[Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal]]}}\n}}\n{{BCint|exit\n|type=incomplete\n|exit=(0)\n|km=0.27\n|road=''private road''&nbsp;\u2013 Harmac Sawmill\n|notes=At grade, traffic signals;

He is known for his landscapes, city views, and seascapes, but also has created genre, portraits and still life works. He is a resident of [[Maryland]], with a studio in [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\n== Biography and Career ==\nAndrei Kushnir was born in Regensburg, Germany, the son of Ukrainian parents who immigrated to the United States to escape Soviet communism. \nHe began painting in oils in 1980 and quickly progressed to painting landscapes on site.  While essentially self-taught, Kushnir studied with artists Michael Francis and Michele Martin Taylor.  He developed his own naturalistic realist style, and has worked primarily outdoors, in every season and type of weather.<ref>\"Artist Andrei Kushnir's Paintings of the C&O Canal,\" Leaves Magazine, Vol. 79, No.5, September/October, 1998, Cover, p. 3 and p. 11; Ann Gerasimos, \"Font of Inspiration,\" Washington Times, Metropolitan Life Section, October 4, 1999, p.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

County, Washington|Snohomish County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.
