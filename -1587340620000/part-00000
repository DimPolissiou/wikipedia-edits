He argued that rival [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]] theories, based on subjective [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartesian]] thinking, undermined the unity of society present in [[Thomism|Thomistic]] [[metaphysics]] as neither were sufficiently concerned with [[ethics|moral]] [[philosophy]].  Writing in 1861, the influential British philosopher and economist, [[John Stuart Mill]] stated in ''[[Utilitarianism]]'' his view that \"Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice; towards which all institutions, and the efforts of all virtuous citizens, should be made in the utmost degree to converge.\"<ref>[[JS Mill]], ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' (1863)</ref>\n\nIn the later 19th and early 20th century, social justice became an important theme in American political and legal philosophy, particularly in the work of [[John Dewey]], [[Roscoe Pound]] and [[Louis Brandeis]]. One of the prime concerns was the ''[[Lochner era]]'' decisions of the [[US Supreme Court]] to strike down legislation passed by state governments and the Federal government for social and economic improvement, such as the [[eight-hour day]] or the right to join a [[trade union]]. After the First World War, the founding document of the [[International Labour Organization]] took up the same terminology in its preamble, stating that \"peace can be established only if it is based on social justice\". From this point, the discussion of social justice entered into mainstream legal and academic discourse.\n\nThus, in 1931, the [[Pope Pius XI]] stated the expression for the first time in the [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic Social Teaching]] in the encyclical [[Quadragesimo anno|Quadragesimo Anno]]. Then again in [[Divini Redemptoris|Divini Redepmtoris]], the Church pointed out that the realisation of social justice relied on the promotion of the [[Human dignity|dignity of human person]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19370319_divini-redemptoris.html|title=Divini Redemptoris (March 19, 1937) {{!}} PIUS XI|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> The same year, and because of the documented influence of [[Divini Redemptoris]] in its drafters,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moyn|first=Samuel|date=2014|title=The Secret History of Constitutional Dignity|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yhrdlj/vol17/iss1/2/|journal=Yale Human Rights and Development Journal|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=|issn=1548-2596|via=}}</ref> the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was the first one to establish the term as a principle of the economy in the State, and then other countries around the world did the same throughout the 20th century, even in [[Socialism|Socialist regimes]] such as the [[Constitution of Cuba|Cuban Constitution]] in 1976.<ref name=\"p\u00e9rez27\"/>\n\nIn the late 20th century, a number of liberal and conservative thinkers, notably [[Friedrich von Hayek]] rejected the concept by stating that it did not mean anything, or meant too many things.<ref>[[FA Hayek]], ''[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]'' (1973) vol II, ch 3</ref> However the concept remained highly influential, particularly with its promotion by philosophers such as [[John Rawls]]. Even though the meaning of social justice varies, at least three common elements can be identified in the contemporary theories about it: a duty of the State to [[Distributive justice|distribute]] certain vital means (such as [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural rights]]), the protection of [[human dignity]], and [[affirmative action]]s to promote [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] for everybody.<ref name=\"p\u00e9rez27\"/>\n\n== Contemporary theory ==\n\n=== Philosophical perspectives ===\n\n==== Cosmic values ====\n\n[[Hunter Lewis]]' work promoting natural healthcare and sustainable economies advocates for [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] as a key premise in social justice.

His first statement of principle was made in ''A Theory of Justice'' where he proposed that, \"Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others.\"<ref>John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (2005 reissue), Chapter 1, \"Justice as Fairness\" \u2013 1. The Role of Justice, pp. 3\u20134</ref> A [[deontological]] proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]] terms. His views are definitively restated in ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' where society is seen \"as a fair system of co-operation over time, from one generation to the next\".<ref>John Rawls, ''Political Liberalism'' 15 (Columbia University Press 2003)</ref>\n\nAll societies have a basic structure of social, economic, and political institutions, both formal and informal. In testing how well these elements fit and work together, Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract. To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate, he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it, but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding. Obviously, not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved, so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable. Rawls constructed an argument for a two-stage process to determine a citizen's hypothetical agreement:\n* The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes, and, to that extent, X holds these powers as a [[trustee]] for the citizen.\n* X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate. The citizen, therefore, is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way.\nThis applies to one person who represents a small group (e.g., the organiser of a social event setting a dress code) as equally as it does to national governments, which are ultimate trustees, holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries. Governments that fail to provide for [[social welfare|welfare]] of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate. To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the law-making powers of governments, Rawls asserted that, \"There is ... a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason. But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty.\"<ref>John Rawls, Political Liberalism 291\u201392 (Columbia University Press 2003)</ref> This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold&nbsp;\u2014 to some extent, the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome. According to Rawls, the basic liberties that every good society should guarantee are:\n* [[Freedom of thought]];\n* Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion, philosophy, and morality;\n* Political liberties (e.g., representative democratic institutions, [[freedom of speech]] and the [[freedom of the press|press]], and [[freedom of assembly]]);\n* [[Freedom of association]];\n* Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person (namely: freedom from slavery, freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one's occupation); and\n* Rights and liberties covered by the [[rule of law]].\n\n==== Thomas Pogge ====\n[[File:2014-01-08 Thomas Pogge 4737-cropped.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Pogge]]]]\n[[Thomas Pogge]]'s arguments pertain to a standard of social justice that creates human rights deficits.

Human life must be valued above all material possessions.\n* Preferential option for the poor and [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]]: Catholics believe Jesus taught that on the [[Day of Judgement]] God will ask what each person did to help the poor and needy: \"Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.\"<ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:40.</ref> The Catholic Church believes that through words, prayers and deeds one must show solidarity with, and compassion for, the poor. The moral test of any society is \"how it treats its most vulnerable members. The poor have the most urgent moral claim on the conscience of the nation. People are called to look at public policy decisions in terms of how they affect the poor.\"<ref>Option for the Poor, [http://www.osjspm.org/cst/themes.htm Major themes from Catholic Social Teaching] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216183419/http://www.osjspm.org/cst/themes.htm |date=16 February 2006 }}, Office for Social Justice, Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis.</ref>\n\nEven before it was propounded in the Catholic social doctrine, social justice appeared regularly in the history of the Catholic Church:\n* [[Pope Leo XIII]], who studied under Taparelli, published in 1891 the [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (On the Condition of the Working Classes; lit. \"On new things\"), rejecting both socialism and capitalism, while defending labor unions and private property. He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not [[class conflict]] and [[competition]]. In this document, Leo set out the Catholic Church's response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism. The Pope advocated that the role of the State was to promote social justice through the protection of rights, while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony.\n* The encyclical ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (On Reconstruction of the Social Order, literally \"in the fortieth year\") of 1931 by [[Pope Pius XI]], encourages a [[living wage]],<ref>Popularised by [[John A. Ryan]], although see [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' (1897)</ref> [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order, saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just.\n* [[Pope John Paul II]] added much to the corpus of the [[Catholic social teaching]], penning three encyclicals which focus on issues such as economics, politics, geo-political situations, ownership of the means of production, private property and the \"[[social mortgage]]\", and private property. The encyclicals ''[[Laborem exercens]]'', ''[[Sollicitudo rei socialis]]'', and ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice. Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and [[human rights]], and spoke forcefully for the poor. He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused, and admits a fear that the \"progress\" of the world is not true progress at all, if it should denigrate the value of the human person. He argued in ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' that private property, markets, and honest labor were the keys to alleviating the miseries of the poor and to enabling a life that can express the fullness of the human person.\n* [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (\"God is Love\") of 2006 claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics, and not of the church, which has charity as its central social concern. It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the church's active role in social justice should be to inform the debate, using reason and natural law, and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics.\n* The official Catholic doctrine on '''social justice''' can be found in the book ''Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church'', published in 2004 and updated in 2006, by the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace|Pontifical Council ''Iustitia et Pax'']].\n\nThe ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (\u00a7\u00a7&nbsp;1928\u20131948) contains more detail of the Church's view of social justice.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a3.htm |title = Catechism of the Catholic Church \u2013 Social justice |publisher = Vatican.va |date =  |accessdate = 29 March 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105063620/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a3.htm |archivedate = 5 November 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Islam ====\n\nIn Muslim history, Islamic governance has often been associated with social justice.{{additional citation|date=April 2018}} Establishment of social justice was one of the motivating factors of the [[Umayyad#Insurrection|Abbasid revolt]] against the Umayyads.<ref>{{cite book |author = John L.

Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care, especially for low income households and families. The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families, and whether the global marketplace is the best way to distribute healthcare. [[Ruth Faden]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics]] and Madison Powers of Georgetown University focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most. They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings.\n\nSocial injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people. These social injustices take the form of [[health inequities]] when negative health states such as malnourishment, and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations.<ref>Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006. Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine. PLoS Medicine, 1686\u20131691</ref> These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as primary healthcare which ensures the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level, gender, education or any other stratifying factors.

One example is the statement by [[H. G. Wells]] that all people are \"equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen.\"<ref>\"The Rights of Man\", ''Daily Herald'', London, February 1940</ref>\n\n[[Friedrich Hayek]] of the [[Austrian School]] of economics rejects the very idea of social justice as meaningless, religious, self-contradictory, and ideological, believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible, and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty:\n{{quote|There can be no test by which we can discover what is 'socially unjust' because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed, and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such (as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined) would appear just to us. [Social justice] does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense, like the term 'a moral stone'.<ref>Hayek, F.A. (1982). ''Law, Legislation and Liberty, Vol. 2''. Routledge. p. 78.</ref>}}\n\nHayek argued that proponents of social justice often present it as a moral virtue but most of their descriptions pertain to impersonal states of affairs (e.g income inequality, poverty), which are cited as \"social injustice.\" Hayek argued that social justice is either a virtue or it is not. If it is, it can only be ascribed to the actions of individuals. However, most who use the term ascribe it to social systems, so \"social justice\" in fact describes a regulative principle of order; they are interested not in virtue but in power.<ref>Novak, Michael. \"Defining social justice.\" First things (2000): 11-12.</ref> \n\nFor Hayek, this notion of social justices presupposes that people are guided by specific external directions rather than internal, personal rules of just conduct. It further presupposes that one can never be held accountable for ones own behaviour, as this would be \"blaming the victim.\" Thus for Hayek, the function of social justice is to blame someone else, often attributed to \"the system\" or those who are supposed, mythically, to control it. Thus it is based on the appealing idea of \"you suffer; your suffering is caused by powerful others; these oppressors must be destroyed.\"<ref>Novak, Michael. \"Defining social justice.\" First things (2000): 11-12.</ref>\n\nBen O'Neill of the [[University of New South Wales]] and the [[Mises Institute]] argues that, for proponents of \"social justice\":<ref>O'Neill, Ben (16 March 2011) [https://mises.org/daily/5099/The-Injustice-of-Social-Justice The Injustice of Social Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028092912/http://mises.org/daily/5099/The-Injustice-of-Social-Justice |date=28 October 2014 }}, ''[[Mises Institute]]''</ref>\n{{quote|the notion of \"rights\" is a mere term of entitlement, indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good, no matter how important or trivial, abstract or tangible, recent or ancient.

He argued that rival [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]] theories, based on subjective [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartesian]] thinking, undermined the unity of society present in [[Thomism|Thomistic]] [[metaphysics]] as neither were sufficiently concerned with [[ethics|moral]] [[philosophy]].  Writing in 1861, the influential British philosopher and economist, [[John Stuart Mill]] stated in ''[[Utilitarianism]]'' his view that \"Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice; towards which all institutions, and the efforts of all virtuous citizens, should be made in the utmost degree to converge.\"<ref>[[JS Mill]], ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' (1863)</ref>\n\nIn the later 19th and early 20th century, social justice became an important theme in American political and legal philosophy, particularly in the work of [[John Dewey]], [[Roscoe Pound]] and [[Louis Brandeis]]. One of the prime concerns was the ''[[Lochner era]]'' decisions of the [[US Supreme Court]] to strike down legislation passed by state governments and the Federal government for social and economic improvement, such as the [[eight-hour day]] or the right to join a [[trade union]]. After the First World War, the founding document of the [[International Labour Organization]] took up the same terminology in its preamble, stating that \"peace can be established only if it is based on social justice\". From this point, the discussion of social justice entered into mainstream legal and academic discourse.\n\nThus, in 1931, the [[Pope Pius XI]] stated the expression for the first time in the [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic Social Teaching]] in the encyclical [[Quadragesimo anno|Quadragesimo Anno]]. Then again in [[Divini Redemptoris|Divini Redepmtoris]], the Church pointed out that the realisation of social justice relied on the promotion of the [[Human dignity|dignity of human person]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19370319_divini-redemptoris.html|title=Divini Redemptoris (March 19, 1937) {{!}} PIUS XI|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> The same year, and because of the documented influence of [[Divini Redemptoris]] in its drafters,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moyn|first=Samuel|date=2014|title=The Secret History of Constitutional Dignity|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yhrdlj/vol17/iss1/2/|journal=Yale Human Rights and Development Journal|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=|issn=1548-2596|via=}}</ref> the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was the first one to establish the term as a principle of the economy in the State, and then other countries around the world did the same throughout the 20th century, even in [[Socialism|Socialist regimes]] such as the [[Constitution of Cuba|Cuban Constitution]] in 1976.<ref name=\"p\u00e9rez27\"/>\n\nIn the late 20th century, a number of liberal and conservative thinkers, notably [[Friedrich von Hayek]] rejected the concept by stating that it did not mean anything, or meant too many things.<ref>[[FA Hayek]], ''[[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]'' (1973) vol II, ch 3</ref> However the concept remained highly influential, particularly with its promotion by philosophers such as [[John Rawls]]. Even though the meaning of social justice varies, at least three common elements can be identified in the contemporary theories about it: a duty of the State to [[Distributive justice|distribute]] certain vital means (such as [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural rights]]), the protection of [[human dignity]], and [[affirmative action]]s to promote [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] for everybody.<ref name=\"p\u00e9rez27\"/>\n\n== Contemporary theory ==\n\n=== Philosophical perspectives ===\n\n==== Cosmic values ====\n\n[[Hunter Lewis]]' work promoting natural healthcare and sustainable economies advocates for [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] as a key premise in social justice.

His first statement of principle was made in ''A Theory of Justice'' where he proposed that, \"Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others.\"<ref>John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (2005 reissue), Chapter 1, \"Justice as Fairness\" \u2013 1. The Role of Justice, pp. 3\u20134</ref> A [[deontological]] proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]] terms. His views are definitively restated in ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' where society is seen \"as a fair system of co-operation over time, from one generation to the next\".<ref>John Rawls, ''Political Liberalism'' 15 (Columbia University Press 2003)</ref>\n\nAll societies have a basic structure of social, economic, and political institutions, both formal and informal. In testing how well these elements fit and work together, Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract. To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate, he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it, but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding. Obviously, not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved, so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable. Rawls constructed an argument for a two-stage process to determine a citizen's hypothetical agreement:\n* The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes, and, to that extent, X holds these powers as a [[trustee]] for the citizen.\n* X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate. The citizen, therefore, is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way.\nThis applies to one person who represents a small group (e.g., the organiser of a social event setting a dress code) as equally as it does to national governments, which are ultimate trustees, holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries. Governments that fail to provide for [[social welfare|welfare]] of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate. To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the law-making powers of governments, Rawls asserted that, \"There is ... a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason. But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty.\"<ref>John Rawls, Political Liberalism 291\u201392 (Columbia University Press 2003)</ref> This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold&nbsp;\u2014 to some extent, the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome. According to Rawls, the basic liberties that every good society should guarantee are:\n* [[Freedom of thought]];\n* Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion, philosophy, and morality;\n* Political liberties (e.g., representative democratic institutions, [[freedom of speech]] and the [[freedom of the press|press]], and [[freedom of assembly]]);\n* [[Freedom of association]];\n* Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person (namely: freedom from slavery, freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one's occupation); and\n* Rights and liberties covered by the [[rule of law]].\n\n==== Thomas Pogge ====\n[[File:2014-01-08 Thomas Pogge 4737-cropped.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Pogge]]]]\n[[Thomas Pogge]]'s arguments pertain to a standard of social justice that creates human rights deficits.

He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not [[class conflict]] and [[competition]]. In this document, Leo set out the Catholic Church's response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism. The Pope advocated that the role of the State was to promote social justice through the protection of rights, while the Church must speak out on social issues in order to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony.\n* The encyclical ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (On Reconstruction of the Social Order, literally \"in the fortieth year\") of 1931 by [[Pope Pius XI]], encourages a [[living wage]],<ref>Popularised by [[John A. Ryan]], although see [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' (1897)</ref> [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order, saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just.\n* [[Pope John Paul II]] added much to the corpus of the [[Catholic social teaching]], penning three encyclicals which focus on issues such as economics, politics, geo-political situations, ownership of the means of production, private property and the \"[[social mortgage]]\", and private property. The encyclicals ''[[Laborem exercens]]'', ''[[Sollicitudo rei socialis]]'', and ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice. Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and [[human rights]], and spoke forcefully for the poor. He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused, and admits a fear that the \"progress\" of the world is not true progress at all, if it should denigrate the value of the human person. He argued in ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' that private property, markets, and honest labor were the keys to alleviating the miseries of the poor and to enabling a life that can express the fullness of the human person.\n* [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (\"God is Love\") of 2006 claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics, and not of the church, which has charity as its central social concern. It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the church's active role in social justice should be to inform the debate, using reason and natural law, and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics.\n* The official Catholic doctrine on '''social justice''' can be found in the book ''Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church'', published in 2004 and updated in 2006, by the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace|Pontifical Council ''Iustitia et Pax'']].\n\nThe ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (\u00a7\u00a7&nbsp;1928\u20131948) contains more detail of the Church's view of social justice.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a3.htm |title = Catechism of the Catholic Church \u2013 Social justice |publisher = Vatican.va |date =  |accessdate = 29 March 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105063620/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a3.htm |archivedate = 5 November 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Islam ====\n\nIn Muslim history, Islamic governance has often been associated with social justice.{{additional citation|date=April 2018}} Establishment of social justice was one of the motivating factors of the [[Umayyad#Insurrection|Abbasid revolt]] against the Umayyads.<ref>{{cite book |author = John L.

Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care, especially for low income households and families. The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families, and whether the global marketplace is the best way to distribute healthcare. [[Ruth Faden]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics]] and Madison Powers of Georgetown University focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most. They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings.\n\nSocial injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people. These social injustices take the form of [[health inequities]] when negative health states such as malnourishment, and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations.<ref>Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006. Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine. PLoS Medicine, 1686\u20131691</ref> These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as primary healthcare which ensures the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level, gender, education or any other stratifying factors. Integrating social justice with health inherently reflects the social determinants of health model without discounting the role of the bio-medical model.<ref>Cueto, Marcos. 2004.

The third principle of [http://www.unesco.org/education/tlsf/mods/theme_a/img/02_earthcharter.pdf The Earth Charter] is Social and economic justice, which is described as seeking to 1) Eradicate poverty as an ethical, social, and environmental imperative 2) Ensure that economic activities and institutions at all levels promote human development in an equitable and sustainable manner 3) Affirm gender equality and equity as prerequisites to sustainable development and ensure universal access to education, health care, and economic opportunity, and 4) Uphold the right of all, without discrimination, to a natural and social environment supportive of human dignity, bodily health, and spiritual well-being, with special attention to the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities.<ref>{{Citation|title=Earth Charter|date=2019-01-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth_Charter&oldid=876558236|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Climate justice|Climate Justice]] and [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice]] movements also incorporate social justice principles, ideas, and practices. Climate justice and environmental justice, as movements within the larger ecological and environmental movement, each incorporate social justice in a particular way.

[[moral relativism|Moral relativists]] deny that there is any kind of objective standard for justice in general. [[non cognitivism|Non-cognitivists]], [[moral skepticism|moral skeptics]], [[moral nihilism|moral nihilists]], and most [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] deny the epistemic possibility of objective notions of justice. [[Political realism|Political realists]] believe that any ideal of social justice is ultimately a mere justification for the [[status quo]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nMany other people{{who|date=November 2018}} accept some of the basic principles of social justice, such as the idea that all human beings have a basic level of value, but disagree with the elaborate conclusions that may or may not follow from this. One example is the statement by [[H. G. Wells]] that all people are \"equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen.\"<ref>\"The Rights of Man\", ''Daily Herald'', London, February 1940</ref>\n\n[[Friedrich Hayek]] of the [[Austrian School]] of economics rejects the very idea of social justice as meaningless, religious, self-contradictory, and ideological, believing that to realize any degree of social justice is unfeasible, and that the attempt to do so must destroy all liberty:\n{{quote|There can be no test by which we can discover what is 'socially unjust' because there is no subject by which such an injustice can be committed, and there are no rules of individual conduct the observance of which in the market order would secure to the individuals and groups the position which as such (as distinguished from the procedure by which it is determined) would appear just to us. [Social justice] does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense, like the term 'a moral stone'.<ref>Hayek, F.A. (1982). ''Law, Legislation and Liberty, Vol. 2''. Routledge. p. 78.</ref>}}\n\nHayek argued that proponents of social justice often present it as a moral virtue but most of their descriptions pertain to impersonal states of affairs (e.g income inequality, poverty), which are cited as \"social injustice.\" Hayek argued that social justice is either a virtue or it is not. If it is, it can only be ascribed to the actions of individuals. However, most who use the term ascribe it to social systems, so \"social justice\" in fact describes a regulative principle of order; they are interested not in virtue but in power.<ref>Novak, Michael. \"Defining social justice.\" First things (2000): 11-12.</ref> \n\nFor Hayek, this notion of social justices presupposes that people are guided by specific external directions rather than internal, personal rules of just conduct. It further presupposes that one can never be held accountable for ones own behaviour, as this would be \"blaming the victim.\" Thus for Hayek, the function of social justice is to blame someone else, often attributed to \"the system\" or those who are supposed, mythically, to control it. Thus it is based on the appealing idea of \"you suffer; your suffering is caused by powerful others; these oppressors must be destroyed.\"<ref>Novak, Michael. \"Defining social justice.\" First things (2000): 11-12.</ref>\n\nBen O'Neill of the [[University of New South Wales]] and the [[Mises Institute]] argues that, for proponents of \"social justice\":<ref>O'Neill, Ben (16 March 2011) [https://mises.org/daily/5099/The-Injustice-of-Social-Justice The Injustice of Social Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028092912/http://mises.org/daily/5099/The-Injustice-of-Social-Justice |date=28 October 2014 }}, ''[[Mises Institute]]''</ref>\n{{quote|the notion of \"rights\" is a mere term of entitlement, indicative of a claim for any possible desirable good, no matter how important or trivial, abstract or tangible, recent or ancient. It is merely an assertion of desire, and a declaration of intention to use the language of rights to acquire said desire.\n\nIn fact, since the program of social justice inevitably involves claims for government provision of goods, paid for through the efforts of others, the term actually refers to an intention to use ''force'' to acquire one's desires. Not to earn desirable goods by rational thought and action, production and voluntary exchange, but to go in there and forcibly take goods from those who can supply them!}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*  [[Activism]]\n* \"[[Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence]]\", an [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti\u2013Vietnam War]] and pro\u2013social justice speech delivered by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1967\n* [[Choosing the Common Good]]\n* [[Counterculture of the 1960s]]\n* [[Climate justice]]\n* [[Economic justice]]\n* [[Education for Justice]]\n* [[Environmental justice]]\n* [[Environmental racism]]\n* [[Essentially contested concept]]\n* [[Labour law]] and [[labour rights]]\n* [[Left-wing politics]]\n* [[Resource justice]]\n* [[Right to education]]\n* [[Right to health]]\n* [[Right to housing]]\n* [[Right to social security]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Social justice art]]\n* [[Social justice warrior]]\n* [[Social law]]\n* [[Social work]]\n* [[Solidarity]]\n* [[National Union for Social Justice (organization)]]\n* [[V\u00f6lkisch equality]]\n* [[World Day of Social Justice]]\n}}\n* {{Lookfrom}}\n* {{in title}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Library resources box}}\n\n=== Articles ===\n* C P\u00e9rez-Garz\u00f3n, '[https://revistas.uexternado.edu.co/index.php/derest/article/view/5907/7607 What is social justice?

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

The first lasted from late February to late May 1644, when the siege was lifted. The second siege took place a year later from July to December 1645. Lathom House was captured and [[slighted]].\n\n==Background==\n[[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby]], was the leading Royalist adherent in the northwest of England when the civil war broke out in 1642. The family seat of the Stanleys was [[Lathom House]]. In 1643, the Earl of Derby was ordered by [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] to fortify the [[Isle of Man]] against a possible Scottish invasion, and then move on to the northern campaign. His wife, [[Charlotte Stanley, Countess of Derby|Charlotte de la Tremo\u00fcille]], was left in charge of what turned out to be the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Lancashire. [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas Fairfax]] saw Derby's absence as an opportunity to strengthen the Long Parliament's position in Lancashire and set out to conquer Lathom House. Immediately after the fall of [[Warrington]], the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]] requested that the countess acknowledge Parliament's authority and surrender her house, but she refused on the grounds that doing so would dishonour her husband. She offered to limit herself to defending her home, and this postponed further attacks on her position.\n\n==First siege==\nWhen Fairfax arrived at Lathom House in February 1644, the Countess had made every effort to conceal the strength of the castle's fortifications. Fairfax demanded that the Countess surrender Lathom House to him. She asked for a week to consider his offer, and then insisted that it was only appropriate that he visit her at Lathom House for further negotiations. He was received as an honoured guest, but the entire household categorically rejected his terms for surrendering. He gave her two more days to consider her situation. The emissary sent two days later was scornfully dismissed.\n\nThe siege began with 2,000 Parliamentary soldiers (500 cavalry and 1,500 infantry) against a garrison of 300. The fortifications of Lathom House consisted of:\n* Outer walls and embankments six feet thick\n* An eight-yard moat\n* Nine towers, each with six cannons, three pointing in either direction, and the Eagle Tower providing an excellent overview of the battlefield\n\nIn addition, the castle was at the lowest point in the middle of an open expanse that allowed superb views of the enemy's activities. Charlotte had assembled a militia of seasoned marksmen who were able to inflict significant losses by sniping.\n\nJohn Seacome, an 18th-century historian of the ''House of Stanley'' quoted from another account ''A true and genuine account of the famous and ever memorable siege of Lathom-House in the County of Lancaster'':{{sfn|Seacome|1793|pp=225\u2013243}}\n\n{{quote|text=Latham-house stands upon a flat, upon a moorish, springy, and spumous ground ; was encompassed by a strong wall of two yards thick; upon the wall were nine towers, flanking each other, and in every tower were six pieces of ordnance, that played three the one way, and three the other. Without the wall was a mote, eight yards wide, and two yards deep; upon the back of the mote, between the wall and the graff, was a strong row of palisadoes around; besides all these there was a high strong tower, called the Eagle Tower, in the midst of the house, surmounting all the rest; and the gate-house was also two high and strong buildings, with a strong tower on each side of it; and in the entrance to the first court upon the tops of these towers, were placed the best and choicest marksmen, who usually attended the Earl in his hunting and other sports, as huntsmen, keepers, fowlers, and the like; who continually kept watch with scrued [screwed] guns and long fowling pieces upon those towers, to the great annoyance and loss of the enemy, especially of their commanders, who were frequently killed in their trenches, or as they came or went to or from them.... Nature herself [seemed to have] formed [the house] for a strong hold or place of security.... The uncommon situation of it may be compared to the palm of a man's hand, flat in the middle, and covered with rising round around it, and so near to it, that the enemy in a two year's siege, were never able to raise a battery against it so as to make a breach in the wall practicable to enter the house by way of storm.{{sfn|Seacome|1793|pp=234\u2013235}}|sign=|source=|Latham-house stands upon a flat, upon a moorish, springy, and spumous ground ; was encompassed by a strong wall of two yards thick; upon the wall were nine towers, flanking each other, and in every tower were six pieces of ordnance, that played three the one way, and three the other.

The hollows in the stone are said to have been used for casting shot by Cromwell's army in the siege of Lathom House.]]\nThe fortifications sustained continuous cannon and mortar fire with minimal damage. The Royalists launched several successful sorties to disrupt Parliamentary efforts to set up batteries. As a result, Parliamentary forces were unable to establish any major [[artillery]] positions against the castle, and the army refused to replenish those guns that were lost or spiked during the sorties. Morale among the Roundheads also suffered greatly as the besieged shot soldiers and engineers on the battlefield.\n\nNevertheless, Fairfax persisted in demanding that Charlotte surrender to his forces, going so far as to obtain a letter from Lord Stanley asking for safe passage for her. She refused to surrender under any terms, rebuking messengers in increasingly disdainful tones.\n\nAfter one particularly audacious sortie in late April that destroyed several Roundhead positions, Fairfax declared a day of fasting and prayer in his camp. One of the chaplains invoked the following verse from [[Jeremiah]] 50:14:\n\n{{quote|Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the Lord.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} }}\n\nCaptain Hector Schofield, a messenger from [[Alexander Rigby|Colonel Alexander Rigby]] of the Roundheads, arrived to offer Charlotte an honourable surrender. She threatened to hang him from the tower gates, then asked him to convey the following while she tore the message:\n\n{{quote|Carry this answer back to Rigby, and tell that insolent rebel, he shall have neither persons, goods, nor house. When our strength and provisions are spent, we shall find a fire more merciful than Rigby; and then, if the providence of God prevent it not, my goods and house shall burn in his sight; and myself, children, and soldiers, rather than fall into his hands will seal our religion and loyalty in the same flames.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}}}\n\nA similar ultimatum issued by Rigby on 23 May prompted Charlotte to respond: \"The mercies of the wicked are cruel .... unless they treated with her lord, they should never take her or any of her friends alive\".\n\nThe siege was lifted on the night of 27 May as the Royalist general [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] approached Lathom with thousands of cavalry and infantry. Charlotte and her household departed for the Isle of Man, leaving the care of Lathom House to Colonel Edward Rawstorne.{{sfn|Timbs|Gunn|1893|p=136}}{{sfn|Young|1970|p=165}}\n\n==Second siege==\nAfter the Parliamentary victory at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]], which was fought 2 July \n1644, the north of England was largely under Parliamentary control apart from areas close to Royalist garrisons such as Lathom House. The next year (1645), in July,{{sfn|Seacome|1793|p=257}} 4,000 Parliamentary troops returned to begin the second siege. Their commander Colonel Peter Egerton made Ormskirk his headquarters while his men encamped on Aughton Moss (or Aughton Moor), near [[Aughton, Lancashire|Aughton Mill]]. Trenchfield House, on the site of this encampment, still retains the name.{{sfn|Egerton|1645}}{{sfn|Newstead|1893|p=13}}{{sfn|Timbs|Gunn|1893|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\nThe garrison did not capitulate quickly, but when it became clear that no relief could be expected, and supplies were running short, famine forced Colonel Rawstorne's hand and he [[surrender at discretion|surrendered at discretion]] to Colonel Egerton on 2 December 1645.{{sfn|Seacome|1793|pp=262\u2013264}}{{sfn|Timbs|Gunn|1893|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Young|1970|p=165}}{{sfn|Farrer|Brownbill|1911|pp=143-150}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe fall of Lathom House was regarded as an event of the first importance by the Parliamentary party. Besides the material gain of twelve pieces of cannon and a large store of arms and ammunition, the Republicans had achieved a great moral triumph in the fall of the famous royalist house, and an order was issued by the \nHouse of Commons \"for the ministers about London to give public thanks to God, on the next Lord's Day, for its surrender\".<ref name=TG >Timbs & Gunn 1893, p. 137.</ref>\n\nAfter the Restoration the property was regained by the Derby family, and in the early part of the eighteenth century it was still occasionally inhabited by them,<ref name=TG/> but [[Knowsley Hall]] succeeded Lathom House as the principal seat of the Stanley family.\n\n==In Literature==\n* [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s poem 'Lord and Lady Derby' and the notes attached reflect on Lady Derby's fortitude during the siege.  \n{{wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833/Lord and Lady Derby|Lord and Lady Derby, by L. E. L.}}\n\n==Popular culture==\n*The song \"They called her Babylon\" by [[Steeleye Span]] tells the story of the siege.

The first lasted from late February to late May 1644, when the siege was lifted. The second siege took place a year later from July to December 1645. Lathom House was captured and [[slighted]].\n\n==Background==\n[[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby]], was the leading Royalist adherent in the northwest of England when the civil war broke out in 1642. The family seat of the Stanleys was [[Lathom House]]. In 1643, the Earl of Derby was ordered by [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] to fortify the [[Isle of Man]] against a possible Scottish invasion, and then move on to the northern campaign. His wife, [[Charlotte Stanley, Countess of Derby|Charlotte de la Tremo\u00fcille]], was left in charge of what turned out to be the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Lancashire. [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas Fairfax]] saw Derby's absence as an opportunity to strengthen the Long Parliament's position in Lancashire and set out to conquer Lathom House. Immediately after the fall of [[Warrington]], the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]] requested that the countess acknowledge Parliament's authority and surrender her house, but she refused on the grounds that doing so would dishonour her husband. She offered to limit herself to defending her home, and this postponed further attacks on her position.\n\n==First siege==\nWhen Fairfax arrived at Lathom House in February 1644, the Countess had made every effort to conceal the strength of the castle's fortifications. Fairfax demanded that the Countess surrender Lathom House to him. She asked for a week to consider his offer, and then insisted that it was only appropriate that he visit her at Lathom House for further negotiations. He was received as an honoured guest, but the entire household categorically rejected his terms for surrendering. He gave her two more days to consider her situation. The emissary sent two days later was scornfully dismissed.\n\nThe siege began with 2,000 Parliamentary soldiers (500 cavalry and 1,500 infantry) against a garrison of 300. The fortifications of Lathom House consisted of:\n* Outer walls and embankments six feet thick\n* An eight-yard moat\n* Nine towers, each with six cannons, three pointing in either direction, and the Eagle Tower providing an excellent overview of the battlefield\n\nIn addition, the castle was at the lowest point in the middle of an open expanse that allowed superb views of the enemy's activities. Charlotte had assembled a militia of seasoned marksmen who were able to inflict significant losses by sniping.\n\nJohn Seacome, an 18th-century historian of the ''House of Stanley'' quoted from another account ''A true and genuine account of the famous and ever memorable siege of Lathom-House in the County of Lancaster'':{{sfn|Seacome|1793|pp=225\u2013243}}\n\n{{quote|text=Latham-house stands upon a flat, upon a moorish, springy, and spumous ground ; was encompassed by a strong wall of two yards thick; upon the wall were nine towers, flanking each other, and in every tower were six pieces of ordnance, that played three the one way, and three the other. Without the wall was a mote, eight yards wide, and two yards deep; upon the back of the mote, between the wall and the graff, was a strong row of palisadoes around; besides all these there was a high strong tower, called the Eagle Tower, in the midst of the house, surmounting all the rest; and the gate-house was also two high and strong buildings, with a strong tower on each side of it; and in the entrance to the first court upon the tops of these towers, were placed the best and choicest marksmen, who usually attended the Earl in his hunting and other sports, as huntsmen, keepers, fowlers, and the like; who continually kept watch with scrued [screwed] guns and long fowling pieces upon those towers, to the great annoyance and loss of the enemy, especially of their commanders, who were frequently killed in their trenches, or as they came or went to or from them.... Nature herself [seemed to have] formed [the house] for a strong hold or place of security.... The uncommon situation of it may be compared to the palm of a man's hand, flat in the middle, and covered with rising round around it, and so near to it, that the enemy in a two year's siege, were never able to raise a battery against it so as to make a breach in the wall practicable to enter the house by way of storm.{{sfn|Seacome|1793|pp=234\u2013235}}|sign=|source=|Latham-house stands upon a flat, upon a moorish, springy, and spumous ground ; was encompassed by a strong wall of two yards thick; upon the wall were nine towers, flanking each other, and in every tower were six pieces of ordnance, that played three the one way, and three the other.

The hollows in the stone are said to have been used for casting shot by Cromwell's army in the siege of Lathom House.]]\nThe fortifications sustained continuous cannon and mortar fire with minimal damage. The Royalists launched several successful sorties to disrupt Parliamentary efforts to set up batteries. As a result, Parliamentary forces were unable to establish any major [[artillery]] positions against the castle, and the army refused to replenish those guns that were lost or spiked during the sorties. Morale among the Roundheads also suffered greatly as the besieged shot soldiers and engineers on the battlefield.\n\nNevertheless, Fairfax persisted in demanding that Charlotte surrender to his forces, going so far as to obtain a letter from Lord Stanley asking for safe passage for her. She refused to surrender under any terms, rebuking messengers in increasingly disdainful tones.\n\nAfter one particularly audacious sortie in late April that destroyed several Roundhead positions, Fairfax declared a day of fasting and prayer in his camp. One of the chaplains invoked the following verse from [[Jeremiah]] 50:14:\n\n{{quote|Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the Lord.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} }}\n\nCaptain Hector Schofield, a messenger from [[Alexander Rigby|Colonel Alexander Rigby]] of the Roundheads, arrived to offer Charlotte an honourable surrender. She threatened to hang him from the tower gates, then asked him to convey the following while she tore the message:\n\n{{quote|Carry this answer back to Rigby, and tell that insolent rebel, he shall have neither persons, goods, nor house. When our strength and provisions are spent, we shall find a fire more merciful than Rigby; and then, if the providence of God prevent it not, my goods and house shall burn in his sight; and myself, children, and soldiers, rather than fall into his hands will seal our religion and loyalty in the same flames.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}}}\n\nA similar ultimatum issued by Rigby on 23 May prompted Charlotte to respond: \"The mercies of the wicked are cruel .... unless they treated with her lord, they should never take her or any of her friends alive\".\n\nThe siege was lifted on the night of 27 May as the Royalist general [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] approached Lathom with thousands of cavalry and infantry. Charlotte and her household departed for the Isle of Man, leaving the care of Lathom House to Colonel Edward Rawstorne.{{sfn|Timbs|Gunn|1893|p=136}}{{sfn|Young|1970|p=165}}\n\n==Second siege==\nAfter the Parliamentary victory at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]], which was fought 2 July \n1644, the north of England was largely under Parliamentary control apart from areas close to Royalist garrisons such as Lathom House. The next year (1645), in July,{{sfn|Seacome|1793|p=257}} 4,000 Parliamentary troops returned to begin the second siege. Their commander Colonel Peter Egerton made Ormskirk his headquarters while his men encamped on Aughton Moss (or Aughton Moor), near [[Aughton, Lancashire|Aughton Mill]]. Trenchfield House, on the site of this encampment, still retains the name.{{sfn|Egerton|1645}}{{sfn|Newstead|1893|p=13}}{{sfn|Timbs|Gunn|1893|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\nThe garrison did not capitulate quickly, but when it became clear that no relief could be expected, and supplies were running short, famine forced Colonel Rawstorne's hand and he [[surrender at discretion|surrendered at discretion]] to Colonel Egerton on 2 December 1645.{{sfn|Seacome|1793|pp=262\u2013264}}{{sfn|Timbs|Gunn|1893|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Young|1970|p=165}}{{sfn|Farrer|Brownbill|1911|pp=143-150}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe fall of Lathom House was regarded as an event of the first importance by the Parliamentary party. Besides the material gain of twelve pieces of cannon and a large store of arms and ammunition, the Republicans had achieved a great moral triumph in the fall of the famous royalist house, and an order was issued by the \nHouse of Commons \"for the ministers about London to give public thanks to God, on the next Lord's Day, for its surrender\".<ref>{{citation-attribution|{{harvnb|Timbs|Gunn|1893|p=137}} }}</ref>\n\nAfter the Restoration the property was regained by the Derby family, and in the early part of the eighteenth century it was still occasionally inhabited by them,{{sfn|Timbs|Gunn|1893|p=137}} but [[Knowsley Hall]] succeeded Lathom House as the principal seat of the Stanley family.\n\n==In Literature==\n* [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s poem 'Lord and Lady Derby' and the notes attached reflect on Lady Derby's fortitude during the siege.  \n{{wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833/Lord and Lady Derby|Lord and Lady Derby, by L. E.

The [[vertebral column|spine]] injury is characterized by a shooting or stinging [[pain]] that travels down one arm, followed by numbness and weakness in the parts of the arms, including the biceps, deltoid, and spinati muscles. Many athletes in contact sports have suffered stingers, but they are often unreported to medical professionals.\n\nAnyone who experiences significant trauma to his or her head or neck needs immediate medical evaluation for the possibility of a [[spinal injury]]. In fact, it's safest to assume that trauma victims have a spinal injury until proven otherwise because:\n* The time between injury and treatment can be critical in determining the extent of complications and the amount of recovery\n* A serious spinal injury is not always immediately obvious. If it is not recognized, more severe injury may occur\n* Numbness or paralysis may develop immediately or come on gradually as bleeding or swelling occurs in or around the spinal cord<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spinal-cord-injury/basics/symptoms/con-20023837|title=Spinal cord injury - Symptoms and causes|author=|date=|website=mayoclinic.org}}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism ==\nSince stingers are a nerve injury, a stringer can fall into two different categories of peripheral nerve injury with physiological differences. '''Grade I''' is [[neurapraxia]], which involves focal damage of the [[Myelin|myelin fibers]] around the [[axon]], with the [[axon]] and the connective tissue sheath remaining intact. The disruption of nerve function involves demyelination. [[Axon|Axonal]] integrity is preserved, and remyelination occurs within days or weeks.<ref name=\":0\">Neal, S. L., & Fields, K. B. (2010).

If this is to happen it is not considered a stringer, and usually is a high-energy injury to the [[Shoulder girdle|shoulder-girdle]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA stinger is an injury that is caused by restriction of the nerve supply to the upper extremity via the [[brachial plexus]].  The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior rami of the nerves at the 5th cervical level of the spinal cord all the way to the nerves at the 1st thoracic level of the spinal cord.  The brachial plexus innervates the upper extremity as well as some muscles in the neck and shoulder.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. 6th ed. New York, NY: \tMcGraw-Hill, 2012. Print.</ref>  Damage to the brachial plexus can occur when the nerves are stretched too far from the head and neck; specifically the upper trunk of the plexus \u2013nerve roots at the 5th and 6th cervical level \u2013are primarily affected. The upper trunk provides part of the nerve to supply to the upper extremity via the Musculocutaneous, Axillary, Radial and Median nerves.<ref>PM&R Knowledge. \"AAPM&R - American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.\" PM&R \tKnowledge NOW. American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 2012.</ref>  It is for this reason that stingers do not affect both arms simultaneously, however it is possible for both arms to accrue injuries. Repeated nerve [[Physical trauma|trauma]] can cause recurring stingers, [[chronic pain]], and [[muscle]] weakness, while recovery can take weeks to months in severe cases.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/1101/p2035.html|title=The \"Burner\": A Common Nerve Injury in Contact Sports|first1=Geoffrey S.|last1=Kuhlman|first2=Douglas B.|last2=McKeag|date=1 November 1999|journal=American Family Physician|volume=60|issue=7|pages=2035-2040|pmid=10569506}}</ref>\n\n== Diagnosis and treatment ==\nStingers are best [[diagnosis|diagnosed]] by a medical professional. This person will assess the athlete's pain, range of head and neck motion, arm numbness, and muscle strength. Often, the affected athlete is allowed to return to play within a short time, but persistent symptoms will result in removal. Athletes are also advised to receive \nregular evaluations until symptoms have ceased. If they have not after two weeks, or increase, additional tests such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) can be performed to detect a more serious injury, such as a [[herniated disc]].\n\nThe order of treatments applied depends on whether the athlete's main complaint is pain or weakness. Both can be treated with an [[analgesic]], [[anti-inflammatory]] [[medication]], ice and heat, restriction of movement, and if necessary, [[cervical collar]] or traction. [[Surgery]] is only necessary in the most severe cases.\n\n== Returning to play ==\nReturning from this injury depends on the number of burners that occurs. If a stinger occurs, the athletes usually return to play after they restore full strength, are asymptomatic where no pain persists, and painless range of motion in the cervical spine. At low frequencies of stingers, like 1 or 2, there is a much lower risk of the symptoms reoccurring. If three or more stingers occur in one season, one has a higher increased risk at the symptoms persisting.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qureshi|first=Sheeraz A.|last2=Hecht|first2=Andrew C.|date=2010-12-01|title=Burner Syndrome and Cervical Cord Neuropraxia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040738310000663|journal=Seminars in Spine Surgery|series=Athletic Spine Injuries: State of the Art|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=193\u2013197|doi=10.1053/j.semss.2010.06.005|issn=1040-7383}}</ref> \n\n== Prevention ==\nStringers can be prevented by several of the following factors. \n\nFlexibility and strength of the neck, shoulder, and upper extremity are essential because stiffness and weakness are predisposing factors for a burner as well as consequences of this injury. Factors that could help in the prevention of stringers could include strengthening the muscles, increasing the range of motion, and improving technique when playing.<ref>KUHLMAN, GEOFFREY S, and DOUGLAS B MCKEAG. \u201cThe \u2018Burner\u2019: A Common Nerve Injury in Contact Sports.\u201d ''American Family Physician'', 1 Nov. 1999, <nowiki>https://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/1101/p2035.html</nowiki>.</ref>\n\nSimple measures can be taken to help in the recovery from stingers. A chest-out posture should be adapted to prevent the neck from extending too far because it brings the head over the shoulders. The chest-out posture is emphasized due to it not being commonly adopted by athletes due to developed shoulders and is perpetuated by [[brachial plexus]] irritation. The chest-out posture also reduces pressure on the [[brachial plexus]] by opening the [[thoracic outlet]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qureshi|first=Sheeraz A.|last2=Hecht|first2=Andrew C.|date=2010-12-01|title=Burner Syndrome and Cervical Cord Neuropraxia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040738310000663|journal=Seminars in Spine Surgery|series=Athletic Spine Injuries: State of the Art|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=193\u2013197|doi=10.1053/j.semss.2010.06.005|issn=1040-7383}}</ref>\n\nFinally, stingers can be prevented by wearing protective gear, such as [[butterfly restrictor]]s, designed to protect the head and neck from being forced into unnatural positions. This equipment is more feasible in positions where unrestricted head and neck movement is not required, such as [[Lineman (American football)|American football lineman]], than in positions like [[quarterback]], where such movement is integral. Regardless of equipment, it is important to report even minor symptoms to an athletic trainer or team physician, and to allow appropriate recovery time.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nStingers commonly occur in contact sports like wrestling, hockey, basketball, boxing, rugby, weightlifting, and, most notably, football. One study found that up to 65% of college football players have suffered at least one stringer. However, it is difficult to ping an exact number of athletes that suffer from stringers as stringers are historically under-reported.

The [[vertebral column|spine]] injury is characterized by a shooting or stinging [[pain]] that travels down one arm, followed by numbness and weakness in the parts of the arms, including the biceps, deltoid, and spinati muscles. Many athletes in contact sports have suffered stingers, but they are often unreported to medical professionals.\n\nAnyone who experiences significant trauma to his or her head or neck needs immediate medical evaluation for the possibility of a [[spinal injury]]. In fact, it's safest to assume that trauma victims have a spinal injury until proven otherwise because:\n* The time between injury and treatment can be critical in determining the extent of complications and the amount of recovery\n* A serious spinal injury is not always immediately obvious. If it is not recognized, more severe injury may occur\n* Numbness or paralysis may develop immediately or come on gradually as bleeding or swelling occurs in or around the spinal cord<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/spinal-cord-injury/basics/symptoms/con-20023837|title=Spinal cord injury - Symptoms and causes|author=|date=|website=mayoclinic.org}}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism ==\nSince stingers are a nerve injury, a stringer can fall into two different categories of peripheral nerve injury with physiological differences. '''Grade I''' is [[neurapraxia]], which involves focal damage of the [[Myelin|myelin fibers]] around the [[axon]], with the [[axon]] and the connective tissue sheath remaining intact. The disruption of nerve function involves demyelination. [[Axon|Axonal]] integrity is preserved, and remyelination occurs within days or weeks.<ref name=\":0\">Neal, S. L., & Fields, K. B. (2010).

If this is to happen it is not considered a stringer, and usually is a high-energy injury to the [[Shoulder girdle|shoulder-girdle]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA stinger is an injury that is caused by restriction of the nerve supply to the upper extremity via the [[brachial plexus]].  The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior rami of the nerves at the 5th cervical level of the spinal cord all the way to the nerves at the 1st thoracic level of the spinal cord.  The brachial plexus innervates the upper extremity as well as some muscles in the neck and shoulder.<ref>Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. 6th ed. New York, NY: \tMcGraw-Hill, 2012.

The upper trunk provides part of the nerve to supply to the upper extremity via the Musculocutaneous, Axillary, Radial and Median nerves.<ref>PM&R Knowledge. \"AAPM&R - American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.\" PM&R \tKnowledge NOW.

Repeated nerve [[Physical trauma|trauma]] can cause recurring stingers, [[chronic pain]], and [[muscle]] weakness, while recovery can take weeks to months in severe cases.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/1101/p2035.html|title=The \"Burner\": A Common Nerve Injury in Contact Sports|first1=Geoffrey S.|last1=Kuhlman|first2=Douglas B.|last2=McKeag|date=1 November 1999|journal=American Family Physician|volume=60|issue=7|pages=2035-2040|pmid=10569506}}</ref>\n\n== Diagnosis and treatment ==\nStingers are best [[diagnosis|diagnosed]] by a medical professional. This person will assess the athlete's pain, range of head and neck motion, arm numbness, and muscle strength. Often, the affected athlete is allowed to return to play within a short time, but persistent symptoms will result in removal. Athletes are also advised to receive \nregular evaluations until symptoms have ceased. If they have not after two weeks, or increase, additional tests such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) can be performed to detect a more serious injury, such as a [[herniated disc]].\n\nThe order of treatments applied depends on whether the athlete's main complaint is pain or weakness. Both can be treated with an [[analgesic]], [[anti-inflammatory]] [[medication]], ice and heat, restriction of movement, and if necessary, [[cervical collar]] or traction. [[Surgery]] is only necessary in the most severe cases.\n\n== Returning to play ==\nReturning from this injury depends on the number of burners that occurs. If a stinger occurs, the athletes usually return to play after they restore full strength, are asymptomatic where no pain persists, and painless range of motion in the cervical spine. At low frequencies of stingers, like 1 or 2, there is a much lower risk of the symptoms reoccurring. If three or more stingers occur in one season, one has a higher increased risk at the symptoms persisting.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qureshi|first=Sheeraz A.|last2=Hecht|first2=Andrew C.|date=2010-12-01|title=Burner Syndrome and Cervical Cord Neuropraxia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040738310000663|journal=Seminars in Spine Surgery|series=Athletic Spine Injuries: State of the Art|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=193\u2013197|doi=10.1053/j.semss.2010.06.005|issn=1040-7383}}</ref> \n\n== Prevention ==\nStringers can be prevented by several of the following factors. \n\nFlexibility and strength of the neck, shoulder, and upper extremity are essential because stiffness and weakness are predisposing factors for a burner as well as consequences of this injury. Factors that could help in the prevention of stringers could include strengthening the muscles, increasing the range of motion, and improving technique when playing.<ref>KUHLMAN, GEOFFREY S, and DOUGLAS B MCKEAG. \u201cThe \u2018Burner\u2019: A Common Nerve Injury in Contact Sports.\u201d ''American Family Physician'', 1 Nov. 1999, <nowiki>https://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/1101/p2035.html</nowiki>.</ref>\n\nSimple measures can be taken to help in the recovery from stingers. A chest-out posture should be adapted to prevent the neck from extending too far because it brings the head over the shoulders. The chest-out posture is emphasized due to it being commonly adopted by athletes due to developed shoulders and is perpetuated by brachial plexus irritation. The chest-out posture also reduces pressure on the brachial plexus by opening the thoracic outlet.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qureshi|first=Sheeraz A.|last2=Hecht|first2=Andrew C.|date=2010-12-01|title=Burner Syndrome and Cervical Cord Neuropraxia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040738310000663|journal=Seminars in Spine Surgery|series=Athletic Spine Injuries: State of the Art|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=193\u2013197|doi=10.1053/j.semss.2010.06.005|issn=1040-7383}}</ref>\n\nFinally, stingers can be prevented by wearing protective gear, such as [[butterfly restrictor]]s, designed to protect the head and neck from being forced into unnatural positions. This equipment is more feasible in positions where unrestricted head and neck movement is not required, such as [[Lineman (American football)|American football lineman]], than in positions like [[quarterback]], where such movement is integral. Regardless of equipment, it is important to report even minor symptoms to an athletic trainer or team physician, and to allow appropriate recovery time.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nStingers commonly occur in contact sports like wrestling, hockey, basketball, boxing, rugby, weightlifting, and, most notably, football. One study found that up to 65% of college football players have suffered at least one stringer. However, it is difficult to ping an exact number of athletes that suffer from stringers as stringers are historically under-reported. This could be due to the players fear of being removed from play or the injury being viewed as unimportant.<ref>Weinberg , J., Rokito , S., & Silber , J. S. (2003).

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin script was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Pala'wan script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" B1 Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha''') which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letterforms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage: straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n====Pre-colonial and colonial usage====\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''suyat'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''suyat'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010.

These signs (which may be presented vertically like Indic dandas, or slanted like forward slashes) are unified across Philippines scripts and were encoded by Unicode in the [[Hanunoo alphabet|Hanun\u00f3o script]] block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch17.pdf#G26723|title=Chapter 17: Indonesia and Oceania, Philippine Scripts|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=March 2020}}</ref> Space separation of words was historically not used on traditional supports, but is common today.\n\n=== Example sentences ===\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170c\u170b\u1705\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u1708\u1704\u1714\u1703\u1703\u1702\u1708\u170f\u1700\u1708\u1714\u1735 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u170b\u1704\u1714 \u1709\u1703\u1711\u1712\u1708\u1711\u1713\u1708\u1714\u1736}}\n*: ''Yamang \u2018di nagkakaunawaan, ay mag-pakahinahon.''\n*: Remain calm in disagreements.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u1704\u1714\u1706\u1708\u1712\u170b\u1714 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u170a\u1712\u1707\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''Magtanim ay 'di bir\u00f2.''\n*: Planting is not a joke.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u170b\u1711\u170e\u1712\u1708\u1714 \u1703\u1712\u1706 \u1711\u1705\u1714\u1704\u1705\u1714 \u1710 \u1709\u1713\u170b\u1713\u1706\u1712 \u1700\u1705\u1714 \u170a\u1713\u1711\u1713\u1703\u1714 \u1703\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''M\u00e1mahalin kit\u00e1 hangg\u00e1ng sa pumut\u00ed ang buh\u00f3k ko.''\n*: I will love you until my hair turns white.\n\n=== Collation ===\n* In the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', the letters of Baybayin were collated (without any connection with other similar script, except sorting vowels before consonants) as:\n*: '''A, U/O, I/E;

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin script was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Pala'wan script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" B1 Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha''') which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letterforms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage: straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters. Found by pupils of [[Rizal Elementary School]] on [[Ticao Island]] in Monreal town, [[Masbate]], which had scraped the mud off their shoes and slippers on two irregular shaped [[limestone]] tablets before entering their classroom, they are now housed at a section of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]], which weighs 30 kilos, is 11 centimeters thick, 54&nbsp;cm long and 44&nbsp;cm wide while the other is 6&nbsp;cm thick, 20&nbsp;cm long and 18&nbsp;cm wide.<ref name=\"INQPHmuddied\">[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/616407/muddied-stones-reveal-ancient-scripts Muddied stones reveal ancient scripts]</ref><ref name=\"ELIZAGAticao\">[http://heritage.elizaga.net/explorations/borrinaga/ticao-stones.pdf Romancing the Ticao Stones: Preliminary Transcription, Decipherment, Translation, and Some Notes]</ref>\n\n=== Two styles of writing ===\n\n[[File:DoctrinaChristianaEspanolaYTagala8-9.jpg|thumb|Pages of the ''Doctrina Christiana'', [[First book of the Spanish Philippines|an early Christian book]] in Spanish and Tagalog (1593)]]\n\n==== Virama Kudlit \"style\" ====\n\nThe original writing method was particularly difficult for the Spanish priests who were translating books into the vernaculars. Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n====Pre-colonial and colonial usage====\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''suyat'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''suyat'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010.

Lt. Gen. Nikolai Parshin, chief of the Missile and Artillery Directorate, said that after Dutch investigators displayed parts of the missile and their serial numbers, they studied and declassified archives at the research center that produced the Buk missiles. Parshin said the Russian archives show that the missile that was made of these parts was transported to a military unit in western Ukraine in 1986, and to Russia's knowledge never left Ukraine.

He is part of Confucius's fourth generation of disciples.

Conversations with these rulers form the basis of the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'', which would later be canonised as a Confucian [[Chinese classics|classic]].\n\nA key belief of his was that humans are innately good, but that this quality requires cultivation and the right environment to flourish. He also taught that rulers must justify their position of power by acting benevolently towards their subjects, and in this sense they are subordinate to the masses. \n{{anchor|History|Biography}}\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Temple of Mencius - Yasheng Hall - inside - P1050921.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An image of Mencius in the sanctuary of the Mencius Temple, Zoucheng]]\nMencius, also known by his birth name '''Meng Ke''' (\u5b5f\u8efb), was born in the [[State of Zou]]. His birthplace is now within the [[county-level city]] of [[Zoucheng]], [[Shandong]] Province, only thirty kilometres (eighteen miles) south of Confucius's birthplace in [[Qufu]].\n\nHe was an itinerant [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] and sage, and one of the principal interpreters of [[Confucianism]]. Supposedly, he was a pupil of Confucius's grandson, [[Zisi]]. Like Confucius, according to legend, he travelled throughout China for forty years to offer advice to rulers for reform.<ref>Chan 1963: 49.</ref> During the [[Warring States period]] (403\u2013221 BC), Mencius served as an official and scholar at the [[Jixia Academy]] in the [[State of Qi]] (1046 BC to 221 BC) from 319 to 312 BC. He expressed his [[filial piety|filial devotion]] when he took three years leave of absence from his official duties for Qi to mourn his mother's death. Disappointed at his failure to effect changes in his contemporary world, he retired from public life.<ref>[[Jaroslav Pr\u016f\u0161ek]] and Zbigniew S\u0142upski, eds., Dictionary of Oriental Literatures: East Asia (Charles Tuttle, 1978): 115-116.</ref>\n\nMencius is buried in the \"Mencius Cemetery\" (\u5b5f\u5b50\u6797, ''Mengzi Lin'', also known as \u4e9e\u8056\u6797, ''Yasheng Lin''), which is located 12&nbsp;km to the northeast of Zoucheng's central urban area. A [[stele]] carried by a giant [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] and crowned with dragons stands in front of his grave.<ref>[http://www.infobase.gov.cn/intro/fjms/l8/l8016/index.htm \u5b5f\u5b50\u6797] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805110526/http://www.infobase.gov.cn/intro/fjms/l8/l8016/index.htm |date=2012-08-05 }} (Mencius Cemetery)</ref>\n\n===Mother===\n{{Anchor|Mencius's mother}}\nMencius's mother is often held up as an exemplary female figure in Chinese culture. One of the most famous traditional Chinese [[Chengyu|four-character idioms]] is {{linktext|\u5b5f\u6bcd\u4e09\u9077}} ({{zh|p=m\u00e8ngm\u01d4-s\u0101nqi\u0101n|l=Mencius's mother moves three times|c=|s=|t=}}); this saying refers to the legend that Mencius's mother moved houses three times before finding a location that she felt was suitable for the child's upbringing. As an expression, the idiom refers to the importance of finding the proper environment for raising children.\n\nMencius's father died when Mencius was very young. His mother {{linktext|Zh\u01ceng}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4ec9}}}}) raised her son alone. They were very poor. At first they lived by a cemetery, where the mother found her son imitating the paid mourners in funeral processions. Therefore, the mother decided to move. The next house was near a market in the town. There the boy began to imitate the cries of merchants (merchants were despised in early China). So the mother moved to a house next to a school. Inspired by the scholars and students, Mencius began to study. His mother decided to remain, and Mencius became a scholar.\n\nAnother story further illustrates the emphasis that Mencius's mother placed on her son's education. As the story goes, once when Mencius was young, he was truant from school. His mother responded to his apparent disregard for his education by taking up a pair of scissors and cutting the cloth she had been weaving in front of him. This was intended to illustrate that one cannot stop a task midway, and her example inspired Mencius to diligence in his studies.\n\nThere is another legend about his mother and his wife, involving a time when his wife was at home alone and was discovered by Mencius not to be sitting properly. Mencius thought his wife had violated a rite, and demanded a divorce. His mother claimed that it was written in The Book of Rites that before a person entered a room, he should announce his imminent presence loudly to let others prepare for his arrival; as he had not done that in this case, the person who had violated the rite was Mencius himself. Eventually Mencius admitted his fault.\n\nShe is one of 125 women of which biographies have been included in the [[Lien\u00fc zhuan|Lien\u00fc zhuan ('Biographies of Exemplary Women')]], written by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]].\n\n===Lineage===\n[[Duke Huan of Lu]]'s son through Qingfu (\u6176\u7236) was the ancestor of Mencius. He was descended from Duke Yang of the [[State of Lu]] (\u9b6f\u716c\u516c). Duke Yang was the son of [[Bo Qin]], who was the son of the [[Duke of Zhou]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]] royal family. The genealogy is found in the Mencius family tree (\u5b5f\u5b50\u4e16\u5bb6\u5927\u5b97\u4e16\u7cfb).<ref>\u300a\u4e09\u9077\u5fd7\u300b\uff0c\uff08\u6e05\uff09\u5b5f\u884d\u6cf0\u7e8c\u4fee</ref><ref>\u300a\u5b5f\u5b50\u4e16\u5bb6\u8b5c\u300b\uff0c\uff08\u6e05\uff09\u5b5f\u5ee3\u5747\u4e3b\u7de8\uff0c1824\u5e74</ref><ref>\u300a\u5b5f\u5b50\u8207\u5b5f\u6c0f\u5bb6\u65cf\u300b\uff0c\u5b5f\u7965\u5c45\u7de8\uff0c2005\u5e74</ref>\n\nMencius's descendants lived in [[Zoucheng]] in the Mencius Family Mansion, where the Mencius Temple was also built and also a cemetery for Mencius's descendants.\n\n[[Meng Haoran]] and [[Meng Jiao]] were descendants of Mencius who lived during the [[Tang dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Ming dynasty]], one of Mencius's descendants was given a hereditary title at the [[Hanlin Academy]] by the Emperor.

T. C. Werner]]\n===Human nature===\nWhile Confucius himself did not explicitly focus on the subject of human nature, Mencius asserted the innate goodness of the individual, believing that it was society's influence \u2013 its lack of a positive cultivating influence \u2013 that caused bad [[moral character]]. \"He who exerts his mind to the utmost knows his nature\"<ref>The ''Mencius'' 7:A1 in Chan 1963: 78.</ref> and \"the way of learning is none other than finding the lost mind.\"<ref>The ''Mencius'' 6:A11 in Chan 1963: 58.</ref>\n\n===The four beginnings (or sprouts)===\nTo show innate goodness, Mencius used the example of a child falling down a well. Witnesses of this event immediately feel {{cquote|alarm and distress, not to gain friendship with the child's parents, nor to seek the praise of their neighbors and friends, nor because they dislike the reputation [of lack of humanity if they did not rescue the child]...\n\nThe feeling of commiseration definitely is the beginning of humanity;\nthe feeling of shame and dislike is the beginning of righteousness;\nthe feeling of deference and compliance is the beginning of propriety;\nand the feeling of right or wrong is the beginning of [[wisdom]].\n\nMen have these Four Beginnings just as they have their four limbs. Having these Four Beginnings, but saying that they cannot develop them is to destroy themselves.<ref>The ''Mencius'' 2A:6 in Chan 1963: 65. Formatting has been applied to ease readability.</ref>}}\n\nHuman nature has an innate tendency towards goodness, but moral rightness cannot be instructed down to the last detail.  This is why merely external controls always fail in improving society.  True improvement results from educational cultivation in favorable environments.  Likewise, bad environments tend to corrupt the human will. This, however, is not proof of innate evil because a clear thinking person would avoid causing harm to others.  This position of Mencius puts him between Confucians such as Xunzi who thought people were innately bad, and Taoists who believed humans did not need cultivation, they just needed to accept their innate, natural, and effortless goodness.  The four beginnings/sprouts could grow and develop, or they could fail. In this way Mencius synthesized integral parts of Taoism into Confucianism.  Individual effort was needed to cultivate oneself, but one's natural tendencies were good to begin with. The object of education is the cultivation of benevolence, otherwise known as [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]].\n\n===Education===\nAccording to Mencius, education must awaken the innate abilities of the human mind.  He denounced memorization and advocated active interrogation of the text, saying, \"One who believes all of a book would be better off without books\" (\u76e1\u4fe1\u66f8\uff0c\u5247\u4e0d\u5982\u7121\u66f8, from \u5b5f\u5b50.\u76e1\u5fc3\u4e0b). One should check for internal consistency by comparing sections and debate the probability of factual accounts by comparing them with experience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Destiny===\nMencius also believed in the power of Destiny in shaping the roles of human beings in society.  What is destined cannot be contrived by the human intellect or foreseen.   Destiny is shown when a path arises that is both unforeseen and constructive.    Destiny should not be confused with Fate.  Mencius denied that Heaven would protect a person regardless of his actions, saying, \"One who understands Destiny will not stand beneath a tottering wall\".  The proper path is one which is natural and unforced.  This path must also be maintained because, \"Unused pathways are covered with weeds.\"  One who follows Destiny will live a long and successful life.  One who rebels against Destiny will die before his time.\n\n===Views on politics and economics===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Life of Mencius.jpg|thumb|210px|right|\"The Life of Mencius\" pictures Mencius walking with the King of [[Teng (state)|Teng]], discussing his philosophy that all men have innate benevolence.]] -->\n\nMencius emphasized the significance of the common citizens in the state. While Confucianism generally regards rulers highly, he argued that it is acceptable for the subjects to overthrow or even kill a ruler who ignores the people's needs and rules harshly. This is because a ruler who does not rule justly is no longer a true ruler. Speaking of the overthrow of the wicked [[King Zhou of Shang]], Mencius said, \"I have merely heard of killing a villain Zhou, but I have not heard of murdering [him as] the ruler.\"<ref>The ''Mencius'' 1B:8 in Chan 1963: 62.</ref>\n\nThis saying should not be taken as an instigation to violence against authorities but as an application of Confucian philosophy to society.  Confucianism requires a clarification of what may be reasonably expected in any given relationship.  All relationships should be beneficial, but each has its own principle or inner logic.  A Ruler must justify his position by acting benevolently before he can expect reciprocation from the people.  In this view, a King is like a steward.  Although Confucius admired Kings of great accomplishment, Mencius is clarifying the proper hierarchy of human society.  Although a King has presumably higher status than a commoner, he is actually subordinate to the masses of people and the resources of society.  Otherwise, there would be an implied disregard of the potential of human society heading into the future.  One is significant only for what one gives, not for what one takes.\n\nMencius distinguished between superior men who recognize and follow the virtues of righteousness and benevolence and inferior men who do not. He suggested that superior men considered only righteousness, not benefits. That assumes \"permanent property\" to uphold common morality. <ref>Yagi, Kiichiro (2008). \"China, economics in,\" ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]], v. 1, p. 778.

Hart|Hart, Michael H.]] (1978), ''The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History'', p. 480.</ref>\n\n==Comparisons to contemporaries==\nHis alleged years make him contemporary with [[Xun Zi]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Gaozi]], and [[Plato]].\n\n===Xun Zi===\n[[Xun Zi]] was a Confucian who believed that human nature is centered on self-interest and greed, and the purpose of moral cultivation is to develop our nature into goodness. This put him at odds with Mencius. Later, the thinker [[Zhu Xi]] declared  the views of Xun Zi to be unorthodox, instead supporting the position of Mencius.\n\n===Plato===\nMencius's argument that unjust rulers may be overthrown is reminiscent of [[Socrates]]'s argument in Book I of Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Temple of Mencius - possibly Yuan bixi near Qisheng Hall - P1050933.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Yuan Dynasty]] [[bixi (tortoise)|turtle]] with a stele honoring Mencius]]\nMencius's interpretation of Confucianism has generally been considered the orthodox version by subsequent Chinese philosophers, especially by the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] of the [[Song dynasty]].  Mencius's disciples included a large number of feudal lords, and he is said to have been more influential than Confucius had been.<ref name=\"test\">Charles O. Hucker, ''China to 1850: A Short History'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1978, p. 45</ref> \n\nThe ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' (also spelled ''Mengzi'' or ''Meng-tzu''), a book of his conversations with kings of the time, is one of the [[Four Books]] that [[Zhu Xi]] grouped as the core of orthodox Neo-Confucian thought. In contrast to the sayings of Confucius, which are short and self-contained, the ''Mencius'' consists of long dialogues, including arguments, with extensive prose. It was generally neglected by the [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] who first translated the [[Confucian canon]] into [[Latin]] and other European languages, as they felt that the Neo-Confucian school largely consisted of [[Buddhism in China|Buddhist]] and [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] contamination of [[Confucianism]]. [[Matteo Ricci]] also particularly disliked what they had believed to be condemnation of celibacy as unfilial, which is rather a mistranslation of a similar word referring more to aspects of personality.

Conversations with these rulers form the basis of the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'', which would later be canonised as a Confucian [[Chinese classics|classic]].\n\nA key belief of his was that humans are innately good, but that this quality requires cultivation and the right environment to flourish. He also taught that rulers must justify their position of power by acting benevolently towards their subjects, and in this sense they are subordinate to the masses. \n{{anchor|History|Biography}}\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Temple of Mencius - Yasheng Hall - inside - P1050921.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An image of Mencius in the sanctuary of the Mencius Temple, Zoucheng]]\nMencius, also known by his birth name '''Meng Ke''' (\u5b5f\u8efb), was born in the [[State of Zou]]. His birthplace is now within the [[county-level city]] of [[Zoucheng]], [[Shandong]] Province, only thirty kilometres (eighteen miles) south of Confucius's birthplace in [[Qufu]].\n\nHe was an itinerant [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] and sage, and one of the principal interpreters of [[Confucianism]]. Supposedly, he was a pupil of Confucius's grandson, [[Zisi]]. Like Confucius, according to legend, he travelled throughout China for forty years to offer advice to rulers for reform.<ref>Chan 1963: 49.</ref> During the [[Warring States period]] (403\u2013221 BC), Mencius served as an official and scholar at the [[Jixia Academy]] in the [[State of Qi]] (1046 BC to 221 BC) from 319 to 312 BC. He expressed his [[filial piety|filial devotion]] when he took three years leave of absence from his official duties for Qi to mourn his mother's death. Disappointed at his failure to effect changes in his contemporary world, he retired from public life.<ref>[[Jaroslav Pr\u016f\u0161ek]] and Zbigniew S\u0142upski, eds., Dictionary of Oriental Literatures: East Asia (Charles Tuttle, 1978): 115-116.</ref>\n\nMencius is buried in the \"Mencius Cemetery\" (\u5b5f\u5b50\u6797, ''Mengzi Lin'', also known as \u4e9e\u8056\u6797, ''Yasheng Lin''), which is located 12&nbsp;km to the northeast of Zoucheng's central urban area. A [[stele]] carried by a giant [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] and crowned with dragons stands in front of his grave.<ref>[http://www.infobase.gov.cn/intro/fjms/l8/l8016/index.htm \u5b5f\u5b50\u6797] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805110526/http://www.infobase.gov.cn/intro/fjms/l8/l8016/index.htm |date=2012-08-05 }} (Mencius Cemetery)</ref>\n\n===Mother===\n{{Anchor|Mencius's mother}}\nMencius's mother is often held up as an exemplary female figure in Chinese culture. One of the most famous traditional Chinese [[Chengyu|four-character idioms]] is {{linktext|\u5b5f\u6bcd\u4e09\u9077}} ({{zh|p=m\u00e8ngm\u01d4-s\u0101nqi\u0101n|l=Mencius's mother moves three times|c=|s=|t=}}); this saying refers to the legend that Mencius's mother moved houses three times before finding a location that she felt was suitable for the child's upbringing. As an expression, the idiom refers to the importance of finding the proper environment for raising children.\n\nMencius's father died when Mencius was very young. His mother {{linktext|Zh\u01ceng}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4ec9}}}}) raised her son alone. They were very poor. At first they lived by a cemetery, where the mother found her son imitating the paid mourners in funeral processions. Therefore, the mother decided to move. The next house was near a market in the town. There the boy began to imitate the cries of merchants (merchants were despised in early China). So the mother moved to a house next to a school. Inspired by the scholars and students, Mencius began to study. His mother decided to remain, and Mencius became a scholar.\n\nAnother story further illustrates the emphasis that Mencius's mother placed on her son's education. As the story goes, once when Mencius was young, he was truant from school. His mother responded to his apparent disregard for his education by taking up a pair of scissors and cutting the cloth she had been weaving in front of him. This was intended to illustrate that one cannot stop a task midway, and her example inspired Mencius to diligence in his studies.\n\nThere is another legend about his mother and his wife, involving a time when his wife was at home alone and was discovered by Mencius not to be sitting properly. Mencius thought his wife had violated a rite, and demanded a divorce. His mother claimed that it was written in The Book of Rites that before a person entered a room, he should announce his imminent presence loudly to let others prepare for his arrival; as he had not done that in this case, the person who had violated the rite was Mencius himself. Eventually Mencius admitted his fault.\n\nShe is one of 125 women of which biographies have been included in the [[Lien\u00fc zhuan|Lien\u00fc zhuan ('Biographies of Exemplary Women')]], written by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]].\n\n===Lineage===\n[[Duke Huan of Lu]]'s son through Qingfu (\u6176\u7236) was the ancestor of Mencius. He was descended from Duke Yang of the [[State of Lu]] (\u9b6f\u716c\u516c). Duke Yang was the son of [[Bo Qin]], who was the son of the [[Duke of Zhou]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]] royal family. The genealogy is found in the Mencius family tree (\u5b5f\u5b50\u4e16\u5bb6\u5927\u5b97\u4e16\u7cfb).<ref>\u300a\u4e09\u9077\u5fd7\u300b\uff0c\uff08\u6e05\uff09\u5b5f\u884d\u6cf0\u7e8c\u4fee</ref><ref>\u300a\u5b5f\u5b50\u4e16\u5bb6\u8b5c\u300b\uff0c\uff08\u6e05\uff09\u5b5f\u5ee3\u5747\u4e3b\u7de8\uff0c1824\u5e74</ref><ref>\u300a\u5b5f\u5b50\u8207\u5b5f\u6c0f\u5bb6\u65cf\u300b\uff0c\u5b5f\u7965\u5c45\u7de8\uff0c2005\u5e74</ref>\n\nMencius's descendants lived in [[Zoucheng]] in the Mencius Family Mansion, where the Mencius Temple was also built and also a cemetery for Mencius's descendants.\n\n[[Meng Haoran]] and [[Meng Jiao]] were descendants of Mencius who lived during the [[Tang dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Ming dynasty]], one of Mencius's descendants was given a hereditary title at the [[Hanlin Academy]] by the Emperor.

Likewise, bad environments tend to corrupt the human will. This, however, is not proof of innate evil because a clear thinking person would avoid causing harm to others.  This position of Mencius puts him between Confucians such as Xunzi who thought people were innately bad, and Taoists who believed humans did not need cultivation, they just needed to accept their innate, natural, and effortless goodness.  The four beginnings/sprouts could grow and develop, or they could fail. In this way Mencius synthesized integral parts of Taoism into Confucianism.  Individual effort was needed to cultivate oneself, but one's natural tendencies were good to begin with. The object of education is the cultivation of benevolence, otherwise known as [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]].\n\n===Education===\nAccording to Mencius, education must awaken the innate abilities of the human mind.  He denounced memorization and advocated active interrogation of the text, saying, \"One who believes all of a book would be better off without books\" (\u76e1\u4fe1\u66f8\uff0c\u5247\u4e0d\u5982\u7121\u66f8, from \u5b5f\u5b50.\u76e1\u5fc3\u4e0b). One should check for internal consistency by comparing sections and debate the probability of factual accounts by comparing them with experience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Destiny===\nMencius also believed in the power of Destiny in shaping the roles of human beings in society.  What is destined cannot be contrived by the human intellect or foreseen.   Destiny is shown when a path arises that is both unforeseen and constructive.    Destiny should not be confused with Fate.  Mencius denied that Heaven would protect a person regardless of his actions, saying, \"One who understands Destiny will not stand beneath a tottering wall\".  The proper path is one which is natural and unforced.  This path must also be maintained because, \"Unused pathways are covered with weeds.\"  One who follows Destiny will live a long and successful life.  One who rebels against Destiny will die before his time.\n\n===Views on politics and economics===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Life of Mencius.jpg|thumb|210px|right|\"The Life of Mencius\" pictures Mencius walking with the King of [[Teng (state)|Teng]], discussing his philosophy that all men have innate benevolence.]] -->\n\nMencius emphasized the significance of the common citizens in the state. While Confucianism generally regards rulers highly, he argued that it is acceptable for the subjects to overthrow or even kill a ruler who ignores the people's needs and rules harshly. This is because a ruler who does not rule justly is no longer a true ruler. Speaking of the overthrow of the wicked [[King Zhou of Shang]], Mencius said, \"I have merely heard of killing a villain Zhou, but I have not heard of murdering [him as] the ruler.\"<ref>The ''Mencius'' 1B:8 in Chan 1963: 62.</ref>\n\nThis saying should not be taken as an instigation to violence against authorities but as an application of Confucian philosophy to society.  Confucianism requires a clarification of what may be reasonably expected in any given relationship.  All relationships should be beneficial, but each has its own principle or inner logic.  A Ruler must justify his position by acting benevolently before he can expect reciprocation from the people.  In this view, a King is like a steward.  Although Confucius admired Kings of great accomplishment, Mencius is clarifying the proper hierarchy of human society.  Although a King has presumably higher status than a commoner, he is actually subordinate to the masses of people and the resources of society.  Otherwise, there would be an implied disregard of the potential of human society heading into the future.  One is significant only for what one gives, not for what one takes.\n\nMencius distinguished between superior men who recognize and follow the virtues of righteousness and benevolence and inferior men who do not. He suggested that superior men considered only righteousness, not benefits. That assumes \"permanent property\" to uphold common morality. <ref>Yagi, Kiichiro (2008). \"China, economics in,\" ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]], v. 1, p. 778.

This put him at odds with Mencius. Later, the thinker [[Zhu Xi]] declared  the views of Xun Zi to be unorthodox, instead supporting the position of Mencius.\n\n===Plato===\nMencius's argument that unjust rulers may be overthrown is reminiscent of [[Socrates]]'s argument in Book I of Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Temple of Mencius - possibly Yuan bixi near Qisheng Hall - P1050933.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Yuan Dynasty]] [[bixi (tortoise)|turtle]] with a stele honoring Mencius]]\nMencius's interpretation of Confucianism has generally been considered the orthodox version by subsequent Chinese philosophers, especially by the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] of the [[Song dynasty]].  Mencius's disciples included a large number of feudal lords, and he is said to have been more influential than Confucius had been.<ref name=\"test\">Charles O.

In contrast to the sayings of Confucius, which are short and self-contained, the ''Mencius'' consists of long dialogues, including arguments, with extensive prose. It was generally neglected by the [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] who first translated the [[Confucian canon]] into [[Latin]] and other European languages, as they felt that the Neo-Confucian school largely consisted of [[Buddhism in China|Buddhist]] and [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] contamination of [[Confucianism]]. [[Matteo Ricci]] also particularly disliked Mencius's strong condemnation of [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]] as [[filial piety|unfilial]].

It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it.<ref>Truss (2004), p. 142.</ref> This character can be represented using the reversed question mark ([[\u2e2e]]) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the [[irony mark]], but those are even more rarely seen.\n\nBracketed question marks can be used for rhetorical questions, for example ''Oh, really(?)'', in informal contexts such as [[closed captioning]].  For an ironic or sarcastic statement, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used: ''Oh, really(!)''.\n\nThe question mark can also be used as a [[meta]]-sign to signal uncertainty regarding what precedes it. It is usually put between brackets: ''(?)''. The uncertainty may concern either a superficial level (such as unsure spelling), or a deeper [[Truth-conditional semantics|truth]] (real [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]).\n\n==Computing==\nIn [[computing]], the question mark [[Character (computing)|character]] is represented by [[ASCII]] code 63 (0x3F hexadecimal), and is located at Unicode code-point {{unichar|003F|QUESTION MARK|html=}}. The full-width (double-byte) equivalent ('''\uff1f'''), is located at code-point {{unichar|FF1F|FULLWIDTH QUESTION MARK|html=}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Character Codes \u2013 HTML Codes, Hexadecimal Codes & HTML Names |url=http://www.character-code.com/ |work=Character-Code.com |access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe question mark is often utilized as a [[wildcard character]]: a symbol that can be used to substitute for any other character or characters in a [[String (computer science)|string]]. In particular \"?\" is used as a substitute for any one character as opposed to the [[asterisk]], \"*\", which can be used as a substitute for zero or more characters in a string. The [[Inverted question mark and exclamation point|inverted question mark]] ('''\u00bf''') corresponds to Unicode code-point {{unichar|00BF|INVERTED QUESTION MARK|html=}}, and can be accessed from the keyboard in [[Microsoft Windows]] on the default US layout by holding down the [[Alt key|<kbd>Alt</kbd>]] and typing either <kbd>1 6 8</kbd> (ANSI) or <kbd>0 1 9 1</kbd> (Unicode) on the numeric keypad. In [[GNOME]] applications on [[Linux]] operating systems, it can be entered by typing the hexadecimal Unicode character (minus leading zeros) while holding down both [[Ctrl key|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>]] and [[Shift key|<kbd>Shift</kbd>]], I J mm.e.: <kbd>Ctrl Shift B F</kbd>. In recent [[XFree86]] and [[X.Org Server|X.Org]] incarnations of the [[X Window System]], it can be accessed as a compose sequence of two straight question marks, i.e. pressing [[Compose key|<kbd>Compose</kbd>]]<kbd> ? ?</kbd> yields <samp>\u00bf</samp>. In [[classic Mac OS]] and [[Mac OS X]] (macOS), the key combination [[Option key|<kbd>Option</kbd>]]<kbd> Shift ?</kbd> produces an inverted question mark.\n\nThe question mark is used in ASCII renderings of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as [[SAMPA]], in place of the [[glottal stop]] symbol, {{IPA|'''\u0294'''}}, (which resembles \"'''?'''\" without the dot), and corresponds to Unicode code point {{unichar|0294|LATIN LETTER GLOTTAL STOP|html=}}.\n\nIn [[computer programming]], the symbol \"'''?'''\" has a special meaning in many [[programming language]]s. In [[C (programming language)|C]]-descended languages, <code>?</code> is part of the [[?:|<code>?:</code>]] operator, which is used to evaluate simple [[Boolean domain|boolean conditions]]. In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0, the <code>?</code> modifier is used to handle [[Nullable type|nullable data types]] and <code>??</code> is the [[null coalescing operator]]. In the [[POSIX]] syntax for [[regular expression]]s, such as that used in [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], <code>?</code> stands for \"zero or one instance of the previous subexpression\", i.e. an optional element. In certain implementations of the [[BASIC]] programming language, the <code>?</code> character may be used as a shorthand for the \"print\" function; in others (notably the [[BBC BASIC]] family), <code>?</code> is used to address a single-byte memory location. In [[OCaml]], the question mark precedes the label for an optional parameter. In [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], as a convention, symbol names ending in <code>?</code> are used for predicates, such as <code>odd?</code>, <code>null?</code>, and <code>eq?</code>. Similarly, in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], method names ending in <code>?</code> are used for predicates. In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], a type followed by <code>?</code> denotes an [[option type]]; <code>?</code> is also used in \"optional chaining\", where if an option value is nil, it ignores the following operations. In [[APL (programming language)|APL]], <code>?</code> generates random numbers or a random subset of indices. In [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], a <code>?</code> suffix on a function or method call indicates error handling.\n\nIn many [[Web browser]]s and other computer programs, when converting text between encodings, it may not be possible to map some characters into the target [[character set]]. In this situation it is common to replace each unmappable character with a question mark <samp>?</samp>, inverted question mark <samp>\u00bf</samp>, or the Unicode [[replacement character]], usually rendered as a white question mark in a black diamond: {{unichar|FFFD|REPLACEMENT CHARACTER}}. This commonly occurs for apostrophes and quotation marks when they are written with software that uses its own proprietary non-standard code for these characters, such as [[Microsoft Office]]'s [[Quotation marks in English#Smart quotes|\"smart quotes\"]].\n\nThe generic [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] syntax allows for a [[query string]] to be appended to a resource location in a Web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the query mark, <code>?</code>, is used to indicate the start of a query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different field/value pairs, each separated by the [[ampersand]] symbol, <code>&</code>, as seen in this URL:\n\n<code><nowiki>http://www.example.com/search.php?query=testing&database=English</nowiki></code>\n\nHere, a script on the page <samp>search.php</samp> on the server <samp>www.example.com</samp> is to provide a response to the query string containing the pairs <samp>query=</samp><kbd>testing</kbd> and <samp>database=</samp><kbd>English</kbd>.\n\n==Games==\nIn [[algebraic chess notation]], some [[chess punctuation]] conventions include: \"'''?'''\" denotes a bad move, \"'''??'''\" a [[blunder (chess)|blunder]], \"'''?!'''\" a [[dubious]] move, and \"'''!?'''\" an interesting move.\n\nIn [[Scrabble]], a question mark indicates a blank tile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tucsonscrabble.com/articles/glossary.html |title=Scrabble Glossary |publisher=Tucson Scrabble Club |access-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematics and formal logic==\n{{anchor|Mathematics|reason=Original section name.}}\nIn [[mathematics]], \"'''?'''\" commonly denotes [[Minkowski's question mark function]]. In equations, it can mean \"questioned\" as opposed to \"defined\".\n\n*{{unichar|225F|QUESTIONED EQUAL TO}}\n*{{unichar|2A7B|LESS-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE}}\n*{{unichar|2A7C|GREATER-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE}}\n\nIn [[linear logic]], the question mark denotes one of the exponential modalities that control weakening and contraction.\n\n==Medicine==\nA question mark is used in English medical notes to suggest a possible [[diagnosis]]. It facilitates the recording of a doctor's impressions regarding a patient's symptoms and signs. For example, for a patient presenting with left [[lower abdominal pain]], a differential diagnosis might include ''?[[diverticulitis]]'' (read as \"query diverticulitis\").\n\n==See also==\n* [[Exclamation mark]]\n* [[Interrobang]]\n* [[Irony mark]]\n* [[Terminal punctuation]]\n* [[Inquiry]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Lupton |first1=Ellen |last2=Miller |first2=J.

It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it.<ref>Truss (2004), p. 142.</ref> This character can be represented using the reversed question mark ([[\u2e2e]]) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the [[irony mark]], but those are even more rarely seen.\n\nBracketed question marks can be used for rhetorical questions, for example ''Oh, really(?)'', in informal contexts such as [[closed captioning]].  For an ironic or sarcastic statement, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used: ''Oh, really(!)''.\n\nThe question mark can also be used as a [[meta]]-sign to signal uncertainty regarding what precedes it. It is usually put between brackets: ''(?)''. The uncertainty may concern either a superficial level (such as unsure spelling), or a deeper [[Truth-conditional semantics|truth]] (real [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]).\n\n==Computing==\nIn [[computing]], the question mark [[Character (computing)|character]] is represented by [[ASCII]] code 63 (0x3F hexadecimal), and is located at Unicode code-point {{unichar|003F|QUESTION MARK|html=}}. The full-width (double-byte) equivalent ('''\uff1f'''), is located at code-point {{unichar|FF1F|FULLWIDTH QUESTION MARK|html=}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Character Codes \u2013 HTML Codes, Hexadecimal Codes & HTML Names |url=http://www.character-code.com/ |work=Character-Code.com |access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe question mark is often utilized as a [[wildcard character]]: a symbol that can be used to substitute for any other character or characters in a [[String (computer science)|string]]. In particular \"?\" is used as a substitute for any one character as opposed to the [[asterisk]], \"*\", which can be used as a substitute for zero or more characters in a string. The [[Inverted question mark and exclamation point|inverted question mark]] ('''\u00bf''') corresponds to Unicode code-point {{unichar|00BF|INVERTED QUESTION MARK|html=}}, and can be accessed from the keyboard in [[Microsoft Windows]] on the default US layout by holding down the [[Alt key|<kbd>Alt</kbd>]] and typing either <kbd>1 6 8</kbd> (ANSI) or <kbd>0 1 9 1</kbd> (Unicode) on the numeric keypad. In [[GNOME]] applications on [[Linux]] operating systems, it can be entered by typing the hexadecimal Unicode character (minus leading zeros) while holding down both [[Ctrl key|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>]] and [[Shift key|<kbd>Shift</kbd>]], I J mm.e.: <kbd>Ctrl Shift B F</kbd>. In recent [[XFree86]] and [[X.Org Server|X.Org]] incarnations of the [[X Window System]], it can be accessed as a compose sequence of two straight question marks, i.e. pressing [[Compose key|<kbd>Compose</kbd>]]<kbd> ? ?</kbd> yields <samp>\u00bf</samp>. In [[classic Mac OS]] and [[Mac OS X]] (macOS), the key combination [[Option key|<kbd>Option</kbd>]]<kbd> Shift ?</kbd> produces an inverted question mark.\n\nThe question mark is used in ASCII renderings of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as [[SAMPA]], in place of the [[glottal stop]] symbol, {{IPA|'''\u0294'''}}, (which resembles \"'''?'''\" without the dot), and corresponds to Unicode code point {{unichar|0294|LATIN LETTER GLOTTAL STOP|html=}}.\n\nIn [[computer programming]], the symbol \"'''?'''\" has a special meaning in many [[programming language]]s. In [[C (programming language)|C]]-descended languages, <code>?</code> is part of the [[?:|<code>?:</code>]] operator, which is used to evaluate simple [[Boolean domain|boolean conditions]]. In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0, the <code>?</code> modifier is used to handle [[Nullable type|nullable data types]] and <code>??</code> is the [[null coalescing operator]]. In the [[POSIX]] syntax for [[regular expression]]s, such as that used in [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], <code>?</code> stands for \"zero or one instance of the previous subexpression\", i.e. an optional element. In certain implementations of the [[BASIC]] programming language, the <code>?</code> character may be used as a shorthand for the \"print\" function; in others (notably the [[BBC BASIC]] family), <code>?</code> is used to address a single-byte memory location. In [[OCaml]], the question mark precedes the label for an optional parameter. In [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], as a convention, symbol names ending in <code>?</code> are used for predicates, such as <code>odd?</code>, <code>null?</code>, and <code>eq?</code>. Similarly, in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], method names ending in <code>?</code> are used for predicates. In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], a type followed by <code>?</code> denotes an [[option type]]; <code>?</code> is also used in \"optional chaining\", where if an option value is nil, it ignores the following operations. In [[APL (programming language)|APL]], <code>?</code> generates random numbers or a random subset of indices. In [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], a <code>?</code> suffix on a function or method call indicates error handling.\n\nIn many [[Web browser]]s and other computer programs, when converting text between encodings, it may not be possible to map some characters into the target [[character set]]. In this situation it is common to replace each unmappable character with a question mark <samp>?</samp>, inverted question mark <samp>\u00bf</samp>, or the Unicode [[replacement character]], usually rendered as a white question mark in a black diamond: {{unichar|FFFD|REPLACEMENT CHARACTER}}. This commonly occurs for apostrophes and quotation marks when they are written with software that uses its own proprietary non-standard code for these characters, such as [[Microsoft Office]]'s [[Quotation marks in English#Smart quotes|\"smart quotes\"]].\n\nThe generic [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] syntax allows for a [[query string]] to be appended to a resource location in a Web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the query mark, <code>?</code>, is used to indicate the start of a query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different field/value pairs, each separated by the [[ampersand]] symbol, <code>&</code>, as seen in this URL:\n\n<code><nowiki>http://www.example.com/search.php?query=testing&database=English</nowiki></code>\n\nHere, a script on the page <samp>search.php</samp> on the server <samp>www.example.com</samp> is to provide a response to the query string containing the pairs <samp>query=</samp><kbd>testing</kbd> and <samp>database=</samp><kbd>English</kbd>.\n\n==Games==\nIn [[algebraic chess notation]], some [[chess punctuation]] conventions include: \"'''?'''\" denotes a bad move, \"'''??'''\" a [[blunder (chess)|blunder]], \"'''?!'''\" a [[dubious]] move, and \"'''!?'''\" an interesting move.\n\nIn [[Scrabble]], a question mark indicates a blank tile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tucsonscrabble.com/articles/glossary.html |title=Scrabble Glossary |publisher=Tucson Scrabble Club |access-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematics and formal logic==\n{{anchor|Mathematics|reason=Original section name.}}\nIn [[mathematics]], \"'''?'''\" commonly denotes [[Minkowski's question mark function]]. In equations, it can mean \"questioned\" as opposed to \"defined\".\n\n*{{unichar|225F|QUESTIONED EQUAL TO}}\n*{{unichar|2A7B|LESS-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE}}\n*{{unichar|2A7C|GREATER-THAN WITH QUESTION MARK ABOVE}}\n\nIn [[linear logic]], the question mark denotes one of the exponential modalities that control weakening and contraction.\n\n==Medicine==\nA question mark is used in English medical notes to suggest a possible [[diagnosis]]. It facilitates the recording of a doctor's impressions regarding a patient's symptoms and signs. For example, for a patient presenting with left [[lower abdominal pain]], a differential diagnosis might include ''?[[diverticulitis]]'' (read as \"query diverticulitis\").\n\n==See also==\n* [[Exclamation mark]]\n* [[Interrobang]]\n* [[Irony mark]]\n* [[Terminal punctuation]]\n* [[Inquiry]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Lupton |first1=Ellen |last2=Miller |first2=J.
