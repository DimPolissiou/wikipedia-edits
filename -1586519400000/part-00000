Lake Martens appeared in the \"Dictionary of the Rivers and Lakes of the [[Province of Quebec]]\" by Eugene Rouillard, Department of Lands and Forests, 1914, page 270. This book shows that in 1886, the land surveyor, F. Vincent Lake Martens described as being located in mountainous terrain, surrounded by fir and spruce. He also noted the presence of [[trout]] in its waters.\n\nThe name of the lake is due to the presence of the [[Marten of Canada]], a carnivorous mammal also known as \"P\u00e9kan\" (in French), whose furs has long adorned the necks of coats.

The 2015 result was narrower, which produced the 5th most marginal majority of the Conservative Party's 331 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/conservative-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Conservative MPs elected in 2015 by % majority] UK Political.info.  Retrieved 2017-01-29</ref>. The 2019 result made this the most marginal constituency in mainland Great Britain, with a majority of 105 votes. Only Sinn Fein's majority of 57 in [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] was lower.\n\n== Boundaries ==\n'''1983\u20132010''': The Metropolitan Borough of Bury wards of Church, East, Elton, Moorside, Ramsbottom, Redvales, [[Tottington, Greater Manchester|Tottington]], and Unsworth.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Metropolitan Borough of Bury wards of Church, East, Elton, Moorside, North Manor, Ramsbottom, Redvales, and Tottington.\n\nThe constituency of Bury North covers the towns of [[Ramsbottom]], [[Tottington, Greater Manchester|Tottington]] and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]]. It was created in 1983 from parts of the former seats of [[Rossendale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rossendale]] and [[Bury and Radcliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Bury and Radcliffe]]. In those boundary changes Ramsbottom was transferred from Rossendale to Bury North, while with the loss of Ramsbottom, Rossendale was linked with Darwen.\n\n==Constituency profile==\nDespite its name, Bury North includes the entirety of the town of Bury.\nA traditional Labour-Conservative marginal, Ramsbottom and Tottington are mostly Conservative, but in the case of Ramsbottom, not always overwhelmingly so, whereas the town of Bury itself (particularly the ''Bury East'' ward) is generally more favourable to Labour, with Elton being a marginal. Tottington, Church ward and the rural North Manor ward are safely Conservative, however Ramsbottom is now a Labour marginal, re-gained by the party in 2018. The 2011 Ramsbottom local election was famously a tie between the Labour and Conservative candidates, decided by drawing straws which Labour won and took control of the council.\n\nThe wards surrounding the town centre include some terraced and social housing and is ethnically diverse. The Bury town centre itself features two large sixth form colleges, the 'World Famous' market famed for Black Pudding as well as newer shopping and leisure developments such as The Rock. Tourist attractions include the East Lancashire Heritage Railway and Fusiliers Museum. North of Bury the area becomes more rural, approaching the provincial towns of Tottington and Ramsbottom, which are becoming increasingly desirable for Manchester commuters looking for quieter housing overlooking the West Pennines. \nRamsbottom features [[Peel Monument]], a tower on Holcombe Hill dedicated to former Conservative Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] who was born in Bury. The tower is occasionally opened by volunteers, which offers views across Greater Manchester and as far out as Cheshire.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{|

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]. With a majority of 105 votes for the Conservative [[James Daly (English politician)|James Daly]], it is the most marginal constituency in Great Britain as of the 2019 General Election.\n\n==History==\n;Summary of results\nBury North is a [[marginal seat]] between [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], and a [[Bellwether|bellwether constituency]] throughout its existence &mdash; the winner of the seat has tended to win the general election.  In forerunner seats, the town of Bury did not have a Labour MP until 1964, since when Bury North has become reported on as an important marginal seat.\n\nThe 2010 gain was the Conservative Party's sole gain in Greater Manchester. The 2015 result was narrower, which produced the 5th most marginal majority of the Conservative Party's 331 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/conservative-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Conservative MPs elected in 2015 by % majority] UK Political.info.  Retrieved 2017-01-29</ref>. The 2019 result made this the most marginal constituency in mainland Great Britain, with a majority of 105 votes. Only Sinn Fein's majority of 57 in [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] was lower.\n\n== Boundaries ==\n'''1983\u20132010''': The Metropolitan Borough of Bury wards of Church, East, Elton, Moorside, Ramsbottom, Redvales, [[Tottington, Greater Manchester|Tottington]], and Unsworth.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Metropolitan Borough of Bury wards of Church, East, Elton, Moorside, North Manor, Ramsbottom, Redvales, and Tottington.\n\nThe constituency of Bury North covers the towns of [[Ramsbottom]], [[Tottington, Greater Manchester|Tottington]] and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]]. It was created in 1983 from parts of the former seats of [[Rossendale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rossendale]] and [[Bury and Radcliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Bury and Radcliffe]]. In those boundary changes Ramsbottom was transferred from Rossendale to Bury North, while with the loss of Ramsbottom, Rossendale was linked with Darwen.\n\n==Constituency profile==\nDespite its name, Bury North includes the entirety of the town of Bury.\nA traditional Labour-Conservative marginal, Ramsbottom and Tottington are mostly Conservative, but in the case of Ramsbottom, not always overwhelmingly so, whereas the town of Bury itself (particularly the ''Bury East'' ward) is generally more favourable to Labour, with Elton being a marginal. Tottington, Church ward and the rural North Manor ward are safely Conservative, however Ramsbottom is now a Labour marginal, re-gained by the party in 2018. The 2011 Ramsbottom local election was famously a tie between the Labour and Conservative candidates, decided by drawing straws which Labour won and took control of the council.\n\nThe wards surrounding the town centre include some terraced and social housing and is ethnically diverse. The Bury town centre itself features two large sixth form colleges, the 'World Famous' market famed for Black Pudding as well as newer shopping and leisure developments such as The Rock. Tourist attractions include the East Lancashire Heritage Railway and Fusiliers Museum. North of Bury the area becomes more rural, approaching the provincial towns of Tottington and Ramsbottom, which are becoming increasingly desirable for Manchester commuters looking for quieter housing overlooking the West Pennines. \nRamsbottom features [[Peel Monument]], a tower on Holcombe Hill dedicated to former Conservative Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] who was born in Bury. The tower is occasionally opened by volunteers, which offers views across Greater Manchester and as far out as Cheshire.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{|
