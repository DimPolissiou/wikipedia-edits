He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

Personally, I know it ripped the heart out of Brian, but having said that, he was in great spirits after the album was finished.\"<ref name=\"Jackson2011\"/> ''Back to the Light'' featured the single \"[[Too Much Love Will Kill You]]\", on which he collaborated as a songwriter with [[Frank Musker]] and Elizabeth Lamers. A version with Freddie Mercury's vocals was later released on the Queen album ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' and won the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Song Musically & Lyrically in 1996.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author=Nigel Hunter|title=Anniversaries Abound at Novello Awards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48|date=21 June 1997|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=48}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1992, [[the Brian May Band]] was officially formed. An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18&nbsp;December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837. Rough Guides, 2003</ref> The band took Mercury's solo album demos and last recordings, which he managed to perform in the studio after the album ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'' was finished, and completed them with their additions both musically and vocally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/made-heaven/|title=Made in Heaven|publisher=Queenonline.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> After Mercury's death, work on the album by Deacon and May began originally in 1992 but was left until a later date due to other commitments.<ref name=\"Buckley\"/>\n\nIn 1995, May began working on a new solo album of covers tentatively titled ''Heroes'', in addition to working on various film and television projects<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0006190|name=Brian May}}</ref> and other collaborations. May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

January 2014)</ref> His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |title=Vox AC30 Brian May |publisher=Brianmaycentral.net |accessdate=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029011512/http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |archivedate=29 October 2014  }}</ref>\n\nMay also customises his amps by removing the circuitry for the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal), and this alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6\u20137&nbsp;dB. He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\" and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"[[Let Me Live]]\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used [[Yamaha DX7]] synths for the opening sequence of \"[[One Vision]]\" and the backgrounds of \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" (also on stage), \"[[Scandal (song)|Scandal]]\" and [[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|\"The Show Must Go On\"]].\n\nThe first instrument May learned to play was the [[Banjo uke|banjolele]]. He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18&nbsp;December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

January 2014)</ref> His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |title=Vox AC30 Brian May |publisher=Brianmaycentral.net |accessdate=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029011512/http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |archivedate=29 October 2014  }}</ref>\n\nMay also customises his amps by removing the circuitry for the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal), and this alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6\u20137&nbsp;dB. He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\" and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"[[Let Me Live]]\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used [[Yamaha DX7]] synths for the opening sequence of \"[[One Vision]]\" and the backgrounds of \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" (also on stage), \"[[Scandal (song)|Scandal]]\" and [[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|\"The Show Must Go On\"]].\n\nThe first instrument May learned to play was the [[Banjo uke|banjolele]]. He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

This was [[hellenization|hellenized]] as ''Sid\u1e53n'' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd}}), which was [[latinization of names|Latinized]] as ''{{lang|la|Sidon}}''. The name appears in [[Classical Arabic]] as ''\u1e62ayd\u016bn'' ({{lang|ar|\u0635\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0652}}) and in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Arabic]] as ''\u1e62ayd\u0101'' ({{lang|ar|\u0635\u064a\u062f\u0627}}).\n\nAs a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]], it was notionally refounded and given the formal name ''{{lang|la|Colonia Aurelia Pia Sidon}}'' to honor its imperial sponsor.\n\nIn the [[Book of Genesis]], Sidon was the first-born son of [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]], who was a son of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], thereby making Sidon a great-grandson of [[Noah]].\n==History==\n[[File:Protome from Eshmun Sanctuary.jpg|thumb|left|Persian style bull [[protome]] found in Sidon gives testimony of the Aecheminid rule and influence. Marble, 5th century BC]]\nSidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a [[Stone tool|lithic]] [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] dating to the [[Acheulean]], whilst finds at Sidon III include a [[Heavy Neolithic]] assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of [[pottery]].<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1965\"/> It was one of the most important [[Phoenicia]]n cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. [[Homer]] praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonizing party went to found the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of [[Phoenicia]]. Glass manufacturing, Sidon's most important enterprise in the Phoenician era, was conducted on a vast scale, and the production of purple dye was almost as important. The small shell of the [[Murex trunculus]] was broken in order to extract the pigment that was so rare it became the mark of royalty.\n[[File:Roman era Phonesia.png|thumb|left|The Peutinger Map showing Tyre and Sidon in the 4th century]]\nIn AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King [[Eshmunazar|Eshmun\u2019azar]] II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \"king of the Sidonians,\" probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of [[`Ashtart|\u2018Ashtart]], \"the goddess of the Sidonians.\"<ref>Thomas Kelly, Herodotus and the Chronology of the Kings of Sidon, [[Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research]], no. 268, pp. 39\u201356, 1987</ref>\nIn this inscription the gods [[Eshmun]] and [[Baal|Ba\u2018al]] Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. \u2018Ashtart is entitled ''\u2018Ashtart-Shem-Ba\u2018al'' '\u2018Ashtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an [[Ugaritic]] text.\n\n[[File:SidonSeaCastle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sidon Sea Castle]], built by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in AD 1228]]\n\nIn the years before Christianity, Sidon had many conquerors: [[Assyria]]ns, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ians, [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and finally [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. [[Herod the Great]] visited Sidon. Both [[Jesus]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] are said to have visited it, too (see ''[[#The Biblical Sidon|Biblical Sidon]]'', below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nLike other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors. At the end of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] era in 351 BC, it was invaded by the emperor [[Artaxerxes III]] and then by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC, when the [[Hellenistic]] era of Sidon began. Under the [[successors of Alexander]], it enjoyed relative autonomy and organized games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]], the [[Lycia]]n tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum|Archaeological Museum]] of [[Istanbul]].<ref name=\"Turkey\">{{Cite news |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654614207 |title=Istanbul Archaeology Museum |accessdate=10 May 2008 |newspaper=The New York Times |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524104810/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654614207 |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The Romans also built a theater and other major monuments in the city. In the reign of [[Elagabalus]], a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]] was established there. During the [[Byzantine]] period, when the [[551 Beirut earthquake|great earthquake of AD 551]] destroyed most of the cities of [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]], [[Law School of Beirut|Beirut's School of Law]] took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until it was [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered]] by the [[Arabs]] in AD 636.\n\n[[File:Sidon-coast.jpg|thumb|Sidon with a view of the Mediterranean coast]]\nOn 4 December 1110, Sidon was [[Siege of Sidon (1110)|captured]], a decade after the [[First Crusade]], by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] and King [[Sigurd I of Norway]]. It then became the centre of the [[Lordship of Sidon]], an important lordship in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. [[Saladin]] captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the [[Crusade of 1197]]. It would remain an important Crusader stronghold until it was finally destroyed by the [[Saracens]] in 1249. In 1260 it was again destroyed by the [[Mongols]]. The remains of the original walls are still visible.\n\nAfter Sidon came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the [[Sidon Eyalet]] (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance.\n\nDuring the [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)| Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War]], Sidon - like much of [[Ottoman Syria]] - was occupied by the forces of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]], commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on September 26, 1840, and landed with the storming column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named \"[[HMS Sidon]]\".  \n\n===Modern era===\nAfter [[World War I]] it became part of the French [[League of Nations mandate|Mandate]] of [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]]. During [[World War II]] the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was [[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign|captured by British forces]] fighting against the [[Vichy French]], and following the war it became a major city of independent [[Lebanon]].\n\nFollowing the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]] in 1948, a considerable number of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of [[Ein el-Hilweh]] and [[Mieh Mieh (camp)|Mieh Mieh]]. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.\n\nSidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900, but studies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of some wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels. (Refer to the '''\"Old City\"''' and the '''\"Architecture and Landscape\"''' sections below).\n\n{{wide image|Panorama of Sidon from the castle.jpg|900px|alt=Panorama of Sidon as seen from the top of the Sea Castle, 2009|{{center|Panorama of Sidon as seen from the top of the Sea Castle, 2009}}}}\n[[Saida International Stadium]] was inaugurated in 2000 for the [[Asian Cup 2000|Asian Football Confederation's Cup 2000]].\n\n\n==Politics==\nThis sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], when armed clashes erupted between the pro-Palestinian Sunni Muslims and the anti-Palestinian Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and the Christians were forced to move to east [[Beirut]]. After the war ended in 1990, the Christians have gradually returned to their hometowns.\n \nThe local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the [[El-Bizri]] and Saad. The [[El-Bizri]] politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of [[Nasser]] in Lebanon). The local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El-Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that Maarouf Saad started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament. The [[El-Bizri]] and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The [[El-Bizri]] were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers Riad Solh, Taki El-Din Solh and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister Saab Salam, father of the current Lebanese prime minister, Tamam Salam. The presence of the El-Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service. The Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. They remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family started to rise to prominence and it became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the [[El-Bizri]] in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism. The politics of Sidon is similar to that of the traditional old cities of the Levant in the sense of being family-based. In broad terms one could say that the [[El-Bizri]] family had an influence since Ottoman times, and then most significantly across almost the entirety of the 20th century. It was local in impact at first, but then the members of this family became influential within the Lebanese state and institutions, and they supported the Solh family that had successive Prime Ministers and that moved its power base from Sidon to Beirut. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the [[El-Bizri]] family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and up till today. Maarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the [[El-Bizri]] were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). As for the Hariri family, they are regionally focused on Saudi orientations in politics. The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the middle 1990s. It is now one of the most organized in political terms and it follows modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes but that is usually seen as a Sunni political movement with regional weight due to its close ties with Saudi Arabia.\n\n==Impact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment==\nAccording to a recent United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report \"data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions).\"<ref>[http://www.undp.org.lb/WhatWeDo/poverty.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105032823/http://www.undp.org.lb/WhatWeDo/poverty.cfm |date=5 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.lb/communication/publications/linking/Session4.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards a Regionally Balance Development |publisher=Undp.org.lb |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital-city outgrew Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.\n\nThe post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992\u20131998), was centred around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.\n\n===The Former ''Makab'' (waste dump) and the Treatment Plant ===\nNear the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the ''Makab''; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with [[medical waste]] and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nSidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the ''Makab'' crisis\u2014which has endangered residents health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the City's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established the privately funded IBC Enviro and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.<ref>{{cite news|last=Antelava |first=Natalia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8426091.stm |title=Lebanese city's mountain of rubbish |work=BBC News |date=2009-12-25 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business24-7.ae/Articles/2009/11/Pages/24112009/11252009_73db570b8298406b974037f9b3a23bbb.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127204925/http://www.business24-7.ae/Articles/2009/11/Pages/24112009/11252009_73db570b8298406b974037f9b3a23bbb.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 November 2009|title=Mountain of rubbish overwhelms Sidon|work=Emirates 24/7|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iloubnan.info/environment/actualite/id/37182/titre/Sidon-chokes-under-rubbish-dump|title=Sidon chokes under rubbish dump|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=1&article_id=108602|title=Syringes plague Sidon beach as dump spills medical waste|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Local government==\nThe city of Sidon is administrated by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administrated by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the [[Governorate of South Lebanon]], and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Saray (building)|Saray]] that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the [[Tyre District|Tyre]] and [[Bint Jbeil]] districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections \u2013 and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law \u2013 the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and [[Deir el Qamar]], and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dsadm.html|title=Sa\u00efd\u0101 (Sidone) (Maronite Eparchy) [Catholic-Hierarchy]|website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref> Sidon also hosts the seat of the [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shiite]] [[Ayatollah]] of South Lebanon.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest [[History of the Jews in Lebanon|Jewish]] population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, compared to 3,060 in [[Beirut]].<ref>Simon, Reeva S., Michael M.

The cemetery now contains 176 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and nine war graves of other nationalities. It was designed by G. Vey. It is perhaps that only garden in modern Sidon that is elegantly kept and cared for.

An assemblage of [[flint]] tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow [[axe]]s or [[chisel]]s that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous.<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1965\"/> The collection appears to have gone missing from the [[Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut]].<ref>Gigues, P.E., Leba'a, Kafer Garra et Qraye, n\u00e9cropoles dde la r\u00e9gion sidonienne.

P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the [[Acheulean]].<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1965\"/>\n\n'''Sidon III''' was found by E. Passemard in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the [[National Museum of Beirut]] marked \"Camp de l'Aviation\". It includes large [[flint]] and [[chert]] bifacials that may be of [[Heavy Neolithic]] origin.<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1965\"/>\n\n'''Sidon IV''' is the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] mound of ancient Sidon with Early [[Bronze Age]] (3200 BC -) deposits, now located underneath the ruined [[Saint Louis Castle]] and what are also thought to be the ruins of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] theatre.<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1965\">{{cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P.

The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: ''Mission de Ph\u00e9nicie'' (1864\u20131874; ''Phoenician Expedition'').\n\nThe St. Louis land-castle grounds were excavated in 1914\u20131920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sidonexcavation.org/ht_d_pre/ht_d_pre1.html |title=Previous Excavation |publisher=SidonExcavation |accessdate=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020419074213/http://www.sidonexcavation.org/ht_d_pre/ht_d_pre1.html |archivedate=19 April 2002 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognise the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with [[Byblos]], even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.\n\n==The Biblical Sidon==\n[[File:Shrinepeter.jpg|thumb|Shrine commemorating the last meeting place between [[St. Paul]] and [[St. Peter]] inside the Old City of Sidon.]]\nThe Bible describes Sidon ({{Script/Hebrew|\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05b9\u05df}} ''Ts\u012bd\u014dn'') in several passages:\n* It received its name from the \"first-born\" of [[Canaan (Biblical figure)|Canaan]], the grandson of [[Noah]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:15, 19).\n* The [[Tribe of Zebulun]] has a frontier on Sidon. (Gen. 49:13)\n* It was the first home of the [[Phoenicia]]ns on the coast of Canaan, and from its extensive commercial relations became a \"great\" city. (Joshua 11:8; 19:28).\n* It was the mother city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued (Judges 1:31).\n* The Sidonians long oppressed [[Israelites|Israel]] (Judges 10:12).\n* From the time of [[David]] its glory began to wane, and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], its \"virgin daughter\" (Isaiah 23:12), rose to its place of pre-eminence.\n* [[Solomon]] entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Sidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the [[land of Israel]] (1 Kings 11:1, 33).\n* [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]] was a Sidonian princess (1 Kings 16:31).\n* It was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce (1 Kings 5:6; 1 Chronicles 22:4; Ezekiel 27:8).\n* It is frequently referred to by the prophets (Isaiah 23:2, 4, 12; Jeremiah 25:22; 27:3; 47:4; Ezekiel 27:8; 28:21, 22; 32:30; Joel 3:4).\n* [[Elijah]] sojourned in Sidon, performing miracles (1 Kings 17:9\u201324; {{bibleref|Luke|4:26}}).\n* Jesus visited the region or \"coasts\" ([[King James Version]]) of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and Sidon ({{bibleref|Matthew|15:21}}; {{bibleref|Mark|7:24}}) and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching (Mark 3:8; Luke 6:17), leading to the stark contrast in {{bibleref|Matthew|11:21\u201323}} to [[Korazin]] and [[Bethsaida]].\n* From Sidon, at which his ship put in after leaving [[Caesarea]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] finally sailed for Rome (Acts 27:3, 4).\n\n==Sanchuniathon==\n* The account ascribed to the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]] makes Sidon a daughter of Pontus, son of [[Nereus]].

This was [[hellenization|hellenized]] as ''Sid\u1e53n'' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd}}), which was [[latinization of names|Latinized]] as ''{{lang|la|Sidon}}''.

Marble, 5th century BC]]\nSidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a [[Stone tool|lithic]] [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] dating to the [[Acheulean]], whilst finds at Sidon III include a [[Heavy Neolithic]] assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of [[pottery]].<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1965\"/> It was one of the most important [[Phoenicia]]n cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. [[Homer]] praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonizing party went to found the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of [[Phoenicia]]. Glass manufacturing, Sidon's most important enterprise in the Phoenician era, was conducted on a vast scale, and the production of purple dye was almost as important. The small shell of the [[Murex trunculus]] was broken in order to extract the pigment that was so rare it became the mark of royalty.\n[[File:Roman era Phonesia.png|thumb|left|The Peutinger Map showing Tyre and Sidon in the 4th century]]\nIn AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King [[Eshmunazar|Eshmun\u2019azar]] II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \"king of the Sidonians,\" probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of [[`Ashtart|\u2018Ashtart]], \"the goddess of the Sidonians.\"<ref>Thomas Kelly, Herodotus and the Chronology of the Kings of Sidon, [[Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research]], no. 268, pp. 39\u201356, 1987</ref>\nIn this inscription the gods [[Eshmun]] and [[Baal|Ba\u2018al]] Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. \u2018Ashtart is entitled ''\u2018Ashtart-Shem-Ba\u2018al'' '\u2018Ashtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an [[Ugaritic]] text.\n\n[[File:SidonSeaCastle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sidon Sea Castle]], built by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in AD 1228]]\n\nIn the years before Christianity, Sidon had many conquerors: [[Assyria]]ns, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ians, [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and finally [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. [[Herod the Great]] visited Sidon. Both [[Jesus]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] are said to have visited it, too (see ''[[#The Biblical Sidon|Biblical Sidon]]'', below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nLike other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors. At the end of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] era in 351 BC, it was invaded by the emperor [[Artaxerxes III]] and then by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC, when the [[Hellenistic]] era of Sidon began. Under the [[successors of Alexander]], it enjoyed relative autonomy and organized games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]], the [[Lycia]]n tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum|Archaeological Museum]] of [[Istanbul]].<ref name=\"Turkey\">{{Cite news |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654614207 |title=Istanbul Archaeology Museum |accessdate=10 May 2008 |newspaper=The New York Times |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524104810/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654614207 |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The Romans also built a theater and other major monuments in the city. In the reign of [[Elagabalus]], a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]] was established there. During the [[Byzantine]] period, when the [[551 Beirut earthquake|great earthquake of AD 551]] destroyed most of the cities of [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]], [[Law School of Beirut|Beirut's School of Law]] took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until it was [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered]] by the [[Arabs]] in AD 636.\n\n[[File:Sidon-coast.jpg|thumb|Sidon with a view of the Mediterranean coast]]\nOn 4 December 1110, Sidon was [[Siege of Sidon (1110)|captured]], a decade after the [[First Crusade]], by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] and King [[Sigurd I of Norway]]. It then became the centre of the [[Lordship of Sidon]], an important lordship in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. [[Saladin]] captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the [[Crusade of 1197]]. It would remain an important Crusader stronghold until it was finally destroyed by the [[Saracens]] in 1249. In 1260 it was again destroyed by the [[Mongols]]. The remains of the original walls are still visible.\n\nAfter Sidon came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the [[Sidon Eyalet]] (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance.\n\nDuring the [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)| Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War]], Sidon - like much of [[Ottoman Syria]] - was occupied by the forces of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]], commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on September 26, 1840, and landed with the storming column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named \"[[HMS Sidon]]\".  \n\n===Modern era===\nAfter [[World War I]] it became part of the French [[League of Nations mandate|Mandate]] of [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]]. During [[World War II]] the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was [[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign|captured by British forces]] fighting against the [[Vichy French]], and following the war it became a major city of independent [[Lebanon]].\n\nFollowing the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]] in 1948, a considerable number of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of [[Ein el-Hilweh]] and [[Mieh Mieh (camp)|Mieh Mieh]]. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.\n\nSidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900, but studies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of some wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels. (Refer to the '''\"Old City\"''' and the '''\"Architecture and Landscape\"''' sections below).\n\n{{wide image|Panorama of Sidon from the castle.jpg|900px|alt=Panorama of Sidon as seen from the top of the Sea Castle, 2009|{{center|Panorama of Sidon as seen from the top of the Sea Castle, 2009}}}}\n[[Saida International Stadium]] was inaugurated in 2000 for the [[Asian Cup 2000|Asian Football Confederation's Cup 2000]].\n\n\n==Politics==\nThis sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], when armed clashes erupted between the pro-Palestinian Sunni Muslims and the anti-Palestinian Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and the Christians were forced to move to east [[Beirut]]. After the war ended in 1990, the Christians have gradually returned to their hometowns.\n \nThe local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the [[El-Bizri]] and Saad. The [[El-Bizri]] politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of [[Nasser]] in Lebanon). The local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El-Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that Maarouf Saad started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament. The [[El-Bizri]] and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The [[El-Bizri]] were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers Riad Solh, Taki El-Din Solh and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister Saab Salam, father of the current Lebanese prime minister, Tamam Salam. The presence of the El-Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service. The Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. They remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family started to rise to prominence and it became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the [[El-Bizri]] in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism. The politics of Sidon is similar to that of the traditional old cities of the Levant in the sense of being family-based. In broad terms one could say that the [[El-Bizri]] family had an influence since Ottoman times, and then most significantly across almost the entirety of the 20th century. It was local in impact at first, but then the members of this family became influential within the Lebanese state and institutions, and they supported the Solh family that had successive Prime Ministers and that moved its power base from Sidon to Beirut. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the [[El-Bizri]] family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and up till today. Maarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the [[El-Bizri]] were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). As for the Hariri family, they are regionally focused on Saudi orientations in politics. The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the middle 1990s. It is now one of the most organized in political terms and it follows modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes but that is usually seen as a Sunni political movement with regional weight due to its close ties with Saudi Arabia.\n\n==Impact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment==\nAccording to a recent United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report \"data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions).\"<ref>[http://www.undp.org.lb/WhatWeDo/poverty.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105032823/http://www.undp.org.lb/WhatWeDo/poverty.cfm |date=5 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.lb/communication/publications/linking/Session4.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards a Regionally Balance Development |publisher=Undp.org.lb |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital-city outgrew Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.\n\nThe post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992\u20131998), was centred around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.\n\n===The Former ''Makab'' (waste dump) and the Treatment Plant ===\nNear the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the ''Makab''; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with [[medical waste]] and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nSidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the ''Makab'' crisis\u2014which has endangered residents health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the City's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established the privately funded IBC Enviro and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.<ref>{{cite news|last=Antelava |first=Natalia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8426091.stm |title=Lebanese city's mountain of rubbish |work=BBC News |date=2009-12-25 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business24-7.ae/Articles/2009/11/Pages/24112009/11252009_73db570b8298406b974037f9b3a23bbb.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127204925/http://www.business24-7.ae/Articles/2009/11/Pages/24112009/11252009_73db570b8298406b974037f9b3a23bbb.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 November 2009|title=Mountain of rubbish overwhelms Sidon|work=Emirates 24/7|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iloubnan.info/environment/actualite/id/37182/titre/Sidon-chokes-under-rubbish-dump|title=Sidon chokes under rubbish dump|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=1&article_id=108602|title=Syringes plague Sidon beach as dump spills medical waste|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Local government==\nThe city of Sidon is administrated by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administrated by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the [[Governorate of South Lebanon]], and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Saray (building)|Saray]] that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the [[Tyre District|Tyre]] and [[Bint Jbeil]] districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon.

It was originally used for the burial of men who died while serving with the occupation force, but subsequently the graves of a number of the casualties of the 1941 campaign were moved into the cemetery from other burial grounds or from isolated positions in the vicinity. The cemetery now contains 176 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and nine war graves of other nationalities. It was designed by G. Vey. It is perhaps that only garden in modern Sidon that is elegantly kept and cared for.

According to a 2006 study, the city is home to 29 schools that serve a total of 18,731 students: 37% are in public schools, 63% are in private schools.

An assemblage of [[flint]] tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow [[axe]]s or [[chisel]]s that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous.<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1965\"/> The collection appears to have gone missing from the [[Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut]].<ref>Gigues, P.E., Leba'a, Kafer Garra et Qraye, n\u00e9cropoles dde la r\u00e9gion sidonienne.

Passemard in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the [[National Museum of Beirut]] marked \"Camp de l'Aviation\". It includes large [[flint]] and [[chert]] bifacials that may be of [[Heavy Neolithic]] origin.<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1965\"/>\n\n'''Sidon IV''' is the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] mound of ancient Sidon with Early [[Bronze Age]] (3200 BC -) deposits, now located underneath the ruined [[Saint Louis Castle]] and what are also thought to be the ruins of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] theatre.<ref name=\"CopelandWescombe1965\">{{cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P.

The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: ''Mission de Ph\u00e9nicie'' (1864\u20131874; ''Phoenician Expedition'').\n\nThe St. Louis land-castle grounds were excavated in 1914\u20131920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sidonexcavation.org/ht_d_pre/ht_d_pre1.html |title=Previous Excavation |publisher=SidonExcavation |accessdate=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020419074213/http://www.sidonexcavation.org/ht_d_pre/ht_d_pre1.html |archivedate=19 April 2002 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognise the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with [[Byblos]], even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.\n\n==The Biblical Sidon==\n[[File:Shrinepeter.jpg|thumb|Shrine commemorating the last meeting place between [[St. Paul]] and [[St. Peter]] inside the Old City of Sidon.]]\nThe Bible describes Sidon ({{Script/Hebrew|\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05b9\u05df}} ''Ts\u012bd\u014dn'') in several passages:\n* It received its name from the \"first-born\" of [[Canaan (Biblical figure)|Canaan]], the grandson of [[Noah]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:15, 19).\n* The [[Tribe of Zebulun]] has a frontier on Sidon. (Gen. 49:13)\n* It was the first home of the [[Phoenicia]]ns on the coast of Canaan, and from its extensive commercial relations became a \"great\" city. (Joshua 11:8; 19:28).\n* It was the mother city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued (Judges 1:31).\n* The Sidonians long oppressed [[Israelites|Israel]] (Judges 10:12).\n* From the time of [[David]] its glory began to wane, and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], its \"virgin daughter\" (Isaiah 23:12), rose to its place of pre-eminence.\n* [[Solomon]] entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Sidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the [[land of Israel]] (1 Kings 11:1, 33).\n* [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]] was a Sidonian princess (1 Kings 16:31).\n* It was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce (1 Kings 5:6; 1 Chronicles 22:4; Ezekiel 27:8).\n* It is frequently referred to by the prophets (Isaiah 23:2, 4, 12; Jeremiah 25:22; 27:3; 47:4; Ezekiel 27:8; 28:21, 22; 32:30; Joel 3:4).\n* [[Elijah]] sojourned in Sidon, performing miracles (1 Kings 17:9\u201324; {{bibleref|Luke|4:26}}).\n* Jesus visited the region or \"coasts\" ([[King James Version]]) of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and Sidon ({{bibleref|Matthew|15:21}}; {{bibleref|Mark|7:24}}) and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching (Mark 3:8; Luke 6:17), leading to the stark contrast in {{bibleref|Matthew|11:21\u201323}} to [[Korazin]] and [[Bethsaida]].\n* From Sidon, at which his ship put in after leaving [[Caesarea]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] finally sailed for Rome (Acts 27:3, 4).\n\n==Sanchuniathon==\n* The account ascribed to the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]] makes Sidon a daughter of Pontus, son of [[Nereus]].

In other regions, such as [[Southeast Asia]], many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.\n\nThe term \"banana\" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit.<ref name=MW/> This can extend to other members of the genus ''Musa'', such as the [[Musa coccinea|scarlet banana]] (''Musa coccinea''), the [[Musa velutina|pink banana]] (''Musa velutina''), and the [[Fe'i banana]]s.

Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60&nbsp;cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|p=212}} The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" ([[petiole (botany)|petiole]]) and a blade ([[Leaf#General characteristics of leaves|lamina]]). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=13\u201317}} Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} to 'Gros Michel' at {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} or more.{{sfn|Nelson|Ploetz|Kepler|2006|p=26}}{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=\"purdue1\"/> They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.<ref name=Greenearth/>\n\nWhen a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or [[inflorescence]]. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=9\u201313}} Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the \"banana heart\". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the Philippines produced five.<ref name=ABS_CBN/>) After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is [[perennial]]. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=244\u2013247}} The inflorescence contains many [[bract]]s (sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is [[ovary (plants)|inferior]], meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008}}\n\nThe banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called \"hands\"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3\u201320 [[wikt:tier#noun 2|tiers]], or commercially as a \"banana stem\", and can weigh {{convert|30|\u2013|50|kg|lb}}. Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or \"finger\") average {{convert|125|g|lb}}, of which approximately 75% is [[water]] and 25% dry matter (nutrient table, lower right).\n\nThe fruit has been described as a \"leathery berry\".<ref name=Smit77/> There is a protective outer layer (a [[Peel (fruit)|peel]] or skin) with numerous long, thin strings (the [[phloem]] [[Vascular bundle|bundles]]), which run lengthwise between the skin and the [[Eating|edible]] inner portion.

The [[APG III system]] assigns Musaceae to the order [[Zingiberales]], part of the [[commelinid]] clade of the [[monocotyledon]]ous flowering plants. Some 70 species of ''Musa'' were recognized by the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] {{asof|2013|January|lc=yes}};<ref name=WCSP_Musa/> several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.<ref name=Bail16/>\n\nThe classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: ''Musa sapientum'' for dessert bananas and ''Musa paradisiaca'' for [[Plantain (true)|plantains]]. More species names were added, but this approach proved to be inadequate for the number of [[cultivar]]s in the primary center of diversity of the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names that were later discovered to be [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}}\n\nIn a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's ''Musa sapientum'' and ''Musa paradisiaca'' were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'', both first described by [[Luigi Aloysius Colla]].<ref name=DRC/> Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars \u2013 those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa balbisiana'', those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa acuminata'', and those with characteristics of both.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}} Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities, leading to confusion.<ref name=DRC/><ref name=Porc02/>\n\nThe accepted [[Botanical name|scientific names]] for most groups of cultivated bananas are ''Musa acuminata'' <small>Colla</small> and ''Musa balbisiana'' <small>Colla</small> for the ancestral species, and ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'' <small>L.</small> for the hybrid ''M. acuminata'' \u00d7 ''M. balbisiana''.<ref name=WCSP_Mp/>\n\n[[Synonym (taxonomy)|Synonyms]] of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'' include\n* many subspecific and varietial names of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'', including ''M. p.'' subsp.

''paradisiaca'' <small>(L.) Baker, nom. illeg.</small>\n\nGenerally, modern classifications of banana cultivars follow Simmonds and Shepherd's system. Cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from. Thus the [[Latundan banana]] is placed in the AAB Group, showing that it is a triploid derived from both ''M. acuminata'' (A) and ''M. balbisiana'' (B). For a list of the cultivars classified under this system, ''see'' \"[[List of banana cultivars]]\".\n\nIn 2012, a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of ''[[Musa acuminata]]''.<ref name=dHon12/>\n\n==Bananas and plantains==\nIn regions such as North America and Europe, ''Musa'' fruits offered for sale can be divided into \"bananas\" and \"[[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]]\", based on their intended use as food. Thus the banana producer and distributor [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]] produces publicity material for the American market which says that \"a plantain is not a banana\". The stated differences are that plantains are more [[starch]]y and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have thicker skin, which may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness.<ref name=Chiquita/> Linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two \"species\" of ''Musa''.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Members of the \"[[Plantain (true)|plantain subgroup]]\" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the Chiquita description, having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as \"true\" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas.{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|pp=18\u201319}} The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the [[East African Highland banana]]s,{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} so would not qualify as \"true\" plantains on this definition.\n[[File:Bananas white background DS.jpg|thumb|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the most common dessert bananas sold]]\nAn alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|p=1}} [[Polyploid|Triploid]] cultivars derived solely from ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' are examples of \"dessert bananas\", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' and ''M.&nbsp;balbinosa'' (in particular the plantain subgroup of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB Group]]) are \"plantains\".<ref name=StovSimm87p183/><ref name=QiMoorOrch00/> Small farmers in Colombia grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations. A study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking bananas, and plantains, although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas.<ref name=GibeDufoGiraSanc09/>\n\nIn Southeast Asia \u2013 the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated \u2013 the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" that is made in English (and Spanish). Thus both [[#Cavendish|Cavendish cultivars]], the classic yellow dessert bananas, and [[Saba banana|Saba cultivars]], used mainly for cooking, are called ''pisang'' in Malaysia and Indonesia, ''kluai'' in Thailand and ''chuoi'' in Vietnam.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|pp=8\u201312}} [[Fe'i banana]]s, grown and eaten in the islands of the Pacific, are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional bananas and plantains. Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, but [[Karat banana]]s, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas, are eaten raw.<ref name=Engl03/>\n\nIn summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas (although not in small-scale cultivation), it is possible to distinguish between \"bananas\", which are eaten raw, and \"plantains\", which are cooked. In other regions of the world, particularly India, Southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific, there are many more kinds of banana and the two-fold distinction is not useful and not made in local languages. Plantains are one of many kinds of cooking bananas, which are not always distinct from dessert bananas.\n\n==Historical cultivation==\n\n===Early cultivation===\n{{See also|Musa acuminata|Domesticated plants and animals of Austronesia|East African Highland bananas}}\n[[File:Banana ancestors (Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana) original range.png|thumb|Original [[Range (biology)|native ranges]] of the ancestors of modern edible bananas.

The [[spread of Islam]] was followed by far-reaching diffusion. There are numerous references to it in Islamic texts (such as poems and [[hadith]]s) beginning in the 9th century. By the 10th century the banana appears in texts from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and Egypt. From there it diffused into North Africa and [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Iberia]]. During the medieval ages, bananas from [[Granada]] were considered among the best in the Arab world.<ref name=Wats83/> In 650, Islamic conquerors brought the banana to Palestine. Today, banana consumption increases significantly in Islamic countries during [[Ramadan]], the month of daylight fasting.<ref name=\"thefinancialexpress-bd\"/>\n\nBananas were certainly grown in the Christian [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] by the late medieval period. Writing in 1458, the Italian traveller and writer {{ILL|Gabriele Capodilista|it}} wrote favourably of the extensive farm produce of the estates at Episkopi, near modern-day [[Limassol]], including the region's banana plantations.<ref name=Jenn92/>\n\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - III musa arabum pala plinii, 1734 \u2013 BEIC 13446956.jpg|thumb|Illustration of fruit and banana plant from [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1734]]\nBananas were introduced to the Americas by Portuguese sailors who brought the fruits from [[West Africa]] in the 16th century.<ref name=Botgard/>\n\nMany [[Musa (genus)#Species|wild banana species]] as well as cultivars exist in extraordinary diversity in India, China, and [[Southeast Asia]].\n{{quote|There are fuzzy [[Musa velutina|bananas whose skins are bubblegum pink]]; green-and-white striped bananas with pulp the color of orange sherbet; bananas that, when cooked, taste like strawberries.

It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed more time between harvesting and ripening. North American shippers like [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]] and [[Andrew Preston]], the founders of the [[Boston Fruit Company]] started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like [[Minor C. Keith]] also participated, eventually culminating in the multi-national giant corporations like today's [[Chiquita Brands International]] and [[Dole Food Company|Dole]].<ref name=Koep08/> These companies were [[monopoly|monopolistic]], [[vertically integrated]] (meaning they controlled growing, processing, shipping and marketing) and usually used political manipulation to build [[enclave economy|enclave economies]] (economies that were internally self-sufficient, virtually tax exempt, and export-oriented that contribute very little to the host economy). Their political maneuvers, which gave rise to the term [[Banana republic]] for states like Honduras and Guatemala, included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the United States, especially during the [[Cold War]], to keep the political climate favorable to their interests.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Peasant cultivation for export in the Caribbean===\n{{Main|History of peasant banana production in the Americas}}\n\nThe vast majority of the world's bananas today are cultivated for family consumption or for sale on local markets. India is the world leader in this sort of production, but many other Asian and African countries where climate and soil conditions allow cultivation also host large populations of banana growers who sell at least some of their crop.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nPeasant sector banana growers produce for the world market in the Caribbean, however. The [[Windward Islands]] are notable for the growing, largely of Cavendish bananas, for an international market, generally in Europe but also in North America. In the Caribbean, and especially in Dominica where this sort of cultivation is widespread, holdings are in the 1\u20132 acre range. In many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops, from engaging in labor outside the farm, and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/poj7td/The-earliest-modern-plantations-originated-in-Jamaica-and-the-related-Western/|title=The earliest modern plantations originated in Jamaica and the related Western|work=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBanana crops are vulnerable to destruction by high winds, such as tropical storms or [[cyclone]]s.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n==Modern cultivation==\nAll widely cultivated bananas today descend from the two wild bananas ''Musa acuminata'' and ''Musa balbisiana''. While the original wild bananas contained large seeds, [[diploid]] or [[polyploid]] cultivars (some being [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]) with tiny seeds are preferred for human raw fruit consumption.<ref name=Cast09/> These are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] from offshoots.

They accounted for the majority of banana exports,<ref name=Cast09/> despite only coming into existence in 1836.<ref name=Homecooking/> The cultivars [[Dwarf Cavendish]] and [[Grand Nain]] (Chiquita Banana) gained popularity in the 1950s after the previous mass-produced cultivar, [[Gros Michel banana|Gros Michel]] (also an AAA group cultivar), became commercially unviable due to [[Panama disease]], caused by the fungus ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' which attacks the roots of the banana plant.<ref name=Cast09/> Cavendish cultivars are resistant to the Panama disease, but in 2013 there were fears that the [[black sigatoka]] fungus would in turn make Cavendish bananas unviable.<ref name=Holmes/>\n\nEven though it is no longer viable for large scale cultivation, Gros Michel is not extinct and is still grown in areas where Panama disease is not found.<ref name=straightdope/> Likewise, Dwarf Cavendish and Grand Nain are in no danger of extinction, but they may leave supermarket shelves if disease makes it impossible to supply the global market. It is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace Cavendish bananas, so various [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] and [[genetic engineering]] programs are attempting to create a disease-resistant, mass-market banana.<ref name=Cast09/>  One such strain that has emerged is the Taiwanese Cavendish, also known as the Formosana.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gittleson |first1=Kim|title=Battling to save the world's bananas| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42777803 |accessdate=April 18, 2018| agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Ripening===\nExport bananas are picked green, and ripen in special rooms upon arrival in the destination country. These rooms are air-tight and filled with [[Ethylene|ethylene gas]] to induce ripening. The vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket bananas is, in fact, caused by the artificial ripening process.<ref name=Ding07/> Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. Bananas are refrigerated to between {{convert|13.5|and|15|C|F}} during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and the bananas turn gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the {{convert|4|C}} environment of a domestic [[refrigerator]], although the fruit inside remains unaffected.\n[[File:Banana-fluorescence-081108.jpg|thumb|left|Ripened bananas (left, under [[sunlight]]) fluoresce in blue when exposed to [[UV light]].|alt=Two adjacent photos of bananas.

This property is attributed to the degradation of [[chlorophyll]] leading to the accumulation of a fluorescent product in the skin of the fruit. The chlorophyll [[breakdown product]] is stabilized by a [[propionate]] [[ester]] group. Banana-plant leaves also fluoresce in the same way.

The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping. The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene. This technology allows storage and transport for 3\u20134 weeks at {{convert|13|C}}. On arrival, bananas are held at about {{convert|17|C}} and treated with a low concentration of ethylene. After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale. Ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home. If bananas are too green, they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process.<ref name=ChiquitaRipen/>\n\nCarbon dioxide (which bananas produce) and ethylene absorbents extend fruit life even at high temperatures. This effect can be exploited by packing banana in a [[polyethylene]] bag and including an ethylene absorbent, e.g., [[potassium permanganate]], on an inert carrier. The bag is then sealed with a band or string. This treatment has been shown to more than double lifespans up to 3\u20134 weeks without the need for refrigeration.<ref name=Scot70/><ref name=Scot71/><ref name=Scot74/>\n\n==Production and export==\n{{Image frame\n|width=520<!-- Must be kept at this size at this point (December 2017) -->\n|content ={{Global Heat Maps by Year| title=| table=Banana production.tab| column=tonnes| columnName=tonnes of bananas per year| year=2014|%=}}\n|caption=Annual banana production, measured in tonnes per year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Banana production |url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/banana-production |website=Our World in Data |accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n|align=right\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width:24em; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|+ 2017 production (in millions of tonnes)\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:70%;\"| \n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:10%;\"| Bananas\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:10%;\"| Plantains\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:10%;\"| Total\n|-\n|{{Flagu|India}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.5||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.5\n|-\n|{{Flagu|China}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|11.2||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|11.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Philippines}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|9.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Colombia}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.8||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.4\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Indonesia}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.2||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Ecuador}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.8||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.1\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Brazil}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.7||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.7\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Cameroon}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.5||style=\"text-align:center;\"|5.8\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Democratic Republic of the Congo}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.8||style=\"text-align:center;\"|5.1\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Angola}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.3||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.3\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Guatemala}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.9||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.4||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.3\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Ghana}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Tanzania}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.5||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.1\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Uganda}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.9\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Nigeria}}||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.2||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Costa Rica}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.7\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Peru}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.0||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.3\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Mexico}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.2||style=\"text-align:center;\"| ||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Dominican Republic}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.2||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.0||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Vietnam}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"| ||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.1\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |'''World'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''113.9'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''39.2'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''153.1'''\n|-\n|colspan=4|<small>Source: [[FAOSTAT]] of the [[United Nations]]<ref name=\"faostat17\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=Banana production in 2017, Crops/Regions/World list/Production Quantity (pick lists)|date=2018|publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT)|accessdate=September 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC</ref> Note: Some countries distinguish between bananas and plantains, but four of the top six producers do not, thus necessitating comparisons using the total for bananas and plantains combined.</small>\n|}\n\nIn 2017, world production of bananas and plantains combined was 153 million tonnes, led by India and China with a combined total of 27% of global production {{cn|date=November 2019}}.

Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is [[isoamyl acetate]] (also known as ''banana oil''), which, along with several other compounds such as [[butyl acetate]] and [[isobutyl acetate]], is a significant contributor to banana flavor.<ref name=Fahl00/><ref name=Mui02/><ref name=Salm96/>\n\nDuring the ripening process, bananas produce the gas [[ethylene]], which acts as a [[plant hormone]] and indirectly affects the flavor. Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of [[amylase]], an [[enzyme]] that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas. The greener, less ripe bananas contain higher levels of starch and, consequently, have a \"starchier\" taste. On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations. Furthermore, ethylene signals the production of [[pectinase]], an enzyme which breaks down the [[pectin]] between the cells of the banana, causing the banana to soften as it ripens.<ref name=plantphys/><ref name=newton/>\n\nBananas are eaten deep fried, baked in their skin in a split [[bamboo]], or steamed in [[glutinous rice]] wrapped in a banana leaf. Bananas can be made into [[fruit preserves]]. Banana [[pancake]]s are popular among travelers in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. This has elicited the expression ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]'' for those places in Asia that cater to these travelers. [[Banana chips]] are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste. Dried bananas are also ground to make [[banana flour]]. Extracting juice is difficult, because when a banana is compressed, it simply turns to pulp. Bananas feature prominently in [[Philippine cuisine]], being part of traditional dishes and desserts like ''[[Maruya (Filipino cuisine)|maruya]]'', ''[[Tur\u00f3n (food)|tur\u00f3n]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]'' or ''saba con yelo''. Most of these dishes use the [[Saba Banana]] or Cardaba banana cultivar. Bananas are also commonly used in cuisine in the South-Indian state of [[Kerala]], where they are steamed (''puzhungiyathu''), made into curries,<ref name=pazhampachadi/> fried into chips, (''upperi'')<ref name=Hindu130413/> or fried in batter (''pazhampori'').<ref name=Hindu110228/> [[Pisang goreng]], bananas fried with batter similar to the Filipino ''maruya'' or Kerala ''pazhampori'', is a popular dessert in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. A similar dish is known in the United Kingdom and United States as banana [[fritter]]s.\n\nPlantains are used in various stews and curries or cooked, baked or mashed in much the same way as [[potatoes]], such as the [[pazham pachadi]] dish prepared in [[Kerala]].<ref name=pazhampachadi/>\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=4|\n|width=160 | height=170\n|align=center\n|image1=\u0c05\u0c30\u0c1f\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c2e\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c41 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2e\u0c4d\u0c2e\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c2a\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41\u0c38\u0c41 \u0c15\u0c42\u0c30.jpg\n|caption1=Banana with Lemon curry made in a house in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India\n|image2 =Bananajf.jpg\n|caption2 =''Kilawin na pus\u00f4 ng saging'', a [[Cuisine of the Philippines|Filipino dish]] using banana flowers\n|image3 =Nacatamales in steamer.jpg\n|caption3=Nicaraguan [[Nacatamal]]es, in banana leaves, ready to be steamed\n|image4 =Kaeng yuak.JPG\n|caption4= ''Kaeng yuak'' is a northern [[Thai curry]] made with the core of the banana plant\n|image5=Pisang goreng in a basket.jpg\n|caption5=''[[Pisang goreng]]'' fried banana coated in batter,  [[Indonesian cuisine|popular snack in Indonesia]]\n|image6=YosriPengatPisang.jpg\n|caption6=Banana in sweet gravy, known as ''pengat pisang'' in Malaysia\n}}\n\n====Flower====\nBanana hearts are used as a [[vegetable]]<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=B&wordid=3219&startno=1&endno=25 |title=Encyclopedia of Asian Food |year=1998 |last=Solomon |first=C |publisher=New Holland Publishers |location=Australia |edition=Periplus |accessdate=May 17, 2008 |isbn=978-0-85561-688-5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603142416/http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=B&wordid=3219&startno=1&endno=25 |archive-date=June 3, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> in [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] and [[Southeast Asian cuisine]], either raw or steamed with dips or cooked in soups, curries and fried foods.<ref>[http://www.dudaonline.com/southeast-asia/thailand/fried-banana-flowers/ Fried banana flowers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405093613/http://www.dudaonline.com/southeast-asia/thailand/fried-banana-flowers/ |date=April 5, 2011 }}.

Especially in the Americas and Europe, \"banana\" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the [[#Cavendish|Cavendish group]], which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, [[List of banana cultivars|''Musa'' cultivars]] with firmer, starchier fruit are called \"plantains\". In other regions, such as [[Southeast Asia]], many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.\n\nThe term \"banana\" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit.<ref name=MW/> This can extend to other members of the genus ''Musa'', such as the [[Musa coccinea|scarlet banana]] (''Musa coccinea''), the [[Musa velutina|pink banana]] (''Musa velutina''), and the [[Fe'i banana]]s. It can also refer to members of the genus ''[[Ensete]]'', such as the [[Ensete glaucum|snow banana]] (''Ensete glaucum'') and the economically important [[Ensete ventricosum|false banana]] (''Ensete ventricosum''). Both genera are in the banana family, [[Musaceae]].\n\n==Description==\n<gallery>\nFile:Banana corm.jpg|A banana corm, about {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} across\nFile:M. acuminata x balbisiana female flower detail.jpg|Female flowers have petals at the tip of the ovary\nFile:2018 06 TropicalIslands IMG 2170.jpg|Banana 'tree' showing fruit and [[inflorescence]]\nFile:Banana tree in Chandigarh.jpg|Banana tree with opening inflorescence\nFile:M. acuminata x balbisiana.JPG|Banana inflorescence, partially opened\nFile:Banana three in R\u00e9union.jpg|Wild banana with flowers and stem growing in reverse direction\nFile:Banana's DNA Strand.jpg|Extracted banana's DNA strands that can be seen with naked eyes\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Baby Banana Plant.jpg|thumb|upright|Young banana plant]]\nThe banana plant is the largest [[herbaceous]] flowering plant.<ref name=PicqINIB00/> All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a \"[[corm]]\".{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=5\u20139}} Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for [[tree]]s, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a \"false stem\" or [[pseudostem]]. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60&nbsp;cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|p=212}} The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" ([[petiole (botany)|petiole]]) and a blade ([[Leaf#General characteristics of leaves|lamina]]). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=13\u201317}} Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} to 'Gros Michel' at {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} or more.{{sfn|Nelson|Ploetz|Kepler|2006|p=26}}{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=\"purdue1\"/> They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.<ref name=Greenearth/>\n\nWhen a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or [[inflorescence]]. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=9\u201313}} Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the \"banana heart\". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the Philippines produced five.<ref name=ABS_CBN/>) After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is [[perennial]]. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=244\u2013247}} The inflorescence contains many [[bract]]s (sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is [[ovary (plants)|inferior]], meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008}}\n\nThe banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called \"hands\"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3\u201320 [[wikt:tier#noun 2|tiers]], or commercially as a \"banana stem\", and can weigh {{convert|30|\u2013|50|kg|lb}}. Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or \"finger\") average {{convert|125|g|lb}}, of which approximately 75% is [[water]] and 25% dry matter (nutrient table, lower right).\n\nThe fruit has been described as a \"leathery berry\".<ref name=Smit77/> There is a protective outer layer (a [[Peel (fruit)|peel]] or skin) with numerous long, thin strings (the [[phloem]] [[Vascular bundle|bundles]]), which run lengthwise between the skin and the [[Eating|edible]] inner portion. The inner part of the common yellow dessert variety can be split lengthwise into three sections that correspond to the inner portions of the three [[carpel]]s by manually deforming the unopened fruit.<ref name=Wark04/> In cultivated varieties, the seeds are diminished nearly to non-existence; their remnants are tiny black specks in the interior of the fruit.<ref name=Simm62/>\n\n===Banana equivalent radiation dose===\n\nAs with all potassium-containing objects on Earth, including many common foods and people, bananas emit [[radioactivity]] at very low levels occurring naturally from [[potassium-40]] (<sup>40</sup>K or K-40),<ref name=\"frame\">{{cite web |author1=Paul Frame |title=General information about K-40 |url=https://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/consumer%20products/potassiumgeneralinfo.htm |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |accessdate=April 24, 2019 |date=January 20, 2009|quote=The human body maintains relatively tight homeostatic control over potassium levels.

The [[APG III system]] assigns Musaceae to the order [[Zingiberales]], part of the [[commelinid]] clade of the [[monocotyledon]]ous flowering plants. Some 70 species of ''Musa'' were recognized by the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] {{asof|2013|January|lc=yes}};<ref name=WCSP_Musa/> several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.<ref name=Bail16/>\n\nThe classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: ''Musa sapientum'' for dessert bananas and ''Musa paradisiaca'' for [[Plantain (true)|plantains]]. More species names were added, but this approach proved to be inadequate for the number of [[cultivar]]s in the primary center of diversity of the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names that were later discovered to be [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}}\n\nIn a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's ''Musa sapientum'' and ''Musa paradisiaca'' were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'', both first described by [[Luigi Aloysius Colla]].<ref name=DRC/> Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars \u2013 those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa balbisiana'', those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa acuminata'', and those with characteristics of both.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}} Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities, leading to confusion.<ref name=DRC/><ref name=Porc02/>\n\nThe accepted [[Botanical name|scientific names]] for most groups of cultivated bananas are ''Musa acuminata'' <small>Colla</small> and ''Musa balbisiana'' <small>Colla</small> for the ancestral species, and ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'' <small>L.</small> for the hybrid ''M. acuminata'' \u00d7 ''M. balbisiana''.<ref name=WCSP_Mp/>\n\n[[Synonym (taxonomy)|Synonyms]] of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'' include\n* many subspecific and varietial names of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'', including ''M. p.'' subsp. ''sapientum'' <small>(L.) Kuntze</small>\n* ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''dacca'' <small>Horan.</small>\n* ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''sapidisiaca'' <small>K.C.Jacob, nom. superfl.</small>\n* ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''sapientum'' <small>L.</small>, and many of its varietal names, including ''M.'' \u00d7 ''sapientum'' var. ''paradisiaca'' <small>(L.) Baker, nom. illeg.</small>\n\nGenerally, modern classifications of banana cultivars follow Simmonds and Shepherd's system. Cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from. Thus the [[Latundan banana]] is placed in the AAB Group, showing that it is a triploid derived from both ''M. acuminata'' (A) and ''M. balbisiana'' (B). For a list of the cultivars classified under this system, ''see'' \"[[List of banana cultivars]]\".\n\nIn 2012, a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of ''[[Musa acuminata]]''.<ref name=dHon12/>\n\n==Bananas and plantains==\nIn regions such as North America and Europe, ''Musa'' fruits offered for sale can be divided into \"bananas\" and \"[[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]]\", based on their intended use as food. Thus the banana producer and distributor [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]] produces publicity material for the American market which says that \"a plantain is not a banana\". The stated differences are that plantains are more [[starch]]y and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have thicker skin, which may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness.<ref name=Chiquita/> Linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two \"species\" of ''Musa''.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Members of the \"[[Plantain (true)|plantain subgroup]]\" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the Chiquita description, having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as \"true\" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas.{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|pp=18\u201319}} The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the [[East African Highland banana]]s,{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} so would not qualify as \"true\" plantains on this definition.\n[[File:Bananas white background DS.jpg|thumb|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the most common dessert bananas sold]]\nAn alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|p=1}} [[Polyploid|Triploid]] cultivars derived solely from ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' are examples of \"dessert bananas\", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' and ''M.&nbsp;balbinosa'' (in particular the plantain subgroup of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB Group]]) are \"plantains\".<ref name=StovSimm87p183/><ref name=QiMoorOrch00/> Small farmers in Colombia grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations. A study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking bananas, and plantains, although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas.<ref name=GibeDufoGiraSanc09/>\n\nIn Southeast Asia \u2013 the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated \u2013 the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" that is made in English (and Spanish).

Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, but [[Karat banana]]s, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas, are eaten raw.<ref name=Engl03/>\n\nIn summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas (although not in small-scale cultivation), it is possible to distinguish between \"bananas\", which are eaten raw, and \"plantains\", which are cooked. In other regions of the world, particularly India, Southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific, there are many more kinds of banana and the two-fold distinction is not useful and not made in local languages.

They [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ized with other (possibly independently domesticated) [[subspecies]] of ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' as well as ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'' in the Philippines, northern New Guinea, and possibly [[Halmahera]]. These hybridization events produced the [[triploid]] [[List of banana cultivars|cultivars of bananas]] commonly grown today.

It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed more time between harvesting and ripening. North American shippers like [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]] and [[Andrew Preston]], the founders of the [[Boston Fruit Company]] started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like [[Minor C. Keith]] also participated, eventually culminating in the multi-national giant corporations like today's [[Chiquita Brands International]] and [[Dole Food Company|Dole]].<ref name=Koep08/> These companies were [[monopoly|monopolistic]], [[vertically integrated]] (meaning they controlled growing, processing, shipping and marketing) and usually used political manipulation to build [[enclave economy|enclave economies]] (economies that were internally self-sufficient, virtually tax exempt, and export-oriented that contribute very little to the host economy). Their political maneuvers, which gave rise to the term [[Banana republic]] for states like Honduras and Guatemala, included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the United States, especially during the [[Cold War]], to keep the political climate favorable to their interests.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Peasant cultivation for export in the Caribbean===\n{{Main|History of peasant banana production in the Americas}}\n\nThe vast majority of the world's bananas today are cultivated for family consumption or for sale on local markets. India is the world leader in this sort of production, but many other Asian and African countries where climate and soil conditions allow cultivation also host large populations of banana growers who sell at least some of their crop.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nPeasant sector banana growers produce for the world market in the Caribbean, however. The [[Windward Islands]] are notable for the growing, largely of Cavendish bananas, for an international market, generally in Europe but also in North America. In the Caribbean, and especially in Dominica where this sort of cultivation is widespread, holdings are in the 1\u20132 acre range. In many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops, from engaging in labor outside the farm, and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/poj7td/The-earliest-modern-plantations-originated-in-Jamaica-and-the-related-Western/|title=The earliest modern plantations originated in Jamaica and the related Western|work=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBanana crops are vulnerable to destruction by high winds, such as tropical storms or [[cyclone]]s.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n==Modern cultivation==\nAll widely cultivated bananas today descend from the two wild bananas ''Musa acuminata'' and ''Musa balbisiana''.

These rooms are air-tight and filled with [[Ethylene|ethylene gas]] to induce ripening. The vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket bananas is, in fact, caused by the artificial ripening process.<ref name=Ding07/> Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. Bananas are refrigerated to between {{convert|13.5|and|15|C|F}} during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and the bananas turn gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the {{convert|4|C}} environment of a domestic [[refrigerator]], although the fruit inside remains unaffected.\n[[File:Banana-fluorescence-081108.jpg|thumb|left|Ripened bananas (left, under [[sunlight]]) fluoresce in blue when exposed to [[UV light]].|alt=Two adjacent photos of bananas.

The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping. The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene. This technology allows storage and transport for 3\u20134 weeks at {{convert|13|C}}. On arrival, bananas are held at about {{convert|17|C}} and treated with a low concentration of ethylene. After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale. Ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home. If bananas are too green, they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process.<ref name=ChiquitaRipen/>\n\nCarbon dioxide (which bananas produce) and ethylene absorbents extend fruit life even at high temperatures. This effect can be exploited by packing banana in a [[polyethylene]] bag and including an ethylene absorbent, e.g., [[potassium permanganate]], on an inert carrier. The bag is then sealed with a band or string.

Like almost all bananas, Cavendish lacks genetic diversity, which makes it vulnerable to diseases, threatening both commercial cultivation and small-scale subsistence farming.<ref name=NS060613/><ref name=Mont03/> Some commentators remarked that those variants which could replace what much of the world considers a \"typical banana\" are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit, and blame the decline of the banana on [[mendelian inheritance|monogenetic]] cultivation driven by short-term commercial motives.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Panama disease===\n[[Panama disease]] is caused by a [[fusarium]] soil [[fungus]] (Race 1), which enters the plants through the roots and travels with water into the trunk and leaves, producing [[gel]]s and gums that cut off the flow of water and nutrients, causing the plant to [[wilting|wilt]], and exposing the rest of the plant to lethal amounts of sunlight. Prior to 1960, almost all commercial banana production centered on \"Gros Michel\", which was highly susceptible.<ref name=Bark08/> Cavendish was chosen as the replacement for Gros Michel because, among resistant cultivars, it produces the highest quality [[fruit]]. However, more care is required for shipping the Cavendish,<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Natasha|last=Frost|date=February 28, 2018|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/gros-michel-bananas|magazine=Atlas Obscura|title=A Quest for the Gros Michel, the Great Banana of Yesteryear|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref> and its quality compared to Gros Michel is debated.<ref name=\"Lessard\">{{Cite book |title=The Complete Book of Bananas |last=Lessard |first=William |year=1992 |isbn=978-0963316103 |pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nAccording to current sources, a deadly form of Panama disease is infecting Cavendish.

Black Sigatoka (also known as black leaf streak) has spread to banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars<ref name =Holmes/>), impeding [[photosynthesis]] by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow [[ripening|ripen]] prematurely, making them unsuitable for export.

Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is [[isoamyl acetate]] (also known as ''banana oil''), which, along with several other compounds such as [[butyl acetate]] and [[isobutyl acetate]], is a significant contributor to banana flavor.<ref name=Fahl00/><ref name=Mui02/><ref name=Salm96/>\n\nDuring the ripening process, bananas produce the gas [[ethylene]], which acts as a [[plant hormone]] and indirectly affects the flavor. Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of [[amylase]], an [[enzyme]] that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas. The greener, less ripe bananas contain higher levels of starch and, consequently, have a \"starchier\" taste. On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations. Furthermore, ethylene signals the production of [[pectinase]], an enzyme which breaks down the [[pectin]] between the cells of the banana, causing the banana to soften as it ripens.<ref name=plantphys/><ref name=newton/>\n\nBananas are eaten deep fried, baked in their skin in a split [[bamboo]], or steamed in [[glutinous rice]] wrapped in a banana leaf. Bananas can be made into [[fruit preserves]]. Banana [[pancake]]s are popular among travelers in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. This has elicited the expression ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]'' for those places in Asia that cater to these travelers. [[Banana chips]] are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste. Dried bananas are also ground to make [[banana flour]]. Extracting juice is difficult, because when a banana is compressed, it simply turns to pulp. Bananas feature prominently in [[Philippine cuisine]], being part of traditional dishes and desserts like ''[[Maruya (Filipino cuisine)|maruya]]'', ''[[Tur\u00f3n (food)|tur\u00f3n]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]'' or ''saba con yelo''. Most of these dishes use the [[Saba Banana]] or Cardaba banana cultivar. Bananas are also commonly used in cuisine in the South-Indian state of [[Kerala]], where they are steamed (''puzhungiyathu''), made into curries,<ref name=pazhampachadi/> fried into chips, (''upperi'')<ref name=Hindu130413/> or fried in batter (''pazhampori'').<ref name=Hindu110228/> [[Pisang goreng]], bananas fried with batter similar to the Filipino ''maruya'' or Kerala ''pazhampori'', is a popular dessert in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.
