MIT therapy on average lasts for 1.5 hours per day for five days per week. At the lowest level of therapy, simple words and phrases (such as \"water\" and \"I love you\") are broken down into a series of high- and low-pitch syllables. With increased treatment, longer phrases are taught and less support is provided by the therapist. Patients are taught to say phrases using the natural melodic component of speaking and continuous voicing is emphasized. The patient is also instructed to use the left hand to tap the syllables of the phrase while the phrases are spoken. Tapping is assumed to trigger the rhythmic component of speaking to utilize the right hemisphere.<ref name='Schlaug' />\n\n[[FMRI]] studies have shown that Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) uses both sides of the brain to recover lost function, as opposed to traditional therapies that utilize only the left hemisphere. In MIT, individuals with small lesions in the left hemisphere seem to recover by activation of the left hemisphere perilesional cortex. Meanwhile, individuals with larger left-hemisphere lesions show a recruitment of the use of language-capable regions in the right hemisphere.<ref name=\"Schlaug\"/> The interpretation of these results is still a matter of debate. For example, it remains unclear whether changes in neural activity in the right hemisphere result from singing or from the intensive use of common phrases, such as \"thank you\", \"how are you?\" or \"I am fine.\" This type of phrases falls into the category of [[formulaic language]] and is known to be supported by neural networks of the intact right hemisphere.<ref name='Stahl c'>{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Benjamin|last2=Kotz|first2=Sonja A.|title=Facing the music: Three issues in current research on singing and aphasia|journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1033 |year=2013 |pages=1\u20134 |issn=1664-1078 |doi= 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01033|pmid=25295017|pmc=4172097}}</ref>\n\nA pilot study reported positive results when comparing the efficacy of a modified form of MIT to no treatment in people with nonfluent aphasia with damage to their left-brain.

In constraint-induced aphasia therapy the interaction is guided by communicative need in a language game context, picture cards, barriers making it impossible to see other players' cards, and other materials, so that patients are encouraged (\"constrained\") to use the remaining verbal abilities to succeed in the communication game.<ref name='Pulvermuller' />\n\nTwo important principles of constraint-induced aphasia therapy are that treatment is very intense, with sessions lasting for up to 6 hours over the course of 10 days and that language is used in a communication context in which it is closely linked to (nonverbal) actions.<ref name='Meinzer' /><ref name='Pulvermuller' />  These principles are motivated by neuroscience insights about learning at the level of nerve cells (synaptic plasticity) and the coupling between cortical systems for language and action in the human brain.<ref name='Pulvermuller2' /> Constraint-induced therapy contrasts sharply with traditional therapy by the strong belief that mechanisms to compensate for lost language function, such as gesturing or writing, should not be used unless absolutely necessary, even in everyday life.<ref name='Meinzer' />\n\nIt is believed that CIAT works by the mechanism of increased [[neuroplasticity]]. By constraining an individual to use only speech, it is believed that the brain is more likely to reestablish old neural pathways and recruit new neural pathways to compensate for lost function.\n\nThe strongest results of CIAT have been seen in patients with chronic aphasia (lasting over 6 months). Studies of CIAT have confirmed that further improvement is possible even after a patient has reached a \"plateau\" period of recovery.<ref name='Meinzer' /><ref name='Pulvermuller' /> It has also been proven that the benefits of CIAT are retained long term.

For example, many individuals who have expressive aphasia struggle with Wh- sentences. \"What\" and \"who\" questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> For instance, therapists have used sentences like, \"Who is the boy helping?\" and \"What is the boy fixing?\" because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments in the form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> In addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. Training \"who\" sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained \"who\" sentences as well as untrained \"what\" sentences, and vice versa.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Likewise, \"where\" and \"when\" question types are very closely linked. \"What\" and \"who\" questions alter placement of arguments, and \"where\" and \"when\" sentences move adjunct phrases.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Training is in the style of: \"The man parked the car in the driveway. What did the man park in the driveway?\"<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.<ref name=\"TUF\" />\n\nResults: Patients\u2019 use of sentence types used in the TUF treatment will improve, subjects will generalize sentences of similar category to those used for treatment in TUF, and results are applied to real-world conversations with others.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Generalization of sentence types used can be improved when the treatment progresses in the order of more complex sentences to more elementary sentences. Treatment has been shown to affect on-line (real-time) processing of trained sentences and these results can be tracked using fMRI mappings.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Training of Wh- sentences has led improvements in three main areas of discourse for aphasics: increased average length of utterances, higher proportions of grammatical sentences, and larger ratios of numbers of verbs to nouns produced.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Patients also showed improvements in verb argument structure productions and assigned thematic roles to words in utterances with more accuracy.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> In terms of on-line sentence processing, patients having undergone this treatment discriminate between anomalous and non-anomalous sentences with more accuracy than control groups and are closer to levels of normalcy than patients not having participated in this treatment.<ref name=\"TUF\" />\n\n===Mechanisms of recovery===\nMechanisms for recovery differ from patient to patient. Some mechanisms for recovery occur spontaneously after damage to the brain, whereas others are caused by the effects of language therapy.<ref name='Berthier' /> [[FMRI]] studies have shown that recovery can be partially attributed to the activation of tissue around the damaged area and the recruitment of new neurons in these areas to compensate for the lost function. Recovery may also be caused in very acute lesions by a return of blood flow and function to damaged tissue that has not died around an injured area.<ref name='Berthier' /> It has been stated by some researchers that the recruitment and recovery of neurons in the left hemisphere opposed to the recruitment of similar neurons in the right hemisphere is superior for long-term recovery and continued rehabilitation.<ref name='Heiss'>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1531-8249(199904)45:4<430::AID-ANA3>3.0.CO;2-P|title=Differential capacity of left and right hemispheric areas for compensation of poststroke|first5=H|last5=Karbe|first4=M|last4=Ghaemi|first3=A|last3=Thiel|first2=J |journal=Ann Neurol|last2=Kessler|year=1999|first=W-D|last=Heiss|volume=45|pmid=10211466|issue=4|pages=430\u2013438|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref> It is thought that, because the right hemisphere is not intended for full language function, using the right hemisphere as a mechanism of recovery is effectively a \"dead-end\" and can lead only to partial recovery.<ref name='Martin' />\n\nIt has been proven that, among all types of therapies, one of the most important factors and best predictors for a successful outcome is the intensity of the therapy.

By examining the brains of deceased individuals having acquired expressive aphasia in life, he concluded that language ability is localized in the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobe. One of the most important aspects of Paul Broca's discovery was the observation that the loss of proper speech in expressive aphasia is due to the brain's loss of ability to produce language, as opposed to the mouth's loss of ability to produce words.<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\nThe discoveries of Paul Broca were made during the same period of time as the German Neurologist [[Carl Wernicke]], who was also studying brains of aphasiacs post-mortem and identified the region now known as [[Wernicke's area]]. Discoveries of both men contributed to the concept of localization, which states that specific brain functions are all localized to a specific area of the brain. While both men made significant contributions to the field of aphasia, it was Carl Wernicke who realized the difference between patients with aphasia that could not produce language and those that could not comprehend language (the essential difference between expressive and [[receptive aphasia]]).<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Broca's region]]\n*[[Transcortical sensory aphasia]]\n*[[Wernicke's aphasia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*ASHA Glossary: Broca's Aphasia.

In the past, it has been believed that the area for language production differs between left and right-handed individuals. If this were true, damage to the homologous region of Broca's area in the right hemisphere should cause aphasia in a left-handed individual. More recent studies have shown that even left-handed individuals typically have language functions only in the left hemisphere. However, left-handed individuals are more likely to have a dominance of language in the right hemisphere.<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\n==== Uncommon causes ====\nLess common causes of expressive aphasia include primary [[Autoimmune encephalitis|autoimmune phenomenon]] and autoimmune phenomenon that are secondary to cancer (as a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]) have been listed as the primary hypothesis for several cases of aphasia, especially when presenting with other psychiatric disturbances and focal neurological deficits.

MIT therapy on average lasts for 1.5 hours per day for five days per week. At the lowest level of therapy, simple words and phrases (such as \"water\" and \"I love you\") are broken down into a series of high- and low-pitch syllables. With increased treatment, longer phrases are taught and less support is provided by the therapist. Patients are taught to say phrases using the natural melodic component of speaking and continuous voicing is emphasized. The patient is also instructed to use the left hand to tap the syllables of the phrase while the phrases are spoken. Tapping is assumed to trigger the rhythmic component of speaking to utilize the right hemisphere.<ref name='Schlaug' />\n\n[[FMRI]] studies have shown that Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) uses both sides of the brain to recover lost function, as opposed to traditional therapies that utilize only the left hemisphere. In MIT, individuals with small lesions in the left hemisphere seem to recover by activation of the left hemisphere perilesional cortex. Meanwhile, individuals with larger left-hemisphere lesions show a recruitment of the use of language-capable regions in the right hemisphere.<ref name=\"Schlaug\"/> The interpretation of these results is still a matter of debate. For example, it remains unclear whether changes in neural activity in the right hemisphere result from singing or from the intensive use of common phrases, such as \"thank you\", \"how are you?\" or \"I am fine.\" This type of phrases falls into the category of [[formulaic language]] and is known to be supported by neural networks of the intact right hemisphere.<ref name='Stahl c'>{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Benjamin|last2=Kotz|first2=Sonja A.|title=Facing the music: Three issues in current research on singing and aphasia|journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1033 |year=2013 |pages=1\u20134 |issn=1664-1078 |doi= 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01033|pmid=25295017|pmc=4172097}}</ref>\n\nA pilot study reported positive results when comparing the efficacy of a modified form of MIT to no treatment in people with nonfluent aphasia with damage to their left-brain.

In constraint-induced aphasia therapy the interaction is guided by communicative need in a language game context, picture cards, barriers making it impossible to see other players' cards, and other materials, so that patients are encouraged (\"constrained\") to use the remaining verbal abilities to succeed in the communication game.<ref name='Pulvermuller' />\n\nTwo important principles of constraint-induced aphasia therapy are that treatment is very intense, with sessions lasting for up to 6 hours over the course of 10 days and that language is used in a communication context in which it is closely linked to (nonverbal) actions.<ref name='Meinzer' /><ref name='Pulvermuller' />  These principles are motivated by neuroscience insights about learning at the level of nerve cells (synaptic plasticity) and the coupling between cortical systems for language and action in the human brain.<ref name='Pulvermuller2' /> Constraint-induced therapy contrasts sharply with traditional therapy by the strong belief that mechanisms to compensate for lost language function, such as gesturing or writing, should not be used unless absolutely necessary, even in everyday life.<ref name='Meinzer' />\n\nIt is believed that CIAT works by the mechanism of increased [[neuroplasticity]]. By constraining an individual to use only speech, it is believed that the brain is more likely to reestablish old neural pathways and recruit new neural pathways to compensate for lost function.\n\nThe strongest results of CIAT have been seen in patients with chronic aphasia (lasting over 6 months). Studies of CIAT have confirmed that further improvement is possible even after a patient has reached a \"plateau\" period of recovery.<ref name='Meinzer' /><ref name='Pulvermuller' /> It has also been proven that the benefits of CIAT are retained long term.

For example, many individuals who have expressive aphasia struggle with Wh- sentences. \"What\" and \"who\" questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> For instance, therapists have used sentences like, \"Who is the boy helping?\" and \"What is the boy fixing?\" because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments in the form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> In addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. Training \"who\" sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained \"who\" sentences as well as untrained \"what\" sentences, and vice versa.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Likewise, \"where\" and \"when\" question types are very closely linked. \"What\" and \"who\" questions alter placement of arguments, and \"where\" and \"when\" sentences move adjunct phrases.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Training is in the style of: \"The man parked the car in the driveway. What did the man park in the driveway?\"<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.<ref name=\"TUF\" />\n\nResults: Patients\u2019 use of sentence types used in the TUF treatment will improve, subjects will generalize sentences of similar category to those used for treatment in TUF, and results are applied to real-world conversations with others.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Generalization of sentence types used can be improved when the treatment progresses in the order of more complex sentences to more elementary sentences. Treatment has been shown to affect on-line (real-time) processing of trained sentences and these results can be tracked using fMRI mappings.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Training of Wh- sentences has led improvements in three main areas of discourse for aphasics: increased average length of utterances, higher proportions of grammatical sentences, and larger ratios of numbers of verbs to nouns produced.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> Patients also showed improvements in verb argument structure productions and assigned thematic roles to words in utterances with more accuracy.<ref name=\"TUF\" /> In terms of on-line sentence processing, patients having undergone this treatment discriminate between anomalous and non-anomalous sentences with more accuracy than control groups and are closer to levels of normalcy than patients not having participated in this treatment.<ref name=\"TUF\" />\n\n===Mechanisms of recovery===\nMechanisms for recovery differ from patient to patient. Some mechanisms for recovery occur spontaneously after damage to the brain, whereas others are caused by the effects of language therapy.<ref name='Berthier' /> [[FMRI]] studies have shown that recovery can be partially attributed to the activation of tissue around the damaged area and the recruitment of new neurons in these areas to compensate for the lost function. Recovery may also be caused in very acute lesions by a return of blood flow and function to damaged tissue that has not died around an injured area.<ref name='Berthier' /> It has been stated by some researchers that the recruitment and recovery of neurons in the left hemisphere opposed to the recruitment of similar neurons in the right hemisphere is superior for long-term recovery and continued rehabilitation.<ref name='Heiss'>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1531-8249(199904)45:4<430::AID-ANA3>3.0.CO;2-P|title=Differential capacity of left and right hemispheric areas for compensation of poststroke|first5=H|last5=Karbe|first4=M|last4=Ghaemi|first3=A|last3=Thiel|first2=J |journal=Ann Neurol|last2=Kessler|year=1999|first=W-D|last=Heiss|volume=45|pmid=10211466|issue=4|pages=430\u2013438|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}</ref> It is thought that, because the right hemisphere is not intended for full language function, using the right hemisphere as a mechanism of recovery is effectively a \"dead-end\" and can lead only to partial recovery.<ref name='Martin' />\n\nIt has been proven that, among all types of therapies, one of the most important factors and best predictors for a successful outcome is the intensity of the therapy.

By examining the brains of deceased individuals having acquired expressive aphasia in life, he concluded that language ability is localized in the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobe. One of the most important aspects of Paul Broca's discovery was the observation that the loss of proper speech in expressive aphasia is due to the brain's loss of ability to produce language, as opposed to the mouth's loss of ability to produce words.<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\nThe discoveries of Paul Broca were made during the same period of time as the German Neurologist [[Carl Wernicke]], who was also studying brains of aphasiacs post-mortem and identified the region now known as [[Wernicke's area]]. Discoveries of both men contributed to the concept of localization, which states that specific brain functions are all localized to a specific area of the brain. While both men made significant contributions to the field of aphasia, it was Carl Wernicke who realized the difference between patients with aphasia that could not produce language and those that could not comprehend language (the essential difference between expressive and [[receptive aphasia]]).<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Broca's region]]\n*[[Transcortical sensory aphasia]]\n*[[Wernicke's aphasia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*ASHA Glossary: Broca's Aphasia.

While Nancy struggles to fit in, Carson is active in local politics, fighting the development of a train line through the town. A local thug named Willie Wharton threatens Nancy one night to try to scare her father into backing down.\n\nWhile performing community service as punishment for a prank on a school bully, Nancy meets Flora, an elderly woman needing help with an apparent haunting in her home. Excited by the mystery, Nancy stays overnight at Flora's home, along with Flora's niece Helen. That night, strange things begin to happen, with lights going out and then exploding, cabinet doors and drawers opening, and a cloaked figure appearing and warning Nancy to give up her mystery.\n\nThe next day, Nancy believes that someone broke in and tried scaring them out. Nancy and Helen investigate, and they find a secret passage that leads outside, revealing how the \"ghost\" entered the house. The secret passage also contains props the intruder used to simulate a haunting, such as a rigged fuse box to manipulate the lights in the house. The rest of the strange phenomenon is explained by a rig that emits concentrated [[nutmeg#Psychoactivity and toxicity|nutmeg]] through the house's air conditioning, which triggers hallucinations.\n\nLater, Nancy realizes her father, who is staying out of town on a business trip, has not checked in with her or her aunt Hannah recently. She calls her father's friend Nate, who tells her that Carson's meeting is at a campsite and reception must be spotty. Nancy is not convinced, as Carson had told her he would be staying at a hotel.\n\nWorried that something has happened to him, Nancy and Helen head to Carson's hotel. They discover that he never checked out, and his cell phone is still in his room. Security footage from the previous night reveals Carson was ambushed and kidnapped by Wharton. Nancy's friends Bess and George find out that Wharton is also the man who bought the nutmeg used at Flora's house, and Nancy realizes Carson is being kept in the secret passage there. She and Helen head to Flora's house, where they shockingly discover Wharton and Nate holding Carson and Flora hostage. It is revealed that Wharton and Nate were working together to sabotage the anti-train movement all along, and that their scheme was meant to force Flora to sell her house so the line could be built through her property. However, to their great misfortune, [[Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase (2019 Film)|Nancy had gotten involved]], and had assured Flora that her property was not haunted, and that she had no absolute need to sell it. As such, they had been forced to use other means to get hold of the land (the kidnapping). Nancy and Helen work together to save Carson and Flora from their captors, who are then arrested by the police.\n\nThe next day at school, Nancy, George, and Bess welcome Helen into their circle of friends, and together they plan their next adventure at the [[The Mystery at Lilac Inn|Lilac Inn]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sophia Lillis]] as [[Nancy Drew]]\n* Zoe Renee as [[George Fayne]]\n* Mackenzie Graham as Bess Marvin\n* [[Laura Slade Wiggins]] as Helen Corning\n* [[Sam Trammell]] as Carson Drew\n* [[Linda Lavin]] as Flora\n* [[Andrea Anders]] as Hannah Gruen\n* [[Jesse C.

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of Genoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm.

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of Genoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks.

Wings are dark grey with varying levels of yellow highlighting. The ventral feathering is light grey to white with light grey scalloping on the chest. The feathering surrounding the eye is black. The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping. Immature birds can be identified in the hand by retained juvenile remiges and rectrices, which are more brownish.<ref name=\"BirdInTheHand\" /> Yellow-throated miners are distinctive from the other miners by their clean white rump, instead of the continuous grey from the back that the noisy and black-eared miners have. The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.

In 1962 she established Our Lady of the Angels monastery. During the 1970s, she was an in-demand lecturer and produced pamphlets and audio and video tapes. She had been a guest on local station [[WIAT|WBMG]] (currently WIAT, Channel 42), and on shows on the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]. After she gave an interview on then-Christian station [[WCPX-TV|WCFC]] (Channel 38) in [[Chicago]], she decided she wanted her own network. \"I walked in, and it was just a little studio, and I remember standing in the doorway and thinking, 'It doesn't take much to reach the masses'. I just stood there and said to the Lord, 'Lord, I've got to have one of these'\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD71F3FF93BA35753C1A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Scandals Aside, TV Preachers Thrive |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Peter |last=Applebome |date=October 8, 1989}}</ref>\n\nMother Angelica purchased satellite space and EWTN began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, with four hours of daily programming, which included her own show, ''Mother Angelica Live'' (aired bi-weekly), a Sunday Mass, and reruns of older Catholic programs such as Archbishop [[Fulton J. Sheen]]'s ''[[Life Is Worth Living]]''. The remainder of the time was filled with shows produced by dioceses across the country, shows from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] sources which Mother Angelica determined were in concert with [[Catholic theology|Catholic teachings]], and children's shows such as ''Joy Junction'' and ''The Sunshine Factory''. About one-third of programming time consisted of secular content, such as re-runs of ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', [[public domain]] films, and cooking and [[Western (genre)|western]]-themed shows. EWTN eventually increased its broadcast schedule to six hours per day and then to eight hours per day by 1986. Secular content was gradually reduced from 1986 to 1988, and [[Satellite television|satellite distribution]] was expanded late in 1987, after which EWTN acquired a far more desirable satellite channel and began broadcasting around the clock. At this point, EWTN began broadcasting the praying of the rosary on a daily basis and added a number of educational shows. In-house production of original programming gradually increased. The Mass became televised daily in 1991 from a chapel on the monastery grounds. Most shows from non-Catholic sources were eliminated and a more theological image gradually developed.\n\n== Radio ==\n{{Main|WEWN}}\nIn 1992, EWTN established the largest privately owned shortwave radio station, WEWN, in the vicinity of [[Birmingham, Alabama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn 1996, Mother Angelica announced that EWTN would make its radio signal available via satellite to AM and FM stations throughout the [[United States]] at no cost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/a-signal-for-the-new-evangelization|title=A Signal for the New Evangelization|author=|date=|work=NCRegister.com|access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, programs included ''Mother Angelica Live'' and \"Life Is Worth Living\" with Fulton J.

EWTN officially assumed total control on February 1, 2011.<ref name=\"ncregister.com\" /> EWTN also owns 'Catholic News Agency' which is a Catholic news service with bureaus across America, Latin America and Europe.\n\n== News coverage ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThe EWTN news department produces a daily news service for television and radio, featuring news sources including [[Vatican Radio]]. It also produces ''The World Over Live'', which reports relevant current events. Journalist and author [[Raymond Arroyo]], who is EWTN's news director, hosts the program. The program is conservative in its political orientation and generally conservative in its religious orientation. Notable guests have included Robert Rector of [[The Heritage Foundation]], author and activist [[George Weigel]], political commentator [[Laura Ingraham]], conservative political commentator [[Pat Buchanan]], and the late columnist and commentator [[Robert Novak]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] convert to the Catholic Faith.\n\n== History of programming ==\nIn its early history, EWTN broadcast Catholic programming from a great variety of Catholic sources, which ranged from Catholic charismatic programming, such as that of [[Michael Manning (priest)|Fr. Michael Manning]], to programs focusing on [[Reform movement |social reform]] and [[social justice]], such as ''[[The Christophers|Christopher Closeup]]'', to [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|doctrinal]] programs hosted by clergy.\n\nIn the early 1990s, EWTN began producing more of its own programs. This effort marked a conspicuously conservative shift in its overall orientation, with programs on topics of social reform and justice gradually eliminated and replaced by programs on doctrine and programs of dialogue. The shift was apparent in the daily televised Masses, which, in 1992, began incorporating [[Latin]] into the liturgy and gradually eliminated contemporary music. Some untelevised Masses are totally in [[English language|English]] and some include more contemporary music. On [[Christmas Eve]] of 1993, Mother Angelica and the nuns of her order reverted to traditional [[Religious habit|habits]]. From 1992 on, the [[Latin]] portions of the Mass included the Gloria, introduction of the Gospel readings, the Sanctus, and the remainder of the Mass after the Great Amen, beginning with the Lord's Prayer.\n\nAmong its notable weekly programs are ''The Journey Home'' and ''Life on the Rock''. ''The Journey Home'', hosted by Marcus Grodi, presents [[Religious conversion|converts]] to the Catholic Faith. Grodi is a former [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] who converted to the Catholic Faith in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chnetwork.org/information/marcus-grodi/|title=Marcus Grodi&nbsp;\u2014 The Coming Home Network|work=The Coming Home Network}}</ref> Although most guests are former [[Protestantism|Protestants]], former members of non-[[Christianity|Christian]] faiths (such as [[Judaism]]) and former [[Atheism|atheists]] occasionally appear. ''Life on the Rock'' is hosted by Rev. Mark Mary, [[Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word|MFVA]] and Doug Barry.\n\nThe HD feed first became available to Comcast customers in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and its vicinity on May 11, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/general/press/pr_detail.asp?id=283|title=EWTN Press Release&nbsp;\u2014 EWTN HD Launches on Comcast in Richmond Area|work=ewtn.com}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011, EWTN became available through the [[Roku]] streaming player.

It was founded by [[Mother Angelica]], [[Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration|PCPA]], in 1980 and began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, from a garage [[Television studio|studio]] at the Our Lady of the Angels Monastery in [[Irondale, Alabama]], which Mother Angelica founded in 1962.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1400|title=Mother Angelica Encyclopedia of Alabama|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|access-date=2016-03-29}}</ref> She hosted her own show, ''Mother Angelica Live'', until suffering a major [[stroke]] and other health issues in September 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/general/press/pr_detail.asp?id=86|title=EWTN Press Release&nbsp;\u2014 Two Years After Suffering a Major Stroke Mother Angelica Lives Her Life of Prayer|work=ewtn.com}}</ref> Repeats now air as either the ''Best of Mother Angelica Live'' or ''Mother Angelica Live Classics''.

In 1962 she established Our Lady of the Angels monastery. During the 1970s, she was an in-demand lecturer and produced pamphlets and audio and video tapes. She had been a guest on local station [[WIAT|WBMG]] (currently WIAT, Channel 42), and on shows on the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]. After she gave an interview on then-Christian station [[WCPX-TV|WCFC]] (Channel 38) in [[Chicago]], she decided she wanted her own network. \"I walked in, and it was just a little studio, and I remember standing in the doorway and thinking, 'It doesn't take much to reach the masses'.

Sheen]]'s ''[[Life Is Worth Living]]''. The remainder of the time was filled with shows produced by dioceses across the country, shows from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] sources which Mother Angelica determined were in concert with [[Catholic theology|Catholic teachings]], and children's shows such as ''Joy Junction'' and ''The Sunshine Factory''. About one-third of programming time consisted of secular content, such as re-runs of ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', [[public domain]] films, and cooking and [[Western (genre)|western]]-themed shows. EWTN eventually increased its broadcast schedule to six hours per day and then to eight hours per day by 1986. Secular content was gradually reduced from 1986 to 1988, and [[Satellite television|satellite distribution]] was expanded late in 1987, after which EWTN acquired a far more desirable satellite channel and began broadcasting around the clock. At this point, EWTN began broadcasting the praying of the rosary on a daily basis and added a number of educational shows. In-house production of original programming gradually increased. The Mass became televised daily in 1991 from a chapel on the monastery grounds. Most shows from non-Catholic sources were eliminated and a more theological image gradually developed.\n\n== Radio ==\n{{Main|WEWN}}\nIn 1992, EWTN established the largest privately owned shortwave radio station, WEWN, in the vicinity of [[Birmingham, Alabama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn 1996, Mother Angelica announced that EWTN would make its radio signal available via satellite to AM and FM stations throughout the [[United States]] at no cost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/a-signal-for-the-new-evangelization|title=A Signal for the New Evangelization|author=|date=|work=NCRegister.com|access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, programs included ''Mother Angelica Live'' and \"Life Is Worth Living\" with Fulton J.

EWTN officially assumed total control on February 1, 2011.<ref name=\"ncregister.com\" /> EWTN also owns 'Catholic News Agency' which is a Catholic news service with bureaus across America, Latin America and Europe.\n\n== News coverage ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThe EWTN news department produces a daily news service for television and radio, featuring news sources including [[Vatican Radio]]. It also produces ''The World Over Live'', which reports relevant current events. Journalist and author [[Raymond Arroyo]], who is EWTN's news director, hosts the program. The program is conservative in its political orientation and generally conservative in its religious orientation. Notable guests have included Robert Rector of [[The Heritage Foundation]], author and activist [[George Weigel]], political commentator [[Laura Ingraham]], conservative political commentator [[Pat Buchanan]], and the late columnist and commentator [[Robert Novak]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] convert to the Catholic Faith.\n\n== History of programming ==\nIn its early history, EWTN broadcast Catholic programming from a great variety of Catholic sources, which ranged from Catholic charismatic programming, such as that of [[Michael Manning (priest)|Fr. Michael Manning]], to programs focusing on [[Reform movement |social reform]] and [[social justice]], such as ''[[The Christophers|Christopher Closeup]]'', to [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|doctrinal]] programs hosted by clergy.\n\nIn the early 1990s, EWTN began producing more of its own programs. This effort marked a conspicuously conservative shift in its overall orientation, with programs on topics of social reform and justice gradually eliminated and replaced by programs on doctrine and programs of dialogue. The shift was apparent in the daily televised Masses, which, in 1992, began incorporating [[Latin]] into the liturgy and gradually eliminated contemporary music. Some untelevised Masses are totally in [[English language|English]] and some include more contemporary music. On [[Christmas Eve]] of 1993, Mother Angelica and the nuns of her order reverted to traditional [[Religious habit|habits]]. From 1992 on, the [[Latin]] portions of the Mass included the Gloria, introduction of the Gospel readings, the Sanctus, and the remainder of the Mass after the Great Amen, beginning with the Lord's Prayer.\n\nAmong its notable weekly programs are ''The Journey Home'' and ''Life on the Rock''. ''The Journey Home'', hosted by Marcus Grodi, presents [[Religious conversion|converts]] to the Catholic Faith. Grodi is a former [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] who converted to the Catholic Faith in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chnetwork.org/information/marcus-grodi/|title=Marcus Grodi&nbsp;\u2014 The Coming Home Network|work=The Coming Home Network}}</ref> Although most guests are former [[Protestantism|Protestants]], former members of non-[[Christianity|Christian]] faiths (such as [[Judaism]]) and former [[Atheism|atheists]] occasionally appear. ''Life on the Rock'' is hosted by Rev. Mark Mary, [[Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word|MFVA]] and Doug Barry.\n\nThe HD feed first became available to Comcast customers in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and its vicinity on May 11, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/general/press/pr_detail.asp?id=283|title=EWTN Press Release&nbsp;\u2014 EWTN HD Launches on Comcast in Richmond Area|work=ewtn.com}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011, EWTN became available through the [[Roku]] streaming player.

His compositions bridge the classical and early romantic styles. His full name and title in German was 'Heinrich Eduard Josef, Freiherr von Lannoy'.\n\n==Biography==\n;Political background \nThe turbulent political events from 1789 include the [[Belgian Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]]; during the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars#Campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary Wars]], French troops under [[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] pushed the armies of the [[First coalition]] as far as the [[River Rhine|Rhine]], and in 1795 the Republic of France formally annexed the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now [[Belgium]]. ''See'' [[commons:file:Europe_1812_map_en.png|Map of Europe in 1812]].)

He received the Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary|Order of St. Stephen]] and was made a ''Freiherr'' (Baron) in 1809. He died in Wildhaus (see below), 8 February 1825.{{sfn|BLKO 14|1884|p=142 [150]}}\n\nLannoy, aged about 8, came with his parents to the Austrian [[Duchy of Styria]] in 1796. He attended school and the 'Gymnasium' in [[Graz]] from 1796 to 1801. He returned to Brussels and enrolled at the [[:fr:\u00c9cole centrale de Bruxelles]] (previously the [[Old University of Leuven]]), where he studied [[linguistics]], philosophy and [[jurisprudence]], and especially mathematics and  music.

His compositions bridge the classical and early romantic styles. His full name and title in German was 'Heinrich Eduard Josef, Freiherr von Lannoy'.\n\n==Biography==\n;Political background \nThe turbulent political events from 1789 include the [[Belgian Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]]; during the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars#Campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary Wars]], French troops under [[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] pushed the armies of the [[First coalition]] as far as the [[River Rhine|Rhine]], and in 1795 the Republic of France formally annexed the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now [[Belgium]]. ''See'' [[commons:file:Europe_1812_map_en.png|Map of Europe in 1812]].) A number of government officials left the country, including Lannoy's father and [[Jean Vesque de Puttelange]]; they both eventually obtained official government positions in Vienna, where their sons had fruitful musical careers.\n\n===Early life===\nEduard de Lannoy was born in [[Brussels]], then in the [[Duchy of Brabant]], a region of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. His father was [[Lannoy family|Pierre Joseph Albert, baron de Lannoy]] (1733-1825), of the [[Lannoy (noble family)|Lannoy]] family, one of the oldest families in Belgium.<ref group=n>See also [[:fr:Liste chronologique de familles belges]]</ref> His father's career began in 1756 in the Finance department of the Austro-Belgian government; after the suppression of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]] in 1773 he was chief administrator for the disbursement of its estates. He received the Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary|Order of St. Stephen]] and was made a ''Freiherr'' (Baron) in 1809. He died in Wildhaus (see below), 8 February 1825.{{sfn|BLKO 14|1884|p=142 [150]}}\n\nLannoy, aged about 8, came with his parents to the Austrian [[Duchy of Styria]] in 1796. He attended school and the 'Gymnasium' in [[Graz]] from 1796 to 1801. He returned to Brussels and enrolled at the [[:fr:\u00c9cole centrale de Bruxelles]] (previously the [[Old University of Leuven]]), where he studied [[linguistics]], philosophy and [[jurisprudence]], and especially mathematics and  music. A shared prize-winning cantata of his was performed in 1806.{{sfn|BLKO 14|1884|pp=142-3 [150-1]}}\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:337 Wildhaus, Schlo\u00df \u2014 Viltus, Slemen - J.F.Kaiser Lithografirte Ansichten der Steiermark 1830.jpg|thumb|Schlo\u00df Wildhaus, 1830 [[lithograph]] by [[Joseph Franz Kaiser|J.
