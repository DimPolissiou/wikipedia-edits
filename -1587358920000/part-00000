In the [[1994 NBA Playoffs]], the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the [[New York Knicks]], whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2\u20130 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philly]] |url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-05-14/sports/25830589_1_scottie-pippen-toni-kukoc-pete-myers|title=Pippen Sits This One Out Bulls' Leader Takes A Seat As Kukoc Hits Game-winner|date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> Although Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a {{convert|23|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[fadeaway|fadeaway jumper]] at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court.<ref>{{YouTube|id=6yjeBPPIp_8|title=Toni Kukoc beats NYK @ d buzzer (94Playoffs) -by SoleRecords}}</ref> \"Scottie asked out of the play,\" Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|work=Sports Illustrated|title=Pippen's Paradox|first=Jackie|last=MacMullan|access-date=June 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301162801/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|archive-date=March 1, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \n\nA key play occurred in the following Game 5 which changed the outcome of the series.

Midway in the third quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center [[Patrick Ewing]] jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several feet (some meters) away from the basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then [[Spike Lee]], who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93\u201379.\n\nIn the final Game 7, Pippen scored 20 points and grabbed a whopping 16 rebounds, but the Bulls still lost 87\u201377.<ref name=\"gameseven\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199405220NYK.html|title=Chicago Bulls at New York Knicks Box Score, May 22, 1994|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref> The Knicks then proceeded to the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they lost to the [[Houston Rockets]], also in seven games.\n\nTrade rumors involving Pippen escalated during the 1994 off-season.

The Pippen-led Bulls did not play as well in the {{nbay|1994}} season as they had in the season before. In fact, for the first time in years, they were in danger of missing the playoffs (though much of this may be due to a lack of interior defense and rebounding due to Grant's departure). The Bulls were just 34\u201331, prior to Jordan's return for the final 17 games, and Jordan led them to a 13\u20134 record to close the regular season.

He was skilled at staying in front of his man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with his long arms in traps. He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.\n\nOn offense, Pippen relied primarily on his remarkable athleticism to gain an advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots\u2014mid-range and three-pointers\u2014on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot over the course of his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketballnetwork.net/scottie-pippen-explains-how-he-developed-a-consistent-jump-shot-after-the-early-struggles-in-his-career-shooting-the-ball/|title=Scottie Pippen explains how he developed a consistent jump shot after the early struggles in his career shooting the ball|publisher=Basketball Network|date=October 6, 2019|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2019}}[[File:\u65d7.JPG|350x300px|thumbnail|right|Pippen's retired #33 jersey hangs in the rafters of the [[United Center]].]]Pippen is remembered as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow [[Chicago Bulls all-time roster|Chicago Bull]] [[Michael Jordan]], he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.\n\nHis unusually long arms ({{convert|88|in|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan)<ref name=\"SunTimes87\"/> and jumping agility helped him to clog the passing lanes on defense, to block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, to grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, to make unusual plays in mid-air, and to make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. Pippen was also a selfless player. His team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championships. Pippen's [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|career assists total]] of 6,135 (5.2 per game) is a testament to that approach. It was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired.\n\nHis intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points). During the [[Slam Dunk Contest#1990s|1990 Slam Dunk Contest]], Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and a skillful [[finger roll]] that he added to his skill set over time.

September 25, 1965), commonly spelled '''Scottie Pippen''', is an American former professional basketball player. He played 17 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), winning six [[NBA championship]]s with the [[Chicago Bulls]].

That year, he earned All-Star Game MVP honors and led the Bulls in scoring, assists, and blocks, and was second in the NBA in [[steal (basketball)|steals]] per game, averaging 22.0 points, 8.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 2.9 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game, while shooting 49.1% from the field and a career-best 32% from the [[three-point field goal|3-point]] line.

The Bulls (with key additions of Toni Kuko\u010d, Steve Kerr and Luc Longley) finished the season with 55 wins, only two fewer than the year before.\n\nHowever, one of the most controversial moments of Pippen's career came in his first year without Jordan. In the [[1994 NBA Playoffs]], the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the [[New York Knicks]], whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2\u20130 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philly]] |url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-05-14/sports/25830589_1_scottie-pippen-toni-kukoc-pete-myers|title=Pippen Sits This One Out Bulls' Leader Takes A Seat As Kukoc Hits Game-winner|date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> Although Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a {{convert|23|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[fadeaway|fadeaway jumper]] at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court.<ref>{{YouTube|id=6yjeBPPIp_8|title=Toni Kukoc beats NYK @ d buzzer (94Playoffs) -by SoleRecords}}</ref> \"Scottie asked out of the play,\" Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|work=Sports Illustrated|title=Pippen's Paradox|first=Jackie|last=MacMullan|access-date=June 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301162801/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|archive-date=March 1, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \n\nA key play occurred in the following Game 5 which changed the outcome of the series.

Midway in the third quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center [[Patrick Ewing]] jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several feet (some meters) away from the basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then [[Spike Lee]], who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93\u201379.\n\nIn the final Game 7, Pippen scored 20 points and grabbed a whopping 16 rebounds, but the Bulls still lost 87\u201377.<ref name=\"gameseven\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199405220NYK.html|title=Chicago Bulls at New York Knicks Box Score, May 22, 1994|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref> The Knicks then proceeded to the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they lost to the [[Houston Rockets]], also in seven games.\n\nTrade rumors involving Pippen escalated during the 1994 off-season. [[Jerry Krause]], the Bulls' general manager, was reportedly looking to ship Pippen off to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in exchange for all-star forward [[Shawn Kemp]], moving [[Toni Kuko\u010d]] into Pippen's position as starting small forward with Kemp filling in the vacant starting power forward position in place of Horace Grant, a free agent who left the Bulls for the up-and-coming [[Orlando Magic]] during the off-season.  In January, when asked by the late [[Craig Sager]] as to whether he thought that he would be traded, Pippen replied, \"I hope I am\".<ref name=\"bulls_1995\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLFqk2JZEhM|title=Scottie Pippen Hopes to Be Traded to Suns (1995)|work=youtube.com|publisher=NBA TV|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref> However, Pippen would remain a Bull and those rumors were put to rest once it was announced that Michael Jordan would be returning to the Bulls, late in the {{nbay|1994}} season. The Pippen-led Bulls did not play as well in the {{nbay|1994}} season as they had in the season before. In fact, for the first time in years, they were in danger of missing the playoffs (though much of this may be due to a lack of interior defense and rebounding due to Grant's departure). The Bulls were just 34\u201331, prior to Jordan's return for the final 17 games, and Jordan led them to a 13\u20134 record to close the regular season.

Phil Jackson once described him as a \"one-man wrecking crew\", capable of guarding anyone from the point guard to the center position.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/14/sports/let-us-now-praise-pippen.html|title=Let Us Now Praise Pippen|date=June 14, 1997|last=Araton|first=Harvey|work=NY Times}}</ref> Pippen is one of three NBA players to record 200 steals and 100 blocks in a season and he has the record for second most career steals in the playoffs (395) behind LeBron James.  He was skilled at staying in front of his man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with his long arms in traps. He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.\n\nOn offense, Pippen relied primarily on his remarkable athleticism to gain an advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots\u2014mid-range and three-pointers\u2014on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot over the course of his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketballnetwork.net/scottie-pippen-explains-how-he-developed-a-consistent-jump-shot-after-the-early-struggles-in-his-career-shooting-the-ball/|title=Scottie Pippen explains how he developed a consistent jump shot after the early struggles in his career shooting the ball|publisher=Basketball Network|date=October 6, 2019|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2019}}[[File:\u65d7.JPG|350x300px|thumbnail|right|Pippen's retired #33 jersey hangs in the rafters of the [[United Center]].]]Pippen is remembered as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow [[Chicago Bulls all-time roster|Chicago Bull]] [[Michael Jordan]], he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.\n\nHis unusually long arms ({{convert|88|in|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan)<ref name=\"SunTimes87\"/> and jumping agility helped him to clog the passing lanes on defense, to block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, to grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, to make unusual plays in mid-air, and to make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. Pippen was also a selfless player. His team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championships. Pippen's [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|career assists total]] of 6,135 (5.2 per game) is a testament to that approach. It was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired.\n\nHis intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points). During the [[Slam Dunk Contest#1990s|1990 Slam Dunk Contest]], Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and a skillful [[finger roll]] that he added to his skill set over time. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter for the time, taking about 3,000 and making almost 1,000 [[three-point field goal|three-pointers]] in his career.\n\nSeveral NBA players, including [[Jason Kidd]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html|title=Jason Kidd Would Take Scottie Pippen Over LeBron James in His All-Time Starting Five|first=Brian|last=Josephs|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=Jun 15, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> Michael Jordan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1849417-michael-jordan-dishes-on-his-starting-5-favorite-shoes-dunks-more|title=Michael Jordan Dishes on His Starting 5, Favorite Shoes, Dunks and More|first=Kenny|last=Dorset|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Nov 13, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> and [[Karl Malone]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1662152-karl-malone-leaves-mj-off-his-all-time-starting-5-admits-man-crush-on-lebron|title=Karl Malone Leaves MJ Off His All-Time Starting 5, Admits 'Man Crush' on LeBron|first=Zack|last=Buckley|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Jun 4, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> have placed Pippen in their all-time starting lineups.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Scottie Pippen and his wife on December 15, 2006.jpg|300x300px|thumbnail|left|Pippen and his wife Larsa attending a [[Chicago Bulls]] game in December 2006]]\nAlthough his given name is spelled ''Scotty'' on his birth certificate, Pippen usually goes by ''Scottie''.<ref name=smith_07301996/> He stated that people usually shorten the name to ''Scott'' if it ends in ''y''.<ref name=fussman_12162011/>\n\nPippen has been married twice: to Karen McCollum (married 1988; divorced 1990) with whom he has a son, Antron Pippen (born 1987),<ref name=\"SunTimes89\">{{cite news|title=Scottie Pippen|date=May 29, 1989|first=Lacy J.|last=Banks|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=11}}</ref> and to Larsa Younan (married 1997; divorced 2018), with whom he has four children, Scotty Pippen Jr. (born 2000), Preston Pippen (born 2002), Justin Pippen (born 2005), and Sophia Pippen (born 2008).

Though the music was heavier and more elaborate than the rest of the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce catalog, it did not sell as well as previous releases from the band. Before a concert in Tucson, Arizona which had a 15,000 seat capacity, only 4,000 tickets were sold, Nikki Sixx decided to call into a Tucson area radio station and offer any fan who showed up free tickets. When only two people took Sixx up on his offer, Sixx stated he knew this version of the band was finished.<ref>{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Andy |date=March 20, 2018 |title=Flashback: Motley Crue Perform 'Home Sweet Home' With John Corabi |publisher=Rolling Stone |website=rollingstone.com |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/motley-crue-sing-home-sweet-home-with-john-corabi-not-vince-neil-w518071 |access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> During the early stages of the writing of a new album which would become ''[[Generation Swine]]'', M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's record label refused to provide funds to record the album unless Vince Neil was let back in the band. Rather than hiring another label, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce acceded to the demand and by 1997, Corabi departed the band and Neil returned. Many of the songs from the early writing session were used on the album and Corabi is credited on the liner notes for co-writing some of the songs.\n\nCorabi and the rest of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce made personal appearances at London's [[Hard Rock Cafe]] at a private party in February 1994 promoting their self-titled ''M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce'' album. The evening was also attended by many M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce competition winners who were invited into the VIP area to chat to Corabi, as well as the other 3 band members.\n\nCorabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Corabi said: \"my record was the first record that they had done that didn't go platinum, didn't make some sort of crazy noise, and everybody panicked\".<ref>{{cite web |date=March 9, 2019 |title=How John Corabi saved M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce with their 1994 hard rock album that failed |url=https://www.rawmusictv.com/article/2019/How-John-Corabi-saved-Motley-Crue-with-their-1994-hard-rock-album-that-failed |accessdate=March 9, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Corabi and his band performed at a bar and played all of the songs off of the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album. Weeks after the performance, Corabi stated \"The album would have made it if this was under a different band name\".\n\n==Union==\nUnion was formed from recently released musician [[Bruce Kulick]] of Kiss, John Corabi, Brent Fitz, and Jamie Hunting. John and Bruce wrote what would become the first Union album (self titled) and proceeded with a nationwide acoustic tour, to promote the album, featuring just Corabi and Kulick (both on guitar). Soon the full band went on a world tour headlining small venues in support of the Union album. The second album \"Live in the Galaxy\" was a live recording with two acoustic tracks recorded in a mobile studio. The third and final Union album, The Blue Room, was a more polished sound than the first studio CD. Union never officially called it quits (playing live shows every so often with guest drummers and bass players), but with Kulick playing along with [[Grand Funk Railroad]], Corabi playing with many bands, most notably [[Ratt]], and both members being tied up in solo projects, Union will probably never return to write new studio material.\n\n==ESP (Eric Singer Project)==\nESP also featured guitarist [[Bruce Kulick]], bassist [[Karl Cochran]], and drummer [[Eric Singer]]. [[Ace Frehley]] makes a special appearance on the Hendrix cover ''Foxy Lady''.\n\n==Twenty 4 Seven==\nTwenty 4 Seven, a collaboration with Corabi, drummer [[Bobby Blotzer]] ([[Ratt]], Contraband), and guitarist [[Rob Marcello]] (Ironhorse, Obsession, [[Danger Danger]]) recorded 10 hard rock tracks entitled ''Destination Everywhere'' (US, 2002).\n\n==Cardboard Vampyres==\nIn early 2004, Corabi joined [[Jerry Cantrell]]'s covers band Cardboard Vampyres. Also in the band were [[The Cult]] guitarist [[Billy Duffy]], The Cult bassist [[Chris Wyse]] and drummer Josh Howser.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeckell |first=Barry A. |url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/6063/jerry-cantrell-forms-new-band-cardboard-vampyres/ |title=Jerry Cantrell Forms New Band \u2013 Cardboard Vampyres |website=Glide Magazine |date=June 18, 2004}}</ref> The band played at various venues in the United States between 2004 and 2005.

He had multiple reasons for leaving the band. One was the fact that he was told it would be an effort much like the \"M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\" album. Secondly, he did not get along very well with [[Tracii Guns]]. He also said in an interview that \"when Nikki told me about the band, I was really into the idea of writing another CD with the heavy sound of the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album, but as we got more into recording, we had our drummer singing what was supposed to be the best song on the CD, when Nikki and Tracii were saying that our singer was the hot new thing, it just did not make sense to me.\"\n\n==Other projects==\nCorabi performed songs on the [[Karl Cochran]] solo album ''Voodooland \u2013 Give Me Air'' released in 2005.\n\n2005 also saw the release of the first [[Union (band)|Union]] DVD, Do Your Own Thing Live, containing two full-length concerts.\n\nUnion performed in Tokyo, Japan in January 2005 and toured Europe in November and December 2005.\n\nCorabi toured Europe with ESP in May 2005 and the USA with RATT in summer of 2005.\n \nIn February 2006, Corabi returned to Japan with ESP for live appearances and meet-and-greets with fans. ESP also performed in Australia in April 2006 for shows in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nIn late 2006, Corabi played the last show with [[RATT]] fronted by [[Jizzy Pearl]] in [[Guadalajara, Mexico]] before the band reunited with original vocalist [[Stephen Pearcy]].\n\nCorabi contributed vocals on a song for Liberty N' Justice (a Christian group that does all-star rock albums) called \"Doubting Thomas.\" The track was released in 2007 on the \"Independence Day\" album.\n\nIn the Summer of 2007, Corabi toured with reunited RATT while on tour with [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Dokken]], and [[Vains of Jenna]].\n\nIn November 2007 Corabi played 4 shows in Japan and 2 shows in Australia with Ratt while touring with [[Winger (band)|Winger]].\n\nIn December 2007, Corabi returned to Mexico City with ESP (Eric Singer Project) for one show and meet-and-greets with fans. The set included songs from Motorhead, Led Zeppelin, Kiss and other favorites.\n\nEarly in 2008, Corabi attended the MOTLEY CRUISE, a 4-day cruise in the Caribbean ('''Miami, Key West and Cozumel''', MX) including performers such as [[Vince Neil]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], [[Ratt]], [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], [[Endeverafter]] and [[Lynam (band)|Lynam]]. On this cruise, Corabi joined [[Vince Neil]] on stage to perform \"Highway to Hell\" by [[AC/DC]]. This performance was a unique event as fans witnessed the two M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce vocalists share the same microphone. In August 2008, Corabi parted ways with Ratt in order to pursue his solo career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/95634 |title=RATT Working on New Material; Album Planned for Early 2009 |publisher=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\nCorabi makes a vocal appearance on Bruce Kulick's 2010 release \"BK3\". He covered \"Life\" by [[Siam Shade]] for the 2010 tribute album, ''[[Siam Shade Tribute]]''.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019, Corabi was the lead vocalist for the Australian/American rock band [[The Dead Daisies]].

Bassist [[Nikki Sixx]] and drummer [[Tommy Lee]] stated that Corabi was capable of singing anything and everything and that was the reason they chose him.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fielder Jr. |first=Gordon |date=August 20, 1994 |title=Motley Crue promises unique ending to BiCenter performance |publisher=Salina Journal |website=Newspapers.com |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19496902/motley_crue_promises_unique_performance/ |access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> Corabi recorded the self-titled ''[[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce (album)|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'' album in 1994 and the EP ''[[Quaternary (EP)|Quaternary]]''. Though the music was heavier and more elaborate than the rest of the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce catalog, it did not sell as well as previous releases from the band. Before a concert in Tucson, Arizona which had a 15,000 seat capacity, only 4,000 tickets were sold, Nikki Sixx decided to call into a Tucson area radio station and offer any fan who showed up free tickets. When only two people took Sixx up on his offer, Sixx stated he knew this version of the band was finished.<ref>{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Andy |date=March 20, 2018 |title=Flashback: Motley Crue Perform 'Home Sweet Home' With John Corabi |publisher=Rolling Stone |website=rollingstone.com |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/motley-crue-sing-home-sweet-home-with-john-corabi-not-vince-neil-w518071 |access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> During the early stages of the writing of a new album which would become ''[[Generation Swine]]'', M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's record label refused to provide funds to record the album unless Vince Neil was let back in the band. Rather than hiring another label, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce acceded to the demand and by 1997, Corabi departed the band and Neil returned. Many of the songs from the early writing session were used on the album and Corabi is credited on the liner notes for co-writing some of the songs.\n\nCorabi and the rest of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce made personal appearances at London's [[Hard Rock Cafe]] at a private party in February 1994 promoting their self-titled ''M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce'' album. The evening was also attended by many M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce competition winners who were invited into the VIP area to chat to Corabi, as well as the other 3 band members.\n\nCorabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Corabi said: \"my record was the first record that they had done that didn't go platinum, didn't make some sort of crazy noise, and everybody panicked\".<ref>{{cite web |date=March 9, 2019 |title=How John Corabi saved M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce with their 1994 hard rock album that failed |url=https://www.rawmusictv.com/article/2019/How-John-Corabi-saved-Motley-Crue-with-their-1994-hard-rock-album-that-failed |accessdate=March 9, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Corabi and his band performed at a bar and played all of the songs off of the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album. Weeks after the performance, Corabi stated \"The album would have made it if this was under a different band name\".\n\n==Union==\nUnion was formed from recently released musician [[Bruce Kulick]] of Kiss, John Corabi, Brent Fitz, and Jamie Hunting. John and Bruce wrote what would become the first Union album (self titled) and proceeded with a nationwide acoustic tour, to promote the album, featuring just Corabi and Kulick (both on guitar). Soon the full band went on a world tour headlining small venues in support of the Union album. The second album \"Live in the Galaxy\" was a live recording with 2 acoustic tracks recorded in a mobile studio. The third and final Union album, The Blue Room, was a more polished sound than the first studio CD. Union never officially called it quits (playing live shows every so often with guest drummers and bass players), but with Kulick playing along with [[Grand Funk Railroad]], Corabi playing with many bands, most notably [[Ratt]], and both members being tied up in solo projects, Union will probably never return to write new studio material.\n\n==ESP (Eric Singer Project)==\nESP also featured guitarist [[Bruce Kulick]], bassist [[Karl Cochran]], and drummer [[Eric Singer]]. [[Ace Frehley]] makes a special appearance on the Hendrix cover ''Foxy Lady''.\n\n==Twenty 4 Seven==\nTwenty 4 Seven, a collaboration with Corabi, drummer [[Bobby Blotzer]] ([[Ratt]], Contraband), and guitarist [[Rob Marcello]] (Ironhorse, Obsession, [[Danger Danger]]) recorded 10 hard rock tracks entitled ''Destination Everywhere'' (US, 2002).\n\n==Cardboard Vampyres==\nIn early 2004, Corabi joined [[Jerry Cantrell]]'s covers band Cardboard Vampyres. Also in the band were [[The Cult]] guitarist [[Billy Duffy]], The Cult bassist [[Chris Wyse]] and drummer Josh Howser.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeckell |first=Barry A. |url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/6063/jerry-cantrell-forms-new-band-cardboard-vampyres/ |title=Jerry Cantrell Forms New Band \u2013 Cardboard Vampyres |website=Glide Magazine |date=June 18, 2004}}</ref> The band played at various venues in the United States between 2004 and 2005.

He had multiple reasons for leaving the band. One was the fact that he was told it would be an effort much like the \"M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\" album. Secondly, he did not get along very well with [[Tracii Guns]]. He also said in an interview that \"when Nikki told me about the band, I was really into the idea of writing another CD with the heavy sound of the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album, but as we got more into recording, we had our drummer singing what was supposed to be the best song on the CD, when Nikki and Tracii were saying that our singer was the hot new thing, it just did not make sense to me.\"\n\n==Other projects==\nCorabi performed songs on the [[Karl Cochran]] solo album ''Voodooland \u2013 Give Me Air'' released in 2005.\n\n2005 also saw the release of the first [[Union (band)|Union]] DVD, Do Your Own Thing Live, containing two full-length concerts.\n\nUnion performed in Tokyo, Japan in January 2005 and toured Europe in November and December 2005.\n\nCorabi toured Europe with ESP in May 2005 and the USA with RATT in summer of 2005.\n \nIn February 2006, Corabi returned to Japan with ESP for live appearances and meet-and-greets with fans. ESP also performed in Australia in April 2006 for shows in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nIn late 2006, Corabi played the last show with [[RATT]] fronted by [[Jizzy Pearl]] in [[Guadalajara, Mexico]] before the band reunited with original vocalist [[Stephen Pearcy]].\n\nCorabi contributed vocals on a song for Liberty N' Justice (a Christian group that does all-star rock albums) called \"Doubting Thomas.\" The track was released in 2007 on the \"Independence Day\" album.\n\nIn the Summer of 2007, Corabi toured with reunited RATT while on tour with [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Dokken]], and [[Vains of Jenna]].\n\nIn November 2007 Corabi played 4 shows in Japan and 2 shows in Australia with Ratt while touring with [[Winger (band)|Winger]].\n\nIn December 2007, Corabi returned to Mexico City with ESP (Eric Singer Project) for one show and meet-and-greets with fans. The set included songs from Motorhead, Led Zeppelin, Kiss and other favorites.\n\nEarly in 2008, Corabi attended the MOTLEY CRUISE, a 4-day cruise in the Caribbean ('''Miami, Key West and Cozumel''', MX) including performers such as [[Vince Neil]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], [[Ratt]], [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], [[Endeverafter]] and [[Lynam (band)|Lynam]]. On this cruise, Corabi joined [[Vince Neil]] on stage to perform \"Highway to Hell\" by [[AC/DC]]. This performance was a unique event as fans witnessed the two M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce vocalists share the same microphone. In August 2008, Corabi parted ways with Ratt in order to pursue his solo career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/95634 |title=RATT Working on New Material; Album Planned for Early 2009 |publisher=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\nCorabi makes a vocal appearance on Bruce Kulick's 2010 release \"BK3\". He covered \"Life\" by [[Siam Shade]] for the 2010 tribute album, ''[[Siam Shade Tribute]]''.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019, Corabi was the lead vocalist for the Australian/American rock band [[The Dead Daisies]]. The band released an album, ''Burn it Down'' in 2018.\n\n==Discography==\n{{update|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Angora (band)|Angora]]'''\n* Six song demo tape\n\n'''[[The Scream (band)|The Scream]]'''\n*''[[Let It Scream]]'' (1991)\n\n'''[[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'''\n*''[[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce (album)|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'' (1994)\n*''[[Quaternary (EP)|Quaternary]]'' EP (1994)\n*''[[Generation Swine]]'' (1997) <small>writer, uncredited vocals</small>\n*''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce]] (2005)\n\n'''[[Eric Singer Project]]'''\n*''Lost and Spaced'' (1998)\n*''ESP'' (1999)\n*''Live in Japan'' (2007)\n*''ESP Live at the Marquee'' (2007)\n\n'''[[Union (band)|Union]]'''\n*''[[Union (Union album)|Union]]'' (1998)\n*''Live in the Galaxy'' (1999)\n*''[[The Blue Room (Album)|The Blue Room]]'' (2000)\n*''Do Your Own Thing Live Concert'' (2005)\n\n'''Twenty 4 Seven'''\n*''Destination Everywhere'' (2002)\n\n'''[[Brides of Destruction]]'''\n*''[[Here Come the Brides (album)|Here Comes the Brides]]'' (2004) <small>Uncredited guitar and writer</small>\n\n'''Voodooland'''\nAdvanced Ep (2003)\n*''Give Me Air'' (2004)\n\n'''Liberty N' Justice'''\n*''Doubting Thomas'' (2007)\n\n'''[[RATT]]'''\n*''[[Infestation (album)|Infestation]]'' (2010) <small>writer</small>\n\n'''John Corabi'''\n*''John Corabi Unplugged'' (November 2012)\n\n'''[[The Dead Daisies]]'''\n*''[[Revolucion (The Dead Daisies album)|Revoluci\u00f3n]]'' (2015)\n*''[[Make Some Noise (The Dead Daisies album)|Make Some Noise]]'' (2016)\n*''[[Burn It Down (The Dead Daisies album)]]'' (2018)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added above External links/Sources by script-assisted edit-->\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.johncorabimusic.com/home.cfm/ John Corabi's official website]\n*[http://www.ratpakrecordsamerica.com/johncorabi/ John Corabi Official Merchandise]\n\n*[https://www.facebook.com/JohnCorabiMusic/ John Corabi Official Facebook Page]\n\n{{The Dead Daisies}}\n{{Ratt}}\n{{M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce}}\n{{Union (band)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corabi, John}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American rock singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American rock guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce members]]\n[[Category:Ratt members]]\n[[Category:Eric Singer Project members]]\n[[Category:Union (band) members]]\n[[Category:The Scream (band) members]]\n[[Category:Singers from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:Brides of Destruction members]]\n", "name_user": "Koavf", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnion", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Corabi"}
