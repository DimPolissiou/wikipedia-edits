The day was also meant to celebrate individual [[health care provider|health workers]] \u2013 the people who provide health care to those who need it, in other words those at the heart of [[health system]]s.\n\nThe Day also marked the launch of the WHO's ''[[World Health Report|World Health Report 2006]]'', which focused on the same theme. The report contained an assessment of the current crisis in the global health workforce, revealing an estimated shortage of almost 4.3 million physicians, midwives, nurses and other [[health care provider]]s worldwide, and further proposed a series of actions for countries and the international community to tackle it.<ref>''The world health report 2006: working together for health'', Geneva, [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 World Health Organization, 2006]</ref>\n\n# The World Health\n\n===2008: Protecting health from the adverse effects of climate change===\nIn 2008, World Health Day focused on the need to protect health from the adverse effects of [[climate change]] and establish links between climate change and health and other development areas such as environment, food, energy, transport.\n\nThe theme \"protecting health from climate change\" put health at the centre of the global dialogue about climate change. WHO selected this theme in recognition that climate change is posing ever growing threats to global public health security.<ref>World Health Organization:[http://www.who.int/world-health-day/previous/2008/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2008'']</ref>\n\n===2009: Save lives. Make hospitals safe in emergencies===\n[[File:Hartford Hospital main entrance.JPG|thumb|Hospital in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]]]\n\nWorld Health Day 2009 focused on the safety of [[health care provider|health facilities]] and the readiness of health workers who treat those affected by emergencies. Health centres and staff are critical lifelines for vulnerable people in disasters \u2013 treating [[trauma (medicine)|injuries]], preventing illnesses and caring for people's health needs. Often, already fragile health systems are unable to keep functioning through a disaster, with immediate and future public health consequences.\n\nFor this year's World Health Day campaign, WHO and international partners underscored the importance of investing in health infrastructure that can withstand hazards and serve people in immediate need, and urged health facilities to implement systems to respond to internal emergencies, such as fires, and ensure the continuity of care.\n\n===2010: Urbanization and health===\nWith the campaign \"1000 cities, 1000 lives\", events were organized worldwide during the week starting 7 April 2010. The global goals of the campaign were:<ref>World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/world-health-day/2010/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2010'']</ref>\n* ''1000 cities'': to open up public spaces to health, whether it be activities in parks, town hall meetings, clean-up campaigns, or closing off portions of streets to motorized vehicles.\n* ''1000 lives'': to collect 1000 stories of urban health champions who have taken action and had a significant impact on health in their cities.\n\n===2011: Antimicrobial Resistance===\nThe theme of World Health Day 2011, marked on 7 April 2011, was \"[[Antimicrobial resistance]] and its global spread\" and focused on the need for governments and stakeholders to implement the policies and practices needed to prevent and counter the emergence of highly resistant [[microorganism]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4616&Itemid=3611&lang=en|title=World Health Day 2011 {{!}} PAHO WHO|last=Mitchell|first=Cristina|work=Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization|access-date=15 December 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[infection]]s caused by resistant microorganisms fail to respond to standard treatments, including [[antibacterial|antibiotics]] and other [[anti-microbial|antimicrobial]] medicines \u2013 also known as [[Multiple drug resistance|drug resistance]] \u2013 this may result in prolonged illness and greater risk of death.\n\nOn World Health Day 2011, WHO called for intensified global commitment to safeguard antimicrobial medicines for future generations.

Life expectancy is going up in most countries, meaning more and more people live longer and enter an age when they may need [[health care]]. Meanwhile, birth rates are generally falling. Countries and health care systems need to find innovative and sustainable ways to cope with the demographic shift. As stated by John Beard, director of the WHO Department of Ageing and Life Course, \"With the rapid ageing of populations, finding the right model for [[long-term care]] becomes more and more urgent.\"<ref>[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/1/12-020112.pdf \"Defusing the demographic \u201ctime-bomb\u201d in Germany.\"] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2012;90:6\u20137.</ref>\n\nDifferent activities were organized by WHO as well as non-governmental and community organizations around the world to mark World Health Day 2012.<ref>World Health Organization.

Mosquitoes, for example, transmit [[malaria]] \u2013 the most deadly vector-borne disease, causing an estimated 660 000 deaths annually worldwide \u2013 as well as [[dengue fever]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], [[chikungunya]], [[Japanese encephalitis]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2014/event/en/index.html World Health Organization, \"World Health Day \u2013 17 April 2014.\"]</ref> More than half of the world\u2019s population is at risk of these diseases.\n\nThe goal of the World Health Day 2014 campaign was better protection from vector-borne diseases, especially for families living in areas where diseases are transmitted by vectors, and travelers to countries where they pose a health threat.

The Wake Forest study found 99.75% of suspects who had been subjected to TASER device use had no significant injuries.\n\nUse of TASER conducted energy weapons by the [[Seattle Police Department]], one of the largest police forces in the [[Northwestern United States]], has been shown to reduce the odds of suspect injury by 48%. Data gathered from other agencies confirms a decline in suspect injuries due to TASER device deployment. In [[Orlando, Florida]] and [[Austin, Texas]], studies found that suspect injuries were 50% and 30% lower respectively after TASER device use was adopted. Officer injuries have been impacted by TASER device use as well. The same studies found that in most agencies officer injuries were greatly reduced after TASER conducted energy weapons were introduced as part of each particular organizations use of force continuum.\n\nAlthough more recent studies have uncovered vast amounts of data that supports the positive benefits of TASER device usage in law enforcement, there is also data that suggests TASER device usage has negatively impacted some individual police officers as well. The study conducted in 2010 by the United States Department of Justice found that some officers may rely too heavily upon activating (deploying) a TASER device during suspect encounters. The study refers to this negative trait in some police officers as \"lazy cop\" syndrome. Further research is being conducted to determine what triggers some officers to rely too heavily upon TASER device use or deploy a TASER device too early in an encounter.\n\n[[File:North Dakota National Guard.jpg|thumb|Controlled taser demonstration by the North Dakota Air National Guard.

In 2004, the parents of a 6-year-old boy in [[Miami]] sued the police department for firing a TASER device at their child. The police said the boy was threatening to injure his own leg with a shard of glass, and said that using the device was the safest option to prevent the boy from injuring himself. Nevertheless, the boy's mother told [[CNN]] that the three officers involved probably found it easier not to reason with her child. Also in 2004, a 12-year-old girl skipping school and drinking alcohol was tased in [[Miami-Dade]] while she was running from police and started to run into traffic. The TASER device was successfully deployed to stop her from being hit by cars or causing an automobile accident.<ref>[[CNN]], Susan Candiotti, contributor.

The study was conducted by the [[United States Department of Justice]]. Just as the number of agencies deploying TASERs has continued to increase each year, so too the number of TASER related \"incidents\" between law enforcement officers and suspects has been on the rise.\n\nAlthough there has been a history of controversy regarding the ethical use of TASERs, studies similar to the one conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice have shown TASER use actually provides many positive benefits to police officers and even to the suspects they encounter. A study of the [[Houston Police Department]] found the number of workers comp claims by officers has declined by as much as 93% due to deploying TASERs as a means of non lethal force. Suspect injuries have also been impacted by TASER use, trimming the percentage of suspect injuries by as much as 60%. Another study conducted in 2009 by [[Wake Forest University]] confirmed data from the Houston study. The Wake Forest study found 99.75% of suspects who had been subjected to TASER use had no significant injuries.\n\nUse of TASERs by the [[Seattle Police Department]], one of the largest police forces in the [[Northwestern United States]], has been shown to reduce the odds of suspect injury by 48%. Data gathered from other agencies confirms a decline in suspect injuries due to TASER deployment. In [[Orlando, Florida]] and [[Austin, Texas]], studies found that suspect injuries were 50% and 30% lower respectively after TASER use was adopted. Officer injuries have been impacted by TASER use as well. The same studies found that in most agencies officer injuries were greatly reduced after TASERs were introduced as part of each particular organizations use of force continuum.\n\nAlthough more recent studies have uncovered vast amounts of data that supports the positive benefits of TASER usage in law enforcement, there is also data that suggests TASER usage has negatively impacted some individual police officers as well. The study conducted in 2010 by the United States Department of Justice found that some officers may rely too heavily upon activating (deploying) a TASER during suspect encounters. The study refers to this negative trait in some police officers as \"lazy cop\" syndrome. Further research is being conducted to determine what triggers some officers to rely too heavily upon TASER use or deploy a TASER too early in an encounter.\n\n[[File:North Dakota National Guard.jpg|thumb|Controlled taser demonstration by the North Dakota Air National Guard.

Instead, ExDS is a potentially fatal disease in which all forms of physiologic stress, from physical and noxious chemical to electrical conductive weapons (commonly called Tasers), can tip the balance of a condition on the edge of being fatal. It recognizes that some form of the use of force is often necessary to control agitation in the face of delirium, but that it should be the minimal amount necessary to achieve patient control and ensure public safety, and be followed immediately by medical intervention.}}</ref>\n\n== Use in schools and on children ==\nThere has been considerable controversy over the use of tasers on children and in schools. In 2004, the parents of a 6-year-old boy in [[Miami]] sued the police department for firing a TASER at their child. The police said the boy was threatening to injure his own leg with a shard of glass, and said that using the device was the safest option to prevent the boy from injuring himself. Nevertheless, the boy's mother told [[CNN]] that the three officers involved probably found it easier not to reason with her child. Also in 2004, a 12-year-old girl skipping school and drinking alcohol was tased in [[Miami-Dade]] while she was running from police and started to run into traffic. The TASER was successfully deployed to stop her from being hit by cars or causing an automobile accident.<ref>[[CNN]], Susan Candiotti, contributor.

People don't understand how experimental ''Show Boat'' and ''Oklahoma!'' felt at the time they were done. Oscar is not about the 'lark that is learning to pray' \u2013 that's easy to make fun of.

As recent revivals of ''Show Boat'', ''Oklahoma!'', ''Carousel'', and ''The King and I'' in London and New York show, Hammerstein was one of the more tough-minded and socially conscious American musical theater artists. According to Richard Kislan, \"The shows of Rodgers and Hammerstein were the product of sincerity. In the light of criticism directed against them and their universe of sweetness and light, it is important to understand that they believed sincerely in what they wrote.\"<ref>{{harv|Kislan|1995|p=141}}</ref>  According to Marc Bauch, \"The Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals are romantic musical plays.

From 8:57 to 9:00 p.m., every neon sign and every light bulb was turned off and all traffic was halted between 42nd Street and 53rd Street, and between 8th Ave and the Avenue of the Americas.  A crowd of 5,000 people, many with heads bowed, assembled at the base of the statue of Father Duffy on Times Square where two trumpeters blew taps.
