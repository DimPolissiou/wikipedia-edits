In preparation for the expansion of Eastlake's student body, a new wing (E wing) and gym was built during the summer of 2012. This shift of grades between schools subsequently also resulted in the moving of most 6th Grade classes from the Elementary schools to the now Middle Schools.\n\n==Academics==\nHigh school schedules typically consist of seven 50-minute periods. Eastlake offers an alternative method. Four days a week, students have 3 or 4 classes that last 90 minutes. On Mondays, the students attend each of their seven classes. This schedule allows students time to process information and reflect on their learning. It also allows teachers to plan lessons and labs that require extended periods of time and focus on complexity and depth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ehs.lwsd.org/academics|title=Academics - Eastlake High School|website=ehs.lwsd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>This is known as [[Block scheduling]].\n\nEastlake offers honors and [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement (AP)]] academic programs to prepare students for upper division and college level courses.

There are two different accounts of this founding.<ref name=\"lcafounding\">{{cite|url=https://www.lambdachi.org/aboutlca-2/history-2/|title=Our Founding|publisher=Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity}}</ref>\n\nThe official story adopted by Warren A. Cole and Albert Cross is that on November 2, 1909, Cole, Percival C. Morse, and Clyde K. Nichols reorganized the Cosmopolitan Law Club, a society of law students of Boston University, into the Loyal Collegiate Associates which was renamed in 1912 to Lambda Chi Alpha.<ref name=\"founders\">{{cite|url=https://www.lambdachi.cc/lambda-chi-alpha-history-in-the-making-founding-the-fraternity/|title=Our Story: A History of the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity|first=Michael J|last=Raymond|year=2017 }}</ref> All were close friends and had been members of Alpha Mu Chi, a [[College-preparatory school|prep school]] fraternity. The Greek letter name is thought{{by whom|date=June 2018}} to have been used from the beginning, but is not recorded in the Alpha Zeta minutes until April 27, 1910.<ref name=\"lcafounding\" />\n\nA second account of the founding, based on interviews with contemporaries, relates that Cole and others did belong to a loose group known as the Tombs or Cosmopolitan Club, but this was not related to the founding of Lambda Chi Alpha. Cole shared an apartment with James C. McDonald and Charles W. Proctor, who later joined [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]. Cole established his own fraternity with Ralph S. Miles, Harold W. Bridge, Percival C. Morse on November 23, 1911. The group issued a charter for itself back-dated to November 15.<ref name=\"lcafounding\" />\n\nCole approached many local groups at colleges and universities throughout the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] looking for others willing to join his new fraternity. He had corresponded with or visited 117 institutions by the time a group at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|Massachusetts Agricultural College]] accepted a charter to become Gamma Zeta, in 1912.<ref>[http://lambdachi.org/fraternity/history/tfolca.asp Lambda Chi Alpha History Timeline: The Founding of Lambda Chi Alpha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928134454/http://lambdachi.org/fraternity/history/tfolca.asp |date=2007-09-28 }}</ref> The first General Assembly, laying down a structure for a national fraternity, was held in Boston on April 13, 1912.\n\nThe fraternity held its second general assembly in Boston on March 22, 1913. There the organization adopted its secret motto, ritual insignia including the badge and coat of arms, and the basic organization; it virtually replaced the fraternity Cole had established outside of its name.<ref name=\"foundersday\">{{cite|url=https://www.lambdachi.cc/happy-founders-day/|title=Happy Founders Day|first=Kyle|last=Jones|work=Cross & Crescent|date=March 2007}}</ref> The 14th General Assembly, in 1931, recognized March 22 as Lambda Chi Alpha Day, in recognition of these achievements. In 1942, the board of directors renamed it Founder's Day.  November 2, 1909 is also still recognized, so Lambda Chi Alpha celebrates two Founders Days each year.<ref name=\"foundersday\" />\n\nIn the years that followed, a divide opened between Cole and a group of young alumni led by Mason, Ernst J.C. Fischer of the [[Cornell University]] chapter, and Samuel Dyer of the [[University of Maine]] chapter, the latter supported by Albert Cross of the University of Pennsylvania chapter and Louis Robbins of the [[Brown University]] chapter.<ref name=\"foundersday\" /> In 1920, Cole was ousted and Fischer was elected national president.

Associate Members within Lambda Chi Alpha to this day have all of the same rights as initiated brothers, can hold officer positions, wear the letters, and can vote on all issues except for those involving the Initiation Ritual. This status as an Associate Member allows new members to enter the fraternity with respect, and helps to combat the issues that arise from the abuse of \"pledges.\" Lambda Chi Alpha was the first fraternal organization to abolish pledging. \"Pledge implies a second-class membership, indentured servitude, [[hazing]], class officers, and extensive memorization.

Unlike most fraternities, the order in which chapters are named is not strictly based on the [[Greek Alphabet]]. Instead, chapters of Lambda Chi Alpha are known as \"Zetas\". Thus, the Alpha-Beta chapter is designated Alpha-Beta Zeta. In addition, at the fraternity's inception, Cole assigned Greek letters to petitioning groups that had not yet been chartered. Not all of these groups were chartered, as a result, the first twenty-two chapters were designated \u0391, \u0393, \u0395, \u0396, \u0399, \u039b, \u0392, \u03a3, \u03a6, \u0394, \u03a0, \u039f, \u039c, \u03a4, \u0397, \u0398, \u03a5, \u039e, \u03a7, \u03a9, \u039a, \u039d, \u03a1, \u03a8. After the twenty-fourth chapter, the sequence was continued with a prefix following the same sequence (\u0391-\u0391, \u0391-\u0393, \u0391-\u0395, ... \u0393-\u0391, \u0393-\u0393, \u0393-\u0395, ... \u0395-A, etc.)\n\nWhen [[Theta Kappa Nu]] merged with Lambda Chi Alpha in 1939, the former Theta Kappa Nu chapters were all given chapter designations prefixed with \u0398, \u039a, or \u039d. The second letter of their chapter name was assigned in the order mentioned above and applied to the chapters in order of their precedence in Theta Kappa Nu. On campuses with chapters of both Lambda Chi Alpha and Theta Kappa Nu, the chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha kept its original designation.\n\n{{anchor|Beta_Kappa}}\nA singular exception, the chapter at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], \u0392-\u039a Zeta, was named in recognition of its existence as a chapter of the national fraternity [[Beta Kappa]], whose other existing chapters merged with [[Theta Chi]] in 1942.<ref>[http://www.lambdachi.org/collegiate/resources/files/Ritual_What_and_Why.pdf Leonard, Edward F., George W.

This status as an Associate Member allows new members to enter the fraternity with respect, and helps to combat the issues that arise from the abuse of \"pledges.\" Lambda Chi Alpha was the first fraternal organization to abolish pledging. \"Pledge implies a second-class membership, indentured servitude, [[hazing]], class officers, and extensive memorization.

Unlike most fraternities, the order in which chapters are named is not strictly based on the [[Greek Alphabet]]. Instead, chapters of Lambda Chi Alpha are known as \"Zetas\". Thus, the Alpha-Beta chapter is designated Alpha-Beta Zeta. In addition, at the fraternity's inception, Cole assigned Greek letters to petitioning groups that had not yet been chartered. Not all of these groups were chartered, as a result, the first twenty-two chapters were designated \u0391, \u0393, \u0395, \u0396, \u0399, \u039b, \u0392, \u03a3, \u03a6, \u0394, \u03a0, \u039f, \u039c, \u03a4, \u0397, \u0398, \u03a5, \u039e, \u03a7, \u03a9, \u039a, \u039d, \u03a1, \u03a8. After the twenty-fourth chapter, the sequence was continued with a prefix following the same sequence (\u0391-\u0391, \u0391-\u0393, \u0391-\u0395, ... \u0393-\u0391, \u0393-\u0393, \u0393-\u0395, ... \u0395-A, etc.)\n\nWhen [[Theta Kappa Nu]] merged with Lambda Chi Alpha in 1939, the former Theta Kappa Nu chapters were all given chapter designations prefixed with \u0398, \u039a, or \u039d. The second letter of their chapter name was assigned in the order mentioned above and applied to the chapters in order of their precedence in Theta Kappa Nu. On campuses with chapters of both Lambda Chi Alpha and Theta Kappa Nu, the chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha kept its original designation.\n\n{{anchor|Beta_Kappa}}\nA singular exception, the chapter at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], \u0392-\u039a Zeta, was named in recognition of its existence as a chapter of the national fraternity [[Beta Kappa]], whose other existing chapters merged with [[Theta Chi]] in 1942.<ref>[http://www.lambdachi.org/collegiate/resources/files/Ritual_What_and_Why.pdf Leonard, Edward F., George W.

ISDS is an instrument of [[public international law]], and it contains a number of [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]], in certain international [[trade treaty|trade treaties]], such as the [[USMCA]].\nA version of it also appeared in the older [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] (chapter 11), and the [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership|CPTPP]] (through incorporation of [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPP]] chapter 9) and [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]] (sections 3 and 4) agreements.\nISDS is also found in [[international investment agreement]]s, such as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]]. If an investor from one country (the \"home state\") invests in another country (the \"host state\"), both of which have agreed to ISDS, and the host state violates the rights granted to the investor under the treaty, then that investor may bring the matter before an [[arbitral tribunal]].\n\nWhile ISDS is often associated with [[international arbitration]] under the rules of ICSID (the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] of the [[World Bank]]), it often takes place under international arbitral tribunals governed by different rules or institutions, such as the [[London Court of International Arbitration]] (LCIA), the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC), the [[Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre]] (HKIA), or the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]] Arbitration Rules.\n\n== Foreign investment protection ==\n=== Historical development ===\nUnder [[customary international law]], an investor state can vindicate injury caused by the host state by exercising [[diplomatic protection]], which may include [[retorsion]] and/or [[reprisals]]. In addition to diplomatic protection, states can and do establish ''[[ad hoc]]'' commissions and [[arbitral tribunal]]s to adjudicate claims involving treatment of foreign nationals and their property by the host state (\"state-state-dispute-settlement\", SSDS), which can help avoid coercive resolutions. Notable examples of this practice are the [[Jay Treaty]] commissions, the [[Iran\u2013United States Claims Tribunal]] and the [[American-Mexican Claims Commission]].<ref name=\"NewcombeParadell\" /> However, these treaties were limited to the treatment of foreign investors during a past period of time, whereas modern ISDS allows investors to make claims against states in general and on a prospective basis.\n\n=== Modern practice ===\nCurrently, the legal protection of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] under [[public international law]] is guaranteed by a network of more than 2,750 [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]] (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] and number of Free Trade Agreements such as [[NAFTA]] containing a chapter on investment protection. Most of these treaties were signed in the late 1980s and early 1990s before the current explosion of investor claims under the treaties began in the late 1990s.\n\nThe majority of the treaties provides foreign investors with substantive legal protection (including the right to \"fair and equitable treatment\", \"full protection and security\", \"free transfer of means\" and the right not to be directly or indirectly expropriated without full compensation) and access to ISDS for redress against host states for breaches of such protection. Some of these standards are framed in vague terms, given extensive discretion to arbitrators in their interpretation and application. The overall number of known cases reached over 500 in 2012. Of these, 244 were concluded, of which approximately 42% were decided in favor of the host state and approximately 31% in favor of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled out of court.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf |title=Recent Developments in Investor-State Disputes |publisher=Unctad.org |accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:NAFTA logo.png|right|150px|thumb|Chapter 11 of [[NAFTA]] includes an Investor-State provision.]]\n\nNotably, only foreign investors can sue states under investment treaties, because states are the parties to the treaty, and only states can be held liable to pay damages for breach of the treaty. States have no corresponding right to bring an original claim against a foreign investor under the treaties, again because investors are not parties to the treaty and therefore cannot be in breach of it. Thus, a decision in favor of the state means that the state has not been ordered to pay compensation, not that it received any compensation from the investor (although costs can be awarded against the investor). A state cannot \"win\" in ISDS in the manner of a foreign investor - a state which wishes to sue a foreign investor does so through its own domestic courts, without the need for a treaty.\n\nISDS cannot overturn local laws (unlike the [[World Trade Organization]]) which violate trade agreements,<ref name=\":232\">{{cite web |url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral |title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE |website=piie.com |access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":273\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e |title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=International Bar Association |access-date= }}</ref> but can grant monetary damages to investors adversely affected by such laws.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid |title=The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries |date=10 June 2015 |publisher=The Guardian |author=Claire Provost and Matt Kennard |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> According to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], ISDS requires specific treaty violations and does not allow corporations to sue solely for \"lost profits\".<ref name=\":152\">{{cite web |url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers |title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative |website=ustr.gov |access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> However, violations may be difficult to foresee, and the threat of exorbitant fines may cause a [[chilling effect]] which halts regulation or legislation in the public interest (e.g. human health and environmental protection).<ref name=\"SCint\">{{cite book |title=Shadow courts: the tribunals that rule global trade |last=Sweetland |first=Edwards, Haley |publisher=Colombia Global Reports |year=2016 |isbn=9780997126402 |location= |pages=Chapter: Introduction |oclc=933590566}}</ref> Critics also state that treaties are written so that any legislation causing lost profits is by definition a treaty violation, rendering the argument null that only treaty violations are subject to ISDS.<ref name=\"SCint\"/>\n\n==== NAFTA Chapter 11 ====\n{{main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}\nA notable example of ISDS, which has been in existence for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international [[arbitral tribunal]]. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the 'local remedies' rule, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several steps of local remedies. On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the customary duty to exhaust local remedies, where reasonably available, may have been a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid-2000s.\n\nInvestors may initiate an arbitration against the NAFTA Party under the Arbitration Rules of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] (\"UNCITRAL Rules\") or under the Rules of the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (\"ICSID Rules\"). NAFTA Chapter 11 was the first instance of an ISDS provision receiving widespread public attention, especially in the United States in the wake of the [[Methanex]] case.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/c5818.htm |title=Methanex Corp. v.

While some research (Olofsdotter, 1998; Reisen and Soto, 2001) finds a positive impact on developing countries, other authors (Mencinger, 2003; Carkovic and Levine, 2005; Johnson, 2006; T\u00fcrkcan, Duman, and Yetkiner, 2008; Herzer, 2012) find a negative impact, and some (De Mello, 1999) find the data to be inconclusive. A fourth conclusion was proposed by others (Alfaro et al., 2004; Li and Liu, 2005; Batten and Vo, 2009): FDI may have a positive or negative impact on the GDP of developing economies depending on the existence of adequate policies to \"filter\" speculative or predatory investment. Thus, opponents of ISDS warn that these systems may harm the government's ability to filter FDI more favorable to development, and therefore harm GDP <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.isdscorporateattacks.org/ |title=Corporate Attacks on Our Laws {{!}} Public Citizen |website=isdscorporateattacks.org/ |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>.

Because governments may not use the ISDS system to sue investors, if arbitrators have any bias toward companies of investors, they will encourage further claims and be personally benefited by that increase. The vague terms of most BITs ease this kind of \"drift\" on the interpretation of treaties by arbitrators <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tni.org/files/download/profitingfrominjustice.pdf |title=Profiting from injustice {{!}} TNI  |website=tni.org |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>. This drift, fueled by the conflict of interest in the core of the system (that need not assume any lack of integrity on a personal level on the arbitrators side, but solely the cognitive difficulty in overcoming a bias when one's personal interest is at stake) may help explain the explosive growth on the number of known ISDS cases in the last few decades.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/investment-dispute-settlement |title=Investment Dispute Settlement Navigator {{!}} UNCTAD  |website=investmentpolicy.unctad.org/ |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Transparency ===\n\nOpponents of ISDS argue that arbitrations are sometimes carried out in secret by trade lawyers who do not enjoy the typical safeguards of judicial independence and procedural fairness, who earn income only if a case is brought and proceeds, and who are not accountable to the public or required to take into account broader constitutional and international law human rights norms.<ref>[http://justinvestment.org/2011/05/oecd-document-discusses-investor-state-dispute-settlement/ Van Harten, Gus. \"OECD Document Discusses Investor State Dispute Settlement\".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104082333/http://justinvestment.org/2011/05/oecd-document-discusses-investor-state-dispute-settlement/ |date=4 January 2019 }} Accessed: 7 July 2011.</ref> The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] agrees \"that secrecy has gone too far\" in many ISDS cases, but notes that agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership did ensure greater transparency in ISDS.<ref name=\":232\" /> Proponents of ISDS point out that confidentiality is a standard feature of all [[arbitration]] and one that enables a constructive, de-politicized and fact-oriented atmosphere of dispute resolution. On the other hand, such traditional confidentiality is limited to disputes that affect the parties in question and not the broader public. Also, most ICSID awards, although confidential, are de facto published by consent of the parties. However, many awards under other arbitration rules are not public and, in the case of investor-arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce, there is a requirement for blanket confidentiality for all aspects of a case.\n\nIt is further pointed out that judges are not elected in most countries outside the US, so that \"public accountability of judges\" may not be considered a standard of [[public international law]]. In any event, they say, the qualification of ISDS arbitrators matches or exceeds the qualification of most court judges.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In response, critics make the point that any judge, whether domestic or international, who is part of a legal system not shown to be systematically biased or unreliable, has a greater claim to independence than an arbitrator because they are insulated from conflicts of interest that arise when arbitrators work on the side as lawyers, and is assigned cases in an objective manner rather than by the discretion of a disputing party or an executive official. Arbitrators are appointed by both parties at dispute, so such conflicts of interest may arise on both sides.\n\nWhile ISDS has traditionally been confidential as any other [[arbitration]], the general trend in the last decade has been to allow for more openness and transparency. On the other hand, there is still widespread confidentiality in the system.\n\nUnder Art. 29 of the U.S. Model-BIT of 2004, all documents pertaining to ISDS have to be made public and [[amicus curiae]] briefs are allowed. However, no investment treaty allows other parties who have an interest in the dispute, other than the claimant investor and respondent government, to obtain [[standing (law)|standing]] in the adjudicative process.\n\nUnder the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]], the tribunals shall, subject to the consent of the disputing parties, conduct hearings open to the public. The tribunal will make available to the public documents relating to the dispute such as the notice of intent, the notice of arbitration, pleadings, memorials, minutes or transcripts of the hearings of the tribunal, where available; orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal. In addition, third parties can and increasingly do participate in investor-state arbitration by submitting ''[[amicus curiae]]'' petitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partF-chap04.htm#r37 |title=ICSID, Arbitration Rules |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) is required by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22 to make public, information on the registration of all requests for arbitration and to indicate in due course the date and method of the termination of each proceeding.

As in most [[arbitration]]s, one is appointed by the investor, one by the state, and the third is usually chosen by agreement between the parties or their appointed arbitrators or selected by the appointing authority, depending on the procedural rules applicable to the dispute. If the parties do not agree who to appoint, this power is assigned to executive officials usually at the World Bank, the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, or a private chamber of commerce.\n\nOther individuals cannot initiate a claim against a state under an investment treaty. Also, no individual or state can initiate a claim against a foreign investor under an investment treaty. This has led to criticisms that investor-state arbitration is not balanced and that it favours the \"haves\" over the \"have nots\" by giving foreign investors, especially major companies, access to a special tribunal outside any court. While the arbitration process itself does not provide explicitly privileged access for larger investors over individuals or SMEs, the costs of ISDS, as in any court or arbitration system, tend to be off-putting for smaller claimants.\n\n== Examples ==\nAccording to a 2011 paper, \"In terms of wins and losses, [the] U.S. has never lost a case as the respondent country.

The state position was that as owned by a Kazakh national the claimant was not eligible for investment protection under the Dutch-Kazakh BIT. This argument was dismissed by the Arbitrage. The Kazakh state then alleged that it didn\u2019t nationalize the bank, but it bailed it out (wiping out the shares\u2019 value in the process).

The Government has not and will not accept provisions that limit its capacity to put health warnings or plain packaging requirements on tobacco products or its ability to continue the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme... In the past, Australian Governments have sought the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements with developing countries at the behest of Australian businesses. The Gillard Government will discontinue this practice. If Australian businesses are concerned about sovereign risk in Australian trading partner countries, they will need to make their own assessments about whether they want to commit to investing in those countries...

ISDS is an instrument of [[public international law]], and it contains a number of [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]], in certain international [[trade treaty|trade treaties]], such as the [[USMCA]].\nA version of it also appeared in the older [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] (chapter 11), and the [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership|CPTPP]] (through incorporation of [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPP]] chapter 9) and [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]] (sections 3 and 4) agreements.\nISDS is also found in [[international investment agreement]]s, such as the [[Energy Charter Treaty]]. If an investor from one country (the \"home state\") invests in another country (the \"host state\"), both of which have agreed to ISDS, and the host state violates the rights granted to the investor under the treaty, then that investor may bring the matter before an [[arbitral tribunal]].\n\nWhile ISDS is often associated with [[international arbitration]] under the rules of ICSID (the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] of the [[World Bank]]), it often takes place under international arbitral tribunals governed by different rules or institutions, such as the [[London Court of International Arbitration]] (LCIA), the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC), the [[Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre]] (HKIA), or the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]] Arbitration Rules.\n\n== Foreign investment protection ==\n=== Historical development ===\nUnder [[customary international law]], an investor state can vindicate injury caused by the host state by exercising [[diplomatic protection]], which may include [[retorsion]] and/or [[reprisals]]. In addition to diplomatic protection, states can and do establish ''[[ad hoc]]'' commissions and [[arbitral tribunal]]s to adjudicate claims involving treatment of foreign nationals and their property by the host state (\"state-state-dispute-settlement\", SSDS), which can help avoid coercive resolutions. Notable examples of this practice are the [[Jay Treaty]] commissions, the [[Iran\u2013United States Claims Tribunal]] and the [[American-Mexican Claims Commission]].<ref name=\"NewcombeParadell\" /> However, these treaties were limited to the treatment of foreign investors during a past period of time, whereas modern ISDS allows investors to make claims against states in general and on a prospective basis.\n\n=== Modern practice ===\nCurrently, the legal protection of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] under [[public international law]] is guaranteed by a network of more than 2,750 [[Bilateral Investment Treaty|bilateral investment treaties]] (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the [[Energy Charter Treaty]] and number of Free Trade Agreements such as [[NAFTA]] containing a chapter on investment protection. Most of these treaties were signed in the late 1980s and early 1990s before the current explosion of investor claims under the treaties began in the late 1990s.\n\nThe majority of the treaties provides foreign investors with substantive legal protection (including the right to \"fair and equitable treatment\", \"full protection and security\", \"free transfer of means\" and the right not to be directly or indirectly expropriated without full compensation) and access to ISDS for redress against host states for breaches of such protection. Some of these standards are framed in vague terms, given extensive discretion to arbitrators in their interpretation and application. The overall number of known cases reached over 500 in 2012. Of these, 244 were concluded, of which approximately 42% were decided in favor of the host state and approximately 31% in favor of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled out of court.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf |title=Recent Developments in Investor-State Disputes |publisher=Unctad.org |accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:NAFTA logo.png|right|150px|thumb|Chapter 11 of [[NAFTA]] includes an Investor-State provision.]]\n\nNotably, only foreign investors can sue states under investment treaties, because states are the parties to the treaty, and only states can be held liable to pay damages for breach of the treaty. States have no corresponding right to bring an original claim against a foreign investor under the treaties, again because investors are not parties to the treaty and therefore cannot be in breach of it. Thus, a decision in favor of the state means that the state has not been ordered to pay compensation, not that it received any compensation from the investor (although costs can be awarded against the investor). A state cannot \"win\" in ISDS in the manner of a foreign investor - a state which wishes to sue a foreign investor does so through its own domestic courts, without the need for a treaty.\n\nISDS cannot overturn local laws (unlike the [[World Trade Organization]]) which violate trade agreements,<ref name=\":232\">{{cite web |url=https://piie.com/publications/piie-briefings/assessing-trans-pacific-partnership-volume-1-market-access-and-sectoral |title=Assessing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Volume 1: Market Access and Sectoral Issues {{!}} PIIE |website=piie.com |access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":273\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=f30e1893-08fb-4c8e-93bd-eac8442faf5e |title=Investor-state dispute settlement: the importance of an informed, fact-based debate |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=International Bar Association |access-date= }}</ref> but can grant monetary damages to investors adversely affected by such laws.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid |title=The obscure legal system that lets corporations sue countries |date=10 June 2015 |publisher=The Guardian |author=Claire Provost and Matt Kennard |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> According to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], ISDS requires specific treaty violations and does not allow corporations to sue solely for \"lost profits\".<ref name=\":152\">{{cite web |url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/blog/2015/march/isds-important-questions-and-answers |title=ISDS: Important Questions and Answers {{!}} United States Trade Representative |website=ustr.gov |access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> However, violations may be difficult to foresee, and the threat of exorbitant fines may cause a [[chilling effect]] which halts regulation or legislation in the public interest (e.g. human health and environmental protection).<ref name=\"SCint\">{{cite book |title=Shadow courts: the tribunals that rule global trade |last=Sweetland |first=Edwards, Haley |publisher=Colombia Global Reports |year=2016 |isbn=9780997126402 |location= |pages=Chapter: Introduction |oclc=933590566}}</ref> Critics also state that treaties are written so that any legislation causing lost profits is by definition a treaty violation, rendering the argument null that only treaty violations are subject to ISDS.<ref name=\"SCint\"/>\n\n==== NAFTA Chapter 11 ====\n{{main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}\nA notable example of ISDS, which has been in existence for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international [[arbitral tribunal]]. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the 'local remedies' rule, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several steps of local remedies. On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the customary duty to exhaust local remedies, where reasonably available, may have been a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid-2000s.\n\nInvestors may initiate an arbitration against the NAFTA Party under the Arbitration Rules of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] (\"UNCITRAL Rules\") or under the Rules of the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (\"ICSID Rules\"). NAFTA Chapter 11 was the first instance of an ISDS provision receiving widespread public attention, especially in the United States in the wake of the [[Methanex]] case.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/c5818.htm |title=Methanex Corp. v.

While some research (Olofsdotter, 1998; Reisen and Soto, 2001) finds a positive impact on developing countries, other authors (Mencinger, 2003; Carkovic and Levine, 2005; Johnson, 2006; T\u00fcrkcan, Duman, and Yetkiner, 2008; Herzer, 2012) find a negative impact, and some (De Mello, 1999) find the data to be inconclusive. A fourth conclusion was proposed by others (Alfaro et al., 2004; Li and Liu, 2005; Batten and Vo, 2009): FDI may have a positive or negative impact on the GDP of developing economies depending on the existence of adequate policies to \"filter\" speculative or predatory investment. Thus, opponents of ISDS warn that these systems may harm the government's ability to filter FDI more favorable to development, and therefore harm GDP <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.isdscorporateattacks.org/ |title=Corporate Attacks on Our Laws {{!}} Public Citizen |website=isdscorporateattacks.org/ |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>.

Opponents of ISDS note that arbitrators are paid on a case-by-case basis, and therefore they are personally benefited with an increase in claims. Because governments may not use the ISDS system to sue investors, if arbitrators have any bias toward companies of investors, they will encourage further claims and be personally benefited by that increase. The vague terms of most BITs ease this kind of \"drift\" on the interpretation of treaties by arbitrators <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tni.org/files/download/profitingfrominjustice.pdf |title=Profiting from injustice {{!}} TNI  |website=tni.org |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>. This drift, fueled by the conflict of interest in the core of the system (that need not assume any lack of integrity on a personal level on the arbitrators side, but solely the cognitive difficulty in overcoming a bias when one's personal interest is at stake) may help explain the explosive growth on the number of known ISDS cases in the last few decades<ref>{{cite web |url=https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/investment-dispute-settlement |title=Investment Dispute Settlement Navigator {{!}} UNCTAD  |website=investmentpolicy.unctad.org/ |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\n=== Transparency ===\n\nOpponents of ISDS argue that arbitrations are sometimes carried out in secret by trade lawyers who do not enjoy the typical safeguards of judicial independence and procedural fairness, who earn income only if a case is brought and proceeds, and who are not accountable to the public or required to take into account broader constitutional and international law human rights norms.<ref>[http://justinvestment.org/2011/05/oecd-document-discusses-investor-state-dispute-settlement/ Van Harten, Gus. \"OECD Document Discusses Investor State Dispute Settlement\".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104082333/http://justinvestment.org/2011/05/oecd-document-discusses-investor-state-dispute-settlement/ |date=4 January 2019 }} Accessed: 7 July 2011.</ref> The [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] agrees \"that secrecy has gone too far\" in many ISDS cases, but notes that agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership did ensure greater transparency in ISDS.<ref name=\":232\" /> Proponents of ISDS point out that confidentiality is a standard feature of all [[arbitration]] and one that enables a constructive, de-politicized and fact-oriented atmosphere of dispute resolution. On the other hand, such traditional confidentiality is limited to disputes that affect the parties in question and not the broader public. Also, most ICSID awards, although confidential, are de facto published by consent of the parties. However, many awards under other arbitration rules are not public and, in the case of investor-arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce, there is a requirement for blanket confidentiality for all aspects of a case.\n\nIt is further pointed out that judges are not elected in most countries outside the US, so that \"public accountability of judges\" may not be considered a standard of [[public international law]]. In any event, they say, the qualification of ISDS arbitrators matches or exceeds the qualification of most court judges.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In response, critics make the point that any judge, whether domestic or international, who is part of a legal system not shown to be systematically biased or unreliable, has a greater claim to independence than an arbitrator because they are insulated from conflicts of interest that arise when arbitrators work on the side as lawyers, and is assigned cases in an objective manner rather than by the discretion of a disputing party or an executive official. Arbitrators are appointed by both parties at dispute, so such conflicts of interest may arise on both sides.\n\nWhile ISDS has traditionally been confidential as any other [[arbitration]], the general trend in the last decade has been to allow for more openness and transparency. On the other hand, there is still widespread confidentiality in the system.\n\nUnder Art. 29 of the U.S. Model-BIT of 2004, all documents pertaining to ISDS have to be made public and [[amicus curiae]] briefs are allowed. However, no investment treaty allows other parties who have an interest in the dispute, other than the claimant investor and respondent government, to obtain [[standing (law)|standing]] in the adjudicative process.\n\nUnder the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]], the tribunals shall, subject to the consent of the disputing parties, conduct hearings open to the public. The tribunal will make available to the public documents relating to the dispute such as the notice of intent, the notice of arbitration, pleadings, memorials, minutes or transcripts of the hearings of the tribunal, where available; orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal. In addition, third parties can and increasingly do participate in investor-state arbitration by submitting ''[[amicus curiae]]'' petitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partF-chap04.htm#r37 |title=ICSID, Arbitration Rules |publisher=Icsid.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s [[International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID) is required by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22 to make public, information on the registration of all requests for arbitration and to indicate in due course the date and method of the termination of each proceeding.

As in most [[arbitration]]s, one is appointed by the investor, one by the state, and the third is usually chosen by agreement between the parties or their appointed arbitrators or selected by the appointing authority, depending on the procedural rules applicable to the dispute. If the parties do not agree who to appoint, this power is assigned to executive officials usually at the World Bank, the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, or a private chamber of commerce.\n\nOther individuals cannot initiate a claim against a state under an investment treaty. Also, no individual or state can initiate a claim against a foreign investor under an investment treaty. This has led to criticisms that investor-state arbitration is not balanced and that it favours the \"haves\" over the \"have nots\" by giving foreign investors, especially major companies, access to a special tribunal outside any court. While the arbitration process itself does not provide explicitly privileged access for larger investors over individuals or SMEs, the costs of ISDS, as in any court or arbitration system, tend to be off-putting for smaller claimants.\n\n== Examples ==\nAccording to a 2011 paper, \"In terms of wins and losses, [the] U.S. has never lost a case as the respondent country.

The state position was that as owned by a Kazakh national the claimant was not eligible for investment protection under the Dutch-Kazakh BIT. This argument was dismissed by the Arbitrage. The Kazakh state then alleged that it didn\u2019t nationalize the bank, but it bailed it out (wiping out the shares\u2019 value in the process). The latter was due to the embezzlement of depositors\u2019 trust (and funds) by Mr. Ablyazov.

It stated that it:\n\n<blockquote>\"...supports the principle of national treatment \u2014 that foreign and domestic businesses are treated equally under the law. However, the Government does not support provisions that would confer greater legal rights on foreign businesses than those available to domestic businesses. Nor will the Government support provisions that would constrain the ability of Australian governments to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters in circumstances where those laws do not discriminate between domestic and foreign businesses. The Government has not and will not accept provisions that limit its capacity to put health warnings or plain packaging requirements on tobacco products or its ability to continue the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme... In the past, Australian Governments have sought the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements with developing countries at the behest of Australian businesses. The Gillard Government will discontinue this practice. If Australian businesses are concerned about sovereign risk in Australian trading partner countries, they will need to make their own assessments about whether they want to commit to investing in those countries... Foreign businesses investing in Australia will be entitled to the same legal protections as domestic businesses but the Gillard Government will not confer greater rights on foreign businesses through investor-state dispute resolution provisions.\"<ref>[http://www.acci.asn.au/getattachment/b9d3cfae-fc0c-4c2a-a3df-3f58228daf6d/Gillard-Government-Trade-Policy-Statement.aspx \"Trade Policy Statement\", Australian Government.] Accessed: 5 September 2014.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis statement is a reaction to Philip Morris' ISDS claim under [[UNCITRAL]] rules to challenge Australian tobacco Advertising Restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/internationalrelations/internationallaw/pages/tobaccoplainpackaging.aspx|title=Tobacco plain packaging\u2014investor-state arbitration|publisher=Ag.gov.au|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> By 2013,{{Update inline|date=April 2017}} Australia had not terminated any bilateral investment treaties allowing for ISDS.

In any event, since the election of the conservative Coalition Government in 2013, the Government has entered into free trade agreements (such as the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, Ch 9 section B) that include ISDS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/in-force/chafta/Pages/australia-china-fta.aspx|title=China\u2013Australia Free Trade Agreement|website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative way ahead may be the preservation of investor protection under [[public international law]], including ISDS, but with more concern for transparency and the balancing of economic and non-economic interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/130710/LDM_BRI(2014)130710_REV2_EN.pdf|title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) : State of play and prospects for reform|publisher=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> As noted [[#Debates|above]], the [[European Commission]] proposed September 2015) an 'Investment Court System' to replace ISDS clauses (notably in the draft TTIP), with the scope for investor challenge much reduced and with 'highly skilled judges' rather than arbitrators used to determine cases.<ref>{{cite web|title = Commission proposes new Investment Court System for TTIP and other EU trade and investment negotiations | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm | work = The European Commission| date = 16 September 2015 | accessdate = 25 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn this vein, [[Karel De Gucht]], the [[European Commissioner for Trade|EU commissioner]] in charge of negotiating [[International Investment Agreement]]s declared on 18 December 2014 that future agreements shall become more transparent, shall \"fully enshrine democratic prerogatives\" and \"explicitly state that legitimate government public policy decisions \u2013 on issues such as the balance between public and private provision of healthcare or \"the European ban on chicken carcasses washed with chlorine\" \u2013 cannot be over-ridden\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/wrong-george-monbiot-nothing-secret-eu-trade-deal|title=You're wrong, George Monbiot \u2013 there is nothing secret about this EU trade deal|author=Karel De Gucht|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> He announced to \"crack down on companies using legal technicalities to build frivolous cases against governments\", to \"open up investment tribunals to public scrutiny \u2013 documents will be public and interested parties, including NGOs, will be able to make submissions\".
