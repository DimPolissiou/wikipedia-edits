A cell phone brought in by Cristina receives a phone call, which is intercepted by a military spy plane, which is transmitted to a large military force encamped outside the bunker.\n\nWhen the military discovers something very rare in the lake, they drop two bombs on the lake to scare the wildlife out of the area. The detonations also damage the bunker, causing it to be evacuated of all but Tato, who is injured and left behind. While El Capo and the rest move to a nearby farm, Tato is captured. When the group makes it to the city, Nancho persuades a terminally ill AIDS man, named El Moro, to drive a car bomb to the Senate in exchange for 200 million pesos for his family. Nancho fails to tell Juan Carlos, El Capo's son, about the bomb, who is killed in the explosion. El Moro's children are rescued from the explosion by Perrys and Chemo, who pledge to take care of them. They then enlist a nurse and help Tato escape from the hospital prior to his being transported to jail. \n\nEl Capo has Juan Carlos' body stolen from the morgue, and brought to a series of caves they are hiding out in.  However, an informer has given their location to the military, who follow them there. It is revealed that General Moncado and General Sarmiento, who were with the military are actually allied with El Capo. They escape into the caves and join El Capo's men.  The military attacks the caves, and in the battle Chemo is killed. However, Moncada, Sarmiento and Perrys escape after the raid, with Perrys vowing to take care of El Moro's kids on her own. The military force is ramped up by the President, who is running for re-election. \n\nEl Capo and his band surrender, in order to protect the rest of his family. While in custody, several of the group are targeted for assassination, including Perrys and the nurse who helped Tato escape. When the President reneges on promises made to El Capo in exchange for his surrender, El Capo escapes with Nancho.  But in the ensuing chase, their car explodes, killing Nancho. Everyone also thinks that El Capo has died in the explosion. When she hears of his supposed death, El Capo's mother dies from grief. At his funeral, the police arrest Isabel Cristina and Marcella, but Tato and Perrys escape. After their escape, Perrys does not want to go with Tato, preferring to leave their life of crime and focus on raising her children. El Capo and Tato escape in a stolen car.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n{{unreferenced|date=August 2018}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|name=''El Capo'' official website}}\n* {{IMDb title|title=El Capo}}\n* {{TheTVDB|title=El Capo}}\n\n{{RCN Telenovelas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Capo}}\n[[Category:2009 Colombian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010 Colombian television series endings]]\n[[Category:2009 telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Colombian telenovelas]]\n[[Category:Colombian crime television series]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language telenovelas]]\n[[Category:MundoMax original programming]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Colombia]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the Colombian TV series|other uses|Capo (disambiguation)}}\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2009}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = El Capo\n| image     = \n| caption   = \n| director  = {{unbulleted list|[[Riccardo Gabrielli R.]]|[[Lilo Vilaplana]]}}\n| producer  = {{unbulleted list|Amparo Lopez|Nelson Martinez|[[Jorge Sastoque Roa]]}}\n| writer    = [[Gustavo Bol\u00edvar M.]]\n| starring  = {{plainlist|\n* [[Marlon Moreno]]\n* [[Katherine Velez]]\n* [[Marcela Mar]]\n* [[Maria Adelaida Puerta]]\n* [[Diego Trujillo]]\n* [[Natalia Jerez]]\n* [[Elkin Diaz]]\n* [[Oscar Borda]]\n* [[Manuel Sarmiento]]\n}}\n| network   = {{unbulleted list|[[RCN Televisi\u00f3n]] (2009\u20132010)|[[MundoFox]] (2012\u20132014)}}\n}}\n\n'''''Marlon Moreno El Capo''''', commonly known as '''''El Capo''''', is a [[television series]] made by [[Fox Telecolombia]] and written by Gustavo Bolivar for [[RCN Television]], based on its namesake book.\n\nThe series follows the story of the fictional drug lord Pedro Pablo Le\u00f3n Jaramillo, a man who by necessity, chance and ambition has become the richest and most wanted drug trafficker in Colombia.

The song has English language verses and an [[Irish language]] chorus, a style known as [[macaronic]].\n\nThe title ({{IPA-ga|\u0283u\u02d0l\u02b2 \u0259 \u027e\u02e0u\u02d0n\u02e0|pron}}) translates to \"go, my love\" (or variants):  ''si\u00fal'' is an imperative, literally translating to \"walk!\", ''a r\u00fain'' is a term of endearment.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the song is unclear. It has been suggested that the song refers to the \"[[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]\" of the [[Glorious Revolution]]. If it does, however, the original version has probably been lost. It is not uncommon that Irish songs were translated into English, with their chorus surviving in Irish, or being transformed into nonsense words (see [[Caleno custure me]]), but in most of these cases, some of the Irish version still survives. It is possible that the song was composed in the 1800s with the conscious intention of styling it after older songs.\n\nSome in Ireland{{who|date=September 2012}} say that after the British occupied the island, they gave Irish men the choice of either joining the army or being exiled forever.  In the American rendition of the song, the young man referred to in the song chooses the army.  In the Irish rendition, however, he chooses permanent exile.\nAs is common in folk music, many lyrical variants of the song exist. \n\n[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] refers to the song twice in his novel [[The Master of Ballantrae]] (1889). Referred to as \"the pathetic air of 'Shule Aroon'\", it is whistled by the Irish Jacobite exile Francis Burke and later sung by the Master of Ballantrae himself to impress his younger brother's wife. The Master describes it as \"very moving\" and describes it being sung by Jacobite exiles in France: \"it is a pathetic sight when a score of rough Irish ... get to this song; and you may see, by their falling tears, how it strikes home to them\". <ref>Stevenson, Robert Louis, The Master of Ballantrae (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), pp. 73, 95.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Ulysses (James Joyce)|Ulysses]]'', [[James Joyce]] had Stephen Dedalus sing the song to Leopold Bloom in Bloom's kitchen (as part of the Ithaca episode).  The song can be seen to signal or echo many of the grand themes of the book, referencing loss of language, usurpation, betrayal, loss of leadership and women selling themselves.  Bloom responds by singing a song in Hebrew.<ref>Joyce, James, Ulysses (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1968), p. 608</ref>\n\n\"[[Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier]]\"/\"Buttermilk Hill\" is a well-known American variant dating to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], sharing a common melody and similar lyrics.\n\n==Modern performance==\n{{Listen|filename=Kokia_-_Siuil A Ruin.ogg|title=\"Si\u00fal A R\u00fain\"|description=A sample of the Irish chorus, as performed by Japanese singer [[Kokia (singer)|Kokia]] on ''[[Fairy Dance: Kokia Meets Ireland]]'' (2008).|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n\"Si\u00fal a R\u00fain\" is one of the most widely sung songs in the Irish repertoire.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Gruening was the [[List of Governors of Alaska|Governor]] of the [[Alaska Territory]] from 1939 until 1953, and a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from Alaska from 1959 until 1969.\n\nBorn in New York City, Gruening pursued a career in journalism after graduating from [[Harvard Medical School]]. After working for various newspapers in New York and [[Boston]], he served in various roles during the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He was appointed as Governor of Alaska in 1939 and became a prominent advocate of Alaska statehood.\n\nGruening became one of Alaska's inaugural pair of Senators after Alaska gained statehood in 1959. Gruening was a prominent opponent of the [[Vietnam War]], and with Oregon's [[Wayne Morse]], was one of just two Senators to vote against the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] which allowed the bombing of North Vietnam. In 1968, [[Mike Gravel]] defeated Gruening in the Senate Democratic primary, and Gruening's attempt to win re-election as an [[independent politician|independent]] was unsuccessful.\n\n==Early life==\nGruening was born in New York City, the son of Phebe (Fridenberg) and Emil Gruening, an eye and ear surgeon.<ref>https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gruening-ernest</ref> Gruening attended [[Hotchkiss School|The Hotchkiss School]], and he graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1907 and from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1912 at the age of 25. He then forsook medicine to pursue journalism, finding it more exciting. Initially a reporter for the ''[[Boston American]]'' in 1912, he went on to become copy desk editor and rewrite man for the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Evening Herald]]'' and, from 1912 to 1913, an editorial writer. He also worked for the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' and the ''[[The Boston Journal|Boston Journal]]'' at various points. For four years, Gruening was, consecutively, managing editor of the ''[[Boston Evening Traveller]]'' and the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. After serving in [[World War I]], Gruening became the editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1920 to 1923 and the editor of the ''[[New York Post]]'' for four months in 1934. During his time in New York, he also worked for the Spanish-language publication ''La Prensa''.\n\n==Political career==\nIntrigued with [[New Deal]] politics, he switched careers. Gruening was appointed to the U.S. delegation to the 7th [[Pan-American Conference|Inter-American Conference]] in 1933, Director of the [[Division of Territories and Island Possessions]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], 1934\u20131939, and Administrator of the [[Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration]], 1935\u20131937. He was a member of the [[Alaska Highway|Alaska International Highway Commission]] from 1938 to 1942. In 1939, Gruening was appointed Governor of the Territory of Alaska, and served in that position for 13 1/2 years. He was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]]s of [[1952 Democratic National Convention|1952]], [[1956 Democratic National Convention|1956]], and [[1960 Democratic National Convention|1960]], and was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1958, serving for 10 years.\n\nOne of Gruening's areas of expertise was [[Mexico]]. In 1928, he published the most comprehensive book on the country, which is still recommended by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and Mexican officials today. For this work, the best written by a non-Mexican on Mexico, he received the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle]] from the Mexican government.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite having been born outside of Alaska, he was a fervent supporter of the territory's statehood, serving as one of its first Senators after statehood. He gave the keynote speech in 1955 at the Alaskan Constitutional Convention entitled \"Let Us End American [[Colonialism]]!\" in which he outlined the ways in which the United States mirrored the actions of the [[British Empire]] in North America before the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in relation to the territory of Alaska. Gruening's argument was that Alaska had been a colony of the U.S., but one that, from its purchase, had been promised statehood.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Let us end American colonialism|url = http://library.alaska.gov/hist/fulltext/ASL-J87.A417G89.htm|website = library.alaska.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}</ref> With his assistance and support, Alaska entered the union four years later, in 1959.\n\n== Governorship ==\nErnest Gruening served as the 7th governor of the Alaskan territory from 1939 to 1953. During his term, he continued to write letters to the editor at ''[[The New Republic]]''. One such letter<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gruening|first1=Ernest|title=Alaska Provides for Veterans|issue=115(20)|work=New Republic|date=1946}}</ref> examined that publication's recent discussion of state legislation affecting [[veteran]]s. Gruening's letter included information on the steps taken by his territorial government benefiting veterans in the state. His plan, the [[Territorial Veterans' Act]], provided for loans up to $10,000 for veterans at a four percent [[interest rate]], half the established rate in Alaska of eight percent.\n\nA significant issue during Gruening's tenure as territorial governor, particularly in 1946, was a [[tuberculosis]] rate so high it caused him to declare a [[state of emergency]]. The territory had as many as 4000 patients and only 289 hospital beds. Alaska spent one-tenth of its annual budget increasing awareness about TB, yet the death rate was still eight times the United States average.<ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Scourge of the North|last = |first = |date = 1946|work = Time|volume=47|issue=19|page=54|access-date = |via = }}</ref>\n\nAnother concern during Gruening's time as governor was the possible effect on [[wildlife]] caused by large numbers of soldiers arriving prior to the United States entry into [[World War II]], and which would only increase during the conflict. While he fully supported military presence and activities, after so many soldiers had been in the state long enough to gain resident hunting licenses (significantly cheaper than nonresident licenses) Gruening worried wildlife populations would suffer. Because of this, he began to focus on instituting new regulations to protect Alaska's animals and environment from the [[Overexploitation|over-harvesting]] that he saw as inevitable.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===World War II===\nIn the spring of 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] invaded Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Meanwhile, in September of that year, [[Imperial Japan]] [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|invaded and conquered French Indochina]] while simultaneously fighting [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Gruening was the [[List of Governors of Alaska|Governor]] of the [[Alaska Territory]] from 1939 until 1953, and a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from Alaska from 1959 until 1969.\n\nBorn in New York City, Gruening pursued a career in journalism after graduating from [[Harvard Medical School]]. After working for various newspapers in New York and [[Boston]], he served in various roles during the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He was appointed as Governor of Alaska in 1939 and became a prominent advocate of Alaska statehood.\n\nGruening became one of Alaska's inaugural pair of Senators after Alaska gained statehood in 1959. Gruening was a prominent opponent of the [[Vietnam War]], and with Oregon's [[Wayne Morse]], was one of just two Senators to vote against the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] which allowed the bombing of North Vietnam. In 1968, [[Mike Gravel]] defeated Gruening in the Senate Democratic primary, and Gruening's attempt to win re-election as an [[independent politician|independent]] was unsuccessful.\n\n==Early life==\nGruening was born in New York City, the son of Phebe (Fridenberg) and Emil Gruening, an eye and ear surgeon.<ref>https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gruening-ernest</ref> Gruening attended [[Hotchkiss School|The Hotchkiss School]], and he graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1907 and from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1912 at the age of 25. He then forsook medicine to pursue journalism, finding it more exciting. Initially a reporter for the ''[[Boston American]]'' in 1912, he went on to become copy desk editor and rewrite man for the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Evening Herald]]'' and, from 1912 to 1913, an editorial writer. He also worked for the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' and the ''[[The Boston Journal|Boston Journal]]'' at various points. For four years, Gruening was, consecutively, managing editor of the ''[[Boston Evening Traveller]]'' and the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. After serving in [[World War I]], Gruening became the editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1920 to 1923 and the editor of the ''[[New York Post]]'' for four months in 1934. During his time in New York, he also worked for the Spanish-language publication ''La Prensa''.\n\n==Political career==\nIntrigued with [[New Deal]] politics, he switched careers. Gruening was appointed to the U.S. delegation to the 7th [[Pan-American Conference|Inter-American Conference]] in 1933, Director of the [[Division of Territories and Island Possessions]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], 1934\u20131939, and Administrator of the [[Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration]], 1935\u20131937. He was a member of the [[Alaska Highway|Alaska International Highway Commission]] from 1938 to 1942. In 1939, Gruening was appointed Governor of the Territory of Alaska, and served in that position for 13 1/2 years. He was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]]s of [[1952 Democratic National Convention|1952]], [[1956 Democratic National Convention|1956]], and [[1960 Democratic National Convention|1960]], and was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1958, serving for 10 years.\n\nOne of Gruening's areas of expertise was [[Mexico]]. In 1928, he published the most comprehensive book on the country, which is still recommended by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and Mexican officials today. For this work, the best written by a non-Mexican on Mexico, he received the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle]] from the Mexican government.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite having been born outside of Alaska, he was a fervent supporter of the territory's statehood, serving as one of its first Senators after statehood. He gave the keynote speech in 1955 at the Alaskan Constitutional Convention entitled \"Let Us End American [[Colonialism]]!\" in which he outlined the ways in which the United States mirrored the actions of the [[British Empire]] in North America before the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in relation to the territory of Alaska. Gruening's argument was that Alaska had been a colony of the U.S., but one that, from its purchase, had been promised statehood.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Let us end American colonialism|url = http://library.alaska.gov/hist/fulltext/ASL-J87.A417G89.htm|website = library.alaska.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}</ref> With his assistance and support, Alaska entered the union four years later, in 1959.\n\n== Governorship ==\nErnest Gruening served as the 7th governor of the Alaskan territory from 1939 to 1953. During his term, he continued to write letters to the editor at ''[[The New Republic]]''. One such letter<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gruening|first1=Ernest|title=Alaska Provides for Veterans|issue=115(20)|work=New Republic|date=1946}}</ref> examined that publication's recent discussion of state legislation affecting [[veteran]]s. Gruening's letter included information on the steps taken by his territorial government benefiting veterans in the state. His plan, the [[Territorial Veterans' Act]], provided for loans up to $10,000 for veterans at a four percent [[interest rate]], half the established rate in Alaska of eight percent.\n\nA significant issue during Gruening's tenure as territorial governor, particularly in 1946, was a [[tuberculosis]] rate so high it caused him to declare a [[state of emergency]]. The territory had as many as 4000 patients and only 289 hospital beds. Alaska spent one-tenth of its annual budget increasing awareness about TB, yet the death rate was still eight times the United States average.<ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Scourge of the North|last = |first = |date = 1946|work = Time|volume=47|issue=19|page=54|access-date = |via = }}</ref>\n\nAnother concern during Gruening's time as governor was the possible effect on [[wildlife]] caused by large numbers of soldiers arriving prior to the United States entry into [[World War II]], and which would only increase during the conflict. While he fully supported military presence and activities, after so many soldiers had been in the state long enough to gain resident hunting licenses (significantly cheaper than nonresident licenses) Gruening worried wildlife populations would suffer. Because of this, he began to focus on instituting new regulations to protect Alaska's animals and environment from the [[Overexploitation|over-harvesting]] that he saw as inevitable.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===World War II===\nIn the spring of 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] invaded Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Meanwhile, in September of that year, [[Imperial Japan]] [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|invaded and conquered French Indochina]] while simultaneously fighting [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].
