The work takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\nResponsible for church music in [[Leipzig]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed most of his church cantatas for occasions of the Lutheran liturgical calendar of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} These works are scored for choir, with optional [[basso continuo]] and instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]'' with the voices. For most of them, an [[Autograph (manuscript)|autograph manuscript]] is missing, posing problems for dating them.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=V}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of six motets<!--historically regarded as a \"canon\" of motets,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} and --> assigned numbers in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] of BWV 225\u2013230.{{sfn|Dubin|2007}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] dated  the motets to Bach's Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter believed in 1912 that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was written for a specific funeral in 1723,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} while [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]].\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for up to five voices, [[SATB|SSATB]],{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} as only few of Bach's compositions of Latin church music, such as the [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723 and the [[Mass for the Dresden court (Bach)|Missa in B-minor]] written for the Dresden court in 1733.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}}\n\n=== Text sources, and chorale melody===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in Johann Cr\u00fcger's ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text for {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:1\u20132, 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the passage reflects Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images.

P. Jones]] said that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing ''colla parte'' in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}\n\nIn the following table, the movement number is followed by the beginning of the text, its source, the voices, and [[Key (music)|key]] and [[time signature]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n<!--! scope=\"col\" | BD-->\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}} || verse 1 || SATB || {{nowrap|[[E minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=1}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen|italic=no}} || verse 2 || SSATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Denn das Gesetz|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=2}} || SSA || [[G major]] || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}} || verse 3 || SSATB || E minor || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#6|6]] || {{lang|la|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=9}} || SSATB || G major || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#7|7]] || {{lang|de|Weg, weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}} || verse 4 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#8|8]] || {{lang|en|So aber Christus in euch ist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=10}} || ATB || [[C major]] || 12/8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#9|9]] || {{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen|italic=no}} || verse 5 || SSAT || [[A minor]] || 2/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#10|10]] || {{lang|de|So nun der Geist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=11}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#11|11]] || {{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}} || verse 6 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|}\n\n=== Movements ===\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas.

Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the second verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} here often expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe structure of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been regarded as unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived.

The work takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\nResponsible for church music in [[Leipzig]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed most of his church cantatas for occasions of the Lutheran liturgical calendar of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} These works are scored for choir, with optional [[basso continuo]] and instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]'' with the voices. For most of them, an [[Autograph (manuscript)|autograph manuscript]] is missing, posing problems for dating them.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=V}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of six motets<!--historically regarded as a \"canon\" of motets,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} and --> assigned numbers in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] of BWV 225\u2013230.{{sfn|Dubin|2007}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] dated  the motets to Bach's Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter believed in 1912 that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was written for a specific funeral in 1723,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} while [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]].\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for up to five voices, [[SATB|SSATB]],{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} as only few of Bach's compositions of Latin church music, such as the [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723 and the [[Mass for the Dresden court (Bach)|Missa in B-minor]] written for the Dresden court in 1733.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}}\n\n=== Text sources, and chorale melody===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in Johann Cr\u00fcger's ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text for {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:1\u20132, 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the passage reflects Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images.

The melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}}\n\n=== Date and purpose ===\nBach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter was the first to state, in the ''Bach-Jahrbuch'' of 1912, that the motets were music commissioned for special occasions.{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} He assigned a specific date to {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, the funeral on 18 July 1723 of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the Epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is not conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} Three of the chorales are contained in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of 149 of Bach's chorale settings, dated {{circa|1735}}, which suggests a latest composition time then.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to describe the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, arguing for a date in the 1720s, assuming that the work was then newly composed.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} According to Melamed, there is evidence that the motet is rather a compilation of partly older music, looking at the four-part setting of the chorale, which seems unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the cantus firmus in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Weimar or even earlier.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} [[Richard D. P. Jones]] said that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing ''colla parte'' in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}\n\nIn the following table, the movement number is followed by the beginning of the text, its source, the voices, and [[Key (music)|key]] and [[time signature]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n<!--! scope=\"col\" | BD-->\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}} || verse 1 || SATB || {{nowrap|[[E minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=1}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen|italic=no}} || verse 2 || SSATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Denn das Gesetz|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=2}} || SSA || [[G major]] || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}} || verse 3 || SSATB || E minor || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#6|6]] || {{lang|la|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=9}} || SSATB || G major || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#7|7]] || {{lang|de|Weg, weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}} || verse 4 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#8|8]] || {{lang|en|So aber Christus in euch ist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=10}} || ATB || [[C major]] || 12/8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#9|9]] || {{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen|italic=no}} || verse 5 || SSAT || [[A minor]] || 2/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#10|10]] || {{lang|de|So nun der Geist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=11}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#11|11]] || {{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}} || verse 6 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|}\n\n=== Movements ===\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas.

The text, in the first person, speaks of longing for Jesus.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Jones noted that the tenor part is particularly expressive.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The last movement has exactly the same music to the different text of the last stanza, creating a frame.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 2 ====\nThe second movement begins with excerpts from the Epistle to the Romans with \"{{lang|de|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches an denen, die in Christo Jesu sind|italic=no}}\" (Now there is nothing damnable in those who are in Christ Jesus).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The difference of living in the flesh and the spirit is an aspect that will be repeated  throughout the motet.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The movement is also in E minor, but for five voices.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=4}} The text is rendered first in rhetorical homophony.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\nIn setting the first sentence, Bach accented the word \"nichts\" (nothing), repeating it twice, with long rests and echo dynamics. Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the second verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} here often expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe structure of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been regarded as unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived.
