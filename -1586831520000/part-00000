Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965 under the direction of the [[Bill Davis|Hon. William Davis]], Minister of Education. The system has grown to encompass 24 public colleges serving 200 communities in the province.\n\nAs Centennial College's first site, Warden Woods Campus (651 Warden Avenue) opened its doors on October 17, 1966, with 514 students enrolled in 16 career-oriented programs including journalism, secretarial science and early childhood education. The campus made use of a decommissioned federal building that had been renovated to serve as a teaching institution. It evolved over the years to include the health/nutrition, hospitality, child studies and community services programs. In 1973, the Ontario government transferred responsibility for nursing education from the province's hospitals to its colleges. Locally, the Scarborough Regional and the Toronto East General schools of nursing joined Centennial College to form the School of Health Sciences, based at Warden Woods Campus.\n\nIn 1992 the [[Scarborough Board of Education]] and the college made a deal to establish an adult education centre, the Scarborough Career Planning Centre, at the Centennial College.<ref>Boyle, Theresa. \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/436548262.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan%2023,%201992&author=Theresa%20Boyle%20Toronto%20Star&pub=Toronto%20Star&edition=&startpage=&desc=Adult%20education%20centre%20will%20be%20constructed%20at%20Centennial%20College Adult education centre will be constructed at Centennial College].\" ''[[Toronto Star]]''.

Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965 under the direction of the [[Bill Davis|Hon. William Davis]], Minister of Education. The system has grown to encompass 24 public colleges serving 200 communities in the province.\n\nAs Centennial College's first site, Warden Woods Campus (651 Warden Avenue) opened its doors on October 17, 1966, with 514 students enrolled in 16 career-oriented programs including journalism, secretarial science and early childhood education. The campus made use of a decommissioned federal building that had been renovated to serve as a teaching institution. It evolved over the years to include the health/nutrition, hospitality, child studies and community services programs. In 1973, the Ontario government transferred responsibility for nursing education from the province's hospitals to its colleges. Locally, the Scarborough Regional and the Toronto East General schools of nursing joined Centennial College to form the School of Health Sciences, based at Warden Woods Campus.\n\nIn 1992 the [[Scarborough Board of Education]] and the college made a deal to establish an adult education centre, the Scarborough Career Planning Centre, at the Centennial College.<ref>Boyle, Theresa. \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/436548262.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan%2023,%201992&author=Theresa%20Boyle%20Toronto%20Star&pub=Toronto%20Star&edition=&startpage=&desc=Adult%20education%20centre%20will%20be%20constructed%20at%20Centennial%20College Adult education centre will be constructed at Centennial College].\" ''[[Toronto Star]]''.

Centennial was among the first colleges in Ontario to receive approval for applied-degree programs in computer and communication networking, and software systems: design, development and management.\n\n===Centennial College Schools===\n* School of Advancement\n* The Business School\n* School of Communications, Media, Arts and Design\n* School of Community and Health Studies\n* School of Engineering Technology and Applied Science\n* School of Hospitality, Tourism and Culinary Arts\n* School of Transportation\n*School of Dumisa Mndzebele\n\n==Community and special events==\nIn July 2010, the students in the School of Hospitality, Tourism and Culture participated and partnered for the very first time with North America's Largest Cultural Festival \u2013 ''Scotiabank Caribana'' (now formally called Scotiabank Caribbean Carnival Toronto (SBCCT)- Festival Management Committee and Tribal Knights with Dexter Senshuai created a Queen costume worn by Salome Odney a hospitality student under the theme \"Tropical Amazon\" which was presented at the Annual King and Queen Competition and then at the Annual Parade. This marked the 1st time an Ontario College took part in the festival which was a huge success in made local headlines and several pictures have surfaced. The student wearing the costume was interviewed by CP24 and various other television stations and Media Afficates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/July2010/27/c6887.html|title=Centennial College \u2013 Centennial College students getting into the Caribana spirit|website=Newswire.ca|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2011, the students made a return to the Scotiabank Caribbean Carnival Festival and participated in highly King and Queen show under a new theme \"LEGENDS\" Our section that was chosen between the committee and Tribal Knights would fit the multicultural diversity of international Students from china and Japanese \"Legends of Orient\" This year would be a little different where it was opened up to the rest of the college staff, faculty, administration to participate with the Centennial College Student Association CCSAI. This year costume was worn by Annakay McCalla who wore the costume for the first time the Centennial College \u2013 School of Hospitality, Tourism and Culture to enter the competition at the Grand Parade and it will be judged with the mas band Tribal nights and made history that our costume was judged and received 4th place with Tribal Knights.

To date, she has participated in 12 deep water dives in the deep-ocean submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]''.  She researched the volcano-tectonic processes responsible for creating new oceanic crust at [[Mid-ocean ridge|seafloor spreading centers]].  In 1968, she co-authored a research paper featuring groundbreaking work into the faulted nature of spreading centers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Menard |first1=H.W. |last2=Atwater |first2= T.M. | year=1968 |title=Changes in direction of sea floor spreading| journal=Nature| volume=219|issue=5153 | pages=463\u2013467|bibcode=1968Natur.219..463M|doi=10.1038/219463a0}}</ref> With [[Jack Corliss]], [[Fred Spiess]], and [[Kenneth C. Macdonald|Kenneth Macdonald]], she played key roles in expeditions that uncovered the distinct biology of ocean floor warm springs, which led to the discovery during the [[RISE project]] of the high temperature black smokers, undersea [[hydrothermal vent]]s.\n\nIn Atwater's research on [[Propagating Rifts]] near the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|Galapagos Islands]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Atwater |first=Tanya | year=1981 |title=Propagating rifts in seafloor spreading patterns| journal=Nature| volume=290|issue=5803 | pages=185\u2013186|bibcode=1981Natur.290..185A|doi=10.1038/290185a0}}</ref> she discovered that propagating rifts were created when spreading centers along the seafloor were disturbed by tectonic movement or [[magma]] and therefore had to change direction to realign. This helped to explain the complex pattern of the seafloor.\n\nAtwater is perhaps best known for her work on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.  She wrote two major research papers outlining the history of plate tectonic evolution of North America and tectonic problems of the [[San Andreas Fault]], which assisted in documenting the history of the [[San Andreas Fault Line]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter | year=1973 |title=Relative motion of the Pacific and North American plates deduced from sea-floor spreading in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific Oceans| publisher=R.

Nur, eds., Proc. of the Conf. on Tectonic Problems of the San Andreas Fault: Stanford University Publication| volume=13 | pages=136\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nShe also studied geometric evolution, integrating and comparing the global plate motion records with the regional continental geologic records.  She found emerging relationships that revealed the origins of many large-scale geologic features (e.g. [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], [[Death Valley]], [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade]] volcanoes, [[California Coast Ranges]]).<ref name=\"foo\"/>\n\nAtwater's research paper, Implications of Plate [[Tectonics]] for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America,<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\">{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya | year=1970 |title=Implications of Plate Tectonics for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume=81 | issue=12 | pages=3513\u20133536|bibcode=1970GSAB...81.3513A |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1970)81[3513:IOPTFT]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> established the essential framework for the plate tectonics of western North America.  In her work, she explains that approximately 40 million years ago, the [[Farallon Plate]] was subducting underneath the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]].  The lower half of the Farallon plate was entirely subducted under Southern California and the upper half did not sink, which eventually became known as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]].Since the southern section of Farallon completely disappeared, the boundary of southern California was now between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The [[San Andreas Fault]] is unique because it acts as a major fault line as well as a border between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\"/> She updated this work in 1989.<ref>Atwater, T.

To date, she has participated in 12 deep water dives in the deep-ocean submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]''.  She researched the volcano-tectonic processes responsible for creating new oceanic crust at [[Mid-ocean ridge|seafloor spreading centers]].  In 1968, she co-authored a research paper featuring groundbreaking work into the faulted nature of spreading centers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Menard |first1=H.W. |last2=Atwater |first2= T.M. | year=1968 |title=Changes in direction of sea floor spreading| journal=Nature| volume=219|issue=5153 | pages=463\u2013467|bibcode=1968Natur.219..463M|doi=10.1038/219463a0}}</ref> With [[Jack Corliss]], [[Fred Spiess]], and [[Kenneth C. Macdonald|Kenneth Macdonald]], she played key roles in expeditions that uncovered the distinct biology of ocean floor warm springs, which led to the discovery during the [[RISE project]] of the high temperature black smokers, undersea [[hydrothermal vent]]s.\n\nIn Atwater's research on [[Propagating Rifts]] near the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|Galapagos Islands]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Atwater |first=Tanya | year=1981 |title=Propagating rifts in seafloor spreading patterns| journal=Nature| volume=290|issue=5803 | pages=185\u2013186|bibcode=1981Natur.290..185A|doi=10.1038/290185a0}}</ref> she discovered that propagating rifts were created when spreading centers along the seafloor were disturbed by tectonic movement or [[magma]] and therefore had to change direction to realign. This helped to explain the complex pattern of the seafloor.\n\nAtwater is perhaps best known for her work on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.  She wrote two major research papers outlining the history of plate tectonic evolution of North America and tectonic problems of the [[San Andreas Fault]], which assisted in documenting the history of the [[San Andreas Fault Line]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter | year=1973 |title=Relative motion of the Pacific and North American plates deduced from sea-floor spreading in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific Oceans| publisher=R.

Nur, eds., Proc. of the Conf. on Tectonic Problems of the San Andreas Fault: Stanford University Publication| volume=13 | pages=136\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nShe also studied geometric evolution, integrating and comparing the global plate motion records with the regional continental geologic records.  She found emerging relationships that revealed the origins of many large-scale geologic features (e.g. [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], [[Death Valley]], [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade]] volcanoes, [[California Coast Ranges]]).<ref name=\"foo\"/>\n\nAtwater's research paper, Implications of Plate [[Tectonics]] for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America,<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\">{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya | year=1970 |title=Implications of Plate Tectonics for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume=81 | issue=12 | pages=3513\u20133536|bibcode=1970GSAB...81.3513A |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1970)81[3513:IOPTFT]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> established the essential framework for the plate tectonics of western North America.  In her work, she explains that approximately 40 million years ago, the [[Farallon Plate]] was subducting underneath the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]].  The lower half of the Farallon plate was entirely subducted under Southern California and the upper half did not sink, which eventually became known as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]].Since the southern section of Farallon completely disappeared, the boundary of southern California was now between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The [[San Andreas Fault]] is unique because it acts as a major fault line as well as a border between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\"/> She updated this work in 1989.<ref>Atwater, T.

It is primarily a [[solid solution|solid-solution]] series between the [[iron]]-[[endmember]] [[annite]],  and the [[magnesium]]-endmember [[phlogopite]]; more [[Aluminium|aluminous]] end-members include [[siderophyllite]] and [[eastonite]]. Biotite was regarded as a mineral ''species'' by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] until 1998, when its status was changed to a mineral ''group''.<ref name=\"Minerals_Net\">{{cite web | url=https://www.minerals.net/mineral/biotite.aspx | title=The Biotite Mineral Group | publisher=Minerals.net | accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.mindat.org/min-677.html</ref> The term ''biotite'' is still used to describe unanalysed dark micas [[Field research|in the field]]. Biotite was named by [[Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann|J.F.L. Hausmann]] in 1847 in honor of the French [[physicist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], who performed early research into the many [[Optical mineralogy|optical properties]] of [[mica]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann| title = Handbuch der Mineralogie| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqgTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA674| year = 1828| publisher = Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht| isbn = | page = 674 }} \"Zur Bezeichnung des sogenannten einachsigen Glimmers ist hier der Name Biotit gew\u00e4hlt worden, um daran zu erinnern, da\u00df Biot es war, der zuerst auf die optische Verschiedenheit der Glimmerarten aufmerksam machte.\"  (For the designation of so-called uniaxial mica, the name \"biotite\" has been chosen in order to recall that it was Biot who first called attention to the optical differences between types of mica.)</ref>\n\nMembers of the biotite group are [[sheet silicate]]s. [[Iron]], [[magnesium]], [[aluminium]], [[silicon]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]] form sheets that are weakly bound together by [[potassium]] [[ion]]s. The term \"iron mica\" is sometimes used for iron-rich biotite, but the term also refers to a flaky micaceous form of [[haematite]], and the field term Lepidomelane for unanalysed iron-rich Biotite avoids this ambiguity. Biotite is also sometimes called \"black mica\" as opposed to \"white mica\" ([[muscovite]]) \u2013 both form in the same [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], and in some instances side-by-side.\n\n==Properties==\n\nLike other [[mica]] minerals, biotite has a highly perfect [[basal cleavage]], and consists of flexible sheets, or [[Lamellae (materials)|lamellae]], which easily flake off.  It has a [[monoclinic crystal system]], with [[tabular habit|tabular]] to [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] crystals with an obvious [[wikt:pinacoid|pinacoid]] termination.  It has four prism faces and two pinacoid faces to form a [[Hexagonal (crystal system)|pseudohexagonal]] crystal.  Although not easily seen because of the cleavage and sheets, fracture is uneven. It appears greenish to brown or black, and even yellow when [[weathering|weathered]].

It is primarily a [[solid solution|solid-solution]] series between the [[iron]]-[[endmember]] [[annite]],  and the [[magnesium]]-endmember [[phlogopite]]; more [[Aluminium|aluminous]] end-members include [[siderophyllite]] and [[eastonite]]. Biotite was regarded as a mineral ''species'' by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] until 1998, when its status was changed to a mineral ''group''.<ref name=\"Minerals_Net\">{{cite web | url=https://www.minerals.net/mineral/biotite.aspx | title=The Biotite Mineral Group | publisher=Minerals.net | accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.mindat.org/min-677.html</ref> The term ''biotite'' is still used to describe unanalysed dark micas [[Field research|in the field]]. Biotite was named by [[Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann|J.F.L. Hausmann]] in 1847 in honor of the French [[physicist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], who performed early research into the many [[Optical mineralogy|optical properties]] of [[mica]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann| title = Handbuch der Mineralogie| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqgTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA674| year = 1828| publisher = Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht| isbn = | page = 674 }} \"Zur Bezeichnung des sogenannten einachsigen Glimmers ist hier der Name Biotit gew\u00e4hlt worden, um daran zu erinnern, da\u00df Biot es war, der zuerst auf die optische Verschiedenheit der Glimmerarten aufmerksam machte.\"  (For the designation of so-called uniaxial mica, the name \"biotite\" has been chosen in order to recall that it was Biot who first called attention to the optical differences between types of mica.)</ref>\n\nMembers of the biotite group are [[sheet silicate]]s. [[Iron]], [[magnesium]], [[aluminium]], [[silicon]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]] form sheets that are weakly bound together by [[potassium]] [[ion]]s. The term \"iron mica\" is sometimes used for iron-rich Biotite, but the term also refers to a flaky micaceous form of haematite, and the field term Lepidomelane for unanalysed iron-rich Biotite avoids this ambiguity. Biotite is also sometimes called \"black mica\" as opposed to \"white mica\" ([[muscovite]]) \u2013 both form in the same [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], and in some instances side-by-side.\n\n==Properties==\n\nLike other [[mica]] minerals, biotite has a highly perfect [[basal cleavage]], and consists of flexible sheets, or [[Lamellae (materials)|lamellae]], which easily flake off.  It has a [[monoclinic crystal system]], with [[tabular habit|tabular]] to [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] crystals with an obvious [[wikt:pinacoid|pinacoid]] termination.  It has four prism faces and two pinacoid faces to form a [[Hexagonal (crystal system)|pseudohexagonal]] crystal.  Although not easily seen because of the cleavage and sheets, fracture is uneven. It appears greenish to brown or black, and even yellow when [[weathering|weathered]]. It can be transparent to opaque, has a vitreous to pearly [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]], and a grey-white [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]]. When biotite crystals are found in large chunks, they are called \"books\" because they resemble books with pages of many sheets. The color of biotite is usually black and the mineral has a hardness of 2.5\u20133 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]].\n\nBiotite [[Solvation|dissolves]] in both [[acid]] and [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] [[aqueous solution]]s, with the highest [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] rates at low [[pH]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Malmstr\u00f6m|first1=Maria|last2=Banwart|first2=Steven|title=Biotite dissolution at 25\u00b0C: The pH dependence of dissolution rate and stoichiometry|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|date=July 1997|volume=61|issue=14|pages=2779\u20132799|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00093-8}}</ref> However, biotite dissolution is highly [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] with crystal edge surfaces ([[Miller index|''h k''0]]) reacting 45 to 132 times faster than basal surfaces ([[Miller index|001]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hodson|first1=Mark E.|title=Does reactive surface area depend on grain size?
