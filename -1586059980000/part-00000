This organization also hosts various foreign dignitaries, US Government officials, and subject matter experts to further inform and foster international understanding both in the university's student body and the greater D.C. community.\n\nThere are also several a cappella performance groups on campus. The university's school-sponsored a cappella group, the co-ed GW Troubadours, has been a presence on campus since the mid-1950s and regularly records studio albums and travels internationally with the Department of Music. The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Each year, the groups duke it out at the Battle of the A-Cappella groups, one of the biggest student events on GW's campus.\n\nAnother student group, the Emergency Medical Response Group (EMeRG) provides an all-volunteer 24/7 ambulance service for the campus and the Foggy Bottom/West End community at no cost. EMeRG has been active on campus since 1994 and has advanced from bike response into a two ambulance system that is sanctioned by the District of Columbia Department of Health and DC Fire and EMS (DCFEMS). EMeRG also plays an active role in special events in around the DC area including the Marine Corps Marathon, National Marathon, Cherry Blossom Race, Commencement, Inauguration and other events in downtown D.C. and on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|last=GWU|first=EMeRG|title=Emergency Medical Response Group|url=http://gwemerg.com/|publisher=GWU EMeRG|accessdate=March 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501114330/http://gwemerg.com/|archive-date=May 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek life===\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:10px;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of Greek Chapters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Inter-fraternity Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |title=Interfraternity Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606200621/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Panhellenic Association<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |title=Panhellenic Association |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606204432/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Multicultural Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |title=Multicultural Greek Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606194623/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Alternative Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |title=Alternative Greek Organizations |publisher=George Washington University Alternative Greek Council |access-date=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522155504/http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Beta Theta Pi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Phi]]<br />[[Delta Tau Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Order]]<br />[[Kappa Sigma]]<br />[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Delta Theta]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Kappa]]<br />[[Pi Kappa Alpha]]<br />[[Sigma Chi]]<br />[[Sigma Nu]]<br />[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]<br />[[Zeta Beta Tau]]||[[Alpha Delta Pi]]<br />[[Alpha Phi]]<br />[[Chi Omega]]\n[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Theta]]<br />[[Kappa Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Beta Phi]]<br />[[Sigma Delta Tau]]<br />[[Sigma Kappa]]\n\n| [[Alpha Phi Alpha]]<br />[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]\n[[Delta Lambda Phi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Theta]]<br />[[Iota Nu Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Phi Lambda]]<br />[[Lambda Pi Chi]]<br />[[Phi Beta Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Delta Psi]]<br />[[Sigma Lambda Upsilon]]<br />[[Sigma Psi Zeta]]<br />[[Zeta Phi Beta]]\n|[[Alpha Kappa Psi]]<br />[[Alpha Chi Sigma]]<br />[[Alpha Omega Epsilon]]<br />[[Alpha Phi Omega]]<br />[[Delta Epsilon Mu]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Alpha Delta]]<br />[[Phi Beta Kappa]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Sigma Iota Rho]]<br />[[Tau Beta Pi]]<br />[[Theta Tau]]\n|}\n[[File:Townhouse Row GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Townhouse Row, home of many fraternities and sororities.]]\nGW has a large Greek community with over 3,000 students consisting of just under 27 percent of the undergraduate population.<ref name=\"Greek community\">{{cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |title=Greek Life Office |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606190055/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Greek organizations are divided up between and governed by the Inter-Fraternity Council with 14 chapters, the Panhellenic Association with 11 chapters, and the Multicultural Greek Council with 13 chapters.<ref name=\"Greek community\"/> Other Greek-life, known as \"Alternative Greek Life\" or simply \"Alt-Greek\", exists on campus in the form of professional, community-serviced based and honor groups although not under the university's traditional Greek life governing structure but instead are considered separate student organizations\n\n===Scholarly societies===\n[[File:Old Main Career Center GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Rice Hall, 1922 F Street, houses various administrative offices.]]\n\nThere are chapters of many varied academic groups at the university.

This organization also hosts various foreign dignitaries, US Government officials, and subject matter experts to further inform and foster international understanding both in the university's student body and the greater D.C. community.\n\nThere are also several a cappella performance groups on campus. The university's school-sponsored a cappella group, the co-ed GW Troubadours, has been a presence on campus since the mid-1950s and regularly records studio albums and travels internationally with the Department of Music. The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Each year, the groups duke it out at the Battle of the A-Cappella groups, one of the biggest student events on GW's campus.\n\nAnother student group, the Emergency Medical Response Group (EMeRG) provides an all-volunteer 24/7 ambulance service for the campus and the Foggy Bottom/West End community at no cost. EMeRG has been active on campus since 1994 and has advanced from bike response into a two ambulance system that is sanctioned by the District of Columbia Department of Health and DC Fire and EMS (DCFEMS). EMeRG also plays an active role in special events in around the DC area including the Marine Corps Marathon, National Marathon, Cherry Blossom Race, Commencement, Inauguration and other events in downtown D.C. and on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|last=GWU|first=EMeRG|title=Emergency Medical Response Group|url=http://gwemerg.com/|publisher=GWU EMeRG|accessdate=March 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501114330/http://gwemerg.com/|archive-date=May 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek life===\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:10px;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of Greek Chapters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Inter-fraternity Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |title=Interfraternity Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606200621/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Panhellenic Association<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |title=Panhellenic Association |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606204432/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Multicultural Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |title=Multicultural Greek Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606194623/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Alternative Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |title=Alternative Greek Organizations |publisher=George Washington University Alternative Greek Council |access-date=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522155504/http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Beta Theta Pi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Phi]]<br />[[Delta Tau Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Order]]<br />[[Kappa Sigma]]<br />[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Delta Theta]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Kappa]]<br />[[Pi Kappa Alpha]]<br />[[Sigma Chi]]<br />[[Sigma Nu]]<br />[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]<br />[[Zeta Beta Tau]]||[[Alpha Delta Pi]]<br />[[Alpha Phi]]<br />[[Chi Omega]]\n[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Theta]]<br />[[Kappa Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Beta Phi]]<br />[[Sigma Delta Tau]]<br />[[Sigma Kappa]]\n\n| [[Alpha Phi Alpha]]<br />[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]\n[[Delta Lambda Phi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Theta]]<br />[[Iota Nu Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Phi Lambda]]<br />[[Lambda Pi Chi]]<br />[[Phi Beta Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Delta Psi]]<br />[[Sigma Lambda Upsilon]]<br />[[Sigma Psi Zeta]]<br />[[Zeta Phi Beta]]\n|[[Alpha Kappa Psi]]<br />[[Alpha Chi Sigma]]<br />[[Alpha Omega Epsilon]]<br />[[Alpha Phi Omega]]<br />[[Delta Epsilon Mu]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Alpha Delta]]<br />[[Phi Beta Kappa]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Sigma Iota Rho]]<br />[[Tau Beta Pi]]<br />[[Theta Tau]]\n|}\n[[File:Townhouse Row GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Townhouse Row, home of many fraternities and sororities.]]\nGW has a large Greek community with over 3,000 students consisting of just under 27 percent of the undergraduate population.<ref name=\"Greek community\">{{cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |title=Greek Life Office |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606190055/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Greek organizations are divided up between and governed by the Inter-Fraternity Council with 14 chapters, the Panhellenic Association with 11 chapters, and the Multicultural Greek Council with 13 chapters.<ref name=\"Greek community\"/> Other Greek-life, known as \"Alternative Greek Life\" or simply \"Alt-Greek\", exists on campus in the form of professional, community-serviced based and honor groups although not under the university's traditional Greek life governing structure but instead are considered separate student organizations\n\n===Scholarly societies===\n[[File:Old Main Career Center GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Rice Hall, 1922 F Street, houses various administrative offices.]]\n\nThere are chapters of many varied academic groups at the university.

[[Maleficent]] states that since people no longer believe in dreams, it is the perfect time for her to return to power and make the Magic Kingdom \"The Place Where Nightmares Come True\" - a play on the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] slogan of \"The Place Where Dreams Come True.\" She is also accompanied by Captain Hook.\n\n===Villains Tonight===\nThe Disney villains star as the main characters in the Disney Cruise lines' variety show, ''Villains Tonight''.

The first, ''[[Our Unsung Villains]]'', was aired in 1956 as part of [[Walt Disney Presents]]. In the special, [[Walt Disney]] himself hands hosting duties over to the Magic Mirror, who hosts a show devoted to Disney villains such as [[The Big Bad Wolf]], the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] and [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]], and [[Br'er Fox]] and [[Br'er Bear]]. In 1977, there was an update to this show entitled ''[[Disney's Greatest Villains]]'', that featured the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] and [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]] again, along with eight other characters from the franchise, plus [[Madam Mim]] and [[Willie the Giant]]. Segments from this special were featured in ''[[A Disney Halloween]]''.\n\n==== ''Descendants'' ====\nIn the [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'' appear Mal, Evie, Jay and Carlos, who are the children of Maleficent, the Evil Queen, Jafar and Cruella de Vil, respectively. They used to live on The Isle of the Lost, an island where all of Disney's villains and their various sidekicks have been imprisoned, along with all the other villains and their children. Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos were chosen by Prince Ben (son of King Beast and Queen Belle) to live in The United States of Auradon.\n\n===Direct-to-DVD films===\n\n====''Mickey's House of Villains''====\nThe Disney Villains star in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', the 2002 [[film adaptation]] of the [[Disney Channel]] [[animated television series]] ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. Set during a [[Halloween]] party, [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]] takes over the house with a musical number of \"It's Our House Now\", and all the other villains in the house join in. In the process, Jafar trap all the heroes in the kitchen, throw [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and the others out into the street, and change the House's name to the \"House of Villains\". [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], [[Goofy]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] in turn try to return things to normal, but [[Chernabog]] keeps throwing them out. Afterwards, [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] dresses in his famous sorcerer outfit from ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and challenges Jafar to a magical duel using fireballs. Mickey's sorcerer hat is bounced off and there is very little time to put it back on, but then [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] saves the day by escaping the kitchen to the backstage room on the [[Magic Carpet (Aladdin)|magic carpet]] and giving [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] who gives Mickey the lamp to trap Jafar. Mickey sucks Jafar into the lamp, while the rest of the villains flee, restoring the house to normal.\n\n====''Once Upon a Halloween''====\nIn the film ''[[Once Upon a Halloween]]'', on the night before [[Halloween]], the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' plans to conquer [[Halloween]], and asks her cauldron to show you several villains to which one of them helps her in her plan.\n\n===Video games===\n\n====''Disney's Villains' Revenge''====\n''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]'' is a video game which tells the story of how the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]], [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]], [[Queen of Hearts (Disney)|Queen of Hearts]], and the Ringmaster from ''[[Dumbo]]'' change the story from the original movie to the way they wanted the story to end, with no \"Happily Ever After\".\n\n====''Kingdom Hearts'' series====\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of [[action role-playing game]]s developed and published by [[Disney Interactive Studios]] and [[Square Enix]], Disney villains play a major role as they seek to harness the power of darkness within the [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]. Led by [[Maleficent]], the villains are antagonists in different worlds, such as the [[Queen of Hearts (Disney)|Queen of Hearts]] of Wonderland, [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] of the Olympus Coliseum, [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]] of the city of Agrabah, [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]] of Atlantica, [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]] of Never Land, [[Chernabog]] of End of the World/Symphony of Sorcerery, [[Shan Yu]] of the Land of Dragons, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] of the Pride Land, The [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] of Dwarf Woodlands, [[Lady Tremaine]] of Castle of Dreams, and [[Claude Frollo (Disney)|Claude Frollo]] of La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches. [[Pete (Disney)|Peg Leg Pete]] appears as [[Maleficent]]'s main henchman in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Other villains outside the official line-up that also make appearances include [[Clayton (Tarzan)|Clayton]] and [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]] of Deep Jungle, [[Oogie Boogie]] of Halloween Town, [[Captain Barbossa]] of Port Royal, the [[Master Control Program (Tron)|Master Control Program]] & [[Sark (Tron)|Sark]] from ''[[Tron]]'' of Space Paranoids, [[Gantu|Captain Gantu]] of Deep Space, [[CLU (Tron)|CLU]] & [[Rinzler (Tron)|Rinzler]] of The Grid and The [[Beagle Boys]] of Country of the Musketeers. Monstro, the whale from [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]], is both a character and a location as well as a boss in [[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep#Final Mix|Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix]]. [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]]'s Castle and Prankster's Paradise remain the only worlds in the series so far where their main villains do not appear at all.\n\n====''Epic Mickey'' series====\n''[[Epic Mickey]]'' introduces new villains to the world of Disney, most of which are from old-style Disney movies and attractions. In the first game, Mickey unwittingly creates a monster called the Shadow Blot (not to be confused with the [[Phantom Blot]]). As Mickey tries to get rid of it, [[Yen Sid]] approaches and Mickey is forced to flee, leaving some of the Blot undestroyed. Years later, the Blot has Mickey kidnapped so that his heart can be used to escape Wasteland. With Oswald's help, Mickey returns home as the Blot is defeated.\n\nIn the second game, a character called [[The Mad Doctor (1933 film)|The Mad Doctor]] tries to rule in the Shadow Blot's stead. In the first game, the Mad Doctor supplied robots for the Blot. If the player choose the Hero path, The Mad Doctor turns from a robot into a toon. If the player chooses the Scrapper path, The Mad Doctor is left in the final battle room to rot. Lastly, at the end of the second game, several versions of Pete look like they're going to try to take over the Wasteland.\n\n===Novels===\n\n====''The Kingdom Keepers''====\nIn ''[[The Kingdom Keepers]]'', Disney villains form a group known as the \"Overtakers\".\n\n==Commentary==\nThe majority of Disney's villain characters are regarded as being age 55 or older. A study from [[Brigham Young University]] reviewed seventy years of Disney films, and found that 42% of the 93 characters reviewed reinforced negative stereotypes of elderly people by portraying those characters as evil or sinister. The conclusion was that Disney was influencing children to have preconceived notions about all older adults.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-458808/Disneys-villains-children-negative-images-elderly.html\n|title=Disney's villains 'give children negative images of the elderly'\n|date=2007-05-31\n|accessdate=2008-12-17\n|author=Fiona MacRae\n|publisher=Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\nDisney villains proved their mark in cinematic history when the American Film Institute named The Queen as the [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Heroes and Villains|10th greatest movie villain of all time]].

They can be horribly evil or grandiosely funny, but are ultimately tragic.</blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Thomas, Frank and Johnston, Ollie, ''The Disney Villain'' (1993) {{ISBN|1-56282-792-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56282-792-2}}\n\n{{DisneyConsumer}}\n{{Disney franchises}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of Disney characters|Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney animated villains| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|List of villains in Disney productions, games and comic books}}\n{{pp-pc1}} \nThis is a '''list of Disney villain characters''' often based on animated [[fictional characters]] who have been featured as part of the [[List of Disney animated characters|Disney character line-up]].

This show features [[Maleficent]], [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]], the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]], [[Cruella de Vil]], [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]], [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], Yzma, [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]], and [[Chernabog]] in a variety of comical situations while performing various musical numbers from their respective appearances.

The first, ''[[Our Unsung Villains]]'', was aired in 1956 as part of [[Walt Disney Presents]]. In the special, [[Walt Disney]] himself hands hosting duties over to the Magic Mirror, who hosts a show devoted to Disney villains such as [[The Big Bad Wolf]], the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] and [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]], and [[Br'er Fox]] and [[Br'er Bear]]. In 1977, there was an update to this show entitled ''[[Disney's Greatest Villains]]'', that featured the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] and [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]] again, along with eight other characters from the franchise, plus [[Madam Mim]] and [[Willie the Giant]]. Segments from this special were featured in ''[[A Disney Halloween]]''.\n\n==== ''Descendants'' ====\nIn the [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'' appear Mal, Evie, Jay and Carlos, who are the children of Maleficent, the Evil Queen, Jafar and Cruella de Vil, respectively. They used to live on The Isle of the Lost, an island where all of Disney's villains and their various sidekicks have been imprisoned, along with all the other villains and their children. Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos were chosen by Prince Ben (son of King Beast and Queen Belle) to live in The United States of Auradon.\n\n===Direct-to-DVD films===\n\n====''Mickey's House of Villains''====\nThe Disney Villains star in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'', the 2002 [[film adaptation]] of the [[Disney Channel]] [[animated television series]] ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. Set during a [[Halloween]] party, [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]] takes over the house with a musical number of \"It's Our House Now\", and all the other villains in the house join in. In the process, Jafar trap all the heroes in the kitchen, throw [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and the others out into the street, and change the House's name to the \"House of Villains\". [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], [[Goofy]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] in turn try to return things to normal, but [[Chernabog]] keeps throwing them out. Afterwards, [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] dresses in his famous sorcerer outfit from ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and challenges Jafar to a magical duel using fireballs. Mickey's sorcerer hat is bounced off and there is very little time to put it back on, but then [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] saves the day by escaping the kitchen to the backstage room on the [[Magic Carpet (Aladdin)|magic carpet]] and giving [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]] who gives Mickey the lamp to trap Jafar. Mickey sucks Jafar into the lamp, while the rest of the villains flee, restoring the house to normal.\n\n====''Once Upon a Halloween''====\nIn the film ''[[Once Upon a Halloween]]'', on the night before [[Halloween]], the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' plans to conquer [[Halloween]], and asks her cauldron to show you several villains to which one of them helps her in her plan.\n\n===Video games===\n\n====''Disney's Villains' Revenge''====\n''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]'' is a video game which tells the story of how the [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]], [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]], [[Queen of Hearts (Disney)|Queen of Hearts]], and the Ringmaster from ''[[Dumbo]]'' change the story from the original movie to the way they wanted the story to end, with no \"Happily Ever After\".\n\n====''Kingdom Hearts'' series====\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of [[action role-playing game]]s developed and published by [[Disney Interactive Studios]] and [[Square Enix]], Disney villains play a major role as they seek to harness the power of darkness within the [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]. Led by [[Maleficent]], the villains are antagonists in different worlds, such as the [[Queen of Hearts (Disney)|Queen of Hearts]] of Wonderland, [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] of the Olympus Coliseum, [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]] of the city of Agrabah, [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]] of Atlantica, [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]] of Never Land, [[Chernabog]] of End of the World/Symphony of Sorcerery, [[Shan Yu]] of the Land of Dragons, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] of the Pride Land, The [[Queen Grimhilde|Evil Queen]] of Dwarf Woodlands, [[Lady Tremaine]] of Castle of Dreams, and [[Claude Frollo (Disney)|Claude Frollo]] of La Cit\u00e9 des Cloches. [[Pete (Disney)|Peg Leg Pete]] appears as [[Maleficent]]'s main henchman in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Other villains outside the official line-up that also make appearances include [[Clayton (Tarzan)|Clayton]] and [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]] of Deep Jungle, [[Oogie Boogie]] of Halloween Town, [[Captain Barbossa]] of Port Royal, the [[Master Control Program (Tron)|Master Control Program]] & [[Sark (Tron)|Sark]] from ''[[Tron]]'' of Space Paranoids, [[Gantu|Captain Gantu]] of Deep Space, [[CLU (Tron)|CLU]] & [[Rinzler (Tron)|Rinzler]] of The Grid and The [[Beagle Boys]] of Country of the Musketeers. Monstro, the whale from [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]], is both a character and a location as well as a boss in [[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep#Final Mix|Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix]]. [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]]'s Castle and Prankster's Paradise remain the only worlds in the series so far where their main villains do not appear at all.\n\n====''Epic Mickey'' series====\n''[[Epic Mickey]]'' introduces new villains to the world of Disney, most of which are from old-style Disney movies and attractions. In the first game, Mickey unwittingly creates a monster called the Shadow Blot (not to be confused with the [[Phantom Blot]]). As Mickey tries to get rid of it, [[Yen Sid]] approaches and Mickey is forced to flee, leaving some of the Blot undestroyed. Years later, the Blot has Mickey kidnapped so that his heart can be used to escape Wasteland. With Oswald's help, Mickey returns home as the Blot is defeated.\n\nIn the second game, a character called [[The Mad Doctor (1933 film)|The Mad Doctor]] tries to rule in the Shadow Blot's stead. In the first game, the Mad Doctor supplied robots for the Blot. If the player choose the Hero path, The Mad Doctor turns from a robot into a toon. If the player chooses the Scrapper path, The Mad Doctor is left in the final battle room to rot. Lastly, at the end of the second game, several versions of Pete look like they're going to try to take over the Wasteland.\n\n===Novels===\n\n====''The Kingdom Keepers''====\nIn ''[[The Kingdom Keepers]]'', Disney villains form a group known as the \"Overtakers\".\n\n==Commentary==\nThe majority of Disney's villain characters are regarded as being age 55 or older. A study from [[Brigham Young University]] reviewed seventy years of Disney films, and found that 42% of the 93 characters reviewed reinforced negative stereotypes of elderly people by portraying those characters as evil or sinister. The conclusion was that Disney was influencing children to have preconceived notions about all older adults.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-458808/Disneys-villains-children-negative-images-elderly.html\n|title=Disney's villains 'give children negative images of the elderly'\n|date=2007-05-31\n|accessdate=2008-12-17\n|author=Fiona MacRae\n|publisher=Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\nDisney villains proved their mark in cinematic history when the American Film Institute named The Queen as the [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Heroes and Villains|10th greatest movie villain of all time]].

They can be horribly evil or grandiosely funny, but are ultimately tragic.</blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Thomas, Frank and Johnston, Ollie, ''The Disney Villain'' (1993) {{ISBN|1-56282-792-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56282-792-2}}\n\n{{DisneyConsumer}}\n{{Disney franchises}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of Disney characters|Villains]]\n[[Category:Disney animated villains| ]]\n", "name_user": "189.216.114.32", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eList of villains)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_villain_characters"}

The company was a direct competitor to [[Universum Film AG|UFA]], which had started in [[Berlin]] in 1917, and quickly absorbed several other film industry companies in the region. In 1930 investor Wilhelm Kraus and a consortium of banks bought a major shareholding in the company, and on 21 September 1932 the group took control of the company and renamed it '''Bavaria Film AG'''.
