{"title_page": "Deaths in 2020", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Short description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n-->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===25===\n\n===24===\n*[[Abdullah al-Hamid]], 69, Saudi poet and human rights activist, co-founder of the [[Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association]], stroke.<ref>[https://www.arab48.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A9/2020/04/24/%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B2-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AF-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%86 \u0648\u0641\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0632 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0645\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062c\u0646] {{in lang|ar}}</ref>\n*[[Mircea Mure\u0219an]], 91, Romanian film director (''[[R\u0103scoala]]'', ''[[Blestemul p\u0103m\u00e2ntului, blestemul iubirii]]'').<ref>[https://adevarul.ro/entertainment/film/a-murit-regizorul-mircea-muresan-ramas-definitiv-memoria-cinefililor-serialului-toate-panzele-sus-1_5ea2afc85163ec42711552a2/index.html A murit regizorul Mircea Mure\u015fan, r\u0103mas definitiv \u00een memoria cinefililor datorit\u0103 serialului \u201eToate p\u00e2nzele sus\u201c] {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n*[[Lynn Faulds Wood]], 72, Scottish television presenter (''[[Watchdog (TV programme)|Watchdog]]'') and journalist, stroke.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52410491 Former Watchdog host Lynn Faulds Wood dies aged 72]</ref>\n*{{ill|Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara|it}}, 84, Italian businessman and football executive, Chairman of [[Bologna FC|Bologna]] (1993\u20132001).<ref>[https://www.tuttobolognaweb.it/news/il-saluto-del-bologna-a-gazzoni/?intcmp=gazzanet-bologna Il saluto del Bologna a Gazzoni] {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n\n===23===\n*{{ill|Andy Ayunir|id}}, 53, Indonesian composer.<ref>[https://www.kompas.com/hype/read/2020/04/23/161729266/komposer-andy-ayunir-meninggal-dunia Komposer Andy Ayunir Meninggal Dunia] {{in lang|id}}</ref>\n*{{ill|Pahri Azhari|id}}, 57, Indonesian politician, [[Musi Banyuasin Regency|Musi Banyuasin]] regent (2008\u20132015), traffic collision.<ref>[https://sumsel.idntimes.com/news/sumsel/muhammad-rangga-erfizal/breaking-mantan-bupati-muba-pahri-azhari-meninggal-dunia/full Mantan Bupati Muba, Pahri Azhari Meninggal Dunia] {{in lang|id}}</ref>\n*[[Norbert Bl\u00fcm]], 84, German politician, [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs|Federal Minister for Social Affairs and Labour]] (1982\u20131998).<ref>[https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/norbert-bluem-frueherer-arbeitsminister-im-alter-von-84-jahren-gestorben-a-74ccbfb1-ce4f-4e06-b3d5-644ec7b31a23 Norbert Bl\u00fcm gestorben] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n*[[Arief Budiman]], 79, Indonesian political activist and sociologist.<ref>[https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/04/23/arief-budiman-dissident-academic-under-new-order-dies-at-79.html Arief Budiman, dissident academic under New Order, dies at 79]</ref>\n*[[Rinaldo Entingh]], 64, Surinamese footballer ([[S.V.

Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n-->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===25===\n\n===24===\n*[[Abdullah al-Hamid]], 69, Saudi poet and human rights activist, co-founder of the [[Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association]], stroke.<ref>[https://www.arab48.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A9/2020/04/24/%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B2-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AF-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%86 \u0648\u0641\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0632 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0645\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062c\u0646] {{in lang|ar}}</ref>\n*[[Mircea Mure\u0219an]], 91, Romanian film director (''[[R\u0103scoala]]'', ''[[Blestemul p\u0103m\u00e2ntului, blestemul iubirii]]'').<ref>[https://adevarul.ro/entertainment/film/a-murit-regizorul-mircea-muresan-ramas-definitiv-memoria-cinefililor-serialului-toate-panzele-sus-1_5ea2afc85163ec42711552a2/index.html A murit regizorul Mircea Mure\u015fan, r\u0103mas definitiv \u00een memoria cinefililor datorit\u0103 serialului \u201eToate p\u00e2nzele sus\u201c] {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n*[[Lynn Faulds Wood]], 72, Scottish television presenter (''[[Watchdog (TV programme)|Watchdog]]'') and journalist, stroke.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52410491 Former Watchdog host Lynn Faulds Wood dies aged 72]</ref>\n*{{ill|Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara|it}}, 84, Italian businessman and football executive, Chairman of [[Bologna FC|Bologna]] (1993\u20132001).<ref>[https://www.tuttobolognaweb.it/news/il-saluto-del-bologna-a-gazzoni/?intcmp=gazzanet-bologna Il saluto del Bologna a Gazzoni] {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n\n===23===\n*{{ill|Andy Ayunir|id}}, 53, Indonesian composer.<ref>[https://www.kompas.com/hype/read/2020/04/23/161729266/komposer-andy-ayunir-meninggal-dunia Komposer Andy Ayunir Meninggal Dunia] {{in lang|id}}</ref>\n*{{ill|Pahri Azhari|id}}, 57, Indonesian politician, [[Musi Banyuasin Regency|Musi Banyuasin]] regent (2008\u20132015), traffic collision.<ref>[https://sumsel.idntimes.com/news/sumsel/muhammad-rangga-erfizal/breaking-mantan-bupati-muba-pahri-azhari-meninggal-dunia/full Mantan Bupati Muba, Pahri Azhari Meninggal Dunia] {{in lang|id}}</ref>\n*[[Norbert Bl\u00fcm]], 84, German politician, [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs|Federal Minister for Social Affairs and Labour]] (1982\u20131998).<ref>[https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/norbert-bluem-frueherer-arbeitsminister-im-alter-von-84-jahren-gestorben-a-74ccbfb1-ce4f-4e06-b3d5-644ec7b31a23 Norbert Bl\u00fcm gestorben] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n*[[Arief Budiman]], 79, Indonesian political activist and sociologist.<ref>[https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/04/23/arief-budiman-dissident-academic-under-new-order-dies-at-79.html Arief Budiman, dissident academic under New Order, dies at 79]</ref>\n*[[Rinaldo Entingh]], 64, Surinamese footballer ([[S.V.

However, the plots of the two films bear no resemblance to each other.\n\n==Plot==\nOn November 17, 1941, on [[Governors Island|Governor's Island]] in [[New York City]], Captain Rick Leland ([[Humphrey Bogart]]) is [[court-martial]]ed and discharged from the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps]] after he is caught stealing. He tries to join the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] but is coldly rebuffed. Ostensibly on his way to [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]] to fight for [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Leland boards a Japanese ship, the ''Genoa Maru,'' sailing from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Yokohama]] via the [[Panama Canal]] and [[Hawaii]].\n\nOn board, he meets Canadian Alberta Marlow ([[Mary Astor]]) who claims to be from [[Medicine Hat]], and a light-hearted romance begins immediately. The other passengers are Dr. Lorenz ([[Sydney Greenstreet]]) and his servant, T. Oki. Lorenz, a professor of sociology, admires the Japanese and therefore is very unpopular in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], where he resides. Leland, in turn, makes it clear that he will fight for anyone willing to pay him enough.\n\nDuring a stop in New York City, Leland is revealed as a secret agent when he reports to Colonel Hart ([[Paul Stanton (actor)|Paul Stanton]]), an undercover [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] officer. Lorenz is a known enemy spy, but Hart and Leland are uncertain about Marlow. Hart also warns him to look out for a Japanese criminal named Totsuiko. Returning to the ship, Leland surprises a Filipino assassin ([[Rudy Robles]]) about to shoot Lorenz. Leland gains Lorenz's confidence by remaining indifferent when Lorenz has the man killed. Joe Totsuiko ([[Victor Sen Yung]]) embarks as a passenger, in the guise of a wise-cracking young [[Nisei]], and a different man returns as T. Oki ([[Kam Tong]]). Lorenz pays Leland in advance for information concerning the military installations guarding the Panama Canal.\n\nIn Panama, the captain announces that Japanese ships must detour around [[Cape Horn]]. Leland, Marlow, and Lorenz wait for another vessel at Sam's ([[Lee Tung Foo]]) hotel.  Crates addressed to Dan Morton, Bountiful Plantation, are unloaded. Lorenz demands that Leland procure up-to-date schedules for the air patrol. On December 6, 1941, Leland meets with his local contact, A. V. Smith ([[Charles Halton]]) and convinces him to provide real timetables: Lorenz would recognize fakes. Smith adds that Dan Morton is a rich [[Dipsomania|dipsomaniac]] and that Marlow is a buyer for Rogers Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nLeland hands over the schedules and is brutally beaten. He revives several hours later and immediately calls Smith, warning him to change the patrol schedule. Smith is killed after Leland hangs up. Lorenz and Marlow are gone. Sam sends Leland to a cinema, where a man ([[Philip Ahn]]), whispers \u201cGo Bountiful Plantation..\u201d and is killed. At the plantation, Leland sees a [[torpedo bomber]] being prepared. He is captured and brought to Lorenz. Also there are Totsuiko, Marlow, plantation owner Dan Morton ([[Monte Blue]]), and the second T. Oki, who is an Imperial Japanese prince and pilot. Morton, a shadow of a man whose weakness was exploited by the saboteurs, is Marlow's father. Her only stake in the affair is his welfare.\n\nLorenz reveals that Smith is dead: The prince will destroy the locks, without interference. They leave Totsuiko on guard. Leland makes a move; Marlow cries out; her father staggers to his feet; Totsuiko shoots him; Leland overpowers Totsuiko. Outside, Leland gets hold of a guard's [[machine gun]], shoots down the plane and dispatches Lorenz's henchmen. In the house, a defeated Lorenz attempts to commit [[seppuku]], but his nerve fails him. He begs Leland to kill him. Leland refuses: Lorenz \u201chas a date with Army Intelligence.\" Leland and Marlow clasp hands and look up at a sky filling with American planes.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:AcrossthePacificshot.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Alberta Marlow (Mary Astor) and Rick Leland (Humphrey Bogart) aboard the ''Genoa Maru''.]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Rick Leland\n* [[Mary Astor]] as Alberta Marlow\n* [[Sydney Greenstreet]] as Dr. Lorenz\n* [[Kam Tong]] as T.

Knopf, Inc. 1980, New York, p88</ref> The studio's solution to the problem was to discard Huston's footage of the impossible dilemma and write a new scenario. <ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n==== Effect of Internment ====\n[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM.com]] reports that Mary Astor later recalled that the constantly expanding [[internment of Japanese Americans]] ordered by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on March 3, 1942, deprived Japanese actors of their jobs on the film. The file on ''Across the Pacific in'' the [https://libraries.usc.edu/locations/cinematic-arts-library USC Cinema-Television Library] shows that ethnically Chinese actors were cast as the Japanese characters from the beginning. Aside from Technical Advisor Dan Fujiwara and \u201ca few bit players\u201d, there were no ethnically Japanese participants in ''Across the Pacific.''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Reception==\n[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] commented, \u201cAlthough picture does not quite hit the edge-of-seat tension engendered by Maltese Falcon, it\u2019s a breezy and fast-paced melodrama.

However, the plots of the two films bear no resemblance to each other.\n\n==Plot==\nOn November 17, 1941, on [[Governors Island|Governor's Island]] in [[New York City]], Captain Rick Leland ([[Humphrey Bogart]]) is [[court-martial]]ed and discharged from the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps]] after he is caught stealing. He tries to join the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] but is coldly rebuffed. Ostensibly on his way to [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]] to fight for [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Leland boards a Japanese ship, the ''Genoa Maru,'' sailing from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Yokohama]] via the [[Panama Canal]] and [[Hawaii]].\n\nOn board, he meets Canadian Alberta Marlow ([[Mary Astor]]) who claims to be from [[Medicine Hat]], and a light-hearted romance begins immediately. The other passengers are Dr. Lorenz ([[Sydney Greenstreet]]) and his servant, T. Oki. Lorenz, a professor of sociology, admires the Japanese and therefore is very unpopular in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], where he resides. Leland, in turn, makes it clear that he will fight for anyone willing to pay him enough.\n\nDuring a stop in New York City, Leland is revealed as a secret agent when he reports to Colonel Hart ([[Paul Stanton (actor)|Paul Stanton]]), an undercover [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] officer. Lorenz is a known enemy spy, but Hart and Leland are uncertain about Marlow. Hart also warns him to look out for a Japanese criminal named Totsuiko. Returning to the ship, Leland surprises a Filipino assassin ([[Rudy Robles]]) about to shoot Lorenz. Leland gains Lorenz's confidence by remaining indifferent when Lorenz has the man killed. Joe Totsuiko ([[Victor Sen Yung]]) embarks as a passenger, in the guise of a wise-cracking young [[Nisei]], and a different man returns as T. Oki ([[Kam Tong]]). Lorenz pays Leland in advance for information concerning the military installations guarding the Panama Canal.\n\nIn Panama, the captain announces that Japanese ships must detour around [[Cape Horn]]. Leland, Marlow, and Lorenz wait for another vessel at Sam's ([[Lee Tung Foo]]) hotel.  Crates addressed to Dan Morton, Bountiful Plantation, are unloaded. Lorenz demands that Leland procure up-to-date schedules for the air patrol. On December 6, 1941, Leland meets with his local contact, A. V. Smith ([[Charles Halton]]) and convinces him to provide real timetables: Lorenz would recognize fakes. Smith adds that Dan Morton is a rich [[Dipsomania|dipsomaniac]] and that Marlow is a buyer for Rogers Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nLeland hands over the schedules and is brutally beaten. He revives several hours later and immediately calls Smith, warning him to change the patrol schedule. Smith is killed after Leland hangs up. Lorenz and Marlow are gone. Sam sends Leland to a cinema, where a man ([[Philip Ahn]]), whispers \u201cGo Bountiful Plantation..\u201d and is killed. At the plantation, Leland sees a [[torpedo bomber]] being prepared. He is captured and brought to Lorenz. Also there are Totsuiko, Marlow, plantation owner Dan Morton ([[Monte Blue]]), and the second T. Oki, who is an Imperial Japanese prince and pilot. Morton, a shadow of a man whose weakness was exploited by the saboteurs, is Marlow's father. Her only stake in the affair is his welfare.\n\nLorenz reveals that Smith is dead: The prince will destroy the locks, without interference. They leave Totsuiko on guard. Leland makes a move; Marlow cries out; her father staggers to his feet; Totsuiko shoots him; Leland overpowers Totsuiko. Outside, Leland gets hold of a guard's [[machine gun]], shoots down the plane and dispatches Lorenz's henchmen. In the house, a defeated Lorenz attempts to commit [[seppuku]], but his nerve fails him. He begs Leland to kill him. Leland refuses: Lorenz \u201chas a date with Army Intelligence.\" Leland and Marlow clasp hands and look up at a sky filling with American planes.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:AcrossthePacificshot.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Alberta Marlow (Mary Astor) and Rick Leland (Humphrey Bogart) aboard the ''Genoa Maru''.]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Rick Leland\n* [[Mary Astor]] as Alberta Marlow\n* [[Sydney Greenstreet]] as Dr. Lorenz\n* [[Kam Tong]] as T.

Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on March 3, 1942, deprived Japanese actors of their jobs on the film. The file on ''Across the Pacific in'' the [https://libraries.usc.edu/locations/cinematic-arts-library USC Cinema-Television Library] shows that ethnically Chinese actors were cast as the Japanese characters from the beginning. Aside from Technical Advisor Dan Fujiwara and \u201ca few bit players\u201d, there were no ethnically Japanese participants in ''Across the Pacific.''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Reception==\n[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] commented, \u201cAlthough picture does not quite hit the edge-of-seat tension engendered by Maltese Falcon, it\u2019s a breezy and fast-paced melodrama.

A final legend tells of one of Cunigunde's nieces, Judith, the abbess of [[Kaufungen Abbey]].  A frivolous young woman, Judith preferred feasting and carousing with the young sisters to the Sabbath rituals.  Cunigunde remonstrated with her, to little effect.  Finally the saint became so vexed with her niece that she slapped her across the face; the marks remained on her face for the rest of her life, serving as a warning to those of the community who would not take their vows or observances seriously.\n\nSt. Cunigunde is widely venerated. As well as churches that are dedicated to her, such as St. Cunegunda Church in [[Detroit]], USA, [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], and the [[Archdiocese of Bamberg]], [[Germany]], she is the [[Patroness]] of [[Luxembourg]], where the parish church of [[Clausen, Luxembourg|Clausen]] (which has on Sundays and holy days a celebration of the [[Tridentine Mass]])<ref>[http://messe-latin-luxembourg.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_5.html Messe Traditionnelle (Tridentin) en Latin - Luxembourg]</ref> is dedicated to her.\n\n==Reception and iconography==\nAs well as in his political life, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] often included his wife in his imperial representation.\n\nHer participation in the reign of her husband is underlined on the dedication picture of the [[Pericopes of Henry II]]. The couple commissioned the book in 1012 to the monks on the island Reichenau in [[Lake Constance]], which was a leading center for [[Illuminated manuscript|book illumination]] at the time. With its precious cover and the 28 full-page miniatures, this is one of the most important works of book art at the time. On the dedication picture, the coronation of the couple by [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is shown. The couple is led by the [[Apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] is shown with an [[Globus cruciger|orb]] and scepter. The role of Cunigunde, who is represented in the same size as her husband, consists in the hand movement, pointing directly to Christ. This active hand movement can be seen as a sign of her political action readiness.<ref>Weinfurter, Stefan (1999). ''Heinrich II. (1002-1024) Herrscher am Ende der Zeiten''. Regensburg: Friedrich Pustet Verlag. pp.97-99.</ref> In the accompanying dedicatory poem, she is referred to as co-regent (''conregnans''). Again, the aspect of the ruler couple moves forward, she appears as a partner in the rule of [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014). ''Die heilige Kaiserin Kunigunde von Luxemburg''. Trier: Verlag Michael Weyand. p.23.</ref>\n\nAfter her [[canonization]], representations of her as a [[Saint]] can be seen in ecclesiastical art, especially in the [[Franconia]]n area. As the founder of the [[Dome]] and [[Diocese]] of [[Bamberg]], she is to be seen together with her husband in the group of figures of the doorcase of the ''Adamspforte'' at [[Bamberg Cathedral]]. This doorcase, created in 1235, is the most significant monumental depiction of Cunigunde in the High Middle Ages. On the left are [[Saint Stephen]], Cunigunde and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], on the right opposite side, [[Saint Peter]], [[Adam and Eve]] can be seen. [[Saint Stephen]], the first Christian [[martyr]] is in the guise of a [[deacon]]. He stands next to the Empress. As a donor, she is holding the model of a church in the right hand, as in many representations. With her left hand, she is pointing to her husband, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], the founder of the diocese.\n\nCunigunde's usual attribute is a ploughshare. According to the legend, she walked over glowing ploughshares without being hurt. This scene is shown on the Tumba made of limestone at [[Bamberg Cathedral]], created in the years 1499-1513 by [[Tilman Riemenschneider]], the most important German sculptor of the time. The double tomb of the imperial couple shows the lying couple with two lions and the Bavarian-Luxembourgish double coat of arms with blue-silver diamonds and the ''Roude Leiw'' at their feet. In such [[Tomb effigy|tomb effigies]], the lion, as a symbol of strength, is usually reserved for men. At the feet of women, there usually is a dog, as a sign of loyalty. The fact, that Cunigunde was also assigned a lion, is a reference of posterity to the duchess, queen and empress, who exercises her own sovereign rights.<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014). ''Die heilige Kaiserin Kunigunde von Luxemburg''. Trier: Verlag Michael Weyand. p.32.</ref> The ''Roude Leiw'' (meaning \"red lion\" in Luxembourgish)is also the coat of arms of Luxembourg since 1235-1239. Three of the four sides of the Tumba are decorated with scenic reliefs and architectural ornaments. Those depict events from the legends of the Saints. Cunigunde is depicted as a miraculous Saint in the \"Ploughshare test\" and the \"Key miracle\".<ref>https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/Riemenschneider,_Tilman:_Kaisergrabmal_im_Bamberger_Dom</ref>\n\nIn Luxembourg, where she is the only female Saint, there is the parish Church of Saint Cunigunde in [[Clausen, Luxembourg|Clausen]], which was consecrated in 1865 and decorated with murals depicting scenes from the life of Cunigunde in 1906. In 1959, the Cunigunde bell (''Cloche St. Cun\u00e9gonde'') was consecrated. In addition to a wooden sculpture of the Saints, a tooth [[relic]] of Cunigunde is worshipped in this church.<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014). ''Die heilige Kaiserin Kunigunde von Luxemburg''. Trier: Verlag Michael Weyand. p.33.</ref> There is also an octagonal Cunigunde Chapel in Heiderscheidergrund (''Heischtergronn''), built in 1848-1852. A statue is located there to the left of the main altar.<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014). ''Die heilige Kaiserin Kunigunde von Luxemburg''. Trier: Verlag Michael Weyand. p.34.</ref> There are two churches consecrated to her in the parish of Park Hosingen, the chapel of the village of Oberschlinder dedicated to her and the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] in 1875, and the church of Hoscheid-Dickt in 1852, which is also the oldest church in Luxembourg dedicated to the Holy Empress.<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014).

Numerous genealogists have tried to find out which Hedwig it is, there are different views. One of the most famous theses regarding her identity is from Joseph Depoin, who claims that Hedwig is the daughter of [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Duke Gilbert of Lorraine]] and his wife [[Gerberga of Saxony]], the daughter of [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. If this is correct, then Cunigunde married her distant cousin. Because [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] was strongly against consanguineous marriage, it is assumed that this can not be.<ref>Jackman, Donald C. (2012). ''Studia Luxembourgensia''. Pennsylvania: Editions Enlaplage. p.25.</ref> It can also often be read, that she is the daughter of [[Berthold of Schweinfurt]] from the House of [[Babenberg]] and Eilika of Walbeck, daughter of Count Lothar.<ref>Weinfurter, Stefan (1999). ''Heinrich II. (1002-1024) Herrscher am Ende der Zeiten''. Regensburg: Verlag Friedrich Puset. p.41.</ref> Cunigunde's paternal grandmother, also called Cunigunde, was a Carolingian.

Regensburg: Friedrich Pustet Verlag. pp.97-99.</ref> In the accompanying dedicatory poem, she is referred to as co-regent (''conregnans''). Again, the aspect of the ruler couple moves forward, she appears as a partner in the rule of [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014). ''Die heilige Kaiserin Kunigunde von Luxemburg''. Trier: Verlag Michael Weyand. p.23.</ref>\n\nAfter her [[canonization]], representations of her as a [[Saint]] can be seen in ecclesiastical art, especially in the [[Franconia]]n area. As the founder of the [[Dome]] and [[Diocese]] of [[Bamberg]], she is to be seen together with her husband in the group of figures of the doorcase of the ''Adamspforte'' at [[Bamberg Cathedral]]. This doorcase, created in 1235, is the most significant monumental depiction of Cunigunde in the High Middle Ages. On the left are [[Saint Stephen]], Cunigunde and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], on the right opposite side, [[Saint Peter]], [[Adam and Eve]] can be seen. [[Saint Stephen]], the first Christian [[martyr]] is in the guise of a [[deacon]]. He stands next to the Empress. As a donor, she is holding the model of a church in the right hand, as in many representations. With her left hand, she is pointing to her husband, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], the founder of the diocese.\n\nCunigunde's usual attribute is a ploughshare. According to the legend, she walked over glowing ploughshares without being hurt. This scene is shown on the Tumba made of limestone at [[Bamberg Cathedral]], created in the years 1499-1513 by [[Tilman Riemenschneider]], the most important German sculptor of the time. The double tomb of the imperial couple shows the lying couple with two lions and the Bavarian-Luxembourgish double coat of arms with blue-silver diamonds and the ''Roude Leiw'' at their feet. In such [[Tomb effigy|tomb effigies]], the lion, as a symbol of strength, is usually reserved for men. At the feet of women, there usually is a dog, as a sign of loyalty. The fact, that Cunigunde was also assigned a lion, is a reference of posterity to the duchess, queen and empress, who exercises her own sovereign rights.<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014). ''Die heilige Kaiserin Kunigunde von Luxemburg''. Trier: Verlag Michael Weyand. p.32.</ref> The ''Roude Leiw'' (meaning \"red lion\" in Luxembourgish)is also the coat of arms of Luxembourg since 1235-1239. Three of the four sides of the Tumba are decorated with scenic reliefs and architectural ornaments. Those depict events from the legends of the Saints. Cunigunde is depicted as a miraculous Saint in the \"Ploughshare test\" and the \"Key miracle\".<ref>https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/Riemenschneider,_Tilman:_Kaisergrabmal_im_Bamberger_Dom</ref>\n\nIn Luxembourg, where she is the only female Saint, there is the parish Church of Saint Cunigunde in [[Clausen, Luxembourg|Clausen]], which was consecrated in 1865 and decorated with murals depicting scenes from the life of Cunigunde in 1906. In 1959, the Cunigunde bell (''Cloche St. Cun\u00e9gonde'') was consecrated. In addition to a wooden sculpture of the Saints, a tooth [[relic]] of Cunigunde is worshipped in this church.<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014). ''Die heilige Kaiserin Kunigunde von Luxemburg''. Trier: Verlag Michael Weyand. p.33.</ref> There is also an octagonal Cunigunde Chapel in Heiderscheidergrund (''Heischtergronn''), built in 1848-1852. A statue is located there to the left of the main altar.<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014). ''Die heilige Kaiserin Kunigunde von Luxemburg''. Trier: Verlag Michael Weyand. p.34.</ref> There are two churches consecrated to her in the parish of Park Hosingen, the chapel of the village of Oberschlinder dedicated to her and the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] in 1875, and the church of Hoscheid-Dickt in 1852, which is also the oldest church in Luxembourg dedicated to the Holy Empress.<ref>Hirschmann, Frank G. & Mar\u00e9chal, Romain (2014).

The reduced coping ability of tissues treated with ZnPP also increases radiosensitivity.<ref name=\":4\">Zhang, W., Qiao, T., & Zha, L.
