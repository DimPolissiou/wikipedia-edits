It also benefited from its strategic importance on the main route between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], as well as from its control of the shipping route from [[Crimea]]. The city of Sestos was the main crossing-point on the [[Hellespont]].\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the Thracian tribe of Dolonci ({{lang-el|\u0394\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9}}) (or \"barbarians\" according to Cornelius Nepos) held possession of Chersonesus before the Greek colonization.

He took authority over the entire peninsula, building up its defences against incursions from the mainland. It eventually passed to his nephew, the more famous [[Miltiades the Younger]], around 524 BC. The peninsula was abandoned to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in 493 BC after the outbreak of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499\u2013478 BC).\n\nThe Persians were eventually expelled, after which the peninsula was for a time ruled over by Athens, which enrolled it into the [[Delian League]] in 478 BC. The Athenians established a number of [[cleruchy|cleruchies]] on the Thracian Chersonese and sent an additional 1,000 settlers around 448 BC. Sparta gained control after the decisive battle of [[Aegospotami]] in 404 BC, but the peninsula subsequently reverted to the Athenians. In the 4th century BC, the Thracian Chersonese became the focus of a bitter territorial dispute between Athens and [[Macedon]], whose king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] sought possession. It was eventually ceded to Philip in 338 BC.\n\nAfter the death of Philip's son [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, the Thracian Chersonese became the object of contention among [[Diadochi|Alexander's successors]]. [[Lysimachus]] established his capital [[Lysimachia (Thrace)|Lysimachia]] here. In 278 BC, Celtic tribes from [[Galatia]] in Asia Minor settled in the area. In 196 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] seized the peninsula. This alarmed the Greeks and prompted them to seek the aid of the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], who conquered the Thracian Chersonese, which they gave to their ally [[Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamon]] in 188 BC. At the extinction of the [[Attalid dynasty]] in 133 BC it passed again to the Romans, who from 129 BC administered it in the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. It was subsequently made a state-owned territory (''ager publicus'') and during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]] it was imperial property.\n\nThe Thracian Chersonese was part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from its foundation in 330 AD. In 443 AD, [[Attila the Hun]] invaded the Gallipoli Peninsula during one of the last stages of his grand campaign that year. He captured both Callipolis and Sestus.<ref>{{cite book| title =Attila the Hun: Barbarian Terror and the Fall of the Roman Empire| url = https://books.google.gr/books?id=f-YN6NwHqq4C| publisher = Vintage | page = 105| isbn = 978-1844139156| date = 2011}}</ref> Aside from a brief period from 1204 to 1235, when it was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] ruled the territory until 1356.

The Ottomans set up defensive fortifications along the peninsula and contained the invading forces.\n\nIn early 1915, attempting to seize a strategic advantage in World War I by capturing [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]), the British authorised an attack on the peninsula by French, British and British Empire forces.

After eight months of heavy fighting the last Allied soldiers withdrew by 9 January 1916.\n\nThe campaign, one of the greatest [[Ottoman Empire| Ottoman]] victories during the war, is considered by historians as a major [[Allies of World War I| Allied]] failure. [[Turkey | Turks]] regard it as a defining moment in their nation's history: a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]]{{cn|date=September 2019}} and the founding of the Republic of Turkey{{cn|date=September 2019}} eight years later under President [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who first rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire instituted the [[Gallipoli Star (Ottoman Empire)| Gallipoli Star]] as a military decoration  in 1915 and awarded it throughout the rest of World War I.\n\nThe campaign was the first major military action of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (or [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps | Anzacs]]) as independent [[dominion]]s, and is often considered{{by whom?|date=September 2019}} to mark the birth of national consciousness in those nations. The date of the landing, 25 April, is known as \"[[Anzac Day]]\".

The peninsula was renowned for its [[wheat]]. It also benefited from its strategic importance on the main route between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], as well as from its control of the shipping route from [[Crimea]]. The city of Sestos was the main crossing-point on the [[Hellespont]].\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the Thracian tribe of Dolonci ({{lang-el|\u0394\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9}}) (or \"barbarians\" according to Cornelius Nepos) held possession of Chersonesus before the Greek colonization.

He took authority over the entire peninsula, building up its defences against incursions from the mainland. It eventually passed to his nephew, the more famous [[Miltiades the Younger]], around 524 BC. The peninsula was abandoned to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in 493 BC after the outbreak of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499\u2013478 BC).\n\nThe Persians were eventually expelled, after which the peninsula was for a time ruled over by Athens, which enrolled it into the [[Delian League]] in 478 BC. The Athenians established a number of [[cleruchy|cleruchies]] on the Thracian Chersonese and sent an additional 1,000 settlers around 448 BC. Sparta gained control after the decisive battle of [[Aegospotami]] in 404 BC, but the peninsula subsequently reverted to the Athenians. In the 4th century BC, the Thracian Chersonese became the focus of a bitter territorial dispute between Athens and [[Macedon]], whose king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] sought possession. It was eventually ceded to Philip in 338 BC.\n\nAfter the death of Philip's son [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, the Thracian Chersonese became the object of contention among [[Diadochi|Alexander's successors]]. [[Lysimachus]] established his capital [[Lysimachia (Thrace)|Lysimachia]] here. In 278 BC, Celtic tribes from [[Galatia]] in Asia Minor settled in the area. In 196 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] seized the peninsula. This alarmed the Greeks and prompted them to seek the aid of the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], who conquered the Thracian Chersonese, which they gave to their ally [[Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamon]] in 188 BC. At the extinction of the [[Attalid dynasty]] in 133 BC it passed again to the Romans, who from 129 BC administered it in the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. It was subsequently made a state-owned territory (''ager publicus'') and during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]] it was imperial property.\n\nThe Thracian Chersonese was part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from its foundation in 330 AD. In 443 AD, [[Attila the Hun]] invaded the Gallipoli Peninsula during one of the last stages of his grand campaign that year. He captured both Callipolis and Sestus.<ref>{{cite book| title =Attila the Hun: Barbarian Terror and the Fall of the Roman Empire| url = https://books.google.gr/books?id=f-YN6NwHqq4C| publisher = Vintage | page = 105| isbn = 978-1844139156| date = 2011}}</ref> Aside from a brief period from 1204 to 1235, when it was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] ruled the territory until 1356.

The Ottomans set up defensive fortifications along the peninsula and contained the invading forces.\n\nIn early 1915, attempting to seize a strategic advantage in World War I by capturing [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]), the British authorised an attack on the peninsula by French, British and British Empire forces. The first Australian troops landed at [[ANZAC Cove]] early in the morning of 25 April 1915. After eight months of heavy fighting the last Allied soldiers withdrew by 9 January 1916.\n\nThe campaign, one of the greatest [[Ottoman Empire| Ottoman]] victories during the war, is considered by historians as a major [[Allies of World War I| Allied]] failure. [[Turkey | Turks]] regard it as a defining moment in their nation's history: a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]]{{cn|date=September 2019}} and the founding of the Republic of Turkey{{cn|date=September 2019}} eight years later under President [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who first rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire instituted the [[Gallipoli Star (Ottoman Empire)| Gallipoli Star]] as a military decoration  in 1915 and awarded it throughout the rest of World War I.\n\nThe campaign was the first major military action of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (or [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps | Anzacs]]) as independent [[dominion]]s, and is often considered{{by whom?|date=September 2019}} to mark the birth of national consciousness in those nations. The date of the landing, 25 April, is known as \"[[Anzac Day]]\".

His mother attempted to get him interested in playing the violin.<ref>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 22.</ref> A classic story is that he tried to hide his pugilistic ambitions from his mother by carrying his boxing gloves inside his violin case.\n\nLouis made his debut in early 1932 at the age of 17. Legend has it that before the fight, the barely literate Louis wrote his name so large that there was no room for his last name, and thus became known as \"Joe Louis\" for the remainder of his boxing career. More likely, Louis simply omitted his last name to keep his boxing a secret from his mother. After this debut\u2014a loss to future Olympian Johnny Miler\u2014Louis compiled numerous amateur victories, eventually winning the club championship of his Brewster Street recreation centre, the home of many aspiring [[Golden Gloves]] fighters.\n\nIn 1933, Louis won the Detroit-area Golden Gloves Novice Division championship against Joe Biskey for the light heavyweight classification. He later lost in the Chicago Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions. The next year, competing in the Golden Gloves' Open Division, he won the light heavyweight classification, this time also winning the Chicago Tournament of Champions. However, a hand injury forced Louis to miss the New York/Chicago Champions' cross-town bout for the ultimate Golden Gloves championship. In April 1934, he followed up his [[Chicago]] performance by winning the [[United States national amateur boxing championships|United States Amateur Champion National AAU tournament]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].\n\nBy the end of his amateur career, Louis's record was 50\u20133, with 43 knockouts.\n\n==Professional career==\n\nJoe Louis had only three losses in his 69 professional fights. He tallied 52 knockouts and held the championship from 1937 to 1949, the longest span of any heavyweight titleholder. After returning from retirement, Louis failed to regain the championship in 1950, and his career ended after he was knocked out by [[Rocky Marciano]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nagler |first=Barney |title=Joe Louis The Brown Bomber |url=http://www.thesportgallery.com/blog/sport-articles/the-brown-bomber-2/ |work=Sport Magazine Article |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028161153/http://www.thesportgallery.com/blog/sport-articles/the-brown-bomber-2/ |archivedate=October 28, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Early years===\n\nLouis's amateur performances attracted the interest of professional promoters, and he was soon represented by a black Detroit-area bookmaker named John Roxborough. As Louis explained in his autobiography, Roxborough convinced the young fighter that white managers would have no real interest in seeing a black boxer work his way up to title contention:\n\n<blockquote>[Roxborough] told me about the fate of most black fighters, ones with white managers, who wound up burned-out and broke before they reached their prime. The white managers were not interested in the men they were handling but in the money they could make from them. They didn't take the proper time to see that their fighters had a proper training, that they lived comfortably, or ate well, or had some pocket change. Mr. Roxborough was talking about Black Power before it became popular. \n</blockquote>\n  \nRoxborough knew a Chicago area boxing promoter named Julian Black who already had a stable of mediocre boxers against which Louis could hone his craft, this time in the heavyweight division. After becoming part of the management team, Black hired fellow Chicago native Jack \"Chappy\" Blackburn as Louis's trainer. Louis' initial professional fights were all in the Chicago area, his professional debut coming on July 4, 1934, against Jack Kracken in the Bacon Casino on Chicago's south side. Louis earned $59 for knocking out Kracken in the first round. $59.00 in 1934 is equivalent to $1,148.60 in 2020 dollars. Louis won all 12 of his professional fights that year, 10 by knockout.\n\nIn September 1934, while promoting a Detroit-area \"coming home\" bout for Louis against Canadian Alex Borchuk, Roxborough was pressured by members of the Michigan State Boxing Commission to have Louis sign with white management. Roxborough refused and continued advancing Louis's career with bouts against heavyweight contenders Art Sykes and Stanley Poreda.\n\nWhen training for a fight against Lee Ramage, Louis noticed a young female secretary for the black newspaper at the gym. After Ramage was defeated, the secretary, Marva Trotter, was invited to the celebration party at Chicago's Grand Hotel. Trotter later became Louis's first wife in 1935.\n\nDuring this time, Louis also met [[Truman Gibson]], the man who would become his personal lawyer. As a young associate at a law firm hired by Julian Black, Gibson was charged with personally entertaining Louis during the pendency of business deals.\n\n===Title contention===\nAlthough Louis' management was finding him bouts against legitimate heavyweight contenders, no path to the title was forthcoming. While professional boxing was not officially segregated, many white Americans had become wary of the prospect of another black champion in the wake of [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s highly unpopular (among whites) \"reign\" atop the heavyweight division.<ref name=deardorff>{{cite news |url=http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/ethnicity-race-racism/1285818-1.html |title=Joe Louis became both a black hero and a national symbol to whites after overcoming racism in the media |date=October 1, 1995 |work=St. Louis Journalism Review |last=Deardorff, II |first=Don |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226224232/http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/ethnicity-race-racism/1285818-1.html |archivedate=February 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  During an era of severe anti-black repression, Jack Johnson's unrepentant masculinity and marriage to a white woman engendered an enormous backlash that greatly limited opportunities of black fighters in the heavyweight division. Black boxers were denied championship bouts, and there were few heavyweight black contenders at the time, though there were African Americans who fought for titles in other weight divisions, and a few notable black champions, such as [[Tiger Flowers]]. Louis and his handlers would counter the legacy of Johnson by emphasizing the Brown Bomber's modesty and sportsmanship.<ref name=deardorff/><ref>[[#Erenberg|Erenberg]], p. 33.</ref> Biographer Gerald Astor stated that \"Joe Louis' early boxing career was stalked by the specter of Jack Johnson\".<ref name=deardorff/><ref>[[#Astor|Astor]], p. 47.</ref>\n\nIf Louis were to rise to national prominence among such cultural attitudes, a change in management would be necessary. In 1935, boxing promoter [[Mike Jacobs (boxing)|Mike Jacobs]] sought out Louis' handlers. After Louis' narrow defeat of Natie Brown on March 29, 1935, Jacobs and the Louis team met at the Frog Club, a black nightclub, and negotiated a three-year exclusive boxing promotion deal.<ref>[[#Vitale|Vitale]], pp. 91\u201392.</ref> The contract, however, did not keep Roxborough and Black from attempting to cash in as Louis' managers; when Louis turned 21 on May 13, 1935, Roxborough and Black each signed Louis to an onerous long-term contract that collectively dedicated half of Louis' future income to the pair.<ref name=pbsrox>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/fight/peopleevents/p_managers.html |title=American Experience: John Roxborough and Julian Black |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBlack and Roxborough continued to carefully and deliberately shape Louis' media image. Mindful of the tremendous public backlash Johnson had suffered for his unapologetic attitude and flamboyant lifestyle, they drafted \"Seven Commandments\" for Louis' personal conduct.

The bout that helped put him in the media spotlight occurred on June 25, when Louis knocked out 6'6\", 265-pound former world heavyweight champion [[Primo Carnera]] in six rounds. Foreshadowing the Louis\u2013Schmeling rivalry to come, the Carnera bout featured a political dimension. Louis' victory over Carnera, who symbolized [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime in the popular eye, was seen as a victory for the international community, particularly among African Americans, who were sympathetic to [[Ethiopia]], which was attempting to maintain its independence by [[Abyssinia Crisis|fending off an invasion by fascist Italy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Reader's Companion to American History |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton-Mifflin |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KrWDw-_devcC&pg=PA680&dq=%22joe+louis%22 |editor1=Eric Foner |editor2=John A.

[[#Bak|Bak]], pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n \t\nHelping the white press to overcome its reluctance to feature a black contender was the fact that in the mid-1930s boxing desperately needed a marketable hero. Since the retirement of [[Jack Dempsey]] in 1929, the sport had devolved into a sordid mixture of poor athletes, gambling, fixed fights, thrown matches, and control of the sport by organized crime.<ref name=deardorff/> ''[[New York Times]]'' Columnist Edward Van Ness wrote, \"Louis ... is a boon to boxing. Just as Dempsey led the sport out of the doldrums ... so is Louis leading the boxing game out of a slump.\"<ref name=deardorff/> Likewise, biographer [[Bill Libby]] asserted that \"The sports world was hungry for a great champion when Louis arrived in New York in 1935.\"<ref name=deardorff/><ref name=\"Libbyp61\">[[Joe Louis#Libby|Libby]], p. 61.</ref>\n\t  \t\nWhile the mainstream press was beginning to embrace Louis, many still opposed the prospect of another black heavyweight champion. In September 1935, on the eve of Louis' fight with former titleholder [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] sportswriter [[Shirley Povich]] wrote about some Americans' hopes for the white contender, \"They say Baer will surpass himself in the knowledge that he is the lone white hope for the defense of Nordic superiority in the prize ring.\"<ref name=\"deardorff\" /> However, the hopes of white suprematists would soon be dashed.\n\nAlthough Baer had been knocked down only once before in his professional career (by [[Frankie Campbell]]), Louis dominated the former champion, knocking him out in the fourth round. Unknowingly, Baer suffered from a unique disadvantage in the fight; earlier that evening, Louis had married Marva Trotter at a friend's apartment and was eager to end the fight in order to consummate the relationship.<ref>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 94.</ref> Later that year, Louis also knocked out [[Paolino Uzcudun]], who had never been knocked down before.\n\n===Louis vs. Schmeling I===\n[[File:Joe Louis - Max Schmeling - 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Louis vs. Schmeling, 1936]]\n{{Main|Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling}}\n\nBy this time, Louis was ranked as the No. 1 contender in the heavyweight division<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/96920-joe-louis-barrow-boxing-day-tribute |title=Joe Louis Barrow: Boxing Day Tribute |first=Stoker |last=MacIntosh |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612022722/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/96920-joe-louis-barrow-boxing-day-tribute |archivedate=June 12, 2009 }}</ref> and had won the [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Associated Press' \"Athlete of the Year\"]] award for 1935.<ref name=jrank>{{cite web |url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/2931/Louis-Joe-Brown-Bomber.html |title=JRank.org: Joe Louis \u2013 the brown bomber |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref> What was considered to be a final tune-up bout before an eventual title shot was scheduled for June 1936 against [[Max Schmeling]].

Braddock]], who had unexpectedly defeated [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] for the heavyweight title the previous June. [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] (MSG) had a contract with Braddock for the title defense and also sought a Braddock\u2013Schmeling title bout. But Jacobs and Braddock's manager [[Joe Gould (manager)|Joe Gould]] had been planning a Braddock\u2013Louis matchup for months.<ref name=Schaap>Schaap, p. 271.</ref> \n[[File:Joe Louis cph.3b09981.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis in 1937]]\nSchmeling's victory gave Gould tremendous leverage, however.  If he were to offer Schmeling the title chance instead of Louis, there was a very real possibility that Nazi authorities would never allow Louis a shot at the title.<ref name=Schaap/> Gould's demands were therefore onerous: Jacobs would have to pay 10% of all future boxing promotion profits (including any future profits from Louis's future bouts) for ten years.<ref name=Bakp127/> Braddock and Gould would eventually receive more than $150,000 from this arrangement.<ref name=Bakp127/> Well before the actual fight, Jacobs and Gould publicly announced that their fighters would fight for the heavyweight title on June 22, 1937.<ref name=Bakp127>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 127.</ref> Figuring that the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] would not sanction the fight in deference to MSG and Schmeling, Jacobs scheduled the fight for Chicago.<ref name=Bakp127/>\n\nEach of the parties involved worked to facilitate the controversial Braddock\u2013Louis matchup. Louis did his part by knocking out former champion [[Jack Sharkey]] on August 18, 1936. Meanwhile, Gould trumped up anti-Nazi sentiment against Schmeling,<ref name=Bakp128>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 128.</ref> and Jacobs defended a lawsuit by MSG to halt the Braddock\u2013Louis fight. A federal court in [[Newark, New Jersey]], eventually ruled that Braddock's contractual obligation to stage his title defense at MSG was unenforceable for lack of mutual consideration.<ref name=Bakp128/>\n\nThe stage was set for Louis's title shot. On the night of the fight, June 22, 1937, Braddock was able to knock Louis down in round one, but afterward could accomplish little. After inflicting constant punishment, Louis defeated Braddock in round eight, knocking him out cold with a strong right hand that busted James' teeth through his gum shield and lip and sent him to the ground for a few minutes. It was the first and only time that Braddock was knocked out (the one other stoppage of Braddock's career was a [[Technical knockout|TKO]] due to a cut). Louis's ascent to the world heavyweight championship was complete.\n\nLouis's victory was a seminal moment in African American history. Thousands of African Americans stayed up all night across the country in celebration.<ref name=matters/> Noted author and member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]] [[Langston Hughes]] described Louis's effect in these terms:\n\n<blockquote>Each time Joe Louis won a fight in those depression years, even before he became champion, thousands of black Americans on relief or [[Works Progress Administration|W.P.A.]], and poor, would throng out into the streets all across the land to march and cheer and yell and cry because of Joe's one-man triumphs. No one else in the United States has ever had such an effect on Negro emotions\u2014or on mine.

Shortly after winning the title, he was quoted as saying, \"I don't want to be called champ until I whip Max Schmeling.\"<ref name=hbo/> Louis's manager Mike Jacobs attempted to arrange a rematch in 1937, but negotiations broke down when Schmeling demanded 30% of the gate.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 113.</ref> When Schmeling instead attempted to arrange for a fight against British Empire champion [[Tommy Farr]], known as the \"Tonypandy Terror\",\u2014ostensibly for a world championship to rival the claims of American boxing authorities\u2014Jacobs outmaneuvered him, offering Farr a guaranteed $60,000 to fight Louis instead. The offer was too lucrative for Farr to turn down.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nOn August 30, 1937, after a postponement of four days due to rain, Louis and Farr finally touched gloves at New York's [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] before a crowd of approximately 32,000.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 115.</ref> Louis fought one of the hardest battles of his life. The bout was closely contested and went the entire 15 rounds, with Louis being unable to knock Farr down. Referee Arthur Donovan was even seen shaking Farr's hand after the bout, in apparent congratulation.<ref name=Mylerp116>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 116.</ref> Nevertheless, after the score was announced, Louis had won a controversial unanimous decision.<ref name=Mylerp116/><ref>{{Cite news\n |last        = Bennison\n |first       = Bill\n |title       = Joe Louis vs Tommy Farr\n |newspaper   = Evening Standard (N.Y.)\n |date        = 1937-08-31\n |url         = http://www.boxinggyms.com/news/louis_farr1937/standard_louis1937rounds.htm\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130118183350/http://www.boxinggyms.com/news/louis_farr1937/standard_louis1937rounds.htm\n |archivedate = January 18, 2013\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the scene thus: \"After collecting the judges' votes, referee Arthur Donovan announced that Louis had won the fight on points.

Seven years later, in his published account of the fight, Donovan spoke of the \"mistake\" that may have led to this confusion. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>As Tommy walked back to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I followed him and seized his glove. \"Tommy, a wonderful perform\u2014\" I began ... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I had given him the fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. \"No! No! No!\" realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground ...

Schmeling's hotel was picketed by anti-Nazi protesters in the days before the fight.<ref name=hbo/>\n\nOn the night of June 22, 1938, Louis and Schmeling met for the second time in the boxing ring. The fight was held in Yankee Stadium before a crowd of 70,043. It was broadcast by radio to millions of listeners throughout the world, with radio announcers reporting on the fight in English, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. Before the bout, Schmeling weighed in at 193&nbsp;pounds; Louis weighed in at 198\u00be&nbsp;pounds.<ref name=hbo/>\n\nThe fight lasted two minutes and four seconds.<ref name=ring/> Louis battered Schmeling with a series of swift attacks, forcing him against the ropes and giving him a paralyzing body blow (Schmeling afterward claimed it was an illegal kidney punch). Schmeling was knocked down three times and only managed to throw two punches in the entire bout. On the third knockdown, Schmeling's trainer threw in the towel and referee Arthur Donovan stopped the fight.<ref name=hbo/>\n\n===\"Bum of the Month Club\"===\nIn the 29 months from January 1939 through May 1941, Louis defended his title thirteen times, a frequency unmatched by any heavyweight champion since the end of the bare-knuckle era.

In his autobiography, Joe Louis said:\n\n<blockquote>I made a mistake going into that fight.

By the eighth round, Louis began suffering from dehydration. By the twelfth round, Louis was exhausted, with Conn ahead on two of three boxing scorecards. But against the advice of his corner, Conn continued to closely engage Louis in the later stages of the fight. Louis made the most of the opportunity, knocking Conn out with two seconds left in the thirteenth round.<ref name=eastside2/>\n\nThe contest created an instant rivalry that Louis's career had lacked since the Schmeling era, and a rematch with Conn was planned for late 1942.

Accordingly, Louis used this personal connection to help the cause of various black soldiers with whom he came into contact. In one noted episode, Louis contacted Gibson in order to facilitate the [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS) applications of a group of black recruits at Fort Riley, which had been inexplicably delayed for several months.<ref name=gale/><ref name=\"Gibson, p. 12\">[[#Gibson|Gibson]], p. 12.</ref> Among the OCS applications Louis facilitated was that of a young [[Jackie Robinson]], later to break the [[baseball color barrier]].<ref name=gale>{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/robinson_j.htm |title=Black History Biographies Jackie Robinson |accessdate=November 24, 2008 |publisher=[[Gale (Cengage)|Gale Cenage Learning]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115020111/http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/robinson_j.htm |archivedate=January 15, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=nytimes>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/02/national/02gibson.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |date=January 2, 2006 |title=Truman Gibson, Who Fought Army Segregation, Is Dead at 93 | first=Richard | last=Goldstein | accessdate=2010-05-06}}</ref> The episode spawned a personal friendship between the two men.<ref>{{cite book |title=Jackie Robinson: Strong Inside and Out |last=Patrick |first=Denise L. |year=2005 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=New York |isbn=0-06-057601-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QeNqS4g7AcQC&pg=PT20&dq=jackie+robinson+officer+training+school}}</ref>\n\nRealizing Louis's potential for raising ''esprit de corps'' among the troops, the Army placed him in its Special Services Division rather than sending him into combat.<ref name=afmuseum/> Louis went on a celebrity tour with other notables, including fellow boxer [[Sugar Ray Robinson]].<ref name=si1985/> He traveled more than {{convert|35,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} and staged 96 boxing exhibitions before two million soldiers.<ref name=arlington/> In England during 1944, he was reported to have enlisted as a player for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool Football Club]] as a publicity stunt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rollin |first=Jack |title=Soccer At War: 1935\u201345 |location=London |publisher=Headline |year=2005 |page=184 |isbn=0-7553-1431-X}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Joe louis barrow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Louis in the Army]]\n\nIn addition to his travels, Louis was the focus of a media recruitment campaign encouraging African-American men to enlist in the Armed Services, despite the military's racial segregation. When he was asked about his decision to enter the racially segregated U.S. Army, he said: \"Lots of things wrong with America, but Hitler ain't going to fix them.\" In 1943, Louis made an appearance in the wartime Hollywood musical ''[[This Is the Army]]'', directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]. He appeared as himself in a musical number, \"The Well-Dressed Man in Harlem,\" which emphasized the importance of African-American soldiers and promoted their enlistment.\n\nLouis's celebrity power was not, however, merely directed toward African Americans. In a famous wartime recruitment slogan, he echoed his prior comments of 1942: \"We'll win, because we're on God's side.\" The publicity of the campaign made Louis widely popular stateside, even outside the world of sports.<ref name=matters/> Never before had white Americans embraced a black man as their representative to the world.<ref name=matters/>\n\nAlthough Louis never saw combat, his military service saw challenges of its own. During his travels, he often experienced blatant racism. On one occasion, a military policeman (MP) ordered Louis and Ray Robinson to move their seats to a bench in the rear of an Alabama Army camp bus depot. \"We ain't moving\", said Louis. The MP tried to arrest them, but Louis forcefully argued the pair out of the situation.<ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], p. 238</ref> In another incident, he allegedly had to resort to bribery to persuade a commanding officer to drop charges against Jackie Robinson for punching a captain who had called Robinson a \"nigger.\"<ref name=\"Gibson, p. 12\"/>\n\nLouis was eventually promoted to the rank of [[technical sergeant]] on April 9, 1945. On September 23 of the same year, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] (a military decoration rarely awarded to enlisted soldiers) for \"incalculable contribution to the general morale.\"<ref name=afmuseum/><ref name=answers/> Receipt of the honor qualified him for immediate release from military service on October 1, 1945.<ref name=arlington/><ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], p. 239.</ref>\n\n===Later career and retirement===\nLouis emerged from his wartime service significantly in debt. In addition to his looming tax bill\u2014which had not been finally determined at the time, but was estimated at greater than $100,000<ref name=si1985/>\u2014Jacobs claimed that Louis owed him $250,000.<ref>[[#Ginson|Gibson]], p. 236.</ref>\n\nDespite the financial pressure on Louis to resume boxing, his long-awaited rematch against Billy Conn had to be postponed to the summer of 1946, when weather conditions could accommodate a large outdoor audience. On June 19, a disappointing 40,000 saw the rematch at Yankee Stadium,<ref name=si1985/> in which Louis was not seriously tested. Conn, whose skills had deteriorated during the long layoff, largely avoided contact until being dispatched by knockout in the eighth round. Although the attendance did not meet expectations, the fight was still the most profitable of Louis's career to date. His share of the purse was $600,000, of which Louis' managers got $140,000, his ex-wife $66,000 and the U.S. state of New York $30,000.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nAfter trouble finding another suitable opponent, on December 5, 1947, Louis met [[Jersey Joe Walcott]], a 33-year-old veteran with a 44\u201311\u20132 record. Walcott entered the fight as a 10-to-1 underdog. Nevertheless, Walcott knocked down Louis twice in the first four rounds. Most observers in Madison Square Garden felt Walcott dominated the 15-round fight. When Louis was declared the winner in a split decision, the crowd booed.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nLouis was under no delusion about the state of his boxing skills, yet he was too embarrassed to quit after the Walcott fight. Determined to win and retire with his title intact, Louis signed on for a rematch. On June 25, 1948, about 42,000 people came to Yankee Stadium to see the aging champion, who weighed 213\u00bd, the heaviest of his career to date. Walcott knocked Louis down in the third round, but Louis survived to knock out Walcott in the eleventh.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nLouis would not defend his title again before announcing his retirement from boxing on March 1, 1949.<ref name=cyber/> In his bouts with Conn and Walcott, it had become apparent that Louis was no longer the fighter he had once been. As he had done earlier in his career, however, Louis would continue to appear in numerous exhibition matches worldwide.<ref name=arlington/><ref name=cyber>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jlouis.htm |title=CyberBoxingZone.com:Joe Louis' Professional and exhibition/sparring records |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref> In August 1949 [[Cab Calloway]] rendered homage to the \u201cking of the ring\u201d with his song ''Ol\u2019 Joe Louis''.<ref>Cab Calloway in Chronology, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe80N5Snxmo&list=OLAK5uy_nb5sgXFO6MktnBBkpadhGVAL8InutwBPE&index=4&t=0s ''Ol' Joe Louis (08-18-49)''].</ref>\n\n===Post-retirement comeback===\nAt the time of Louis's initial retirement, the IRS was still completing its investigation of his prior tax returns, which had always been handled by Mike Jacobs's personal accountant.<ref>Gibson, p. 243.</ref> In May 1950, the IRS finished a full audit of Louis's past returns and announced that, with interest and penalties, he owed the government more than $500,000.<ref name=si1985/> Louis had no choice but to return to the ring.\n\nAfter asking Gibson to take over his personal finances and switching his management from Jacobs and Roxborough to Marshall Miles,<ref name=ring/><ref>[[#Roberts|Roberts]], p. 488.</ref> the Louis camp negotiated a deal with the IRS under which Louis would come out of retirement, with all Louis's net proceeds going to the IRS. A match with [[Ezzard Charles]]\u2014who had acquired the vacant heavyweight title in June 1949 by outpointing Walcott\u2014was set for September 27, 1950. By then, Louis was 36 years old and had been away from competitive boxing for two years. Weighing in at 218, Louis was still strong, but his reflexes were gone. Charles repeatedly beat him to the punch. By the end of the fight, Louis was cut above both eyes, one of which was shut tight by swelling.<ref name=ring/> He knew he had lost even before Charles was declared the winner. The result was not the only disappointing aspect of the fight for Louis; only 22,357 spectators paid to witness the event at Yankee Stadium, and his share of the purse was a mere $100,458.<ref name=ring>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fightersfactory.com/story_detail.php?i=33 |title=Joe Louis \u2013 The man who reigned as champion longer than any boxer in modern history |journal=The Ring |date=November 1980 |postscript=<!--None--> }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Louis had to continue fighting.\n\nAfter facing several club-level opponents and scoring an early knockout victory over EBU champion [[Lee Savold]] (also defeating top contender [[Jimmy Bivins]] by unanimous decision), the International Boxing Club guaranteed Louis $300,000 to face undefeated heavyweight contender [[Rocky Marciano]] on October 26, 1951.<ref name=si1985/> Despite his being a 6-to-5 favorite, few boxing insiders believed Louis had a chance.<ref>[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/mccoy2404.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809070332/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/mccoy2404.php |date=August 9, 2012 }}</ref> Marciano himself was reluctant to participate in the bout, but was understanding of Louis's position: \"This is the last guy on earth I want to fight.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Levine |first=Ben |url=http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/media/storage/paper300/news/2008/10/23/Sports/Over-The.Ropes-3506639.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411100138/http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/media/storage/paper300/news/2008/10/23/Sports/Over-The.Ropes-3506639.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |title=Over the ropes |work=The Muehlenberg (College) Weekly |date=October 23, 2008 }}</ref> It was feared, particularly among those who had witnessed Marciano's punching power first-hand, that Louis's unwillingness to quit would result in serious injury.

He reigned as the world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949, and is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. Nicknamed the '''Brown Bomber''', Louis' championship reign lasted 140 consecutive months, during which he participated in 26 championship fights. The 27th fight, against [[Ezzard Charles]] in 1950, was a challenge for Charles' heavyweight title and so is not included in Louis' reign.

His mother attempted to get him interested in playing the violin.<ref>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 22.</ref> A classic story is that he tried to hide his pugilistic ambitions from his mother by carrying his boxing gloves inside his violin case.\n\nLouis made his debut in early 1932 at the age of 17. Legend has it that before the fight, the barely literate Louis wrote his name so large that there was no room for his last name, and thus became known as \"Joe Louis\" for the remainder of his boxing career. More likely, Louis simply omitted his last name to keep his boxing a secret from his mother. After this debut\u2014a loss to future Olympian Johnny Miler\u2014Louis compiled numerous amateur victories, eventually winning the club championship of his Brewster Street recreation centre, the home of many aspiring [[Golden Gloves]] fighters.\n\nIn 1933, Louis won the Detroit-area Golden Gloves Novice Division championship against Joe Biskey for the light heavyweight classification. He later lost in the Chicago Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions. The next year, competing in the Golden Gloves' Open Division, he won the light heavyweight classification, this time also winning the Chicago Tournament of Champions. However, a hand injury forced Louis to miss the New York/Chicago Champions' cross-town bout for the ultimate Golden Gloves championship. In April 1934, he followed up his [[Chicago]] performance by winning the [[United States national amateur boxing championships|United States Amateur Champion National AAU tournament]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].\n\nBy the end of his amateur career, Louis's record was 50\u20133, with 43 knockouts.\n\n==Professional career==\n\nJoe Louis had only three losses in his 69 professional fights. He tallied 52 knockouts and held the championship from 1937 to 1949, the longest span of any heavyweight titleholder. After returning from retirement, Louis failed to regain the championship in 1950, and his career ended after he was knocked out by [[Rocky Marciano]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nagler |first=Barney |title=Joe Louis The Brown Bomber |url=http://www.thesportgallery.com/blog/sport-articles/the-brown-bomber-2/ |work=Sport Magazine Article |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028161153/http://www.thesportgallery.com/blog/sport-articles/the-brown-bomber-2/ |archivedate=October 28, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Early years===\n\nLouis's amateur performances attracted the interest of professional promoters, and he was soon represented by a black Detroit-area bookmaker named John Roxborough. As Louis explained in his autobiography, Roxborough convinced the young fighter that white managers would have no real interest in seeing a black boxer work his way up to title contention:\n\n<blockquote>[Roxborough] told me about the fate of most black fighters, ones with white managers, who wound up burned-out and broke before they reached their prime. The white managers were not interested in the men they were handling but in the money they could make from them. They didn't take the proper time to see that their fighters had a proper training, that they lived comfortably, or ate well, or had some pocket change. Mr. Roxborough was talking about Black Power before it became popular. \n</blockquote>\n  \nRoxborough knew a Chicago area boxing promoter named Julian Black who already had a stable of mediocre boxers against which Louis could hone his craft, this time in the heavyweight division. After becoming part of the management team, Black hired fellow Chicago native Jack \"Chappy\" Blackburn as Louis's trainer. Louis' initial professional fights were all in the Chicago area, his professional debut coming on July 4, 1934, against Jack Kracken in the Bacon Casino on Chicago's south side. Louis earned $59 for knocking out Kracken in the first round. $59.00 in 1934 is equivalent to $1,148.60 in 2020 dollars. Louis won all 12 of his professional fights that year, 10 by knockout.\n\nIn September 1934, while promoting a Detroit-area \"coming home\" bout for Louis against Canadian Alex Borchuk, Roxborough was pressured by members of the Michigan State Boxing Commission to have Louis sign with white management. Roxborough refused and continued advancing Louis's career with bouts against heavyweight contenders Art Sykes and Stanley Poreda.\n\nWhen training for a fight against Lee Ramage, Louis noticed a young female secretary for the black newspaper at the gym. After Ramage was defeated, the secretary, Marva Trotter, was invited to the celebration party at Chicago's Grand Hotel. Trotter later became Louis's first wife in 1935.\n\nDuring this time, Louis also met [[Truman Gibson]], the man who would become his personal lawyer. As a young associate at a law firm hired by Julian Black, Gibson was charged with personally entertaining Louis during the pendency of business deals.\n\n===Title contention===\nAlthough Louis' management was finding him bouts against legitimate heavyweight contenders, no path to the title was forthcoming. While professional boxing was not officially segregated, many white Americans had become wary of the prospect of another black champion in the wake of [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s highly unpopular (among whites) \"reign\" atop the heavyweight division.<ref name=deardorff>{{cite news |url=http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/ethnicity-race-racism/1285818-1.html |title=Joe Louis became both a black hero and a national symbol to whites after overcoming racism in the media |date=October 1, 1995 |work=St. Louis Journalism Review |last=Deardorff, II |first=Don |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226224232/http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/ethnicity-race-racism/1285818-1.html |archivedate=February 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  During an era of severe anti-black repression, Jack Johnson's unrepentant masculinity and marriage to a white woman engendered an enormous backlash that greatly limited opportunities of black fighters in the heavyweight division. Black boxers were denied championship bouts, and there were few heavyweight black contenders at the time, though there were African Americans who fought for titles in other weight divisions, and a few notable black champions, such as [[Tiger Flowers]]. Louis and his handlers would counter the legacy of Johnson by emphasizing the Brown Bomber's modesty and sportsmanship.<ref name=deardorff/><ref>[[#Erenberg|Erenberg]], p. 33.</ref> Biographer Gerald Astor stated that \"Joe Louis' early boxing career was stalked by the specter of Jack Johnson\".<ref name=deardorff/><ref>[[#Astor|Astor]], p. 47.</ref>\n\nIf Louis were to rise to national prominence among such cultural attitudes, a change in management would be necessary. In 1935, boxing promoter [[Mike Jacobs (boxing)|Mike Jacobs]] sought out Louis' handlers. After Louis' narrow defeat of Natie Brown on March 29, 1935, Jacobs and the Louis team met at the Frog Club, a black nightclub, and negotiated a three-year exclusive boxing promotion deal.<ref>[[#Vitale|Vitale]], pp. 91\u201392.</ref> The contract, however, did not keep Roxborough and Black from attempting to cash in as Louis' managers; when Louis turned 21 on May 13, 1935, Roxborough and Black each signed Louis to an onerous long-term contract that collectively dedicated half of Louis' future income to the pair.<ref name=pbsrox>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/fight/peopleevents/p_managers.html |title=American Experience: John Roxborough and Julian Black |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBlack and Roxborough continued to carefully and deliberately shape Louis' media image. Mindful of the tremendous public backlash Johnson had suffered for his unapologetic attitude and flamboyant lifestyle, they drafted \"Seven Commandments\" for Louis' personal conduct. These included:\n\n<blockquote>\n*Never have his picture taken with a white woman\n*Never gloat over a fallen opponent\n*Never engage in fixed fights\n*Live and fight clean<ref name=espn>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016109.html |first=Larry |last=Schwartz |title='Brown Bomber' was a hero to all |accessdate=April 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8iSImJVDkb8C&pg=PA8&dq=%22joe+louis%22+biography |title=Muhammed Ali: A Biography |last=Edmonds |first=Anthony O. |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-313-33092-6 |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated |pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAs a result, Louis was generally portrayed in the white media as a modest, clean-living person, which facilitated his burgeoning celebrity status.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8iSImJVDkb8C&pg=PA8&dq=%22joe+louis%22+biography |title=Muhammed Ali: A Biography |last=Edmonds |first=Anthony O. |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-313-33092-6 |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated |page=9}}</ref>\n\nWith the backing of major promotion, Louis fought thirteen times in 1935. The bout that helped put him in the media spotlight occurred on June 25, when Louis knocked out 6'6\", 265-pound former world heavyweight champion [[Primo Carnera]] in six rounds. Foreshadowing the Louis\u2013Schmeling rivalry to come, the Carnera bout featured a political dimension. Louis' victory over Carnera, who symbolized [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime in the popular eye, was seen as a victory for the international community, particularly among African Americans, who were sympathetic to [[Ethiopia]], which was attempting to maintain its independence by [[Abyssinia Crisis|fending off an invasion by fascist Italy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Reader's Companion to American History |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton-Mifflin |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KrWDw-_devcC&pg=PA680&dq=%22joe+louis%22 |editor1=Eric Foner |editor2=John A.

[[#Bak|Bak]], pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n \t\nHelping the white press to overcome its reluctance to feature a black contender was the fact that in the mid-1930s boxing desperately needed a marketable hero. Since the retirement of [[Jack Dempsey]] in 1929, the sport had devolved into a sordid mixture of poor athletes, gambling, fixed fights, thrown matches, and control of the sport by organized crime.<ref name=deardorff/> ''[[New York Times]]'' Columnist Edward Van Ness wrote, \"Louis ... is a boon to boxing.

In September 1935, on the eve of Louis' fight with former titleholder [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] sportswriter [[Shirley Povich]] wrote about some Americans' hopes for the white contender, \"They say Baer will surpass himself in the knowledge that he is the lone white hope for the defense of Nordic superiority in the prize ring.\"<ref name=\"deardorff\" /> However, the hopes of white suprematists would soon be dashed.\n\nAlthough Baer had been knocked down only once before in his professional career (by [[Frankie Campbell]]), Louis dominated the former champion, knocking him out in the fourth round. Unknowingly, Baer suffered from a unique disadvantage in the fight; earlier that evening, Louis had married Marva Trotter at a friend's apartment and was eager to end the fight in order to consummate the relationship.<ref>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 94.</ref> Later that year, Louis also knocked out [[Paolino Uzcudun]], who had never been knocked down before.\n\n===Louis vs. Schmeling I===\n[[File:Joe Louis - Max Schmeling - 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Louis vs. Schmeling, 1936]]\n{{Main|Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling}}\n\nBy this time, Louis was ranked as the No. 1 contender in the heavyweight division<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/96920-joe-louis-barrow-boxing-day-tribute |title=Joe Louis Barrow: Boxing Day Tribute |first=Stoker |last=MacIntosh |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612022722/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/96920-joe-louis-barrow-boxing-day-tribute |archivedate=June 12, 2009 }}</ref> and had won the [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Associated Press' \"Athlete of the Year\"]] award for 1935.<ref name=jrank>{{cite web |url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/2931/Louis-Joe-Brown-Bomber.html |title=JRank.org: Joe Louis \u2013 the brown bomber |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref> What was considered to be a final tune-up bout before an eventual title shot was scheduled for June 1936 against [[Max Schmeling]].

Braddock]], who had unexpectedly defeated [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] for the heavyweight title the previous June. [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] (MSG) had a contract with Braddock for the title defense and also sought a Braddock\u2013Schmeling title bout. But Jacobs and Braddock's manager [[Joe Gould (manager)|Joe Gould]] had been planning a Braddock\u2013Louis matchup for months.<ref name=Schaap>Schaap, p. 271.</ref> \n[[File:Joe Louis cph.3b09981.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis in 1937]]\nSchmeling's victory gave Gould tremendous leverage, however.  If he were to offer Schmeling the title chance instead of Louis, there was a very real possibility that Nazi authorities would never allow Louis a shot at the title.<ref name=Schaap/> Gould's demands were therefore onerous: Jacobs would have to pay 10% of all future boxing promotion profits (including any future profits from Louis's future bouts) for ten years.<ref name=Bakp127/> Braddock and Gould would eventually receive more than $150,000 from this arrangement.<ref name=Bakp127/> Well before the actual fight, Jacobs and Gould publicly announced that their fighters would fight for the heavyweight title on June 22, 1937.<ref name=Bakp127>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 127.</ref> Figuring that the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] would not sanction the fight in deference to MSG and Schmeling, Jacobs scheduled the fight for Chicago.<ref name=Bakp127/>\n\nEach of the parties involved worked to facilitate the controversial Braddock\u2013Louis matchup. Louis did his part by knocking out former champion [[Jack Sharkey]] on August 18, 1936. Meanwhile, Gould trumped up anti-Nazi sentiment against Schmeling,<ref name=Bakp128>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 128.</ref> and Jacobs defended a lawsuit by MSG to halt the Braddock\u2013Louis fight. A federal court in [[Newark, New Jersey]], eventually ruled that Braddock's contractual obligation to stage his title defense at MSG was unenforceable for lack of mutual consideration.<ref name=Bakp128/>\n\nThe stage was set for Louis's title shot. On the night of the fight, June 22, 1937, Braddock was able to knock Louis down in round one, but afterward could accomplish little. After inflicting constant punishment, Louis defeated Braddock in round eight, knocking him out cold with a strong right hand that busted James' teeth through his gum shield and lip and sent him to the ground for a few minutes. It was the first and only time that Braddock was knocked out (the one other stoppage of Braddock's career was a [[Technical knockout|TKO]] due to a cut). Louis's ascent to the world heavyweight championship was complete.\n\nLouis's victory was a seminal moment in African American history. Thousands of African Americans stayed up all night across the country in celebration.<ref name=matters/> Noted author and member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]] [[Langston Hughes]] described Louis's effect in these terms:\n\n<blockquote>Each time Joe Louis won a fight in those depression years, even before he became champion, thousands of black Americans on relief or [[Works Progress Administration|W.P.A.]], and poor, would throng out into the streets all across the land to march and cheer and yell and cry because of Joe's one-man triumphs.

Shortly after winning the title, he was quoted as saying, \"I don't want to be called champ until I whip Max Schmeling.\"<ref name=hbo/> Louis's manager Mike Jacobs attempted to arrange a rematch in 1937, but negotiations broke down when Schmeling demanded 30% of the gate.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 113.</ref> When Schmeling instead attempted to arrange for a fight against British Empire champion [[Tommy Farr]], known as the \"Tonypandy Terror\",\u2014ostensibly for a world championship to rival the claims of American boxing authorities\u2014Jacobs outmaneuvered him, offering Farr a guaranteed $60,000 to fight Louis instead. The offer was too lucrative for Farr to turn down.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nOn August 30, 1937, after a postponement of four days due to rain, Louis and Farr finally touched gloves at New York's [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] before a crowd of approximately 32,000.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 115.</ref> Louis fought one of the hardest battles of his life.

Seven years later, in his published account of the fight, Donovan spoke of the \"mistake\" that may have led to this confusion. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>As Tommy walked back to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I followed him and seized his glove. \"Tommy, a wonderful perform\u2014\" I began ... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I had given him the fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. \"No! No! No!\" realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground ...

A few weeks before the bout, Louis visited the White House, where President [[Franklin D.

Schmeling's hotel was picketed by anti-Nazi protesters in the days before the fight.<ref name=hbo/>\n\nOn the night of June 22, 1938, Louis and Schmeling met for the second time in the boxing ring. The fight was held in Yankee Stadium before a crowd of 70,043. It was broadcast by radio to millions of listeners throughout the world, with radio announcers reporting on the fight in English, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. Before the bout, Schmeling weighed in at 193&nbsp;pounds; Louis weighed in at 198\u00be&nbsp;pounds.<ref name=hbo/>\n\nThe fight lasted two minutes and four seconds.<ref name=ring/> Louis battered Schmeling with a series of swift attacks, forcing him against the ropes and giving him a paralyzing body blow (Schmeling afterward claimed it was an illegal kidney punch). Schmeling was knocked down three times and only managed to throw two punches in the entire bout. On the third knockdown, Schmeling's trainer threw in the towel and referee Arthur Donovan stopped the fight.<ref name=hbo/>\n\n===\"Bum of the Month Club\"===\nIn the 29 months from January 1939 through May 1941, Louis defended his title thirteen times, a frequency unmatched by any heavyweight champion since the end of the bare-knuckle era. The pace of his title defenses, combined with his convincing wins, earned Louis' opponents from this era the collective nickname \"Bum of the Month Club\".<ref name=espn/> Notables of this lambasted pantheon include:\n\n* world light heavyweight champion [[John Henry Lewis]] who, attempting to move up a weight class, was knocked out in the first round by Louis on January 25, 1939.<ref name=eastside/>\n* \"Two Ton\" [[Tony Galento]], who was able to knock Louis to the canvas with a left hook in the third round of their bout on June 28, 1939, before letting his guard down and being knocked out in the fourth.<ref name=eastside/>\n* Chilean [[Arturo Godoy]], whom Louis fought twice in 1940, on February 9 and June 20.

Of the 12 fighters Louis faced during this period, five were rated by ''The Ring'' as top-10 heavyweights in the year they fought Louis: Galento (overall #2 heavyweight in 1939), Bob Pastor (#3, 1939), Godoy (#3, 1940), Simon (#6, 1941) and Baer (#8, 1941); four others (Musto, Dorazio, Burman and Johnny Paychek) were ranked in the top 10 in a different year.<ref>See BoxRec.com's record of ''The Ring'' magazine's ratings for [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1938 1938], [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1939 1939], [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1940 1940], [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1941 1941], [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1942 1942], and [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1943 1943].</ref>\n\n===Billy Conn fight===\nLouis' string of lightly regarded competition ended with his bout against [[Billy Conn]], the light heavyweight champion and a highly regarded contender.

In his autobiography, Joe Louis said:\n\n<blockquote>I made a mistake going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them to say in the papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did a little roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as possible so I could weigh in under 200&nbsp;pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he'd sting and move.<ref name=eastside2/>\n</blockquote>\n\nConn had the better of the fight through 12 rounds, although Louis was able to stun Conn with a left hook in the fifth, cutting his eye and nose. By the eighth round, Louis began suffering from dehydration. By the twelfth round, Louis was exhausted, with Conn ahead on two of three boxing scorecards. But against the advice of his corner, Conn continued to closely engage Louis in the later stages of the fight. Louis made the most of the opportunity, knocking Conn out with two seconds left in the thirteenth round.<ref name=eastside2/>\n\nThe contest created an instant rivalry that Louis's career had lacked since the Schmeling era, and a rematch with Conn was planned for late 1942.

Slowly, the press began to eliminate its stereotypical racial references when covering Louis and instead treated him as an unqualified sports hero.<ref name=deardorff/> Despite the public relations boon, Louis's charitable fights proved financially costly. Although he saw none of the roughly $90,000 raised by these and other charitable fights, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] later credited these amounts as taxable income paid to Louis.<ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], pp. 234\u2013235.</ref> After the war, the IRS pursued the issue.\n\nFor basic training, Louis was assigned to a segregated cavalry unit based in [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]].

When he was asked about his decision to enter the racially segregated U.S. Army, he said: \"Lots of things wrong with America, but Hitler ain't going to fix them.\" In 1943, Louis made an appearance in the wartime Hollywood musical ''[[This Is the Army]]'', directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]. He appeared as himself in a musical number, \"The Well-Dressed Man in Harlem,\" which emphasized the importance of African-American soldiers and promoted their enlistment.\n\nLouis's celebrity power was not, however, merely directed toward African Americans. In a famous wartime recruitment slogan, he echoed his prior comments of 1942: \"We'll win, because we're on God's side.\" The publicity of the campaign made Louis widely popular stateside, even outside the world of sports.<ref name=matters/> Never before had white Americans embraced a black man as their representative to the world.<ref name=matters/>\n\nAlthough Louis never saw combat, his military service saw challenges of its own. During his travels, he often experienced blatant racism. On one occasion, a military policeman (MP) ordered Louis and Ray Robinson to move their seats to a bench in the rear of an Alabama Army camp bus depot. \"We ain't moving\", said Louis. The MP tried to arrest them, but Louis forcefully argued the pair out of the situation.<ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], p. 238</ref> In another incident, he allegedly had to resort to bribery to persuade a commanding officer to drop charges against Jackie Robinson for punching a captain who had called Robinson a \"nigger.\"<ref name=\"Gibson, p. 12\"/>\n\nLouis was eventually promoted to the rank of [[technical sergeant]] on April 9, 1945. On September 23 of the same year, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] (a military decoration rarely awarded to enlisted soldiers) for \"incalculable contribution to the general morale.\"<ref name=afmuseum/><ref name=answers/> Receipt of the honor qualified him for immediate release from military service on October 1, 1945.<ref name=arlington/><ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], p. 239.</ref>\n\n===Later career and retirement===\nLouis emerged from his wartime service significantly in debt. In addition to his looming tax bill\u2014which had not been finally determined at the time, but was estimated at greater than $100,000<ref name=si1985/>\u2014Jacobs claimed that Louis owed him $250,000.<ref>[[#Ginson|Gibson]], p. 236.</ref>\n\nDespite the financial pressure on Louis to resume boxing, his long-awaited rematch against Billy Conn had to be postponed to the summer of 1946, when weather conditions could accommodate a large outdoor audience. On June 19, a disappointing 40,000 saw the rematch at Yankee Stadium,<ref name=si1985/> in which Louis was not seriously tested. Conn, whose skills had deteriorated during the long layoff, largely avoided contact until being dispatched by knockout in the eighth round. Although the attendance did not meet expectations, the fight was still the most profitable of Louis's career to date. His share of the purse was $600,000, of which Louis' managers got $140,000, his ex-wife $66,000 and the U.S. state of New York $30,000.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nAfter trouble finding another suitable opponent, on December 5, 1947, Louis met [[Jersey Joe Walcott]], a 33-year-old veteran with a 44\u201311\u20132 record. Walcott entered the fight as a 10-to-1 underdog. Nevertheless, Walcott knocked down Louis twice in the first four rounds. Most observers in Madison Square Garden felt Walcott dominated the 15-round fight. When Louis was declared the winner in a split decision, the crowd booed.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nLouis was under no delusion about the state of his boxing skills, yet he was too embarrassed to quit after the Walcott fight. Determined to win and retire with his title intact, Louis signed on for a rematch. On June 25, 1948, about 42,000 people came to Yankee Stadium to see the aging champion, who weighed 213\u00bd, the heaviest of his career to date. Walcott knocked Louis down in the third round, but Louis survived to knock out Walcott in the eleventh.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nLouis would not defend his title again before announcing his retirement from boxing on March 1, 1949.<ref name=cyber/> In his bouts with Conn and Walcott, it had become apparent that Louis was no longer the fighter he had once been. As he had done earlier in his career, however, Louis would continue to appear in numerous exhibition matches worldwide.<ref name=arlington/><ref name=cyber>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jlouis.htm |title=CyberBoxingZone.com:Joe Louis' Professional and exhibition/sparring records |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref> In August 1949 [[Cab Calloway]] rendered homage to the \u201cking of the ring\u201d with his song ''Ol\u2019 Joe Louis''.<ref>Cab Calloway in Chronology, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe80N5Snxmo&list=OLAK5uy_nb5sgXFO6MktnBBkpadhGVAL8InutwBPE&index=4&t=0s ''Ol' Joe Louis (08-18-49)''].</ref>\n\n===Post-retirement comeback===\nAt the time of Louis's initial retirement, the IRS was still completing its investigation of his prior tax returns, which had always been handled by Mike Jacobs's personal accountant.<ref>Gibson, p. 243.</ref> In May 1950, the IRS finished a full audit of Louis's past returns and announced that, with interest and penalties, he owed the government more than $500,000.<ref name=si1985/> Louis had no choice but to return to the ring.\n\nAfter asking Gibson to take over his personal finances and switching his management from Jacobs and Roxborough to Marshall Miles,<ref name=ring/><ref>[[#Roberts|Roberts]], p. 488.</ref> the Louis camp negotiated a deal with the IRS under which Louis would come out of retirement, with all Louis's net proceeds going to the IRS. A match with [[Ezzard Charles]]\u2014who had acquired the vacant heavyweight title in June 1949 by outpointing Walcott\u2014was set for September 27, 1950. By then, Louis was 36 years old and had been away from competitive boxing for two years. Weighing in at 218, Louis was still strong, but his reflexes were gone. Charles repeatedly beat him to the punch. By the end of the fight, Louis was cut above both eyes, one of which was shut tight by swelling.<ref name=ring/> He knew he had lost even before Charles was declared the winner. The result was not the only disappointing aspect of the fight for Louis; only 22,357 spectators paid to witness the event at Yankee Stadium, and his share of the purse was a mere $100,458.<ref name=ring>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fightersfactory.com/story_detail.php?i=33 |title=Joe Louis \u2013 The man who reigned as champion longer than any boxer in modern history |journal=The Ring |date=November 1980 |postscript=<!--None--> }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Louis had to continue fighting.\n\nAfter facing several club-level opponents and scoring an early knockout victory over EBU champion [[Lee Savold]] (also defeating top contender [[Jimmy Bivins]] by unanimous decision), the International Boxing Club guaranteed Louis $300,000 to face undefeated heavyweight contender [[Rocky Marciano]] on October 26, 1951.<ref name=si1985/> Despite his being a 6-to-5 favorite, few boxing insiders believed Louis had a chance.<ref>[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/mccoy2404.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809070332/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/mccoy2404.php |date=August 9, 2012 }}</ref> Marciano himself was reluctant to participate in the bout, but was understanding of Louis's position: \"This is the last guy on earth I want to fight.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Levine |first=Ben |url=http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/media/storage/paper300/news/2008/10/23/Sports/Over-The.Ropes-3506639.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411100138/http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/media/storage/paper300/news/2008/10/23/Sports/Over-The.Ropes-3506639.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |title=Over the ropes |work=The Muehlenberg (College) Weekly |date=October 23, 2008 }}</ref> It was feared, particularly among those who had witnessed Marciano's punching power first-hand, that Louis's unwillingness to quit would result in serious injury.

During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001\u201302 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Arsenal/Arsenal-change-kits.html\n| title=Arsenal Change Kits\n| work=Historical Football Kits\n| publisher=D & M Moor\n| accessdate=27 November 2009\n}}</ref>\nUntil 2014, the away kit was changed every season, and the outgoing away kit became the third-choice kit if a new home kit was being introduced in the same year.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.arsenal.com/the-club/corporate-info/the-club-charter\n| title=Club Charter\n| publisher=Arsenal F.C\n| accessdate=23 October 2009\n}}</ref>\nSince [[Puma SE|Puma]] began manufacturing Arsenal's kits in 2014, new home, away and third kits are released every single season.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/arsenal-puma-kit-puma-to-release-three-new-shirts-every-season-9612371.html\n| title=Puma to release three new shirts every season\n| work=The Independent\n| accessdate=26 April 2017\n| date=17 July 2014\n}}</ref> From the 2019\u201320 season Arsenal's kits will be manufactured by Adidas.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADIDAS AND ARSENAL LAUNCH NEW PARTNERSHIP|url=https://news.adidas.com/football/adidas-and-arsenal-launch-new-partnership-with-2019-20-home-kit/s/a792ee1b-7f39-4f66-a095-a689e151ec5b|publisher=Adidas |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n\n===Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors===\n{| style=\"width:420px; float:Left; padding-right: 1em;\"\n|-\n|valign=top width=90%|\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and [[terrace (stadium)|terracing]], upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894\u201395 season), until the move to north London in 1913.<ref>{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Suspension of the Plumstead Ground |newspaper=The Times |date=7 February 1895 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nWidely referred to as Highbury, [[Arsenal Stadium]] was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.<ref name=\"conservation_plan\"/> The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new [[Art Deco]] West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.<ref name=\"conservation_plan\"/>\n\nHighbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993\u201394 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=The+Club&article=344883&Title=Highbury\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223345/http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=The+Club&article=344883&Title=Highbury\n |archivedate=11 January 2008\n |title=Highbury\n |publisher=Arsenal F.C\n |url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\nThis capacity had to be reduced further during [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], which could house more than 70,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/138932.stm | title=Arsenal get Wembley go-ahead |work=BBC Sport | date=24 July 1998 | accessdate=11 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arsenal Stadium interior North Bank.jpg|thumb|right|The North Bank Stand, [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]|alt=A grandstand at a sports stadium.

The [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]] promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Gunflash'' and the satirical ''Up The Arse!''.
