As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year, the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]]. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\" by ''Southern Business and Development,'' an industry trade publication.\n\nOpelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=mid}} mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses,  TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more.\n\nOpelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.<ref>[https://www.eamc.org/includes/files/annualreport2009.pdf page 14]</ref>\n\nHistoric downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants.\n\nWith industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.<ref>Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804\n.</ref>\n\n[[File:Opelika City Hall Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial in front of Opelika City Hall]]\n\n==Law and government==\nOpelika is governed by a [[mayor-council government]], with a mayor and a five-member [[city council]].\n\nThe chief executive official of the city of Opelika is the mayor. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The mayor has complete executive power in the city, and can appoint and dismiss department heads at will. The current mayor of Opelika is Gary Fuller.\n\nThe Opelika city council is the legislative body of the city. It passes laws and ordinances, and creates citywide policy. The city council is made up of five members, chosen for four-year terms each from one of five districts. Current council members through 2020 are:\n* District 1 - Patricia Jones\n* District 2 - Tiffany Gibson-Pitts\n* District 3 - Dozier Smith T\n* District 4 - Eddie Smith\n* District 5 - David Canon\n\nRecently the city council designated Opelika as a [[City of Character]]. The City of Character program is made to recognize, emphasize and in some cases enforce good character throughout the community as well as mandate character training from [[CharacterFirst!]]. There are 49 character traits emphasized. These traits were designated by [[Bill Gothard]].<ref>[http://www.envisionopelika.org/?p=45 Envision Opelika \u00bb City of Character<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ Character Cities, Counties, and States - International Association of Character Cities<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118225650/http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ |date=2008-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |title=About Us - Character First!<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231171401/http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |archive-date=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOpelika is located in north-central [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]], and is bordered by [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] to the west. Opelika lies in the southern reaches of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]], and straddles the divide between the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] river watersheds.\n\nThe city is located along [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|Interstate 85]], which runs east of the city, with access from exits 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66.\nI-85 leads northeast 101&nbsp;mi (163&nbsp;km) to [[Atlanta]] and southwest 62&nbsp;mi (100&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 280|280]] and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|431]] also run through the city as well, with US 280/431 leading southeast 27&nbsp;mi (43&nbsp;km) to [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]]. After splitting in the city, US 280 leads northwest 28&nbsp;mi (45&nbsp;km) to [[Dadeville, Alabama|Dadeville]], and US 431 leads north 23&nbsp;mi (37&nbsp;km) to [[LaFayette, Alabama|LaFayette]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|53.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|52.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} (1.24%) is water.\n\n==Economy==\nOpelika is located between the Hyundai-Kia automobile manufacturing facilities with the [[Kia Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|18|mi|km}} east on I-85 and the [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama|Hyundai Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|67|mi|km}} west on I-85/I-65.\n\nOpelika's economy has shifted away from a traditional basis in [[textile manufacturing]]. Since 2004, the city has experienced revitalization in many segments of the economy, including commercial, residential and industrial activity. Since January 2005, the City of Opelika has announced new industry investments and existing industry expansions totaling 1.407 billion and 3717 additional jobs.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org</ref>\nProjects include a {{convert|170000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} company named [[Daewon]]. Daewon's investment in Opelika totaled $52.5 million, but a $13 million expansion in 2012 brought their total investment in Opelika to $65.5 million. Along with the additional investment of $13 million, they added 32 more jobs, bringing their total number of jobs to 240. As of June 2019, Daewon has invested a total of $108.5 million and the total number of jobs created to 273.\n\n[[File:Northeast Opelika Industrial Park.jpg|thumb|Northeast Opelika Industrial Park]]\n\nAnother major employer is Baxter International Inc.'s plant in Opelika. Previously known as Gambro Renal Products, the Swedish-based manufacturer of dialyzers for kidney dialysis made the largest single initial investment in Lee County's history of $165.5 million in 2005. The company changed its name to Baxter after merging with Baxter International, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manufactures life-sustaining medical products including dialyzers, which act as filters for patients with end stage renal disease. In August 2014, Baxter announced plans for a $300 million expansion of its state-of-the-art facility in Opelika, that added {{convert|230000|sqft|m2}} and several production lines, and created an additional 200 jobs. As of June 2019, Baxter has a total capital investment of $465.5 million and total job creation is 360.\n\nMando America Corp. has also been very successful in Opelika and continues to grow and prosper. An expansion announcement in April 2012 of approximately $24 million brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to nearly $160 million. Along with the $24 million investment, Mando promised 30 more jobs, increasing the total number of employees to over 600 and making them one of the largest employers in Opelika. In June 2013, Mando announced an additional investment of $35 million for equipment and building improvements over the next three years with plans to hire an additional 67 employees to support the expansion. In 2019, Mando announced an additional $9.6 million expansion and 23 new jobs. This brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to over $218.6 million and their employment total to more than 700. Mando's Opelika operations continue to produce brake calipers and suspension modules to support its customer base located throughout the U.S.\n\nWith a capital investment of $76.5 million, Pharmavite, a global leader and manufacturer of Nature Made dietary supplements began production in January 2013 and created 280 new jobs to Opelika and the surrounding area. As of April 2014, Pharmavite's capital investment in Opelika totaled more than $89 million. In addition, Pharmavite has implemented a third expansion, with a capital investment of $21.6 million and 54 new jobs scheduled over the next three years. In March 2019, Pharmavite announced a $8.9 million expansion and 18 new employees bringing the company's total investment to Opelika's economy to $144 million and the total number of jobs created to a total of 412.\n\nOn April 19, 2012, a 67-acre site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park became a Certified Food Site through Primus Builders, Inc./Garner Economics, LLC. The food site designation experts presented the Opelika Industrial Development Authority with the certification, stating the site is an ideal location for food and beverage processing, cold storage or food distribution facilities. The certification is aimed to attract new food-based companies to the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park and ultimately create additional jobs for the City of Opelika.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Cumberland Plastic Solutions took possession of the former Benteler Automotive facility and invested over $2 million worth of building improvements and repairs to bring the facility up to par as a state-of- the-art injection molding manufacturing plant. Cumberland is a privately held custom injection molding company employing over 150 employees and supplies locale OEMs such as Briggs & Stratton and automotive manufacturers Mercedes, Nissan and BM with various plastic components. The total capital investment as of June 2019 is $23.1 million with 159 jobs created.\n\nOn February 17, 2015, Golden State Foods Corp, one of the largest diversified suppliers to the quick-service restaurant and retail industries, announced its decision to build a new state-of-the-art meat processing facility using the certified food site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park. Mayor Gary Fuller, Secretary of Commerce Greg Canfield, and Alabama Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard made the announcement, along with Golden State Foods Corp company officials by video conference. The capital investment in the facility is estimated to be between $40 and $45 million. Golden State Foods will create 173 new jobs in Opelika. Wayne Morgan, Corporate Vice President, President Meat Group Golden State Foods, said the company selected Opelika as the site for their new facility \"based on the strategic location along I-85, the available workforce and the atmosphere of industry and government cooperation.\" Golden State Foods was established in 1947 and currently serves more than 125,000 restaurants from its 45 locations on five continents. With about 5,000 associates worldwide, Golden State Foods' core businesses include processing and distribution of liquid products, meat products, produce, dairy, and other services, providing a variety of networked solutions for the total supply chain spectrum.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org/Default.asp?ID=660&pg=News&action=view&aid=1469&title=GOLDEN+STATE+FOODS+CORP+LOCATING+IN+OPELIKA</ref> As of June 2019, Golden State Foods has a total capital investment of $77.7 million and has created 173 jobs.\n\nDinan Engineering, a company known for the high-performance aftermarket products it makes for cars, relocated to Opelika, Alabama in April 2018. This addition will bring 13+ jobs to Opelika.\n\nCar Tech, LLC established operations in Opelika, Alabama with a capital investment of $72 million and the agreement to create 200 jobs in Opelika for manufacturing automotive equipment.\n\nYongsan Automotive USA, Inc. established its first U.S. location in Opelika, Alabama with an investment of more than $5.5 million for manufacturing equipment and building improvements and the creation of 150 new jobs over a three-year period. The company leased an existing building on Jeter Avenue in the Fox Run Business Park in March 2019.\n\nIn June 2019, two industries announced expansions in Opelika. West Fraser, Inc., will be constructing a new planer mill, which will increase its manufacturing capabilities. West Fraser is one of the largest lumber manufacturers in the United States, with 45 facilities in Western Canada and the southern U.S. They offer sustainable forestry, high-efficiency wood products. The company plans to invest an additional $43 million. The total investment of West Fraser since 2005 in Opelika's economy as of the June 2019 expansion is $148.3 million. Hanwha will invest an additional $32 million in capital and create 128 new jobs within the next three years. Hanwha has four production bases in the U.S. and manufactures high-quality lightweight composite materials and auto parts. Hanwha, formerly Maxforma Plastics has provided a total capital investment of $122.3 million and has created 518 jobs since 2005.\n\nThe TigerTown retail shopping complex continues to expand its commercial developments with restaurants such as [[Chick-Fil-A]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Olive Garden]].\nTigerTown's most recent additions include PetSmart, Men's Warehouse, Shoe Station, [[Newk's Eatery]], Full Moon Bar-B-Q, and Cook Out. A new development adjacent to Tiger Town has recently been constructed and offers retail and restaurant favorites such as Tazikis, Chipotle and BurgerFi.\n\nOpelika is also  home to AMC Cinema's Tiger 13, a 55,000-square-foot, 13-screen movie theater. The theater includes the \"Big D Digital Experience\", a theater featuring an 80-foot screen with approximately 580 seats.\n\nOpelika has received several honors for its success in attracting new business. In 2004, the city of Opelika's Economic Development Department was named one of the top 10 economic development groups in North America by ''Site Selection'' magazine, a national industry trade publication covering corporate real estate management and economic development.

One part of the reason this area received this ranking is that Opelika is home to Robert Trent Jones Grand National. The site for the course, which hugs the edge of Lake Saugahatchee in Opelika's northwest, was described by Jones as the \"single greatest\" site for a golf complex that he had ever seen. The course, which is considered to be the jewel of Alabama's [[Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail]], has hosted a number of national tournaments, including the 1997 Nike Tour championship, the 1998 LPGA Tournament of Champions, and the 2000 NCAA Men's Division 1 National Championship. \nRobert Trent Jones Grand National also served as the tournament host for the first PGA Tour tournament in Alabama since 1990, the [[Barbasol Championship]], held the same week as [[The Open Championship]].<ref>http://www.pgatour.com/company/2014/08/11/barbasol-championship-pga-tour-2015.html</ref> Another reason that the Auburn-Opelika MSA was named the #1 area for golf in the United States was for the local public golf courses like Indian Pines Golf Course in Opelika. Indian Pines Golf Course is an 18-hole public golf course that has a par 71 course with summer Bermuda grass and a bentgrass/ryegrass mix in the winter.\n\nThe Alabama Recreation and Parks Association awarded the Opelika Sportsplex and Aquatics Center the 2010 Facility of the Year Award for cities with populations of 15,001 people or more.\n\nThe City of Opelika was honored by the Alabama League of Municipalities at the Statewide conference in May, 2010.

The city's governing body set out to make the dream a reality, and soon resolutions were passed by the city council authorizing the city to move forward with the plans.\nOn February 21, 2008, after years of preparation and fundraising, groundbreaking ceremonies were held.  On August 31, 2009 \u2013 on schedule and on budget \u2013 Opelika's new state-of-the-art Sportsplex & Aquatics Center opened its doors to the public.\n\nThe Lewis Cooper Jr. Memorial Library in Opelika received the 2019 Gold Standard Award for Public Libraries.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year, the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]]. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\" by ''Southern Business and Development,'' an industry trade publication.\n\nOpelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=mid}} mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses,  TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more.\n\nOpelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.<ref>[https://www.eamc.org/includes/files/annualreport2009.pdf page 14]</ref>\n\nHistoric downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants.\n\nWith industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.<ref>Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804\n.</ref>\n\n[[File:Opelika City Hall Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial in front of Opelika City Hall]]\n\n==Law and government==\nOpelika is governed by a [[mayor-council government]], with a mayor and a five-member [[city council]].\n\nThe chief executive official of the city of Opelika is the mayor. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The mayor has complete executive power in the city, and can appoint and dismiss department heads at will. The current mayor of Opelika is Gary Fuller.\n\nThe Opelika city council is the legislative body of the city. It passes laws and ordinances, and creates citywide policy. The city council is made up of five members, chosen for four-year terms each from one of five districts. Current council members through 2020 are:\n* District 1 - Patricia Jones\n* District 2 - Tiffany Gibson-Pitts\n* District 3 - Dozier Smith T\n* District 4 - Eddie Smith\n* District 5 - David Canon\n\nRecently the city council designated Opelika as a [[City of Character]]. The City of Character program is made to recognize, emphasize and in some cases enforce good character throughout the community as well as mandate character training from [[CharacterFirst!]]. There are 49 character traits emphasized. These traits were designated by [[Bill Gothard]].<ref>[http://www.envisionopelika.org/?p=45 Envision Opelika \u00bb City of Character<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ Character Cities, Counties, and States - International Association of Character Cities<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118225650/http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ |date=2008-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |title=About Us - Character First!<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231171401/http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |archive-date=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOpelika is located in north-central [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]], and is bordered by [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] to the west. Opelika lies in the southern reaches of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]], and straddles the divide between the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] river watersheds.\n\nThe city is located along [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|Interstate 85]], which runs east of the city, with access from exits 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66.\nI-85 leads northeast 101&nbsp;mi (163&nbsp;km) to [[Atlanta]] and southwest 62&nbsp;mi (100&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 280|280]] and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|431]] also run through the city as well, with US 280/431 leading southeast 27&nbsp;mi (43&nbsp;km) to [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]]. After splitting in the city, US 280 leads northwest 28&nbsp;mi (45&nbsp;km) to [[Dadeville, Alabama|Dadeville]], and US 431 leads north 23&nbsp;mi (37&nbsp;km) to [[LaFayette, Alabama|LaFayette]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|53.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|52.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} (1.24%) is water.\n\n==Economy==\nOpelika is located between the Hyundai-Kia automobile manufacturing facilities with the [[Kia Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|18|mi|km}} east on I-85 and the [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama|Hyundai Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|67|mi|km}} west on I-85/I-65.\n\nOpelika's economy has shifted away from a traditional basis in [[textile manufacturing]]. Since 2004, the city has experienced revitalization in many segments of the economy, including commercial, residential and industrial activity. Since January 2005, the City of Opelika has announced new industry investments and existing industry expansions totaling 1.407 billion and 3717 additional jobs.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org</ref>\nProjects include a {{convert|170000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} company named [[Daewon]]. Daewon's investment in Opelika totaled $52.5 million, but a $13 million expansion in 2012 brought their total investment in Opelika to $65.5 million. Along with the additional investment of $13 million, they added 32 more jobs, bringing their total number of jobs to 240. As of June 2019, Daewon has invested a total of $108.5 million and the total number of jobs created to 273.\n\n[[File:Northeast Opelika Industrial Park.jpg|thumb|Northeast Opelika Industrial Park]]\n\nAnother major employer is Baxter International Inc.'s plant in Opelika. Previously known as Gambro Renal Products, the Swedish-based manufacturer of dialyzers for kidney dialysis made the largest single initial investment in Lee County's history of $165.5 million in 2005. The company changed its name to Baxter after merging with Baxter International, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manufactures life-sustaining medical products including dialyzers, which act as filters for patients with end stage renal disease. In August 2014, Baxter announced plans for a $300 million expansion of its state-of-the-art facility in Opelika, that added {{convert|230000|sqft|m2}} and several production lines, and created an additional 200 jobs. As of June 2019, Baxter has a total capital investment of $465.5 million and total job creation is 360.\n\nMando America Corp. has also been very successful in Opelika and continues to grow and prosper. An expansion announcement in April 2012 of approximately $24 million brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to nearly $160 million. Along with the $24 million investment, Mando promised 30 more jobs, increasing the total number of employees to over 600 and making them one of the largest employers in Opelika. In June 2013, Mando announced an additional investment of $35 million for equipment and building improvements over the next three years with plans to hire an additional 67 employees to support the expansion. In 2019, Mando announced an additional $9.6 million expansion and 23 new jobs. This brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to over $218.6 million and their employment total to more than 700. Mando's Opelika operations continue to produce brake calipers and suspension modules to support its customer base located throughout the U.S.\n\nWith a capital investment of $76.5 million, Pharmavite, a global leader and manufacturer of Nature Made dietary supplements began production in January 2013 and created 280 new jobs to Opelika and the surrounding area. As of April 2014, Pharmavite's capital investment in Opelika totaled more than $89 million. In addition, Pharmavite has implemented a third expansion, with a capital investment of $21.6 million and 54 new jobs scheduled over the next three years. In March 2019, Pharmavite announced a $8.9 million expansion and 18 new employees bringing the company's total investment to Opelika's economy to $144 million and the total number of jobs created to a total of 412.\n\nOn April 19, 2012, a 67-acre site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park became a Certified Food Site through Primus Builders, Inc./Garner Economics, LLC. The food site designation experts presented the Opelika Industrial Development Authority with the certification, stating the site is an ideal location for food and beverage processing, cold storage or food distribution facilities. The certification is aimed to attract new food-based companies to the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park and ultimately create additional jobs for the City of Opelika.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Cumberland Plastic Solutions took possession of the former Benteler Automotive facility and invested over $2 million worth of building improvements and repairs to bring the facility up to par as a state-of- the-art injection molding manufacturing plant. Cumberland is a privately held custom injection molding company employing over 150 employees and supplies locale OEMs such as Briggs & Stratton and automotive manufacturers Mercedes, Nissan and BM with various plastic components. The total capital investment as of June 2019 is $23.1 million with 159 jobs created.\n\nOn February 17, 2015, Golden State Foods Corp, one of the largest diversified suppliers to the quick-service restaurant and retail industries, announced its decision to build a new state-of-the-art meat processing facility using the certified food site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park. Mayor Gary Fuller, Secretary of Commerce Greg Canfield, and Alabama Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard made the announcement, along with Golden State Foods Corp company officials by video conference. The capital investment in the facility is estimated to be between $40 and $45 million. Golden State Foods will create 173 new jobs in Opelika. Wayne Morgan, Corporate Vice President, President Meat Group Golden State Foods, said the company selected Opelika as the site for their new facility \"based on the strategic location along I-85, the available workforce and the atmosphere of industry and government cooperation.\" Golden State Foods was established in 1947 and currently serves more than 125,000 restaurants from its 45 locations on five continents. With about 5,000 associates worldwide, Golden State Foods' core businesses include processing and distribution of liquid products, meat products, produce, dairy, and other services, providing a variety of networked solutions for the total supply chain spectrum.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org/Default.asp?ID=660&pg=News&action=view&aid=1469&title=GOLDEN+STATE+FOODS+CORP+LOCATING+IN+OPELIKA</ref> As of June 2019, Golden State Foods has a total capital investment of $77.7 million and has created 173 jobs.\n\nDinan Engineering, a company known for the high-performance aftermarket products it makes for cars, relocated to Opelika, Alabama in April 2018. This addition will bring 13+ jobs to Opelika.\n\nCar Tech, LLC established operations in Opelika, Alabama with a capital investment of $72 million and the agreement to create 200 jobs in Opelika for manufacturing automotive equipment.\n\nYongsan Automotive USA, Inc. established its first U.S. location in Opelika, Alabama with an investment of more than $5.5 million for manufacturing equipment and building improvements and the creation of 150 new jobs over a three-year period. The company leased an existing building on Jeter Avenue in the Fox Run Business Park in March 2019.\n\nIn June 2019, two industries announced expansions in Opelika. West Fraser, Inc., will be constructing a new planer mill, which will increase its manufacturing capabilities. West Fraser is one of the largest lumber manufacturers in the United States, with 45 facilities in Western Canada and the southern U.S. They offer sustainable forestry, high-efficiency wood products. The company plans to invest an additional $43 million. The total investment of West Fraser since 2005 in Opelika's economy as of the June 2019 expansion is $148.3 million. Hanwha will invest an additional $32 million in capital and create 128 new jobs within the next three years. Hanwha has four production bases in the U.S. and manufactures high-quality lightweight composite materials and auto parts. Hanwha, formerly Maxforma Plastics has provided a total capital investment of $122.3 million and has created 518 jobs since 2005.\n\nThe TigerTown retail shopping complex continues to expand its commercial developments with restaurants such as [[Chick-Fil-A]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Olive Garden]].\nTigerTown's most recent additions include PetSmart, Men's Warehouse, Shoe Station, [[Newk's Eatery]], Full Moon Bar-B-Q, and Cook Out. A new development adjacent to Tiger Town has recently been constructed and offers retail and restaurant favorites such as Tazikis, Chipotle and BurgerFi.\n\nOpelika is also  home to AMC Cinema's Tiger 13, a 55,000-square-foot, 13-screen movie theater. The theater includes the \"Big D Digital Experience\", a theater featuring an 80-foot screen with approximately 580 seats.\n\nOpelika has received several honors for its success in attracting new business. In 2004, the city of Opelika's Economic Development Department was named one of the top 10 economic development groups in North America by ''Site Selection'' magazine, a national industry trade publication covering corporate real estate management and economic development.

In its first year of program participation, Opelika High School had 63 more course enrollments in rigorous AP classes than in the year prior and students earned qualifying scores on 45 AP exams. Driving the increases in student achievement is the implementation of the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE)/A+ College Ready AP Program, which OHS began implementing in 2014. The goals of the program are to boost student enrollment and achievement, particularly for under-represented student groups in rigorous AP courses and to build a pipeline of students better prepared for college and careers.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org/Default.asp?ID=660&pg=News&action=view&aid=1545&title=Opelika+High+School+among+Alabama+Schools+Lauded+as+National+Champions+in+Advanced+Placement</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, renovations and new construction began on Opelika High School.

One part of the reason this area received this ranking is that Opelika is home to Robert Trent Jones Grand National. The site for the course, which hugs the edge of Lake Saugahatchee in Opelika's northwest, was described by Jones as the \"single greatest\" site for a golf complex that he had ever seen. The course, which is considered to be the jewel of Alabama's [[Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail]], has hosted a number of national tournaments, including the 1997 Nike Tour championship, the 1998 LPGA Tournament of Champions, and the 2000 NCAA Men's Division 1 National Championship. \nRobert Trent Jones Grand National also served as the tournament host for the first PGA Tour tournament in Alabama since 1990, the [[Barbasol Championship]], held the same week as [[The Open Championship]].<ref>http://www.pgatour.com/company/2014/08/11/barbasol-championship-pga-tour-2015.html</ref> Another reason that the Auburn-Opelika MSA was named the #1 area for golf in the United States was for the local public golf courses like Indian Pines Golf Course in Opelika. Indian Pines Golf Course is an 18-hole public golf course that has a par 71 course with summer Bermuda grass and a bentgrass/ryegrass mix in the winter.\n\nThe Alabama Recreation and Parks Association awarded the Opelika Sportsplex and Aquatics Center the 2010 Facility of the Year Award for cities with populations of 15,001 people or more.\n\nThe City of Opelika was honored by the Alabama League of Municipalities at the Statewide conference in May, 2010.

In their remarks, league leaders noted \"Your exemplary program demonstrates a strong commitment to improving the quality of life in the City of Opelika...your program exhibits the type of innovation that the National League of Cities is looking to recognize.\"\nThis $32 million, {{convert|75,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} complex is the largest project ever undertaken by the City of Opelika in its 155-year history,  representing the first-ever public-private partnership, with businesses, corporations and private individuals.\nThe idea began with a survey that was conducted in the early 2000s (decade) that concluded that the citizens of Opelika wanted a \"family oriented\" facility that would offer a wide variety of activities where everyone could have fun together. The city's governing body set out to make the dream a reality, and soon resolutions were passed by the city council authorizing the city to move forward with the plans.\nOn February 21, 2008, after years of preparation and fundraising, groundbreaking ceremonies were held.  On August 31, 2009 \u2013 on schedule and on budget \u2013 Opelika's new state-of-the-art Sportsplex & Aquatics Center opened its doors to the public.\n\nThe Lewis Cooper Jr. Memorial Library in Opelika received the 2019 Gold Standard Award for Public Libraries.

It was broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 16 June 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Doctor Who UK airdate announced |work=News |publisher=[[Dreamwatch]] |date=27 February 2007 |url=http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312164215/http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref> It is the first of three episodes that form a linked narrative, followed by \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\" and \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\". The episode serves to re-introduce [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]), an alien villain of the show's original run who previously appeared in the 1996 television movie ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''.\n\nSet close to the [[Heat death of the universe|end of the universe]] 100 trillion years in the future, the episode involves Professor Yana ([[Derek Jacobi]]) attempting to send the last of humanity in a rocket to a place called \"Utopia\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], [[Tenth Doctor|the Doctor]]'s former [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], is stranded on Earth and has based himself in 21st-century Cardiff to wait for the Doctor, knowing the Doctor would eventually land there to refuel with the [[Cardiff Rift]]. The Doctor lands the [[TARDIS]] in Cardiff to refuel. The Doctor sees Jack racing towards the TARDIS and dematerialises. Jack grabs on to the outer shell, causing the TARDIS to fly to the end of the universe trying to shake him off. Jack dies on the journey but revives seconds later as he cannot stay dead. As they explore the planet Malcassairo, the Doctor, Jack, and the Doctor's companion [[Martha Jones|Martha]] encounter Padra, a lone human running for his life from cannibalistic humanoids called the Futurekind.\n\nThe Doctor, Jack, and Martha help Padra reach a missile silo where a rocket intends to transport the last of the human race to \"Utopia\". While there they meet the elderly Professor Yana and his insectoid assistant Chantho. The Professor asks the Doctor to look at their rocket engine to determine why it will not launch, and the Doctor helps him repair it and give it power. During the repairs, the Professor repeatedly hears a rhythmic drumbeat he has heard for as long as he can remember. When the rocket is ready to launch, the refugees board it. One of the Futurekind shorts the system out, filling the room with the rocket couplings with deadly radiation. Jack is enlisted to fix the couplings.\n\nWhile Jack is inside working, the Doctor admits he abandoned Jack purposely because of the immortality [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] granted to Jack. Jack readies the rocket for launch. Martha unintentionally draws attention to the Professor's fob watch, similar to the one which changed the Doctor from a [[Time Lord]] into a human. She rushes to tell the Doctor about the watch as the Professor hears voices coming from it.\n\nThe Doctor initiates the launch sequence of the rocket at the same time that the Professor opens the fob watch. A frantic Doctor runs back to the control room, but the Professor lets the Futurekind inside the silo. Chantho confronts the Professor. He responds that his name is [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. Chantho and the Master both fatally injure each other. An injured Master stumbles into the TARDIS and [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] into a younger form. The Master begins to dematerialise the TARDIS, stranding the Doctor, Jack, and Martha with the Futurekind.\n\n===Continuity===\n\"Utopia\" explains the [[Face of Boe]]'s cryptic message of \"you are not alone\" (y-a-n-a, the source of the Master's human name in this episode) in the episode \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". It referred to the Master, another [[Time Lord]]. The concept of using a fob watch to disguise a [[Time Lord]] as a human was introduced in the two-parter \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\" / \"[[The Family of Blood]]\" earlier this series, when the Doctor hides as a human, John Smith. It becomes crucial in the climax of this episode, used as a plot device to reveal the Master's identity,\n\nThis episode features the return of former companion Jack Harkness, who was left behind by the Doctor during \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) and ended up the main protagonist of the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' before learning of the Doctor's presence in the series 1 finale \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\". Harkness uses the Doctor's severed hand from \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" as a \"Doctor detector\". The hand is encased in a jar that bubbles when the Doctor is near. The hand reappears in the episodes \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[The Last of the Time Lords]]\", \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\", \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\", and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\".\n\nThe episode marks the return of the renegade Time lord known as the Master, who last appeared during the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|television movie]]. It also references the events of \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note01/> \"[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note02/> \"The Parting of the Ways\",<ref group=Note name=Note03/> \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"<ref group=Note name=Note04/> and ''Torchwood'' episode \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\".<ref group=Note name=Note05/> As well, it contains clips from \"The Parting of the Ways\", \"The Christmas Invasion\", \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" and \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\" and audio clips of previous Masters when the Professor's watch is beckoning him to open it, including [[Anthony Ainley]]'s laugh and a line [[Roger Delgado]] spoke in ''[[The D\u00e6mons]]''.<ref name=\"Utopia\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=\"Utopia\" Podcast |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s311_commentary.mp3 |work= |date=16 June 2007|accessdate=9 July 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nDerek Jacobi plays the fifth version of the Master whom the Doctor has encountered on screen, and John Simm is the sixth.<ref name=\"Utopia\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_311.shtml |title=Doctor Who - Fact File - \"Utopia\" |accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> At least one television pundit speculated whether \"Mister Saxon\" was an intentional anagram of \"Master No. Six\" or was perhaps \"a big [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]]\".<ref name=\"master_anagram\">{{Cite web|title=Of a Thursday|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a44695/of-a-thursday.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=1 April 2007|accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> However, when asked, Russell T Davies stated that it was not deliberate.<ref>''Radio Times'' 30 June\u20136 July 2007: ''Doctor Who'' Watch</ref><ref>''Doctor Who Magazine'' issue 384: ''Return of the Master''</ref> Jacobi also played the Master in the [[Shalka Doctor|alternate Ninth Doctor]] story ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''. Since 2017, Jacobi has since reprised the role due to popular demand for several Doctor Who audio dramas for [[Big Finish Productions]] beginning with [[\"The War Master\"]].\n\nThe episode marks the first time the Master has been shown undergoing regeneration; previous serials have shown two natural incarnations of the Master (the incarnation played by Roger Delgado opposite [[Jon Pertwee]]'s Doctor, and the final incarnation first seen in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976), and subsequently appearing in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]''). In ''The Keeper of Traken'' (1981), as a way of extending his life beyond the end of his final natural incarnation, the Master appropriates someone else's body; he does this again in [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 TV movie]]. In the following episode, \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", the Master states that the Time Lords resurrected him to serve as a soldier in the Time War, presumably giving him a new body with a new set of regenerations (which had previously been alluded to in ''[[The Five Doctors]]''). This is the second episode to show a Time Lord other than the Doctor regenerating on screen (and the first of the revived series), the first being the regeneration of K'anpo in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974); although [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] regenerated in the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), this process was depicted off screen.\n\nThe Master continually hears the sound of drums throughout this episode; this continues through \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\" and becomes a plot point in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was announced as the first of a three-part story in ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]'', broadcast the day before. Prior to this, only the following two instalments had been linked.  Later reference material, including ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'''s season poll, treated the three episodes as a single three-part story.  Russell T Davies has said that he regards \"Utopia\" as a separate story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Davies |first=Russell T |authorlink=Russell T Davies |date=4 March 2009|title=Production Notes |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=406 |page=4 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]] |quote=And I certainly feel the Series Three climax was two stories, no matter what the '''DWM''' season poll says.

The episode serves to re-introduce [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]), an alien villain of the show's original run who previously appeared in the 1996 television movie ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''.\n\nSet close to the [[Heat death of the universe|end of the universe]] 100 trillion years in the future, the episode involves Professor Yana ([[Derek Jacobi]]) attempting to send the last of humanity in a rocket to a place called \"Utopia\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], [[Tenth Doctor|the Doctor]]'s former [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], is stranded on Earth and has based himself in 21st-century Cardiff to wait for the Doctor, knowing the Doctor would eventually land there to refuel with the [[Cardiff Rift]]. The Doctor lands the [[TARDIS]] in Cardiff to refuel. The Doctor sees Jack racing towards the TARDIS and dematerialises. Jack grabs on to the outer shell, causing the TARDIS to fly to the end of the universe trying to shake him off. Jack dies on the journey but revives seconds later as he cannot stay dead. As they explore the planet Malcassairo, the Doctor, Jack, and the Doctor's companion [[Martha Jones|Martha]] encounter Padra, a lone human running for his life from cannibalistic humanoids called the Futurekind.\n\nThe Doctor, Jack, and Martha help Padra reach a missile silo where a rocket intends to transport the last of the human race to \"Utopia\". While there they meet the elderly Professor Yana and his insectoid assistant Chantho. The Professor asks the Doctor to look at their rocket engine to determine why it will not launch, and the Doctor helps him repair it and give it power. During the repairs, the Professor repeatedly hears a rhythmic drumbeat he has heard for as long as he can remember. When the rocket is ready to launch, the refugees board it. One of the Futurekind shorts the system out, filling the room with the rocket couplings with deadly radiation. Jack is enlisted to fix the couplings.\n\nWhile Jack is inside working, the Doctor admits he abandoned Jack purposely because of the immortality [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] granted to Jack. Jack readies the rocket for launch. Martha unintentionally draws attention to the Professor's fob watch, similar to the one which changed the Doctor from a [[Time Lord]] into a human. She rushes to tell the Doctor about the watch as the Professor hears voices coming from it.\n\nThe Doctor initiates the launch sequence of the rocket at the same time that the Professor opens the fob watch. A frantic Doctor runs back to the control room, but the Professor lets the Futurekind inside the silo. Chantho confronts the Professor. He responds that his name is [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. Chantho and the Master both fatally injure each other. An injured Master stumbles into the TARDIS and [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] into a younger form. The Master begins to dematerialise the TARDIS, stranding the Doctor, Jack, and Martha with the Futurekind.\n\n===Continuity===\n\"Utopia\" explains the [[Face of Boe]]'s cryptic message of \"you are not alone\" (y-a-n-a, the source of the Master's human name in this episode) in the episode \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". It referred to the Master, another [[Time Lord]]. The concept of using a fob watch to disguise a [[Time Lord]] as a human was introduced in the two-parter \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\" / \"[[The Family of Blood]]\" earlier this series, when the Doctor hides as a human, John Smith. It becomes crucial in the climax of this episode, used as a plot device to reveal the Master's identity,\n\nThis episode features the return of former companion Jack Harkness, who was left behind by the Doctor during \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) and ended up the main protagonist of the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' before learning of the Doctor's presence in the series 1 finale \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\". Harkness uses the Doctor's severed hand from \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" as a \"Doctor detector\". The hand is encased in a jar that bubbles when the Doctor is near. The hand reappears in the episodes \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[The Last of the Time Lords]]\", \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\", \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\", and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\".\n\nThe episode marks the return of the renegade Time lord known as the Master, who last appeared during the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|television movie]]. It also references the events of \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note01/> \"[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note02/> \"The Parting of the Ways\",<ref group=Note name=Note03/> \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"<ref group=Note name=Note04/> and ''Torchwood'' episode \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\".<ref group=Note name=Note05/> As well, it contains clips from \"The Parting of the Ways\", \"The Christmas Invasion\", \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" and \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\" and audio clips of previous Masters when the Professor's watch is beckoning him to open it, including [[Anthony Ainley]]'s laugh and a line [[Roger Delgado]] spoke in ''[[The D\u00e6mons]]''.<ref name=\"Utopia\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=\"Utopia\" Podcast |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s311_commentary.mp3 |work= |date=16 June 2007|accessdate=9 July 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nDerek Jacobi plays the fifth version of the Master whom the Doctor has encountered on screen, and John Simm is the sixth.<ref name=\"Utopia\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_311.shtml |title=Doctor Who - Fact File - \"Utopia\" |accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> At least one television pundit speculated whether \"Mister Saxon\" was an intentional anagram of \"Master No. Six\" or was perhaps \"a big [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]]\".<ref name=\"master_anagram\">{{Cite web|title=Of a Thursday|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a44695/of-a-thursday.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=1 April 2007|accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> However, when asked, Russell T Davies stated that it was not deliberate.<ref>''Radio Times'' 30 June\u20136 July 2007: ''Doctor Who'' Watch</ref><ref>''Doctor Who Magazine'' issue 384: ''Return of the Master''</ref> Jacobi also played the Master in the [[Shalka Doctor|alternate Ninth Doctor]] story ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nThe episode marks the first time the Master has been shown undergoing regeneration; previous serials have shown two natural incarnations of the Master (the incarnation played by Roger Delgado opposite [[Jon Pertwee]]'s Doctor, and the final incarnation first seen in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976), and subsequently appearing in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]''). In ''The Keeper of Traken'' (1981), as a way of extending his life beyond the end of his final natural incarnation, the Master appropriates someone else's body; he does this again in [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 TV movie]]. In the following episode, \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", the Master states that the Time Lords resurrected him to serve as a soldier in the Time War, presumably giving him a new body with a new set of regenerations (which had previously been alluded to in ''[[The Five Doctors]]''). This is the second episode to show a Time Lord other than the Doctor regenerating on screen (and the first of the revived series), the first being the regeneration of K'anpo in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974); although [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] regenerated in the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), this process was depicted off screen.\n\nThe Master continually hears the sound of drums throughout this episode; this continues through \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\" and becomes a plot point in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was announced as the first of a three-part story in ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]'', broadcast the day before. Prior to this, only the following two instalments had been linked.  Later reference material, including ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'''s season poll, treated the three episodes as a single three-part story.  Russell T Davies has said that he regards \"Utopia\" as a separate story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Davies |first=Russell T |authorlink=Russell T Davies |date=4 March 2009|title=Production Notes |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=406 |page=4 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]] |quote=And I certainly feel the Series Three climax was two stories, no matter what the '''DWM''' season poll says.

Marty's best friend is Alex the [[lion]], who enjoys showing off for the public and his celebrity status as \"the king of New York\". Alex attempts to cheer Marty up, but Marty, still unsatisfied, learns that the zoo's [[penguin]]s\u2014Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private\u2014are trying to escape, and follows them out. Alex, Melman the [[giraffe]], and Gloria the [[hippopotamus]] pursue Marty and attempt to convince him to return. The four, along with the penguins and two [[chimpanzee]]s named Mason and Phil, converge at [[Grand Central Station]] where the authorities sedate them using [[tranquilizer gun]]s. Under pressure from anti-captivity activists, the zoo is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a [[Kenya]]n wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape and take over the ship, intent on taking it to [[Antarctica]]. Their antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to fall overboard and wash ashore on [[Madagascar]].\n\nInitially believing themselves to be at the [[San Diego Zoo]], the animals come across a pack of [[lemur]]s led by King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]]. The predatory [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] attack the lemurs, but are scared off by Alex's fearsome appearance. Alex blames Marty for the group's predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, and Gloria and Melman soon join him in enjoying the island. Alex eventually comes around, but without the raw [[steak]]s he was provided at the zoo, hunger sets in and his [[prey drive]] begins to show. King Julien has the lemurs (particularly Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]] and one of King Julien's servants) befriend the zoo animals in the hope that Alex's presence will keep the fossa at bay, despite his [[aye-aye]] lemur adviser Maurice's warnings about Alex's predatory nature. When Alex loses control and attacks Marty, Julien realizes that he is a threat and banishes him to the predator side of the island, where the fossa live. Seeing what has happened to Alex, and how dangerous the wild can be, Marty begins to regret his decision to leave the zoo.\n\nThe penguins, having been to Antarctica and found it inhospitable, land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing the chance to return Alex to New York, Marty crosses over to the predator side and attempts to convince the grizzled, starving Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear that he will attack Marty again. The fossa attack Marty, and though Gloria, Melman, and the penguins come to the rescue, they are outnumbered. Alex overcomes his predatory instincts, rescues his friends, and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex, and the penguins satisfy his hunger by feeding him [[sushi]]. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:David Schwimmer 2005 Madagascar.jpg|thumb|[[David Schwimmer]] at the film's British premiere in London]]\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Alex, a [[lion]].

Alex, Melman the [[giraffe]], and Gloria the [[hippopotamus]] pursue Marty and attempt to convince him to return. The four, along with the penguins and two [[chimpanzee]]s named Mason and Phil, converge at [[Grand Central Station]] where the authorities sedate them using [[tranquilizer gun]]s. Under pressure from anti-captivity activists, the zoo is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a [[Kenya]]n wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape and take over the ship, intent on taking it to [[Antarctica]]. Their antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to fall overboard and wash ashore on [[Madagascar]].\n\nInitially believing themselves to be at the [[San Diego Zoo]], the animals come across a pack of [[lemur]]s led by King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]]. The predatory [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] attack the lemurs, but are scared off by Alex's fearsome appearance. Alex blames Marty for the group's predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, and Gloria and Melman soon join him in enjoying the island. Alex eventually comes around, but without the raw [[steak]]s he was provided at the zoo, hunger sets in and his [[prey drive]] begins to show. King Julien has the lemurs (particularly Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]] and one of King Julien's servants) befriend the zoo animals in the hope that Alex's presence will keep the fossa at bay, despite his [[aye-aye]] lemur adviser Maurice's warnings about Alex's predatory nature. When Alex loses control and attacks Marty, Julien realizes that he is a threat and banishes him to the predator side of the island, where the fossa live. Seeing what has happened to Alex, and how dangerous the wild can be, Marty begins to regret his decision to leave the zoo.\n\nThe penguins, having been to Antarctica and found it inhospitable, land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing the chance to return Alex to New York, Marty crosses over to the predator side and attempts to convince the grizzled, starving Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear that he will attack Marty again. The fossa attack Marty, and though Gloria, Melman, and the penguins come to the rescue, they are outnumbered. Alex overcomes his predatory instincts, rescues his friends, and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex, and the penguins satisfy his hunger by feeding him [[sushi]]. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:David Schwimmer 2005 Madagascar.jpg|thumb|[[David Schwimmer]] at the film's British premiere in London]]\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Alex, a [[lion]].

{"title_page": "Perpendicular", "text_new": "{{short description|Relationship between two lines that meet at a right angle (90 degrees)}}\n{{other uses}}\n[[File:Perpendicular-coloured.svg|right|thumb|236px<!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)-->|The segment AB is perpendicular to the segment CD because the two angles it creates (indicated in orange and blue) are each 90 degrees. The segment AB can be called ''the perpendicular from A to the segment CD'', using \"perpendicular\" as a noun. The point ''B'' is called the ''foot of the perpendicular from ''A'' to segment CD'', or simply, the ''foot of ''A'' on CD''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=114}}</ref> ]]\n{{General geometry |concepts}}\n\nIn elementary [[geometry]], the property of being '''perpendicular''' ('''perpendicularity''') is the relationship between two [[Line (geometry)|line]]s which meet at a [[right angle]] (90 [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s). The property extends to other related [[Mathematical object|geometric object]]s.\n\nA line is said to be perpendicular to another line if the two lines [[Intersection|intersect]] at a right angle.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=91}}</ref> Explicitly, a first line is perpendicular to a second line if (1) the two lines meet; and (2) at the point of intersection the [[straight angle]] on one side of the first line is cut by the second line into two [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[angle]]s. Perpendicularity can be shown to be [[symmetric]], meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order.\n\nPerpendicularity easily extends to [[Line segment|segment]]s and [[Ray (geometry)|ray]]s. For example, a line segment <math>\\overline{AB}</math> is perpendicular to a line segment <math>\\overline{CD}</math> if, when each is extended in both directions to form an infinite line, these two resulting lines are perpendicular in the sense above. In symbols, <math>\\overline{AB} \\perp \\overline{CD}</math> means line segment AB is perpendicular to line segment CD.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=91}}</ref> For information regarding the perpendicular symbol see [[Up tack]].\n\nA line is said to be perpendicular to a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] if it is perpendicular to every line in the plane that it intersects. This definition depends on the definition of perpendicularity between lines.\n\nTwo planes in space are said to be perpendicular if the [[dihedral angle]] at which they meet is a right angle (90 degrees).\n\nPerpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of [[orthogonality]]; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word \"perpendicular\" is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its [[Normal (geometry)|normal]].\n\n==Foot of a perpendicular==\nThe word '''foot''' is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars.

Let Q and P be the points of intersection of these two circles.\n* Step 3 (blue): connect Q and P to construct the desired perpendicular PQ.\n\nTo prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SSS congruence theorem]] for ' and QPB' to conclude that angles OPA' and OPB' are equal.

The property extends to other related [[Mathematical object|geometric object]]s.\n\nA line is said to be perpendicular to another line if the two lines [[Intersection|intersect]] at a right angle.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=91}}</ref> Explicitly, a first line is perpendicular to a second line if (1) the two lines meet; and (2) at the point of intersection the [[straight angle]] on one side of the first line is cut by the second line into two [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[angle]]s. Perpendicularity can be shown to be [[symmetric]], meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order.\n\nPerpendicularity easily extends to [[Line segment|segment]]s and [[Ray (geometry)|ray]]s. For example, a line segment <math>\\overline{AB}</math> is perpendicular to a line segment <math>\\overline{CD}</math> if, when each is extended in both directions to form an infinite line, these two resulting lines are perpendicular in the sense above. In symbols, <math>\\overline{AB} \\perp \\overline{CD}</math> means line segment AB is perpendicular to line segment CD.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=91}}</ref> For information regarding the perpendicular symbol see [[Up tack]].\n\nA line is said to be perpendicular to a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] if it is perpendicular to every line in the plane that it intersects. This definition depends on the definition of perpendicularity between lines.\n\nTwo planes in space are said to be perpendicular if the [[dihedral angle]] at which they meet is a right angle (90 degrees).\n\nPerpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of [[orthogonality]]; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word \"perpendicular\" is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its [[Normal (geometry)|normal]].\n\n==Foot of a perpendicular==\nThe word '''foot''' is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars.
