By the end of the conflict it was issued in four degrees and had an equivalent [[Civil awards and decorations|civil award]]. A \"[[Denazification|de-Nazified]]\" version of the War Merit Cross was reissued in 1957 by the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' for its [[Veteran|veteran]]s.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|pp=300\u2013305}}\n\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kriegsverdienstkreuz 1939.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The German War Merit Cross (1939\u201345)]]\nThis award was created by [[Adolf Hitler]] in October 1939 as a successor to the non-combatant [[Iron Cross]] which was used in earlier wars (similar medal but with a different ribbon). The award was graded in the same manner as the Iron Cross:  ''War Merit Cross Second Class'', ''War Merit Cross First Class'', and ''Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross''.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|pp=300\u2013305, 336}} The award had two variants: ''with swords'' given to soldiers for exceptional service \"not in direct connection with combat\", and ''without swords'' given to civilians for meritorious service in \"furtherance of the war effort\". Recipients had to have the lower grade of the award before getting the next level.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=300}}{{sfn|Ailsby|1987|pp=75, 76}}\n\nThe wearing of Nazi era decorations was banned in Germany after the war, as was any display of the swastika. Veterans awarded the War Merit Cross were therefore unable to wear it, either in uniform or - publicly - on civilian dress.  In 1957 the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] authorised alternative 'de-nazified' replacement versions of World War II period war decorations.  These could be worn both on ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' uniform and in civilian dress. The new version of the War Merit Cross replaced the swastika on the obverse central disc of the cross with the date \"1939\" (as on the reverse disc of the original version), the reverse disc being blank.  The wearing of Nazi era decorations in any form continued to be banned in the [[German Democratic Republic]] until German reunification in 1990.\n\n==Criteria==\nThe ribbon of the War Merit Cross was in red-white-black-white-red; that was, the red and black colors being reversed from the ribbon of the World War II version of the Iron Cross. The ribbon for the War Merit Medal was similar, but with a narrow vertical red strip in the center of the black field.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|pp=300, 301, 336, 337}} Soldiers who earned the War Merit Cross 2nd Class with Swords wore a small crossed-swords device on the ribbon. The War Merit Cross 1st Class was a pin-backed medal worn on the pocket of the tunic (like the Iron Cross 1st Class). The ribbon of the War Merit Cross 2nd Class could be worn like the ribbon of the Iron Cross 2nd Class (through the second buttonhole).{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=300}} Nonetheless combat soldiers tended to hold the War Merit Cross in low regard, referring to its wearers as being in 'Iron Cross Training'.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=302}} The Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross was a [[neck decoration|neck order]] and worn the same way as the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=308}}\n\nThere was one extra grade of the War Merit Cross, which was created at the suggestion of [[Albert Speer]]: ''The Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross in Gold'' ({{lang-de|Goldenes Ritterkreuz des Kriegsverdienstkreuzes}}), but this was never officially placed on the list of national awards as it came about in late 1944 and there was no time to officially promulgate the award before the war ended. The Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross in Gold (without swords) was awarded 'on paper' to two recipients on 20 April 1945: [[Franz Hahne]] and [[Karl-Otto Saur]].{{sfn|Angolia|1987|pp=309, 310}}\n\nThe Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross was considered to be ranked higher than the [[German Cross]] in silver, but below the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=308}} A total of 118 awards of the Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross with swords, and 137 awards without swords were awarded.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=308}} Considering the relative rarity of the award compared with the grades of the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross, it took on \"extra meaning\" it did not necessarily deserve, as it ranked below the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=308}} For example, ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] made a concerted effort to get Hitler to award him this order, much to Hitler's annoyance. In response, Hitler outlined a series of criteria governing the awarding of this decoration and the philosophy of such awards, and directed that \"prominent party comrades\" were not to be awarded with the Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross (or similar decorations), and withdrew the proposed awards of this order to Gauleiter [[Erich Koch]] and [[Herbert Backe]]. Directing his comments at G\u00f6ring personally, Hitler ordered that such attempts to gain this award be stopped.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=308}}{{sfn|Ailsby|1987|p=79}} Also, six persons received two Knights Cross' of the War Merit Cross (each one with and without Swords): [[Walter Brugmann]], [[Julius Dorpm\u00fcller]], [[Karl-Otto Saur]], [[Albin Sawatzki]], [[Walter Schreiber]], and [[Walter Rohlandt]].\n\n{{main|War Merit Medal}}\nClosely related to the War Merit Cross was the War Merit Medal ({{lang-de|Kriegsverdienstmedaille}}), designated on 19 August 1940 for civilians to recognize outstanding service in the war effort.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=306}} It was usually awarded to those workers in factories who significantly exceeded work quotas. The War Merit Medal was awarded to Germans and non-Germans, to men and women. An estimated 4.9 million medals were awarded by the end of the war in Europe.{{sfn|Angolia|1987|p=306}}\n\n==Notable recipients== <!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not add photographs of recipients to this section.

The initial core of the force was populated by [[Latvian Police Battalions]], which were formed starting in 1941 earlier for security duties. Also, some who had previously served in the notorious [[Arajs Kommando]] commando unit,<ref name=\"Hiden\">John Hiden. The Slavonic and East European Review, Vol. 85, No. 2 (Apr., 2007), pp. 364-365</ref> responsible for atrocities committed against Jews, Roma, and civilians along Latvia's border with the Soviet Union were transferred to the Latvian Legion.<ref name=\"bettina\">[[Ruth Bettina Birn]] and Volker Riess. \"Revising the Holocaust\".

Draftees were given a choice between serving in the [[Waffen-SS]] Legions, serving as [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] auxiliaries, or being sent to a slave labour camp in Germany.

The first conscription, in 1943, applied to all Latvian men born from 1919 to 1924. The subsequent conscriptions extended to Latvians born between 1906 and 1928. The division commanders and most of the staff were German SS officers. The individual combat regiments were typically commanded by Latvian officers.\n\nAfter the [[Red Army]] broke through German lines at [[Nevel (town)|Nevel]] along the [[1st Baltic Front]] in November 1943, advancing on Latvia, the [[Latvian Self-Administration]] took over mobilization from the Germans on November 13.

Another 23,000 Latvians were serving as Wehrmacht \"auxiliaries\".<ref name=\"legion2\"/>\n\n== Operational history ==\nThe first Latvian Legion unit was the [[2 SS Infantry Brigade|2nd Latvian SS Brigade]], created in February 1943. It fought its first battle in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], opposite the [[Pulkovo observatory]] on 18 March 1943. It continued fighting around Leningrad until the German forces retreated in January 1944.\n\nThe 15th Waffen-SS Division was formed and sent to the front in November 1943. Originally, it was sent to the [[Ostrov, Ostrovsky District, Pskov Oblast|Ostrov]] and [[Novosokolniki]] districts of [[Pskov Oblast]], but after the German Army suffered setbacks there, was moved to positions in the [[Belebelka]] district of [[Novgorod Oblast]] in January 1944. It retreated from there a month later. At the end of February 1944, both units took joint defensive positions on the [[Sorota]] and [[Velikaya River|Velikaya]] rivers. At that time, the 2nd Brigade was renamed the 19th Waffen-SS division.<ref name=llf>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-03-15|title=Latvian Legion Military and Feldpost History|url= http://axis101.bizland.com/Latvian19Feldpost.htm}}</ref> Over the next two months, these positions saw intense fighting.\n\nIn April 1944, the Legion was replaced by other units and moved to less active positions in Bardovo-Kudever, 50&nbsp;km east of [[Opochka]]. It came under attack there in June 1944 and started to retreat on July 10, 1944, crossing the Latvian-Russian border on July 17.\n\nIn August and September 1944, the 15th Division was moved to [[Prussia]], for replenishment with new recruits. It was in training near [[Danzig]] until being ordered into battle on 22 January 1945. At that time, the division consisted of about 15,000 soldiers. It fought near Danzig in January and February, retreating to [[Pomerania]] in early March. By early April, the division was reduced to 8,000 men. About 1,000 were sent by sea to replenish the forces in the [[Courland Pocket]], the rest were lost during the fighting. On April 11, the division was told about plans to transfer the entire division to Courland. Seeing that the war was lost and understanding that being sent to Courland would mean eventually having to surrender to the Soviets, the division decided to surrender to the Western Allies instead, disobeying German orders to the contrary, when necessary.\n\nThe 19th Division continued to fight in Latvia. In October 1944, Soviet advances in [[Lithuania]] cut off it and other units in the Courland Pocket from the rest of the German forces. It was a part of the six battles between Soviet and German armies in the Courland Pocket in 1944 and 1945. During the third battle in December 1944, the opposing Soviet units included two Latvian divisions, the 43rd and the 308th, formed from recruits drafted in Soviet-occupied Eastern Latvia. When the Latvian units on both sides of the front faced one another, they were quite unwilling and occasionally disengaged without firing a shot. The Soviet command would transfer the Latvian divisions elsewhere after a few days. Together with other units in the Courland Pocket, the 19th division surrendered to the Soviets at the end of the war on May 9, 1945.<ref name=llf/> Subsequently almost 50,000 Latvian soldiers became Soviet prisoners of war, imprisoned in filtration or [[Gulag]] camps.<ref name=\"Neiburgs\" /> Some of the Legion soldiers continued fighting the Soviets as [[Forest Brothers]] for up to ten years after the end of the war.\n\n== Motivation of Latvian Legionnaires ==\n[[File:3-Occupations-Waffen-SS-conscript.png|thumb|200px|Conscription order]] Oberf\u00fchrer [[Adolf Ax]], commander of the 15th Division, reported on 27 January 1945: \"They are first and foremost Latvians.

Throughout the post-war years, the Allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the Latvian Legion and the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|Estonian Legion]]. The US Displaced Persons Commission in September 1950 declared that:\n<blockquote>\"The Baltic Waffen SS Units (Baltic Legions) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose, ideology, activities, and qualifications for membership from the German SS, and therefore the Commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the Government of the United States.\"<ref name=\"legion4\"/></blockquote>\n\nEven before this decision, around 1,000 former Latvian Legion soldiers had served as guards at the [[Nuremberg trials]], guarding Nazi war criminals. Afterwards, during the [[Berlin Blockade]], they took part in securing Allied facilities involved in the [[Berlin Airlift]] and later also were guarding USA Army headquarters.<ref name=\"legion3\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettia.lv/en_a_legionari-nirnberga.html |title=Latvian legion soldiers at Nuremberg Tribunal |year=2006 |publisher=Lettia.lv }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring the Soviet period, the Latvian Legion were described as having been illegally conscripted by Nazi Germany in 1943, with no indication of being war criminals or of Holocaust involvement.<ref name=LPSRME>''Latvijas PSR Maz\u0101 Enciklop\u0113dija (The Latvian SSR Concise Encyclopedia)''. Riga: Zinate. 1970, volume II page 326.</ref> For example, the Soviet film ''[[I remember everything, Richard]]'' (also known as ''Rock and Splinters'' in its uncut release) made during the 1960s (during the Cold War) at the [[Riga Film Studio]], while being full of Soviet propaganda clich\u00e9s, clearly illustrates recognition of several essential aspects with respect to Legion soldiers, amongst those: that they were front-line soldiers, they were mostly forcefully conscripted, they were not supporters of Nazi ideology, they did not take part in the Holocaust.  This contrasts sharply with Russia's post-Soviet stance, which denounces the Legion as Waffen SS war criminals and uses the Legion issue to assert political and ideological pressure on Latvia on the international scene.\n\nIn 1946 the coalition government of Sweden led by the Social Democrats, despite strong protests from many sectors of Swedish society, extradited soldiers from the Latvian Legion (also some Estonian Legion and Lithuanian soldiers) who had fled to Sweden and were interned there to the USSR in an event that became known as ''[[Baltutl\u00e4mningen]]''. In the 1990s the Swedish government admitted that this had been a mistake. Surviving Baltic veterans were invited to Sweden in 1994, where they were met by the King of Sweden [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden [[Margaretha af Ugglas]] and participated in various ceremonies commemorating the events surrounding their extradition.

In 1990, Legion veterans started commemorating March 16 in Latvia. In 1998 Latvia's [[Saeima]] (parliament) voted this to be an official national remembrance day. The word \"Legion\" was, however, excluded from the remembrance day's name, in order to include all those who fought against the Soviets, both during World War II, and as [[Forest Brothers#Latvia|resistance fighters]] afterwards. International pressure forced the Saeima to remove March 16 from the list of \"State remembrance days\" in 2000.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMarch 16 events have been quite confrontational in recent years, with Latvian nationalist organizations (such as [[All For Latvia!]] and [[National Power Unity]]) marching in support of the Latvian Legion, and predominantly-Russian organizations ([[For Human Rights in United Latvia]]) holding protests and attempting to block the marches. Due to a particularly harsh controversy around the official commemoration of the Remembrance Day of the Latvian Legionnaires in 1998, the Latvian officials refrain from its official honoring. Currently, the official position of Latvian authorities is that the Day is a primarily private business of the veterans and their relatives.<ref>Eva-Clarita Onken.

Draftees were given a choice between serving in the [[Waffen-SS]] Legions, serving as [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] auxiliaries, or being sent to a slave labour camp in Germany.

The first conscription, in 1943, applied to all Latvian men born from 1919 to 1924. The subsequent conscriptions extended to Latvians born between 1906 and 1928.

It fought its first battle in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], opposite the [[Pulkovo observatory]] on 18 March 1943. It continued fighting around Leningrad until the German forces retreated in January 1944.\n\nThe 15th Waffen-SS Division was formed and sent to the front in November 1943. Originally, it was sent to the [[Ostrov, Ostrovsky District, Pskov Oblast|Ostrov]] and [[Novosokolniki]] districts of [[Pskov Oblast]], but after the German Army suffered setbacks there, was moved to positions in the [[Belebelka]] district of [[Novgorod Oblast]] in January 1944. It retreated from there a month later. At the end of February 1944, both units took joint defensive positions on the [[Sorota]] and [[Velikaya River|Velikaya]] rivers. At that time, the 2nd Brigade was renamed the 19th Waffen-SS division.<ref name=llf>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-03-15|title=Latvian Legion Military and Feldpost History|url= http://axis101.bizland.com/Latvian19Feldpost.htm}}</ref> Over the next two months, these positions saw intense fighting.\n\nIn April 1944, the Legion was replaced by other units and moved to less active positions in Bardovo-Kudever, 50&nbsp;km east of [[Opochka]]. It came under attack there in June 1944 and started to retreat on July 10, 1944, crossing the Latvian-Russian border on July 17.\n\nIn August and September 1944, the 15th Division was moved to [[Prussia]], for replenishment with new recruits. It was in training near [[Danzig]] until being ordered into battle on 22 January 1945. At that time, the division consisted of about 15,000 soldiers. It fought near Danzig in January and February, retreating to [[Pomerania]] in early March. By early April, the division was reduced to 8,000 men. About 1,000 were sent by sea to replenish the forces in the [[Courland Pocket]], the rest were lost during the fighting. On April 11, the division was told about plans to transfer the entire division to Courland. Seeing that the war was lost and understanding that being sent to Courland would mean eventually having to surrender to the Soviets, the division decided to surrender to the Western Allies instead, disobeying German orders to the contrary, when necessary.\n\nThe 19th Division continued to fight in Latvia. In October 1944, Soviet advances in [[Lithuania]] cut off it and other units in the Courland Pocket from the rest of the German forces. It was a part of the six battles between Soviet and German armies in the Courland Pocket in 1944 and 1945. During the third battle in December 1944, the opposing Soviet units included two Latvian divisions, the 43rd and the 308th, formed from recruits drafted in Soviet-occupied Eastern Latvia. When the Latvian units on both sides of the front faced one another, they were quite unwilling and occasionally disengaged without firing a shot. The Soviet command would transfer the Latvian divisions elsewhere after a few days. Together with other units in the Courland Pocket, the 19th division surrendered to the Soviets at the end of the war on May 9, 1945.<ref name=llf/> Subsequently almost 50,000 Latvian soldiers became Soviet prisoners of war, imprisoned in filtration or [[Gulag]] camps.<ref name=\"Neiburgs\" /> Some of the Legion soldiers continued fighting the Soviets as [[Forest Brothers]] for up to ten years after the end of the war.\n\n== Motivation of Latvian Legionnaires ==\n[[File:3-Occupations-Waffen-SS-conscript.png|thumb|200px|Conscription order]] Oberf\u00fchrer [[Adolf Ax]], commander of the 15th Division, reported on 27 January 1945: \"They are first and foremost Latvians.

Throughout the post-war years, the Allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the Latvian Legion and the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|Estonian Legion]]. The US Displaced Persons Commission in September 1950 declared that:\n<blockquote>\"The Baltic Waffen SS Units (Baltic Legions) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose, ideology, activities, and qualifications for membership from the German SS, and therefore the Commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the Government of the United States.\"<ref name=\"legion4\"/></blockquote>\n\nEven before this decision, around 1,000 former Latvian Legion soldiers had served as guards at the [[Nuremberg trials]], guarding Nazi war criminals. Afterwards, during the [[Berlin Blockade]], they took part in securing Allied facilities involved in the [[Berlin Airlift]] and later also were guarding USA Army headquarters.<ref name=\"legion3\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettia.lv/en_a_legionari-nirnberga.html |title=Latvian legion soldiers at Nuremberg Tribunal |year=2006 |publisher=Lettia.lv }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring the Soviet period, the Latvian Legion were described as having been illegally conscripted by Nazi Germany in 1943, with no indication of being war criminals or of Holocaust involvement.<ref name=LPSRME>''Latvijas PSR Maz\u0101 Enciklop\u0113dija (The Latvian SSR Concise Encyclopedia)''. Riga: Zinate. 1970, volume II page 326.</ref> For example, the Soviet film ''[[I remember everything, Richard]]'' (also known as ''Rock and Splinters'' in its uncut release) made during the 1960s (during the Cold War) at the [[Riga Film Studio]], while being full of Soviet propaganda clich\u00e9s, clearly illustrates recognition of several essential aspects with respect to Legion soldiers, amongst those: that they were front-line soldiers, they were mostly forcefully conscripted, they were not supporters of Nazi ideology, they did not take part in the Holocaust.  This contrasts sharply with Russia's post-Soviet stance, which denounces the Legion as Waffen SS war criminals and uses the Legion issue to assert political and ideological pressure on Latvia on the international scene.\n\nIn 1946 the coalition government of Sweden led by the Social Democrats, despite strong protests from many sectors of Swedish society, extradited soldiers from the Latvian Legion (also some Estonian Legion and Lithuanian soldiers) who had fled to Sweden and were interned there to the USSR in an event that became known as ''[[Baltutl\u00e4mningen]]''. In the 1990s the Swedish government admitted that this had been a mistake. Surviving Baltic veterans were invited to Sweden in 1994, where they were met by the King of Sweden [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden [[Margaretha af Ugglas]] and participated in various ceremonies commemorating the events surrounding their extradition. Both the King and the Minister for Foreign affairs expressed their regret for Sweden's past extradition of Baltic Legion soldiers to the Stalinist USSR.<ref name=\"legion101\">{{cite book |first=Valentins |last=Silamikelis |title= With the Baltic Flag : Through Three Occupations |publisher=Jumava |year=2005 |isbn=978-9984-38-044-5 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the position of the defenders of Latvian Legion is quite wide-spread, some scholars stress that there are grounds for supposing that the Latvian Legion possesses all the features of a criminal organization specified at the Nuremberg trials: the conscription procedure into the Legion had certain peculiarities, which do not allow to definitively speak of its compulsory character.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kazyrytski|first1=Leanid|title=Latvian SS-Legion: Past and Present.

In 1990, Legion veterans started commemorating March 16 in Latvia. In 1998 Latvia's [[Saeima]] (parliament) voted this to be an official national remembrance day. The word \"Legion\" was, however, excluded from the remembrance day's name, in order to include all those who fought against the Soviets, both during World War II, and as [[Forest Brothers#Latvia|resistance fighters]] afterwards. International pressure forced the Saeima to remove March 16 from the list of \"State remembrance days\" in 2000.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMarch 16 events have been quite confrontational in recent years, with Latvian nationalist organizations (such as [[All For Latvia!]] and [[National Power Unity]]) marching in support of the Latvian Legion, and predominantly-Russian organizations ([[For Human Rights in United Latvia]]) holding protests and attempting to block the marches. Due to a particularly harsh controversy around the official commemoration of the Remembrance Day of the Latvian Legionnaires in 1998, the Latvian officials refrain from its official honoring. Currently, the official position of Latvian authorities is that the Day is a primarily private business of the veterans and their relatives.<ref>Eva-Clarita Onken.

The oldest works of art which remained from the early [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] (14th century) are paintings dedicated to churches and [[liturgy]] (e.g., frescoes in the Crypts of [[Vilnius Cathedral]], decorated [[hymn]]s books). Walls paintings from the 16th centuries were also discovered in Vilnius (e.g., painting of the [[Church of St. Francis and St. Bernard, Vilnius|Church of St. Francis and St. Bernard]] vaults or in the [[Church of Saint Nicholas, Vilnius|Church of Saint Nicholas]]).<ref name=\"tapybavle\">{{cite web |title=Lietuvos tapyba |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/Lietuvos-tapyba-117712 |website=vle.lt |accessdate=10 November 2019 |language=lt}}</ref> Gothic wooden, mostly polychrome sculptures were used to decorate the altars of the churches of Vilnius.

In the Renaissance period, portrait tombstones and medals were highly valued (e.g., marle tomb of [[Albertas Go\u0161tautas]], 1548, by B. Z. da Gianotti, tomb of [[Povilas Al\u0161\u0117ni\u0161kis]], 1555, by G. Cini, both located in the Vilnius Cathedral). The works of Italian sculptors are characterized by a naturalistic treatment of forms, precise proportions, tectonicity, a realistic representation of the deceased. The local sculptors took over only the iconographic scheme of the Renaissance tomb; their works (e.g., tomb of [[Lew Sapieha]], ca. 1633, at [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|Church of St. Michael]]) are characterized by conditionality of forms, stylization.<ref name=\"skulptura\" /> During this period local and [[Western Europe]]an painters created religious, mythologic compositions, portraits, which were intertwined with late Gothic and Baroque features. Illustrated prayer books illustrations and miniatures have survived.<ref name=\"tapybavle\" />\n\nThe [[Baroque]] period which began in the late 16th century was exceptional for Vilnius as wall painting blossomed in the city. Most of the palaces and churches were decorated with frescoes characterized by bright colors, sophisticated angles and [[dramatism]] style. Also during this period the secular painting spread \u2013 representational, imaginative, epitaph portraits, scenes of battles, politically important events. It is characterized by detailed realistic style.<ref name=\"tapybavle\" /> This period sculptures dominated in the [[sacred architecture]] (tombstones with sculptural portraits, exterior and interior decorative sculptures), made of wood, marble and [[stucco]]. Italian sculptors (e.g., G. P. Perti, G. M. Galli, A. S. Capone) were exceptionally important in the 17th century Grand Duchy's sculptures development and were invited there by the [[Lithuanian nobility]]. Their works are characterized by the features of mature baroque: expressiveness of forms, sensuality, atectonic composition (e.g., sculptural decor of the [[Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Vilnius|Church of St. Peter and St. Paul]]). The local sculptors emphasized the decorative features of the baroque, and the expressiveness and emotionality of the baroque was less characteristic in their works.<ref name=\"skulptura\" />\n\n[[File:Rusiecki-Litwinka z wierzbami.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|''[[Lithuanian Girl with Palm Sunday Fronds]]'' by [[Kanutas Ruseckas]]]]\nAt the late 18th and 19th centuries, the Lithuanian painting was largely influenced by the [[:lt:Vilniaus meno mokykla|Vilnius Art School]] which introduced manifestations of [[Classicism]] art and later of [[Romanticism]] art.

Its history begins from the [[Neolithic period]]. During it, the glacial hills were intermittently occupied and a wooden castle, at the confluence of the [[Neris]] and [[Vilnia]] rivers, was built around 1000 AD to fortify [[Gedimino Hill]]. The settlement developed into a town in the 13th century, when the [[pagan]] [[Baltic people]] were invaded by [[Western Europeans|the Westerners]] during the [[Lithuanian Crusade]]. Around 1323, when the first written sources about Vilnia occurred, it was the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which was formed from various cultures and nationalities residents. At this time, it only had some brick structures. By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had become one of the most powerful and the largest country in [[Europe]] with its territory stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]] (mostly, present-day [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] lands). The historic centre consists of [[Vilnius Castle Complex|three castles]] territories (Upper, Lower and Curved) and the area that was previously encircled by a [[Wall of Vilnius]]. Its plan is mostly circular with its center in the original castle site. The streets pattern is [[medieval]] and has small, narrow streets, however large squares were also developed in later periods.<ref name=\"unesco\" /> [[Pilies Street]], the main artery, links the [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] with [[Town Hall, Vilnius|Vilnius Town Hall]].

Nevertheless, this has to be seen in the context of a shrinking working age population. The activity rate reached 82% in 2017. Vilnius and [[Kaunas]] counties offer better labour market opportunities than other counties, and this drives the internal interregional migration. However, in other regions employment opportunities remain scarce. Unemployment rates remained persistently high in the least developed regions (14.9% in [[Utena County]] as compared to 4.8% in [[Vilnius County]]). Other key labour market indicators have improved, returning to [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|pre-crisis]] levels. Long-term unemployment fell to 2.1% in the third quarter of 2018 (EU average: 2.9%). Youth unemployment (13.3%) and the rate of young people not in employment, education or training ([[NEET]], at 9.1%) were below the EU average in 2017.<ref>{{cite book |title=Country Report Lithuania 2019 |date=27 February 2019 |publisher=European Commission |location=Brussels |page=8 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/2019-european-semester-country-report-lithuania_en.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:K29 business centre in Vilnius.jpg|thumb|left|K29 business centre is the first office in the [[Baltic states]] which received excellent [[BREEAM]] rating<ref>{{cite web |title=Biur\u0173 pastatui Konstitucijos prospekte suteiktas auk\u0161\u010diausias Baltijos \u0161alyse tvarumo \u012fvertinimas |url=https://www.15min.lt/verslas/naujiena/kvadratinis-metras/nekilnojamasis-turtas/biuru-pastatui-k29-suteiktas-auksciausias-baltijos-salyse-tvarumo-ivertinimas-973-799132 |website=[[15min.lt]] |accessdate=31 August 2019 |language=lt}}</ref>]]\nOverall, the share of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) has decreased since Lithuania joined the EU in 2004. However, it remains among the highest in the EU (29.6% in 2017, compared to 22.4% in the EU). The risk of poverty or social exclusion in rural areas is nearly double that of urban areas, which corresponds to the gap in the unemployment rate between cities and rural areas (4.5% versus 11% in 2017). In particular the metropolitan areas of Vilnius and Kaunas, where significant economic activity is centred, drive a significant gap between AROPE rates in urban and rural areas. In 2017, the AROPE rate in rural areas was 37.2%, compared to 19.9% in cities.<ref>{{cite book |title=Country Report Lithuania 2019 |date=27 February 2019 |publisher=European Commission |location=Brussels |page=9 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/2019-european-semester-country-report-lithuania_en.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver the past 15 years, Lithuania has experienced the fastest convergence in the EU, but the benefits of economic growth are uneven across regions.

While [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita reached nearly 110% of the EU average in the capital region of Vilnius, it is only between 42% and 77% in other regions. The country's rapid convergence is mainly fuelled by two regions&nbsp;\u2013 the capital region of Vilnius and [[Kaunas County]]&nbsp;\u2013 producing 42% and 20% of the national GDP, respectively.

The local sculptors took over only the iconographic scheme of the Renaissance tomb; their works (e.g., tomb of [[Lew Sapieha]], ca. 1633, at [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|Church of St. Michael]]) are characterized by conditionality of forms, stylization.<ref name=\"skulptura\" /> During this period local and [[Western Europe]]an painters created religious, mythologic compositions, portraits, which were intertwined with late Gothic and Baroque features.

Their works are characterized by the features of mature baroque: expressiveness of forms, sensuality, atectonic composition (e.g., sculptural decor of the [[Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Vilnius|Church of St. Peter and St. Paul]]). The local sculptors emphasized the decorative features of the baroque, and the expressiveness and emotionality of the baroque was less characteristic in their works.<ref name=\"skulptura\" />\n\n[[File:Rusiecki-Litwinka z wierzbami.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|''[[Lithuanian Girl with Palm Sunday Fronds]]'' by [[Kanutas Ruseckas]]]]\nAt the late 18th and 19th centuries, the Lithuanian painting was largely influenced by the [[:lt:Vilniaus meno mokykla|Vilnius Art School]] which introduced manifestations of [[Classicism]] art and later of [[Romanticism]] art.

The settlement developed into a town in the 13th century, when the [[pagan]] [[Baltic people]] were invaded by [[Western Europeans|the Westerners]] during the [[Lithuanian Crusade]]. Around 1323, when the first written sources about Vilnia occurred, it was the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which was formed from various cultures and nationalities residents.

The historic centre consists of [[Vilnius Castle Complex|three castles]] territories (Upper, Lower and Curved) and the area that was previously encircled by a [[Wall of Vilnius]].

Employment reached a record high of 77.5% in the third quarter of 2018 while unemployment was 6.3% in the fourth quarter, a rate last observed in 2008. Nevertheless, this has to be seen in the context of a shrinking working age population. The activity rate reached 82% in 2017. Vilnius and [[Kaunas]] counties offer better labour market opportunities than other counties, and this drives the internal interregional migration. However, in other regions employment opportunities remain scarce. Unemployment rates remained persistently high in the least developed regions (14.9% in [[Utena County]] as compared to 4.8% in [[Vilnius County]]). Other key labour market indicators have improved, returning to [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|pre-crisis]] levels. Long-term unemployment fell to 2.1% in the third quarter of 2018 (EU average: 2.9%). Youth unemployment (13.3%) and the rate of young people not in employment, education or training ([[NEET]], at 9.1%) were below the EU average in 2017.<ref>{{cite book |title=Country Report Lithuania 2019 |date=27 February 2019 |publisher=European Commission |location=Brussels |page=8 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/2019-european-semester-country-report-lithuania_en.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:K29 business centre in Vilnius.jpg|thumb|left|K29 business centre is the first office in the [[Baltic states]] which received excellent [[BREEAM]] rating<ref>{{cite web |title=Biur\u0173 pastatui Konstitucijos prospekte suteiktas auk\u0161\u010diausias Baltijos \u0161alyse tvarumo \u012fvertinimas |url=https://www.15min.lt/verslas/naujiena/kvadratinis-metras/nekilnojamasis-turtas/biuru-pastatui-k29-suteiktas-auksciausias-baltijos-salyse-tvarumo-ivertinimas-973-799132 |website=[[15min.lt]] |accessdate=31 August 2019 |language=lt}}</ref>]]\nOverall, the share of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) has decreased since Lithuania joined the EU in 2004. However, it remains among the highest in the EU (29.6% in 2017, compared to 22.4% in the EU). The risk of poverty or social exclusion in rural areas is nearly double that of urban areas, which corresponds to the gap in the unemployment rate between cities and rural areas (4.5% versus 11% in 2017). In particular the metropolitan areas of Vilnius and Kaunas, where significant economic activity is centred, drive a significant gap between AROPE rates in urban and rural areas. In 2017, the AROPE rate in rural areas was 37.2%, compared to 19.9% in cities.<ref>{{cite book |title=Country Report Lithuania 2019 |date=27 February 2019 |publisher=European Commission |location=Brussels |page=9 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/2019-european-semester-country-report-lithuania_en.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver the past 15 years, Lithuania has experienced the fastest convergence in the EU, but the benefits of economic growth are uneven across regions.

While [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita reached nearly 110% of the EU average in the capital region of Vilnius, it is only between 42% and 77% in other regions. The country's rapid convergence is mainly fuelled by two regions&nbsp;\u2013 the capital region of Vilnius and [[Kaunas County]]&nbsp;\u2013 producing 42% and 20% of the national GDP, respectively.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits.

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. This also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to a [[desert]] and the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite image showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v.
