In a penalty shoot-out, each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark, with the goal only defended by the opposing team's goalkeeper. Each team has five shots which must be taken by different kickers; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor. Shoot-outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead. If scores are level after five pairs of shots, the shootout progresses into additional \"sudden-death\" rounds.<ref name=\"Laws\" /> Balls successfully kicked into the goal during a shoot-out do not count as goals for the individual kickers or the team, and are tallied separately from the goals scored during normal play (including extra time, if any). Although the procedure for each individual kick in the shoot-out resembles that of a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]], there are some differences. Most notably, neither the kicker nor any player other than the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] may play the ball again once it has been kicked.\n\nThe penalty shoot-out is one of the three methods of breaking a draw that are currently approved by the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]; the others are extra time and, for [[two-legged tie]]s, the [[away goals rule]].<ref name=\"Laws\" /> A shoot-out is usually used only after one or more of the other methods fail to produce a winner. The method of breaking a draw for a specific match is determined beforehand by the match organizing body. In most professional level competitions, two 15-minute extra time periods are played if the score is tied at the end of regulation time, and a shoot-out is held if the score is still tied after the extra time periods.\n\nAlthough widely employed in football since the 1970s, penalty shoot-outs have been widely criticized by many followers of the game, due primarily to their perceived reliance on [[luck]] rather than skill and their dependence on individual duels between opposing players, which is arguably not in keeping with football as a [[team sport]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Wilson, M|author2=Wood, G|author3=Jordet, G.|title=The BASES Expert Statement on the Psychological Preparation for Football Penalty Shootouts|url=http://www.bases.org.uk/write/545_Expert_statement_on_Psychological_preparation_for_Football_penalty_shootouts.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106200749/http://www.bases.org.uk/write/545_Expert_statement_on_Psychological_preparation_for_Football_penalty_shootouts.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2016|publisher=British Association of Sports and Exercise Sciences|accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref> Conversely, some believe the pressure and unpredictability involved makes it one of the most thrilling finales to any sport.<ref>{{Cite web |title=World Cup shootouts are great and here is how other sports can adopt the thrilling finale |quote=But all those things combine to make it dramatic and compulsive viewing, the ultimate element of instant unpredictability, a quick fix for both the \u201cshort attention span\u201d generation and all the ones before it, too.

The procedure is specified in Law 10 (\"Determining the Outcome of a Match\") of the IFAB's ''Laws of the Game'' document (p.&nbsp;71).<ref name=\"Laws\" />\n\n# The referee tosses a coin to decide the goal at which the kicks will be taken.  The choice of goal by the coin toss winner may only be changed by the referee for safety reasons or if the goal or playing surface becomes unusable.<ref name=\"Laws\"/>\n# The referee tosses the coin a second time to determine which team will take the first kick.\n# All players other than the kicker and the goalkeepers must remain in the [[Association football pitch|pitch]]'s centre circle (see above).\n# Each kick will be taken in the general manner of a penalty kick. Each kick will be taken from the [[Penalty area|penalty mark]], which is {{convert|11|m|yd|abbr=in}} from the goal line and equidistant from each touch line, with the goal defended only by the opposing goalkeeper. The goalkeeper must remain between the goal posts on his goal line until the ball has been kicked, although he can jump in place, wave his arms, move side to side along the goal line or otherwise try to distract the shooter.\n# Each team is responsible for selecting from the eligible players the order in which they will take the kicks.\n# Each kicker can kick the ball only once. Once kicked, the kicker may not play the ball again. The decision on a re-kick is solely at the referee's discretion.\n# No other player on either team, other than the designated kicker and goalkeeper, may touch the ball.<ref name=\"Laws\" />\n# A kick is successful if, having been touched once by the kicker, the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar, without touching any player, official, or outside agent other than the defending goalkeeper. The ball may touch the goalkeeper, goal posts, or crossbar any number of times before going into the goal as long as the referee believes the ball's motion is the result of the initial kick. This was clarified after an incident in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] shoot-out between [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[France national football team|France]]. [[Bruno Bellone]]'s kick rebounded out off the post, hit goalkeeper [[Carlos Roberto Gallo|Carlos]]'s back, and subsequently bounced into the goal. Referee [[Ioan Igna]] gave the goal to France, and Brazil captain [[Edino Nazareth Filho|Edinho]] was booked for protesting that the kick should have been considered a miss as soon as it rebounded off the post. In 1987, the [[International Football Association Board]] clarified Law&nbsp;14, covering penalty kicks, to support Igna's decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corshamref.org.uk/newsletter/news06jul.htm |date=July 2006 |title=The Corsham Referee Newsletter |first=Julian |last=Carosi |accessdate=2008-06-20 |number=31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006164438/http://corshamref.org.uk/newsletter/news06jul.htm |archivedate=6 October 2008 }} and {{cite book |chapter-url=http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1987/1987app.pdf |title=Minutes of the AGM |author=IFAB |publisher=Soccer South Bay Referee Association |location=Llandudno |date=13 June 1987 |accessdate=29 November 2009 |pages=18\u201322 |chapter=III.8(a) Proposal by the Scottish Football Association: Law XIV\u2014Penalty Kick |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430130743/http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1987/1987app.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n# Teams take turns to kick from the penalty mark until each has taken five kicks. However, if one side has scored more successful kicks than the other could possibly reach with all of its remaining kicks, the shoot-out immediately ends, regardless of the number of kicks remaining; this basis is called \"best-of-five kicks\". An example of this is the 2006 World Cup final, the shootout ended after Italy's [[Fabio Grosso]] had scored his team's fifth, despite the fact that France (on 3) still had one more to go.\n# If after five rounds of kicks the teams have an equal number of successful kicks, additional rounds of one kick each will be used until one team scores and the other misses. This is known as [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]].\n# The team that scores the most successful kicks at the end of the shoot-out will be the winner of the match.\n# Only players who were on the pitch at the end of play or temporarily absent (injured, adjusting equipment etc.) will be allowed to participate in the shoot-out.<ref name=\"Laws\" /> If at the end of the match and before or during the kicks one side has more players on the pitch than the other, whether as a result of injury or red cards, then the side with more players must reduce its numbers to match the opponents; this is known as 'reduce to equate'. For example, if Team&nbsp;A has 11&nbsp;players but Team&nbsp;B only has 10, then Team&nbsp;A will choose one player who will not take part. Players excluded this way normally take no further part in the procedure, except that they can be used to replace an injured goalkeeper. The rule was introduced by the International Football Association Board in February 2000 because previously an eleventh kick would be taken by the eleventh (i.e. weakest) player of a full-strength team and the first (i.e. strongest) player of a sub-strength team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid=74400.html |title=The Laws change and the game gets better |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=1 August 2000 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514104336/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid%3D74400.html |archivedate=14 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> A rule change in 2016 eliminated the possibility of a team gaining such an advantage if a player is injured or sent off ''during'' the shoot-out.<ref name=\"changes2016\">{{cite web|last1=Hinch|first1=Will|title=Football Law Changes 2016/17|url=https://www.pitchero.com/blog/football-law-changes-201617|website=Pitchero|accessdate=14 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807040806/https://www.pitchero.com/blog/football-law-changes-201617|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n# A team may replace a goalkeeper who becomes injured during the shoot-out with a substitute (provided the team has not already used the maximum number of substitutes allowed by the competition) or by a player previously excluded under the 'reduce to equate' provision.<ref name=\"Laws\" />\n# If a goalkeeper is sent off during the shoot-out, another player who finished the game must act as goalkeeper.<ref name=\"Laws\" />\n# If a player, other than the goalkeeper, becomes injured or is sent off during the shoot-out, then the shoot-out will continue with no substitution allowed.

Some decide which way they will dive beforehand, giving themselves time to reach the side of the goalmouth.  A 2011 study published in the journal ''Psychological Science'' found goalkeepers dived to the right 71% of the time when their team was losing, but only 48% when ahead and 49% when tied, a phenomenon believed to be related to certain right-preferring behaviour in social mammals.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/02/138922339/under-pressure-soccer-goalies-tend-to-dive-right|title=Under Pressure, Soccer Goalies Tend To Dive Right|date=2 August 2011|accessdate=2011-09-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803010726/http://www.npr.org/2011/08/02/138922339/under-pressure-soccer-goalies-tend-to-dive-right|archivedate=3 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Others try to read the kicker's motion pattern. Kickers may attempt to feint, or delay their shot to see which way the keeper dives. Shooting high and centre, in the space that the keeper will evacuate, carries the highest risk of shooting above the bar.<ref>How to actually, seriously play soccer 2007/2008, p.130: \"Don't shoot right down the pipe\"</ref>  If a keeper blocks a penalty kick during a match, there is a danger the kicker or a teammate may score from the rebound; this is not relevant in the case of a shoot-out.\n\nSince the entire shoot-out is conducted at the same goal, the crowd behind the goal may favour one team and try to distract the other team's shooters. To forestall any potential advantage, in 2016 the Laws of the Game were modified to add a coin toss between the two teams prior to the shoot-out: the winner of the coin toss has the right to decide which goal is used for the shoot-out (previously, the decision was at the referee's discretion). The referee may change the goal only for safety reasons or if the selected goal or pitch are unusable.<ref name=\"Laws\"/>\n\nA goalkeeper may not use distracting gamesmanship such as cleaning his boots or asking the referee to see if the ball is placed properly; this risks a [[Misconduct (association football)#Cautionable offences (yellow card)|caution]] for [[unsporting conduct]].

The goalkeeper [[Oleksandr Shovkovsky]] ([[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]]) became the first not to concede a single goal in the penalty shoot-out, saving two of the Swiss attempts, with another shot hitting the crossbar. The result meant that Switzerland became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals (and, moreover, the only nation to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal).\n\nThe same competition featured a shoot-out between Germany and Argentina, the two most successful teams up to that point in terms of World Cup finals penalty shoot-outs: each team had competed in 3 shoot-outs and won all of them. Germany won the shoot-out, leaving Germany alone with a 4\u20130 record in World Cup finals.\n\nOn 20 June 2007, a new UEFA record was established.<ref>{{cite web\n|work=UEFA.com\n|title=Netherlands News\n|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=548583.html\n|accessdate=2007-08-21\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017163842/http://uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind%3D1/newsid%3D548583.html\n|archivedate=17 October 2007\n|url-status=dead\n|df=dmy-all\n}}</ref>  The semi-final of the European under-21 Championships in [[Abe Lenstra Stadion|Heerenveen]] between the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands]] and [[England national under-21 football team|England]] team finished 1\u20131.

They were introduced more generally in the [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392 season]] to decide matches still level after one replay and extra time. Previously there was no limit on the number of replays, which led to fixture disruption, especially disliked by the top clubs. Replays were often two or three days after the drawn match, which conflicted with the increased planning required after the [[Football Spectators Act 1989]]. The first team eliminated from the FA Cup on penalties was [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], beaten on 26 October 1991 by [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] after a first-round replay.<ref name=\"CoxRussell2002\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Cox|editor1-first=Richard William|editor2-last=Russell|editor2-first=Dave|editor3-last=Vamplew|editor3-first=Wray|first= John |last=Coyle |title=Encyclopedia of British football|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC&pg=PA265 |accessdate=27 June 2010|date=3 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8|page=265|chapter=Replays}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/cup2.sd?competitionid=58&seasonid=121|title=English FA Cup \u2013 1991/1992|publisher=soccerbase.com|accessdate=27 June 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504045132/http://www.soccerbase.com/cup2.sd?competitionid=58&seasonid=121|archivedate=4 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A shoot-out was first used in the [[FA Cup Final]] in [[2005 FA Cup Final|2005]], when [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 5\u20134.<ref>[https://archive.today/20080708225448/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/04/FACF_Preview1.htm]</ref> The [[2006 FA Cup Final|following year]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the FA Cup Final's second ever penalty shoot-out.<ref>[https://archive.today/20080518095426/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2006/05/FACF06_MatchReport.htm]</ref>\n\nOn 31 August 2005, a new English record was established when a shoot-out between [[Tunbridge Wells F.C.|Tunbridge Wells]] and [[Littlehampton Town F.C.|Littlehampton Town]] in an FA Cup replay involved 40&nbsp;kicks being taken, with Tunbridge Wells winning 16\u201315.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/News/2005/Sep/FAC_TunbridgePenaltyRecord|title=Wells' shoot-out record|publisher=The FA|date=2 September 2005|accessdate=2013-07-01|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130203190722/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/News/2005/Sep/FAC_TunbridgePenaltyRecord|archivedate=3 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tunbridgewellsfc.co.uk/news.asp?offset=-1 |title=Latest news |publisher=Tunbridge Wells FC |accessdate=2012-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208120551/http://www.tunbridgewellsfc.co.uk/news.asp?offset=-1 |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nShoot-outs have been used to settle five [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] finals to date.  The first was in [[2001 Football League Cup Final|2001]] when [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 5\u20134 on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw after extra time in the match. The second was the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|2009 final]] between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] ended goalless and was won 4\u20131 on penalties by Manchester United.  Then the [[2012 Football League Cup Final|2012 final]] between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] finished 2\u20132 after extra time, Liverpool winning 3\u20132 on penalties. The [[2016 Football League Cup Final|2016 final]] was won by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] beating Liverpool 3\u20131 on penalties, after a 1\u20131 draw. Manchester City also won the [[2019 EFL Cup Final|2019 final]] 4\u20133 on penalties after a 0\u20130 draw with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].\n\nPenalty shoot-outs have been used for many years to settle drawn games in the earlier rounds of the [[Football League Cup]], the earliest example being August 1976 when [[Doncaster Rovers]] beat [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] 3\u20132 on penalties after three drawn games in a row (1\u20131, 1\u20131, 2\u20132) in a first round match. Shoot-outs tend to be quite rare in the semi-finals due to the [[away goal rule]] applying after extra time. However, a shoot-out was used in the [[2013-14 Football League Cup|2013\u201314 semi-final]] between [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]] and Manchester United after both teams finished level over two legs; Sunderland won the shoot-out 2\u20131.\n\nThe [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] is also settled using penalties, following the normal 90 minutes of play, but no extra time. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] have won the shield three times via a shoot-out, beating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in [[2003 FA Community Shield|2003]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in [[2007 FA Community Shield|2007]], and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in [[2008 FA Community Shield|2008]]. Manchester United lost the [[2009 FA Community Shield|2009]] match on penalties to Chelsea.\n\nIn 2008, the Turkish Cup Final featured two clubs outside of Istanbul's Top Three for the first time in two decades, but penalty kicks decided the winner between Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi and Kayserispor, the latter having reached the final for the first time ever. After a scoreless 120 minutes, 28 penalty kicks were needed to decide the outcome, and Kayserispor, thanks  to the goal scoring and goal saving heroics of Dimitar Ivankov, won its first Turkish Cup 11\u201310.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/news/newsid=2075236/|title=Kayserispor triumph in 28-penalty shootout|last=FIFA.com|date=7 May 2013|website=fifa.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606181033/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/news/newsid=2075236/|archivedate=6 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 Greek Cup final AEK took a 3\u20132 lead at 89\u2019 with a goal by Scocco; however Olympiacos came back from the dead at the dying seconds of stoppage time (90\u2019+6) with a goal by Derbyshire, to force an overtime. While Olympiacos took a 4\u20133 lead in overtime with a goal by Galletti, the scorer was sent off with a second yellow card for taking his shirt off while celebrating. Later on, Avraam Papadopoulos also got a second yellow leaving Olympiacos with 9 players. AEK managed to tie the game at 4\u20134 forcing a penalty shoot out.\n\nAEK was shooting first. Both AEK and Olympiacos scored in the first 4 penalties. Majstorovic of AEK hit the horizontal crossbar in the 5th penalty giving the chance to Djordjevic (for whom it was the closing game of his career) to seal the victory for Olympiacos. However, his shot was blocked by AEK\u2019s Argentinian goalkeeper Saha. Hence, the shooting continued. Both teams scored their 6th and 7th penalties. Center-back Antzas was slotted to hit the 8th penalty for Olympiacos, but keeper Nikopolidis took the initiative and took the penalty instead tying the score to 7\u20137. Nikopolidis blocked the subsequent (9th) penalty by Georgeas for AEK but Antzas missed the penalty for Olympiacos (saved by Saha) and failed to finish the shoot-out.\n\nSince Olympiacos had only 9 players in the field, the shooters had to rotate, going back to those that shoot the very first penalties. All 7 subsequent penalty takers for both teams scored, leading to a penalty shoot out that was at 14\u201314 with 32 (!) penalty shots having been taken. However, Pelletieri of AEK had a bad penalty shot that was easily deflected by Nikopolidis, who then took the 34th penalty shot against the other goalkeeper, Saha, scoring, and ending this saga with a 15\u201314 win for Olympiacos in penalty shoot out and an overall score of 19\u201318. ([[2008\u201309 Greek Cup]]).\n\n===UEFA club competitions===\nThe first penalty shoot-out in a European Cup final occurred in the [[1984 European Cup Final]] as [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] defeated [[A.S. Roma]]. The match is best known for the antics of Liverpool keeper [[Bruce Grobbelaar]]. As Roma's [[Bruno Conti]] prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded to bite the back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before [[Francesco Graziani]] took his kick, famously wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani duly missed and Liverpool went on to win the shootout 4\u20132.\n\nIn the [[1986 European Cup Final]] between [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] and [[FC Barcelona]], Steaua keeper [[Helmuth Duckadam]] saved all four of Barca's penalties, for which he was dubbed \"the hero of [[Seville]]\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Steaua's story |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8184991.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=7 August 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090806101018/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8184991.stm| archivedate= 6 August 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Steaua also missed two, but still prevailed 2\u20130 in the shoot-out to become the only Romanian club side to win the title.\n\nIn the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]] the penalty-shoot out has caused controversy among many fans as replays showed that [[Dida (goalkeeper)|Dida]] was off his goal line when saving penalties from [[David Trezeguet|Trezeguet]], [[Marcelo Zalayeta|Zalayeta]] and [[Paolo Montero|Montero]]. [[Gianluigi Buffon|Buffon]] was also off his goal line when saving penalties from [[Clarence Seedorf|Seedorf]] and [[Kakha Kaladze|Kaladze]].\n\nIn the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final]] between [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]], Liverpool keeper [[Jerzy Dudek]] used tactics similar to [[Bruce Grobbelaar]] in 1984 (known as the \"Dudek dance\" in 2005) to distract the Milan shootout takers which resulted in a victory for his team.\n\nThe [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]] between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] went to penalties, when [[John Terry]] missed a penalty which would have won Chelsea the match (and the Champions League). His standing leg slipped as he took his kick, and the ball hit the post. Chelsea lost the shoot-out 6\u20135, to which Terry reacted by breaking down in tears. Terry was not originally the penalty taker, however, striker [[Didier Drogba]] had been sent off shortly before extra time ended.\n\nIn the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League between [[Real Madrid]] and [[Bayern Munich]], [[Iker Casillas]] and [[Manuel Neuer]] each saved two spot kicks. Neuer kept out penalties from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (\u00a380 million) and [[Kak\u00e1]] (\u00a356 million), then the most expensive footballers in history from their transfer fees.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/9226202/Real-Madrid-2-Bayern-Munich-1-agg-3-3-Bayern-win-3-1-on-pens-match-report.html |title=Bayern Munich reach Champions League final after beating Real Madrid in dramatic penalty shoot-out |newspaper=Telegraph |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |location=London |first=Henry |last=Winter |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425225935/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/9226202/Real-Madrid-2-Bayern-Munich-1-agg-3-3-Bayern-win-3-1-on-pens-match-report.html |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2012 Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich 4\u20133 on penalties in the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final]]. Chelsea had never previously won a shoot-out in the competition, and had lost the 2008 final and 2007 semi-final on penalties. Bayern had never lost a shoot-out in Europe; their wins included the [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final|2001 final]] against Valencia and the 2012 semi-final against Real Madrid. [[Didier Drogba]] dispatched the winning penalty, having been unable to take the fifth kick (missed by Terry) in the 2008 final due to a red card in extra time. The following day, many British newspapers made reference to the fact that an English team had finally beaten a German team on penalties.\n\nFinally, on the tenth of November 2019, Ben Grogan missed a penalty in the final of some cup that no-one really cared about anyway. Still, the memory remains in the hearts and minds of his dearest friends as a reminder of what happens when you're shit at taking pens.\n\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/may/20/chelsea-national-newspapers|title=How the papers reported Chelsea's football victory|first=Roy|last=Greenslade|date=20 May 2012|website=the Guardian|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510223748/https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/may/20/chelsea-national-newspapers|archivedate=10 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Records===\nOn 17 July 2011, during the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] tournament in Argentina, Brazil missed 4 penalties in a row in the quarter-final, which allowed Paraguay to reach the semi-finals 2\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ca2011.com/jogos_tabela.php?idJ=0d3180d672e08b4c5312dcdafdf6ef36|title=CA2011.com \u2013 Brazil vs Paraguay|accessdate=17 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716052933/http://www.ca2011.com/jogos_tabela.php?idJ=0d3180d672e08b4c5312dcdafdf6ef36|archivedate=16 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe current World Record for the most penalties scored consecutively in a shoot out stands at 29, in a [[Hampshire Senior Cup]] second-round game between [[Brockenhurst F.C.|Brockenhurst]] and [[Andover Town F.C.|Andover Town]] on 9 October 2013, in which the 30th penalty was saved allowing Brockenhurst to win 15\u201314.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/10737257.Shoot_out_world_record_confirmed/|title=Andover Town shoot-out world record confirmed|work=Andover Advertiser|date=14 October 2013|accessdate=14 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104214440/http://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/10737257.Shoot_out_world_record_confirmed/|archivedate=4 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This beat the previous record of 27, in a Johnstones Paint Trophy first round match between [[Leyton Orient F.C.]] and [[Dagenham & Redbridge F.C.]] on 7 September 2011, in which the 28th penalty was saved allowing Dagenham to win the shootout.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nDuring the final of the [[1992 African Cup of Nations]] played in Senegal, Ivory Coast won the penalty shootout 11\u201310.

However, after the 2006 World Cup, [[Sepp Blatter]] stated that he wants no more penalty shoot-outs in the Final of the World Cup, tentatively suggesting either a replay or \"Maybe to take players away and play [[golden goal]]\".<ref name=\"blatter\" />\n\nHenry Birtles' \"Advantage\" proposal is for the shoot-out to be held before extra-time, and only acting as a tiebreak if the game remains a draw after the full 120 minutes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/33743/FIFA-ponder-end-to-shoot-out-woe |title=FIFA ponder end to shoot-out woe |work=[[Daily Express]] |date=4 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |first=Bill |last=Bradshaw }}\n</ref> Proponents of this idea state that it would lead to a more offensive extra-time as one of the teams would know they have to score and there would never be a match in which both teams are simply waiting for penalties. Another advantage is that players who have missed would have a chance to redeem themselves in extra-time. The obvious flaw is that the team that wins the penalty shoot-out would be inclined to play defensively in extra time in the knowledge that a draw would put them through. However, this flaw is not so clear because a single goal makes the difference between winning and losing, as opposed to a team which defends a single-goal lead more comfortably because a conceded goal is the difference between winning and drawing.\n\nAnother alternative is Attacker Defender Goalkeeper (ADG), which features a series of ten contests, in which an attacker has thirty seconds to score a goal against a defender and goalkeeper. At the completion of the ten contests, the team with the most goals is the winner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theadgalternative.com/ |title=Theadgalternative.com |publisher=Theadgalternative.com |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224090150/http://www.theadgalternative.com/ |archivedate=24 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bleacherreport.com/articles/1195909-10-alternatives-to-a-penalty-shootout |title=10 Alternatives to Penalty Shootouts |last=Tidey |first=Will |work=Bleacher Report |accessdate=2012-11-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103150137/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1195909-10-alternatives-to-a-penalty-shootout |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n==North American experiments==\nThe [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL) in the 1970s and 1980s, then [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) for its first four seasons (1996\u20131999) experimented with a variation of the shoot-out procedure.\n\nInstead of a straight penalty kick, the shoot-out started {{convert|35|yd|m|abbr=out|disp=or}} from the goal and having five seconds to attempt a shot. The player could make as many moves as he could in a breakaway situation in the five seconds, then attempt a shot. This procedure is similar to that used in an [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|ice hockey penalty shot]]. As with a standard shoot-out, this variation used a best-of-five-kicks model, and if the score was still level, the tiebreaker would head to an extra round of one attempt per team.\n\nThis format rewarded player skills, as players were able to attempt to deceive goalkeepers and play the ball in an attempt to make the shot, as in a one-on-one skills contest, and goalkeepers could take on the attackers without restrictions that are normally implemented in penalty shootouts. [[Soccer Bowl '81]], the NASL's 1981 championship final, was decided by this format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyG1cBb-cpM|title=NASL Soccer Bowl '81|last=thecelebratedmisterk|date=13 April 2010|accessdate=3 May 2018|via=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531020714/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyG1cBb-cpM|archivedate=31 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom its inception in [[1968 North American Soccer League season|1968]], the NASL used an unconventional point system in determining the league standings. Teams were awarded six points for a win and three points for a draw. In addition, teams earned one bonus point for each goal scored in a game up to a maximum of three per game. Thus, a team that lost 5\u20133 would earn three points. However, a team that lost 1\u20130 would earn no points. Also, a team that won 5\u20134 would earn nine points (the same as a 3\u20130 win). But a team that won 2\u20130 would earn only eight points. In the league's second season ([[1969 North American Soccer League season|1969]]), the [[Kansas City Spurs]] were the league champions with 10 wins, 2 losses and 4 ties even though the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] had 11 wins, 2 losses and 3 ties, because Kansas City earned more bonus points. Starting with [[1971 North American Soccer League season|1971]] postseason playoff matches, the NASL used a [[golden goal]] rule, and every match had a winner decided from the run of play. Extra-time sessions were 15 minutes long before a brief break and change of ends. Game 1 of the 1971 NASL semifinal series between the [[Rochester Lancers (1967\u201380)|Rochester Lancers]] and the [[Dallas Tornado]] went six extra-time periods with Rochester scoring the game-winning goal in the 176th minute. Game 3 of that same series went four extra time periods with Dallas scoring in the 148th minute to win the match and the series. In [[1975 North American Soccer League season|1975]], the NASL adopted a conventional penalty-kick shootout system for all regular-season and postseason playoff matches, and there were no longer any NASL matches that ended in ties. In the standings, a team that won in regulation time was awarded six points. A team that won in a penalty-kick shootout was awarded one point. Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game. In [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977]], the NASL adopted the experimental North American shootout procedure described above. If a match was tied after 90 minutes, a maximum of two golden goal extra time periods of 7.5 minutes each were played. If neither team scored, the shootout was held to determine the winner of the match. In the standings, a team that won was awarded six points whether the win came in regulation time, extra time or by shootout. Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game. No bonus points were awarded for goals scored in extra time. Postseason playoff games were decided in the same manner. In [[1981 North American Soccer League season|1981]], the number of points awarded to a team that won a game in a shootout was reduced from six to four. This remained the system until the NASL's final season in [[1984 North American Soccer League season|1984]].\n\nFrom its inception in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]], MLS used the shootout system that had been used by the NASL to determine winners of matches. No regular-season or postseason playoff games ended in a tie. In general, no extra time was played; the shootout commenced immediately after 90 minutes had been played. The only exception was in the [[MLS Cup '96|MLS Cup Final]] in which a match tied after 90 minutes would be followed by a maximum of two 15-minute extra time sessions on a golden goal basis. In the regular-season standings, a team that won a match in regulation was awarded three points. A team that won a match in a shootout was awarded one point. There were no bonus points or points awarded to teams that lost whether in regulation time or a shootout. In the playoffs, the conference semifinals and conference finals were organized as best-of-three matches series. A shootout win counted as a win. Thus, a team could win two of the three matches by shootout and lose the other match in regulation and still advance to the next round. This was inconsistent with how the teams were rewarded during the regular season when the team with one win would have earned three points, and the team with two wins would have earned only two points. In [[1999 Major League Soccer season|1999]], a maximum of two 15-minute golden goal extra time periods were added for matches that were tied after 90 minutes of regulation play. If neither team scored during extra time, the match was decided by a shootout. MLS abandoned the North American style shootout starting with the [[2000 Major League Soccer season|2000 season]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Yannis|date=18 November 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=M.L.S. is Making Changes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/sports/soccer-mls-is-making-changes.html|accessdate=13 July 2014|location=New York|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180417/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/sports/soccer-mls-is-making-changes.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> If penalties are required to determine a winner during the playoffs, MLS now uses the shoot-out procedure specified by the International Football Association Board.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[List of FIFA Women's World Cup penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[List of UEFA European Championship penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[List of Copa Am\u00e9rica penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[List of CONCACAF Gold Cup penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[Penalty shoot-out]]\n* [[Penalty kick (association football)|Penalty kick]]\n* [[Golden goal]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''On Penalties'' by Andrew Anthony ({{ISBN|0-224-06116-X}})\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Penalty shootout (association football)}}\n* [http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/penalties.html Penalty Shoot-out Trivia] \u2014 [[rec.sport.soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]\n* [http://www.penaltyshoot-outs.co.uk/index.html Penalty Shoot-outs]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \u2014 by four researchers associated with the Fit Project at the [[Open University]]\n\n[[Category:Association football penalty shoot-outs| ]]\n[[Category:Laws of association football]]\n[[Category:Association football terminology]]\n[[Category:Street football games]]\n[[Category:Sports penalties]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n\nA '''penalty shoot-out''' (officially '''kicks from the penalty mark''')<ref name=\"Laws\">{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2016/2017|url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/60/Laws%20of%20the%20Game_16-17_Digital_Eng.pdf|author=IFAB|authorlink=International Football Association Board|publisher=[[IFAB]]|location=[[Zurich]]|accessdate=27 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911032912/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/60/Laws%20of%20the%20Game_16-17_Digital_Eng.pdf|archivedate=11 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is a method of determining which team is awarded victory in an [[association football]] match that cannot end in a [[tie (draw)|draw]], when the score is tied after the regulation playing time as well as [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] (if used) have expired. In a penalty shoot-out, each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark, with the goal only defended by the opposing team's goalkeeper. Each team has five shots which must be taken by different kickers; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor. Shoot-outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead. If scores are level after five pairs of shots, the shootout progresses into additional \"sudden-death\" rounds.<ref name=\"Laws\" /> Balls successfully kicked into the goal during a shoot-out do not count as goals for the individual kickers or the team, and are tallied separately from the goals scored during normal play (including extra time, if any). Although the procedure for each individual kick in the shoot-out resembles that of a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]], there are some differences. Most notably, neither the kicker nor any player other than the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] may play the ball again once it has been kicked.\n\nThe penalty shoot-out is one of the three methods of breaking a draw that are currently approved by the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]; the others are extra time and, for [[two-legged tie]]s, the [[away goals rule]].<ref name=\"Laws\" /> A shoot-out is usually used only after one or more of the other methods fail to produce a winner. The method of breaking a draw for a specific match is determined beforehand by the match organizing body. In most professional level competitions, two 15-minute extra time periods are played if the score is tied at the end of regulation time, and a shoot-out is held if the score is still tied after the extra time periods.\n\nAlthough widely employed in football since the 1970s, penalty shoot-outs have been widely criticized by many followers of the game, due primarily to their perceived reliance on [[luck]] rather than skill and their dependence on individual duels between opposing players, which is arguably not in keeping with football as a [[team sport]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Wilson, M|author2=Wood, G|author3=Jordet, G.|title=The BASES Expert Statement on the Psychological Preparation for Football Penalty Shootouts|url=http://www.bases.org.uk/write/545_Expert_statement_on_Psychological_preparation_for_Football_penalty_shootouts.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106200749/http://www.bases.org.uk/write/545_Expert_statement_on_Psychological_preparation_for_Football_penalty_shootouts.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2016|publisher=British Association of Sports and Exercise Sciences|accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref> Conversely, some believe the pressure and unpredictability involved makes it one of the most thrilling finales to any sport.<ref>{{Cite web |title=World Cup shootouts are great and here is how other sports can adopt the thrilling finale |quote=But all those things combine to make it dramatic and compulsive viewing, the ultimate element of instant unpredictability, a quick fix for both the \u201cshort attention span\u201d generation and all the ones before it, too.

The procedure is specified in Law 10 (\"Determining the Outcome of a Match\") of the IFAB's ''Laws of the Game'' document (p.&nbsp;71).<ref name=\"Laws\" />\n\n# The referee tosses a coin to decide the goal at which the kicks will be taken.  The choice of goal by the coin toss winner may only be changed by the referee for safety reasons or if the goal or playing surface becomes unusable.<ref name=\"Laws\"/>\n# The referee tosses the coin a second time to determine which team will take the first kick.\n# All players other than the kicker and the goalkeepers must remain in the [[Association football pitch|pitch]]'s centre circle (see above).\n# Each kick will be taken in the general manner of a penalty kick. Each kick will be taken from the [[Penalty area|penalty mark]], which is {{convert|11|m|yd|abbr=in}} from the goal line and equidistant from each touch line, with the goal defended only by the opposing goalkeeper. The goalkeeper must remain between the goal posts on his goal line until the ball has been kicked, although he can jump in place, wave his arms, move side to side along the goal line or otherwise try to distract the shooter.\n# Each team is responsible for selecting from the eligible players the order in which they will take the kicks.\n# Each kicker can kick the ball only once. Once kicked, the kicker may not play the ball again. The decision on a re-kick is solely at the referee's discretion.\n# No other player on either team, other than the designated kicker and goalkeeper, may touch the ball.<ref name=\"Laws\" />\n# A kick is successful if, having been touched once by the kicker, the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar, without touching any player, official, or outside agent other than the defending goalkeeper. The ball may touch the goalkeeper, goal posts, or crossbar any number of times before going into the goal as long as the referee believes the ball's motion is the result of the initial kick. This was clarified after an incident in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] shoot-out between [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[France national football team|France]]. [[Bruno Bellone]]'s kick rebounded out off the post, hit goalkeeper [[Carlos Roberto Gallo|Carlos]]'s back, and subsequently bounced into the goal. Referee [[Ioan Igna]] gave the goal to France, and Brazil captain [[Edino Nazareth Filho|Edinho]] was booked for protesting that the kick should have been considered a miss as soon as it rebounded off the post. In 1987, the [[International Football Association Board]] clarified Law&nbsp;14, covering penalty kicks, to support Igna's decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corshamref.org.uk/newsletter/news06jul.htm |date=July 2006 |title=The Corsham Referee Newsletter |first=Julian |last=Carosi |accessdate=2008-06-20 |number=31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006164438/http://corshamref.org.uk/newsletter/news06jul.htm |archivedate=6 October 2008 }} and {{cite book |chapter-url=http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1987/1987app.pdf |title=Minutes of the AGM |author=IFAB |publisher=Soccer South Bay Referee Association |location=Llandudno |date=13 June 1987 |accessdate=29 November 2009 |pages=18\u201322 |chapter=III.8(a) Proposal by the Scottish Football Association: Law XIV\u2014Penalty Kick |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430130743/http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1987/1987app.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n# Teams take turns to kick from the penalty mark until each has taken five kicks. However, if one side has scored more successful kicks than the other could possibly reach with all of its remaining kicks, the shoot-out immediately ends, regardless of the number of kicks remaining; this basis is called \"best-of-five kicks\". An example of this is the 2006 World Cup final, the shootout ended after Italy's [[Fabio Grosso]] had scored his team's fifth, despite the fact that France (on 3) still had one more to go.\n# If after five rounds of kicks the teams have an equal number of successful kicks, additional rounds of one kick each will be used until one team scores and the other misses. This is known as [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]].\n# The team that scores the most successful kicks at the end of the shoot-out will be the winner of the match.\n# Only players who were on the pitch at the end of play or temporarily absent (injured, adjusting equipment etc.) will be allowed to participate in the shoot-out.<ref name=\"Laws\" /> If at the end of the match and before or during the kicks one side has more players on the pitch than the other, whether as a result of injury or red cards, then the side with more players must reduce its numbers to match the opponents; this is known as 'reduce to equate'. For example, if Team&nbsp;A has 11&nbsp;players but Team&nbsp;B only has 10, then Team&nbsp;A will choose one player who will not take part. Players excluded this way normally take no further part in the procedure, except that they can be used to replace an injured goalkeeper. The rule was introduced by the International Football Association Board in February 2000 because previously an eleventh kick would be taken by the eleventh (i.e. weakest) player of a full-strength team and the first (i.e. strongest) player of a sub-strength team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid=74400.html |title=The Laws change and the game gets better |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=1 August 2000 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514104336/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid%3D74400.html |archivedate=14 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> A rule change in 2016 eliminated the possibility of a team gaining such an advantage if a player is injured or sent off ''during'' the shoot-out.<ref name=\"changes2016\">{{cite web|last1=Hinch|first1=Will|title=Football Law Changes 2016/17|url=https://www.pitchero.com/blog/football-law-changes-201617|website=Pitchero|accessdate=14 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807040806/https://www.pitchero.com/blog/football-law-changes-201617|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n# A team may replace a goalkeeper who becomes injured during the shoot-out with a substitute (provided the team has not already used the maximum number of substitutes allowed by the competition) or by a player previously excluded under the 'reduce to equate' provision.<ref name=\"Laws\" />\n# If a goalkeeper is sent off during the shoot-out, another player who finished the game must act as goalkeeper.<ref name=\"Laws\" />\n# If a player, other than the goalkeeper, becomes injured or is sent off during the shoot-out, then the shoot-out will continue with no substitution allowed.

Some decide which way they will dive beforehand, giving themselves time to reach the side of the goalmouth.  A 2011 study published in the journal ''Psychological Science'' found goalkeepers dived to the right 71% of the time when their team was losing, but only 48% when ahead and 49% when tied, a phenomenon believed to be related to certain right-preferring behaviour in social mammals.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/02/138922339/under-pressure-soccer-goalies-tend-to-dive-right|title=Under Pressure, Soccer Goalies Tend To Dive Right|date=2 August 2011|accessdate=2011-09-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803010726/http://www.npr.org/2011/08/02/138922339/under-pressure-soccer-goalies-tend-to-dive-right|archivedate=3 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Others try to read the kicker's motion pattern. Kickers may attempt to feint, or delay their shot to see which way the keeper dives. Shooting high and centre, in the space that the keeper will evacuate, carries the highest risk of shooting above the bar.<ref>How to actually, seriously play soccer 2007/2008, p.130: \"Don't shoot right down the pipe\"</ref>  If a keeper blocks a penalty kick during a match, there is a danger the kicker or a teammate may score from the rebound; this is not relevant in the case of a shoot-out.\n\nSince the entire shoot-out is conducted at the same goal, the crowd behind the goal may favour one team and try to distract the other team's shooters. To forestall any potential advantage, in 2016 the Laws of the Game were modified to add a coin toss between the two teams prior to the shoot-out: the winner of the coin toss has the right to decide which goal is used for the shoot-out (previously, the decision was at the referee's discretion). The referee may change the goal only for safety reasons or if the selected goal or pitch are unusable.<ref name=\"Laws\"/>\n\nA goalkeeper may not use distracting gamesmanship such as cleaning his boots or asking the referee to see if the ball is placed properly; this risks a [[Misconduct (association football)#Cautionable offences (yellow card)|caution]] for [[unsporting conduct]].

After Euro 1996, England lost four more shoot-outs in a row in major tournament finals, losing to Argentina at the 1998 World Cup, Portugal at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup and Italy at Euro 2012, before finally breaking their losing streak at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]] against Colombia; this shootout also allowed England to progress into the quarter-finals for the first time in twelve years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2018/07/03/england-vs-colombia-world-cup-2018-live-score-harry-kane-latest/|title=England banish penalty curse to pass Colombia test and reach World Cup quarter-final: live reaction|last=Wallace|first=Sam|date=2018-07-03|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-07-03|last2=Tyers|first2=Alan|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nThe Netherlands, meanwhile, lost four consecutive shoot-outs; against Denmark in Euro 1992, France in Euro 1996, Brazil in the 1998 World Cup, and Italy in Euro 2000, before finally winning one against Sweden in Euro 2004. In Euro 2000, the Netherlands had two penalty kicks during the match and four attempts in the shootout but only managed to convert one kick against Italian keeper [[Francesco Toldo]]. [[Frank de Boer]] had both a penalty kick and shootout kick saved by Toldo, who also saved from [[Paul Bosvelt]] to give Italy a 3\u20131 shootout victory. The Netherlands' fortunes seemed to have improved during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] when they defeated Costa Rica on penalty kicks in their quarter-final, only to lose again on penalties in their semi-final against Argentina.\n\nThe Italians have lost six shoot-outs in major championships, notably being eliminated from three consecutive World Cups (1990\u20131998, including the 1994 final) and the Euro 2016 quarter-finals on penalties. However, they have also won three shoot-outs, including the Euro 2000 semi-final against the Netherlands, the Euro 2012 quarter-final against England, and the 2006 World Cup Final against France.\n\nOn 16 November 2005, a place in the World Cup was directly determined by a penalty shoot-out for the first time.

A scoreless 30 minutes of [[extra time]] was followed by a shoot-out, which Australia won 4\u20132.\n\nDuring the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] set an unwanted new record in the round&nbsp;of&nbsp;16 shoot-out against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] by failing to convert any of their penalties, losing 3\u20130. The goalkeeper [[Oleksandr Shovkovsky]] ([[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]]) became the first not to concede a single goal in the penalty shoot-out, saving two of the Swiss attempts, with another shot hitting the crossbar. The result meant that Switzerland became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals (and, moreover, the only nation to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal).\n\nThe same competition featured a shoot-out between Germany and Argentina, the two most successful teams up to that point in terms of World Cup finals penalty shoot-outs: each team had competed in 3 shoot-outs and won all of them. Germany won the shoot-out, leaving Germany alone with a 4\u20130 record in World Cup finals.\n\nOn 20 June 2007, a new UEFA record was established.<ref>{{cite web\n|work=UEFA.com\n|title=Netherlands News\n|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=548583.html\n|accessdate=2007-08-21\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017163842/http://uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind%3D1/newsid%3D548583.html\n|archivedate=17 October 2007\n|url-status=dead\n|df=dmy-all\n}}</ref>  The semi-final of the European under-21 Championships in [[Abe Lenstra Stadion|Heerenveen]] between the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands]] and [[England national under-21 football team|England]] team finished 1\u20131.

They were introduced more generally in the [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392 season]] to decide matches still level after one replay and extra time. Previously there was no limit on the number of replays, which led to fixture disruption, especially disliked by the top clubs. Replays were often two or three days after the drawn match, which conflicted with the increased planning required after the [[Football Spectators Act 1989]]. The first team eliminated from the FA Cup on penalties was [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], beaten on 26 October 1991 by [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] after a first-round replay.<ref name=\"CoxRussell2002\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Cox|editor1-first=Richard William|editor2-last=Russell|editor2-first=Dave|editor3-last=Vamplew|editor3-first=Wray|first= John |last=Coyle |title=Encyclopedia of British football|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC&pg=PA265 |accessdate=27 June 2010|date=3 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8|page=265|chapter=Replays}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/cup2.sd?competitionid=58&seasonid=121|title=English FA Cup \u2013 1991/1992|publisher=soccerbase.com|accessdate=27 June 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504045132/http://www.soccerbase.com/cup2.sd?competitionid=58&seasonid=121|archivedate=4 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A shoot-out was first used in the [[FA Cup Final]] in [[2005 FA Cup Final|2005]], when [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 5\u20134.<ref>[https://archive.today/20080708225448/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/04/FACF_Preview1.htm]</ref> The [[2006 FA Cup Final|following year]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the FA Cup Final's second ever penalty shoot-out.<ref>[https://archive.today/20080518095426/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2006/05/FACF06_MatchReport.htm]</ref>\n\nOn 31 August 2005, a new English record was established when a shoot-out between [[Tunbridge Wells F.C.|Tunbridge Wells]] and [[Littlehampton Town F.C.|Littlehampton Town]] in an FA Cup replay involved 40&nbsp;kicks being taken, with Tunbridge Wells winning 16\u201315.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/News/2005/Sep/FAC_TunbridgePenaltyRecord|title=Wells' shoot-out record|publisher=The FA|date=2 September 2005|accessdate=2013-07-01|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130203190722/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/News/2005/Sep/FAC_TunbridgePenaltyRecord|archivedate=3 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tunbridgewellsfc.co.uk/news.asp?offset=-1 |title=Latest news |publisher=Tunbridge Wells FC |accessdate=2012-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208120551/http://www.tunbridgewellsfc.co.uk/news.asp?offset=-1 |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nShoot-outs have been used to settle five [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] finals to date.  The first was in [[2001 Football League Cup Final|2001]] when [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 5\u20134 on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw after extra time in the match. The second was the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|2009 final]] between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] ended goalless and was won 4\u20131 on penalties by Manchester United.  Then the [[2012 Football League Cup Final|2012 final]] between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] finished 2\u20132 after extra time, Liverpool winning 3\u20132 on penalties. The [[2016 Football League Cup Final|2016 final]] was won by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] beating Liverpool 3\u20131 on penalties, after a 1\u20131 draw. Manchester City also won the [[2019 EFL Cup Final|2019 final]] 4\u20133 on penalties after a 0\u20130 draw with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].\n\nPenalty shoot-outs have been used for many years to settle drawn games in the earlier rounds of the [[Football League Cup]], the earliest example being August 1976 when [[Doncaster Rovers]] beat [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] 3\u20132 on penalties after three drawn games in a row (1\u20131, 1\u20131, 2\u20132) in a first round match. Shoot-outs tend to be quite rare in the semi-finals due to the [[away goal rule]] applying after extra time. However, a shoot-out was used in the [[2013-14 Football League Cup|2013\u201314 semi-final]] between [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]] and Manchester United after both teams finished level over two legs; Sunderland won the shoot-out 2\u20131.\n\nThe [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] is also settled using penalties, following the normal 90 minutes of play, but no extra time. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] have won the shield three times via a shoot-out, beating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in [[2003 FA Community Shield|2003]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in [[2007 FA Community Shield|2007]], and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in [[2008 FA Community Shield|2008]]. Manchester United lost the [[2009 FA Community Shield|2009]] match on penalties to Chelsea.\n\nIn 2008, the Turkish Cup Final featured two clubs outside of Istanbul's Top Three for the first time in two decades, but penalty kicks decided the winner between Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi and Kayserispor, the latter having reached the final for the first time ever. After a scoreless 120 minutes, 28 penalty kicks were needed to decide the outcome, and Kayserispor, thanks  to the goal scoring and goal saving heroics of Dimitar Ivankov, won its first Turkish Cup 11\u201310.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/news/newsid=2075236/|title=Kayserispor triumph in 28-penalty shootout|last=FIFA.com|date=7 May 2013|website=fifa.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606181033/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/news/newsid=2075236/|archivedate=6 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 Greek Cup final AEK took a 3\u20132 lead at 89\u2019 with a goal by Scocco; however Olympiacos came back from the dead at the dying seconds of stoppage time (90\u2019+6) with a goal by Derbyshire, to force an overtime. While Olympiacos took a 4\u20133 lead in overtime with a goal by Galletti, the scorer was sent off with a second yellow card for taking his shirt off while celebrating. Later on, Avraam Papadopoulos also got a second yellow leaving Olympiacos with 9 players. AEK managed to tie the game at 4\u20134 forcing a penalty shoot out.\n\nAEK was shooting first. Both AEK and Olympiacos scored in the first 4 penalties. Majstorovic of AEK hit the horizontal crossbar in the 5th penalty giving the chance to Djordjevic (for whom it was the closing game of his career) to seal the victory for Olympiacos. However, his shot was blocked by AEK\u2019s Argentinian goalkeeper Saha. Hence, the shooting continued. Both teams scored their 6th and 7th penalties. Center-back Antzas was slotted to hit the 8th penalty for Olympiacos, but keeper Nikopolidis took the initiative and took the penalty instead tying the score to 7\u20137. Nikopolidis blocked the subsequent (9th) penalty by Georgeas for AEK but Antzas missed the penalty for Olympiacos (saved by Saha) and failed to finish the shoot-out.\n\nSince Olympiacos had only 9 players in the field, the shooters had to rotate, going back to those that shoot the very first penalties. All 7 subsequent penalty takers for both teams scored, leading to a penalty shoot out that was at 14\u201314 with 32 (!) penalty shots having been taken. However, Pelletieri of AEK had a bad penalty shot that was easily deflected by Nikopolidis, who then took the 34th penalty shot against the other goalkeeper, Saha, scoring, and ending this saga with a 15\u201314 win for Olympiacos in penalty shoot out and an overall score of 19\u201318. ([[2008\u201309 Greek Cup]]).\n\n===UEFA club competitions===\nThe first penalty shoot-out in a European Cup final occurred in the [[1984 European Cup Final]] as [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] defeated [[A.S. Roma]]. The match is best known for the antics of Liverpool keeper [[Bruce Grobbelaar]]. As Roma's [[Bruno Conti]] prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded to bite the back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before [[Francesco Graziani]] took his kick, famously wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani duly missed and Liverpool went on to win the shootout 4\u20132.\n\nIn the [[1986 European Cup Final]] between [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] and [[FC Barcelona]], Steaua keeper [[Helmuth Duckadam]] saved all four of Barca's penalties, for which he was dubbed \"the hero of [[Seville]]\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Steaua's story |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8184991.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 August 2009 |accessdate=7 August 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090806101018/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8184991.stm| archivedate= 6 August 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Steaua also missed two, but still prevailed 2\u20130 in the shoot-out to become the only Romanian club side to win the title.\n\nIn the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]] the penalty-shoot out has caused controversy among many fans as replays showed that [[Dida (goalkeeper)|Dida]] was off his goal line when saving penalties from [[David Trezeguet|Trezeguet]], [[Marcelo Zalayeta|Zalayeta]] and [[Paolo Montero|Montero]]. [[Gianluigi Buffon|Buffon]] was also off his goal line when saving penalties from [[Clarence Seedorf|Seedorf]] and [[Kakha Kaladze|Kaladze]].\n\nIn the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final]] between [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]], Liverpool keeper [[Jerzy Dudek]] used tactics similar to [[Bruce Grobbelaar]] in 1984 (known as the \"Dudek dance\" in 2005) to distract the Milan shootout takers which resulted in a victory for his team.\n\nThe [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]] between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] went to penalties, when [[John Terry]] missed a penalty which would have won Chelsea the match (and the Champions League). His standing leg slipped as he took his kick, and the ball hit the post. Chelsea lost the shoot-out 6\u20135, to which Terry reacted by breaking down in tears. Terry was not originally the penalty taker, however, striker [[Didier Drogba]] had been sent off shortly before extra time ended.\n\nIn the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League between [[Real Madrid]] and [[Bayern Munich]], [[Iker Casillas]] and [[Manuel Neuer]] each saved two spot kicks. Neuer kept out penalties from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (\u00a380 million) and [[Kak\u00e1]] (\u00a356 million), then the most expensive footballers in history from their transfer fees.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/9226202/Real-Madrid-2-Bayern-Munich-1-agg-3-3-Bayern-win-3-1-on-pens-match-report.html |title=Bayern Munich reach Champions League final after beating Real Madrid in dramatic penalty shoot-out |newspaper=Telegraph |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |location=London |first=Henry |last=Winter |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425225935/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/9226202/Real-Madrid-2-Bayern-Munich-1-agg-3-3-Bayern-win-3-1-on-pens-match-report.html |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2012 Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich 4\u20133 on penalties in the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final]].

and since shoot-outs were introduced.\n\nHistorically, one of the first tie-breaking procedures was contained in the [[wikisource:Sheffield Rules#Rules of 1862|Sheffield Rules]] between 1862 and 1871, with the concept of the ''rouge'', scorable when the ball went narrowly wide off the goal. Rule&nbsp;14 stated \"A goal outweighs any number of rouges. Should no goals or an equal number be obtained, the match is decided by rouges\". Similarly, the [[Try (rugby)|try]] in [[rugby football]] was used from 1875 as a tie-breaker if teams were level on goals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |title=Scoring through the ages |last=Trueman |first=Nigel |work=Rugby football history |accessdate=2009-10-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804112452/http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |archivedate=4 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nA drawn result may be allowed to stand, unless the fixture determines which team qualifies for a later round.

They both won 2\u20131 at home, so they played a third match at a neutral location. When this ended in a 1\u20131 draw after extra time, Morocco advanced on a coin toss to the next round of qualification. This scenario was repeated during the [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification process]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], when the same two teams were tied after three matches and extra time. Again, Morocco advanced on a coin toss. Tunisia did have better luck with the coin toss in the intervening years; during the [[1965 African Cup of Nations]], they reached the final at the expense of Senegal by winning a coin toss after three group matches had left Tunisia and Senegal tied with a win (over Ethiopia) and a draw (against each other).\n\nCurrent alternatives include replaying a match that has ended in a draw. This still occurs in the fifth (last sixteen) round and earlier rounds of the [[FA Cup|English FA Cup]]. Until 1991, any number of replays were permitted, with a record of five.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/05/48711.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20040106155319/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/05/48711.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 January 2004 |title=FA Cup Trivia |date=16 May 2003 |accessdate=2008-06-15 |publisher=[[The Football Association|FA]]}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2018}} (Since then, a draw in the (first) replay has been resolved by a penalty-shoot-out.) Only once, in [[1974 European Cup Final|1974]], did the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final go to a replay.\n\nOther suggestions have included using elements of match play such as most shots on goal, most [[corner kick]]s awarded, fewest [[Misconduct (association football)|cautions and sendings-off]], or having ongoing [[extra time]] with teams compelled to remove players at progressive intervals (similar to regular season play in the [[National Hockey League]], where players play 3-on-3 in the extra time).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.penaltyshootouts.co.uk/alternatives.html |title=Penalty Shoot-outs: alternatives |first=Jon |last=Billsberry |author2=Nathalie van Meurs |author3=Patrick Nelson |author4=Gareth Edwards |accessdate=2008-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624181210/http://www.penaltyshootouts.co.uk/alternatives.html |archivedate=24 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These proposals have not yet been authorised by the [[International Football Association Board]].

Another advantage is that players who have missed would have a chance to redeem themselves in extra-time. The obvious flaw is that the team that wins the penalty shoot-out would be inclined to play defensively in extra time in the knowledge that a draw would put them through. However, this flaw is not so clear because a single goal makes the difference between winning and losing, as opposed to a team which defends a single-goal lead more comfortably because a conceded goal is the difference between winning and drawing.\n\nAnother alternative is Attacker Defender Goalkeeper (ADG), which features a series of ten contests, in which an attacker has thirty seconds to score a goal against a defender and goalkeeper. At the completion of the ten contests, the team with the most goals is the winner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theadgalternative.com/ |title=Theadgalternative.com |publisher=Theadgalternative.com |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224090150/http://www.theadgalternative.com/ |archivedate=24 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bleacherreport.com/articles/1195909-10-alternatives-to-a-penalty-shootout |title=10 Alternatives to Penalty Shootouts |last=Tidey |first=Will |work=Bleacher Report |accessdate=2012-11-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103150137/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1195909-10-alternatives-to-a-penalty-shootout |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n==North American experiments==\nThe [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL) in the 1970s and 1980s, then [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) for its first four seasons (1996\u20131999) experimented with a variation of the shoot-out procedure.\n\nInstead of a straight penalty kick, the shoot-out started {{convert|35|yd|m|abbr=out|disp=or}} from the goal and having five seconds to attempt a shot. The player could make as many moves as he could in a breakaway situation in the five seconds, then attempt a shot. This procedure is similar to that used in an [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|ice hockey penalty shot]]. As with a standard shoot-out, this variation used a best-of-five-kicks model, and if the score was still level, the tiebreaker would head to an extra round of one attempt per team.\n\nThis format rewarded player skills, as players were able to attempt to deceive goalkeepers and play the ball in an attempt to make the shot, as in a one-on-one skills contest, and goalkeepers could take on the attackers without restrictions that are normally implemented in penalty shootouts. [[Soccer Bowl '81]], the NASL's 1981 championship final, was decided by this format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyG1cBb-cpM|title=NASL Soccer Bowl '81|last=thecelebratedmisterk|date=13 April 2010|accessdate=3 May 2018|via=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531020714/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyG1cBb-cpM|archivedate=31 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom its inception in [[1968 North American Soccer League season|1968]], the NASL used an unconventional point system in determining the league standings. Teams were awarded six points for a win and three points for a draw. In addition, teams earned one bonus point for each goal scored in a game up to a maximum of three per game. Thus, a team that lost 5\u20133 would earn three points. However, a team that lost 1\u20130 would earn no points. Also, a team that won 5\u20134 would earn nine points (the same as a 3\u20130 win). But a team that won 2\u20130 would earn only eight points. In the league's second season ([[1969 North American Soccer League season|1969]]), the [[Kansas City Spurs]] were the league champions with 10 wins, 2 losses and 4 ties even though the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] had 11 wins, 2 losses and 3 ties, because Kansas City earned more bonus points. Starting with [[1971 North American Soccer League season|1971]] postseason playoff matches, the NASL used a [[golden goal]] rule, and every match had a winner decided from the run of play. Extra-time sessions were 15 minutes long before a brief break and change of ends. Game 1 of the 1971 NASL semifinal series between the [[Rochester Lancers (1967\u201380)|Rochester Lancers]] and the [[Dallas Tornado]] went six extra-time periods with Rochester scoring the game-winning goal in the 176th minute. Game 3 of that same series went four extra time periods with Dallas scoring in the 148th minute to win the match and the series. In [[1975 North American Soccer League season|1975]], the NASL adopted a conventional penalty-kick shootout system for all regular-season and postseason playoff matches, and there were no longer any NASL matches that ended in ties. In the standings, a team that won in regulation time was awarded six points. A team that won in a penalty-kick shootout was awarded one point. Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game. In [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977]], the NASL adopted the experimental North American shootout procedure described above. If a match was tied after 90 minutes, a maximum of two golden goal extra time periods of 7.5 minutes each were played. If neither team scored, the shootout was held to determine the winner of the match. In the standings, a team that won was awarded six points whether the win came in regulation time, extra time or by shootout. Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game. No bonus points were awarded for goals scored in extra time. Postseason playoff games were decided in the same manner. In [[1981 North American Soccer League season|1981]], the number of points awarded to a team that won a game in a shootout was reduced from six to four. This remained the system until the NASL's final season in [[1984 North American Soccer League season|1984]].\n\nFrom its inception in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]], MLS used the shootout system that had been used by the NASL to determine winners of matches. No regular-season or postseason playoff games ended in a tie. In general, no extra time was played; the shootout commenced immediately after 90 minutes had been played. The only exception was in the [[MLS Cup '96|MLS Cup Final]] in which a match tied after 90 minutes would be followed by a maximum of two 15-minute extra time sessions on a golden goal basis. In the regular-season standings, a team that won a match in regulation was awarded three points. A team that won a match in a shootout was awarded one point. There were no bonus points or points awarded to teams that lost whether in regulation time or a shootout. In the playoffs, the conference semifinals and conference finals were organized as best-of-three matches series. A shootout win counted as a win. Thus, a team could win two of the three matches by shootout and lose the other match in regulation and still advance to the next round. This was inconsistent with how the teams were rewarded during the regular season when the team with one win would have earned three points, and the team with two wins would have earned only two points. In [[1999 Major League Soccer season|1999]], a maximum of two 15-minute golden goal extra time periods were added for matches that were tied after 90 minutes of regulation play. If neither team scored during extra time, the match was decided by a shootout. MLS abandoned the North American style shootout starting with the [[2000 Major League Soccer season|2000 season]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Yannis|date=18 November 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=M.L.S. is Making Changes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/sports/soccer-mls-is-making-changes.html|accessdate=13 July 2014|location=New York|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180417/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/sports/soccer-mls-is-making-changes.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> If penalties are required to determine a winner during the playoffs, MLS now uses the shoot-out procedure specified by the International Football Association Board.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[List of FIFA Women's World Cup penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[List of UEFA European Championship penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[List of Copa Am\u00e9rica penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[List of CONCACAF Gold Cup penalty shoot-outs]]\n* [[Penalty shoot-out]]\n* [[Penalty kick (association football)|Penalty kick]]\n* [[Golden goal]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''On Penalties'' by Andrew Anthony ({{ISBN|0-224-06116-X}})\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Penalty shootout (association football)}}\n* [http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/penalties.html Penalty Shoot-out Trivia] \u2014 [[rec.sport.soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]\n* [http://www.penaltyshoot-outs.co.uk/index.html Penalty Shoot-outs]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \u2014 by four researchers associated with the Fit Project at the [[Open University]]\n\n[[Category:Association football penalty shoot-outs| ]]\n[[Category:Laws of association football]]\n[[Category:Association football terminology]]\n[[Category:Street football games]]\n[[Category:Sports penalties]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c6:6286:3100:bc1e:a591:58b9:acbb", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eUEFA club competitions)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)"}

Holy Cross High School]]'' 4 F.3d 166 (2nd Cir. 1993) was an employment discrimination case brought under the ADEA ([[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]]). The appellant, Guy DeMarco, was released from employment prior to his eligibility for tenure at the age of forty-nine. Holy Cross High School argued that it was not subject to ADEA laws, and if it were that this case against it was in violation of the [[Free Exercise Clause]] and the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]]. The defendant also argued that the plaintiff failed to utilize the administrative remedies available. The court noted that other anti-discrimination statutes were held to be applicable to religious organizations, with the exception of statutes that prohibited discrimination based on religious belief. Since statutes prohibiting discrimination by race, gender and national origin were already found applicable to religious organizations, it was logical (and a reasonable interpretation of the legislative history) to extend the prohibition against age discrimination to religious organizations as well.<ref>Id.

Holy Cross High School]]'' 4 F.3d 166 (2nd Cir. 1993) was an employment discrimination case brought under the ADEA ([[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]]). The appellant, Guy DeMarco, was released from employment prior to his eligibility for tenure at the age of forty-nine. Holy Cross High School argued that it was not subject to ADEA laws, and if it were that this case against it was in violation of the [[Free Exercise Clause]] and the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]]. The defendant also argued that the plaintiff failed to utilize the administrative remedies available. The court noted that other anti-discrimination statutes were held to be applicable to religious organizations, with the exception of statutes that prohibited discrimination based on religious belief. Since statutes prohibiting discrimination by race, gender and national origin were already found applicable to religious organizations, it was logical (and a reasonable interpretation of the legislative history) to extend the prohibition against age discrimination to religious organizations as well.<ref>Id.

Two years later, in 1939, then with the rank of Sub-lieutenant, he moved to the \"Maipo\" Regiment, garrisoned in Valpara\u00edso. He returned to Infantry School in 1940.

At the same time, he worked as a teachers' aide at the War Academy, giving military geography and geopolitics classes. He was also the editor of the institutional magazine ''Cien \u00c1guilas'' (\"One Hundred Eagles\").

At the end of 1959 he returned to Chile and was sent to General Headquarters of the 1st Army Division, based in [[Antofagasta]]. The following year, he was appointed commander of the \"Esmeralda\" Regiment. Due to his success in this position, he was appointed Sub-director of the War Academy in 1963. In 1968, he was named Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army Division, based in [[Santiago]], and at the end of that year, he was promoted to brigadier general and Commander in Chief of the 6th Division, garrisoned in Iquique. In his new function, he was also appointed Intendent of the [[Tarapac\u00e1 Region|Tarapac\u00e1]] Province.\n\nIn January 1971, Pinochet was promoted to division general and was named General Commander of the Santiago Army Garrison.

A year later, the murder of 119 opponents abroad was disguised as an internal conflict, the DINA setting up a propaganda campaign to support this idea ([[Operation Colombo]]), a campaign publicised by the leading newspaper in Chile, El Mercurio.\n\nOther victims of Condor included, among hundreds of less famous persons, [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]], the former President of Bolivia, assassinated in Buenos Aires on 2 June 1976; [[Carmelo Soria]], a UN diplomat working for the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|CEPAL]], assassinated in July 1976;\n[[Orlando Letelier]], a former Chilean [[ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] to the United States and minister in Allende's cabinet, [[Assassination of Orlando Letelier|assassinated]] after his release from internment and exile in [[Washington, D.C.]] by a car bomb on 21 September 1976.

Random House, Penguin Books. pages 154-168. {{ISBN|9781101980965}}</ref> MacLean's account, however, has come under scrutiny. Economist Andrew Farrant examined the Chilean constitutional clauses that MacLean attributes to Buchanan, and discovered that they pre-dated his visit. He concludes that \"evidence suggests that Buchanan's May 1980 visit did not particularly influence the subsequent drafting of the Chilean Constitution\" and \"there is no evidence to suggest that Buchanan had any kind of audience with Pinochet or corresponded with the Chilean dictator.\"<ref>Farrant, Andrew. \"What Should (Knightian) Economists Do?

Confronted with increasing opposition, notably at the international level, Pinochet legalized political parties in 1987 and called for a vote to determine whether or not he would remain in power until 1997. If the \"YES\" won, Pinochet would have to implement the dispositions of the 1980 Constitution, mainly the call for general elections, while he would himself remain in power as President. If the \"NO\" won, Pinochet would remain President for another year, and a joint Presidential and legislative election would be held.\n\nAnother reason for Pinochet's decision to call for elections was the April 1987 visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to Chile. According to the US Catholic author [[George Weigel]], he held a meeting with Pinochet during which they discussed a return to democracy. John Paul II allegedly pushed Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of his government, and even called for his resignation.<ref>[[George Weigel]], ''Biograf\u00eda de Juan Pablo II \u2013 Testigo de Esperanza'', Editorial Plaza & Jan\u00e9s (2003), {{ISBN|84-01-01304-6}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinochet Aylwin Bush.png|thumb|Former President Pinochet as Commander-in-Chief and President Aylwin met with U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1990.]]\nPolitical advertising was legalized on 5 September 1987, as a necessary element for the campaign for the \"NO\" to the referendum, which countered the official campaign, which presaged a return to a Popular Unity government in case of a defeat of Pinochet. The Opposition, gathered into the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por el NO]]'' (\"Coalition of Parties for NO\"), organized a colorful and cheerful campaign under the slogan ''La alegr\u00eda ya viene'' (\"Joy is coming\"). It was formed by the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democracy]], the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democrat Radical Party|Radical Party]], gathered in the ''Alianza Democr\u00e1tica'' (Democratic Alliance). In 1988, several more parties, including the [[Humanist Party (Chile)|Humanist Party]], the [[Ecologist Party of Chile|Ecologist Party]], the Social Democrats, and several Socialist Party splinter groups added their support.\n\nOn 5 October 1988, the \"NO\" option won with 55.99%<ref name=\"Elections\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117085107/http://www.tribunalcalificador.cl/resultado.php Tribunal Calificador], Chilean governmental website {{in lang|es}}</ref> of the votes, against 44.01% of \"YES\" votes. Pinochet accepted the result and the ensuing Constitutional process led to presidential and legislative elections the following year.\n\nThe Coalition changed its name to ''Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por la Democracia'' (Coalition of Parties for Democracy) and put forward [[Patricio Aylwin]], a Christian Democrat who had opposed Allende, as presidential candidate, and also proposed a list of candidates for the parliamentary elections. The opposition and the Pinochet government made several negotiations to amend the Constitution and agreed to 54 modifications. These amendments changed the way the Constitution would be modified in the future, added restrictions to state of emergency dispositions, the affirmation of [[pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], and enhanced constitutional rights as well as the [[democracy|democratic]] principle and participation to political life. In July 1989, a [[1989 Chilean referendum|referendum]] on the proposed changes took place, supported by all the parties except the right-wing [[Southern Party]] and the Chilean Socialist Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0041490 |title=El plebiscito incomprendido |work=[[Apsi]] |date=17 July 1989}}</ref> The Constitutional changes were approved by 91.25% of the voters.\n\nThereafter, Aylwin won the [[1989 Chilean presidential election|December 1989 presidential election]] with 55% of the votes,<ref name=Elections/> against less than 30% for the right-wing candidate, [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]], who had been Pinochet's [[Minister of Finances]] since 1985 (there was also a third-party candidate, [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera|Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz]], a wealthy aristocrat representing the extreme economic right, who garnered the remaining 15%<ref name=Elections/>). Pinochet thus left the presidency on 11 March 1990 and transferred power to the new democratically elected president.\n\nThe ''Concertaci\u00f3n'' also won the majority of votes for the Parliament. However, due to the \"binomial\" representation system included in the constitution, the elected senators did not achieve a complete majority in Parliament, a situation that would last for over 15 years. This forced them to negotiate all law projects with the [[Alliance for Chile]] (originally called \"Democracy and Progress\" and then \"Union for Chile\"), a center-right coalition involving the ''[[Independent Democratic Union|Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente]]'' (UDI) and ''[[National Renewal (Chile)|Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional]]'' (RN), parties composed mainly of Pinochet's supporters.\n\nDue to the transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. He was then sworn in as a [[senator-for-life]], a privilege granted by the 1980 constitution to former presidents with at least six years in office. His senatorship and consequent [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] protected him from legal action. These were possible in Chile only after Pinochet was arrested in 1998 in the [[United Kingdom]], on an [[extradition]] request issued by Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garz\u00f3n]]. Allegations of abuses had been made numerous times before his arrest, but never acted upon.<ref>See [[Juan Guzm\u00e1n Tapia]]'s autobiography</ref> The extradition attempt was dramatised in the 2006 BBC television docudrama ''[[Pinochet in Suburbia]]'', with Pinochet played by [[Derek Jacobi]].

Arguing that the bodies of the \"[[Forced disappearance|disappeared]]\" were still missing, he made [[jurisprudence]], which had as effect to lift any [[statute of limitation|prescription]] on the crimes committed by the military. Pinochet's trial continued until his death on 10 December 2006, with an alternation of indictments for specific cases, lifting of immunities by the Supreme Court or to the contrary immunity from prosecution, with his health a main argument for, or against, his prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed, in March 2005, Pinochet's immunity concerning the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires, which had taken place in the frame of Operation Condor. However, he was deemed fit to stand trial for [[Operation Colombo]], during which 119 political opponents were \"disappeared\" in Argentina. The Chilean justice also lifted his immunity on the [[Villa Grimaldi]] case, a detention and torture center in the outskirts of Santiago. Pinochet, who still benefited from a reputation of righteousness from his supporters, lost legitimacy when he was put under house arrest on tax fraud and passport forgery, following the publication by the US Senate [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] of a report concerning the [[Riggs Bank]] in July 2004. The report was a consequence of investigations on financial funding of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the US. The bank controlled between US$4 million and $8 million of Pinochet's assets, who lived in Santiago in a modest house, dissimulating his wealth. According to the report, Riggs participated in [[money laundering]] for Pinochet, setting up offshore [[shell company|shell corporations]] (referring to Pinochet as only \"a former public official\"), and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. Related to Pinochet's and his family secret bank accounts in United States and in Caribbean islands, this tax fraud filing for an amount of 27 million dollars shocked the conservative sectors who still supported him. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was chief of the Chilean armies, and would essentially have come from [[weapons traffic]] (when purchasing French '[[Dassault Mirage|Mirage]]' fighter aircraft in 1994, Dutch '[[Leopard 2]]' tanks, Swiss '[[MOWAG]]' armored vehicles or by illegal sales of weapons to [[Croatia]], during the [[Yugoslav Wars|Balkans war]].) His wife, [[Luc\u00eda Hiriart]], and his son, Marco Antonio Pinochet, were also sued for complicity.

In Santiago, opponents celebrated his death in Alameda Avenue, while supporters grieved outside the Military Hospital.

At the end of 1959 he returned to Chile and was sent to General Headquarters of the 1st Army Division, based in [[Antofagasta]]. The following year, he was appointed commander of the \"Esmeralda\" Regiment. Due to his success in this position, he was appointed Sub-director of the War Academy in 1963. In 1968, he was named Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army Division, based in [[Santiago]], and at the end of that year, he was promoted to brigadier general and Commander in Chief of the 6th Division, garrisoned in Iquique.

Economist Andrew Farrant examined the Chilean constitutional clauses that MacLean attributes to Buchanan, and discovered that they pre-dated his visit. He concludes that \"evidence suggests that Buchanan's May 1980 visit did not particularly influence the subsequent drafting of the Chilean Constitution\" and \"there is no evidence to suggest that Buchanan had any kind of audience with Pinochet or corresponded with the Chilean dictator.\"<ref>Farrant, Andrew. \"What Should (Knightian) Economists Do?

Confronted with increasing opposition, notably at the international level, Pinochet legalized political parties in 1987 and called for a vote to determine whether or not he would remain in power until 1997. If the \"YES\" won, Pinochet would have to implement the dispositions of the 1980 Constitution, mainly the call for general elections, while he would himself remain in power as President. If the \"NO\" won, Pinochet would remain President for another year, and a joint Presidential and legislative election would be held.\n\nAnother reason for Pinochet's decision to call for elections was the April 1987 visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to Chile. According to the US Catholic author [[George Weigel]], he held a meeting with Pinochet during which they discussed a return to democracy. John Paul II allegedly pushed Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of his government, and even called for his resignation.<ref>[[George Weigel]], ''Biograf\u00eda de Juan Pablo II \u2013 Testigo de Esperanza'', Editorial Plaza & Jan\u00e9s (2003), {{ISBN|84-01-01304-6}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinochet Aylwin Bush.png|thumb|Former President Pinochet as Commander-in-Chief and President Aylwin met with U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1990.]]\nPolitical advertising was legalized on 5 September 1987, as a necessary element for the campaign for the \"NO\" to the referendum, which countered the official campaign, which presaged a return to a Popular Unity government in case of a defeat of Pinochet. The Opposition, gathered into the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por el NO]]'' (\"Coalition of Parties for NO\"), organized a colorful and cheerful campaign under the slogan ''La alegr\u00eda ya viene'' (\"Joy is coming\"). It was formed by the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democracy]], the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democrat Radical Party|Radical Party]], gathered in the ''Alianza Democr\u00e1tica'' (Democratic Alliance). In 1988, several more parties, including the [[Humanist Party (Chile)|Humanist Party]], the [[Ecologist Party of Chile|Ecologist Party]], the Social Democrats, and several Socialist Party splinter groups added their support.\n\nOn 5 October 1988, the \"NO\" option won with 55.99%<ref name=\"Elections\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117085107/http://www.tribunalcalificador.cl/resultado.php Tribunal Calificador], Chilean governmental website {{in lang|es}}</ref> of the votes, against 44.01% of \"YES\" votes. Pinochet accepted the result and the ensuing Constitutional process led to presidential and legislative elections the following year.\n\nThe Coalition changed its name to ''Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por la Democracia'' (Coalition of Parties for Democracy) and put forward [[Patricio Aylwin]], a Christian Democrat who had opposed Allende, as presidential candidate, and also proposed a list of candidates for the parliamentary elections. The opposition and the Pinochet government made several negotiations to amend the Constitution and agreed to 54 modifications. These amendments changed the way the Constitution would be modified in the future, added restrictions to state of emergency dispositions, the affirmation of [[pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], and enhanced constitutional rights as well as the [[democracy|democratic]] principle and participation to political life. In July 1989, a [[1989 Chilean referendum|referendum]] on the proposed changes took place, supported by all the parties except the right-wing [[Southern Party]] and the Chilean Socialist Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0041490 |title=El plebiscito incomprendido |work=[[Apsi]] |date=17 July 1989}}</ref> The Constitutional changes were approved by 91.25% of the voters.\n\nThereafter, Aylwin won the [[1989 Chilean presidential election|December 1989 presidential election]] with 55% of the votes,<ref name=Elections/> against less than 30% for the right-wing candidate, [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]], who had been Pinochet's [[Minister of Finances]] since 1985 (there was also a third-party candidate, [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera|Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz]], a wealthy aristocrat representing the extreme economic right, who garnered the remaining 15%<ref name=Elections/>). Pinochet thus left the presidency on 11 March 1990 and transferred power to the new democratically elected president.\n\nThe ''Concertaci\u00f3n'' also won the majority of votes for the Parliament. However, due to the \"binomial\" representation system included in the constitution, the elected senators did not achieve a complete majority in Parliament, a situation that would last for over 15 years. This forced them to negotiate all law projects with the [[Alliance for Chile]] (originally called \"Democracy and Progress\" and then \"Union for Chile\"), a center-right coalition involving the ''[[Independent Democratic Union|Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente]]'' (UDI) and ''[[National Renewal (Chile)|Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional]]'' (RN), parties composed mainly of Pinochet's supporters.\n\nDue to the transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. He was then sworn in as a [[senator-for-life]], a privilege granted by the 1980 constitution to former presidents with at least six years in office. His senatorship and consequent [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] protected him from legal action. These were possible in Chile only after Pinochet was arrested in 1998 in the [[United Kingdom]], on an [[extradition]] request issued by Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garz\u00f3n]]. Allegations of abuses had been made numerous times before his arrest, but never acted upon.<ref>See [[Juan Guzm\u00e1n Tapia]]'s autobiography</ref> The extradition attempt was dramatised in the 2006 BBC television docudrama ''[[Pinochet in Suburbia]]'', with Pinochet played by [[Derek Jacobi]].

Guzm\u00e1n had ordered in 1999 the arrest of five militarists, including General [[Pedro Espinoza Bravo]] of the [[Direcci\u00f3n de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], for their role in the [[Caravan of Death]] following the coup on 11 September. Arguing that the bodies of the \"[[Forced disappearance|disappeared]]\" were still missing, he made [[jurisprudence]], which had as effect to lift any [[statute of limitation|prescription]] on the crimes committed by the military. Pinochet's trial continued until his death on 10 December 2006, with an alternation of indictments for specific cases, lifting of immunities by the Supreme Court or to the contrary immunity from prosecution, with his health a main argument for, or against, his prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed, in March 2005, Pinochet's immunity concerning the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires, which had taken place in the frame of Operation Condor. However, he was deemed fit to stand trial for [[Operation Colombo]], during which 119 political opponents were \"disappeared\" in Argentina. The Chilean justice also lifted his immunity on the [[Villa Grimaldi]] case, a detention and torture center in the outskirts of Santiago. Pinochet, who still benefited from a reputation of righteousness from his supporters, lost legitimacy when he was put under house arrest on tax fraud and passport forgery, following the publication by the US Senate [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] of a report concerning the [[Riggs Bank]] in July 2004. The report was a consequence of investigations on financial funding of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the US. The bank controlled between US$4 million and $8 million of Pinochet's assets, who lived in Santiago in a modest house, dissimulating his wealth. According to the report, Riggs participated in [[money laundering]] for Pinochet, setting up offshore [[shell company|shell corporations]] (referring to Pinochet as only \"a former public official\"), and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. Related to Pinochet's and his family secret bank accounts in United States and in Caribbean islands, this tax fraud filing for an amount of 27 million dollars shocked the conservative sectors who still supported him. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was chief of the Chilean armies, and would essentially have come from [[weapons traffic]] (when purchasing French '[[Dassault Mirage|Mirage]]' fighter aircraft in 1994, Dutch '[[Leopard 2]]' tanks, Swiss '[[MOWAG]]' armored vehicles or by illegal sales of weapons to [[Croatia]], during the [[Yugoslav Wars|Balkans war]].) His wife, [[Luc\u00eda Hiriart]], and his son, Marco Antonio Pinochet, were also sued for complicity. For the fourth time in seven years, Pinochet was indicted by the Chilean justice.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/28/chile.pinochet/?section=cnn_topstories U.S. sends back Pinochet daughter], ''[[CNN]]'', 28 January 2006</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Pinochet muerto.jpg|thumb|upright|Pinochet on the bier on 11 December 2006]]\n[[File:Feretro Pinochet.jpg|thumb|Pinochet's funeral]]\nPinochet suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on the morning of 3 December 2006 and was given the [[last rites]] the same day.

I'd sit and watch them, and soon I started joining in.\" Soon, Jones began drumming in local bands and subsequently touring the UK and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tomtommag.com/2013/07/hot-chips-hot-chip-sarah-jones/ |title=Hot Chip\u2019s Hot Chip: Sarah Jones |publisher=Tom Tom Mag}}</ref>\n\n==Harry Styles==\n[[File:Sarah-Jones-Drummer-Harry-Styles-Band-SAP-Center.png|thumb|Sarah Jones performing at the SAP Center with Harry Styles]]\n\nSarah Jones played drums and provided backing vocals for [[Harry Styles]]'s [[Harry Styles: Live on Tour|world tour]], including an April 2017 performance with Styles on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', playing \"Sign of the Times\" and \"Ever Since New York.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/erinchack/harry-styles-is-cool-an-all-but-lets-talk-about-his-drummer |title=Harry Styles Is Cool And All But Let's Talk About His Drummer Sarah Jones\n|publisher=BuzzFeed}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bandwagon.asia/articles/a-guide-to-harry-styles-band-and-no-we-don-t-mean-one-direction |title=A guide to Harry Styles\u2019 band, and no, we don\u2019t mean One Direction\n|publisher=Bandwagon}}</ref> The tour itself began on September 19 2017, and ended on July 14 2018.\n\nJones has continued as drummer for Styles following his sophomore record 'Fine Line' (2019), including its promotion and upcoming world tour \"Love on Tour\" (2020) <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqm7-zN5s8k</ref>.\n\n==Pillow Person==\nSarah Jones has written and performed three [[electropop]] songs (\"Go Ahead (2016)\", \"On Your Way (2017)\", \"Kitchen (2017)\") under the name Pillow Person.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudandquiet.com/interview/somehow-sarah-jones-managed-find-time-create-pillow-person/ |title=Somehow Sarah Jones has managed to find time to create Pillow Person\n |publisher=Loud and Quiet}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nylon.com/articles/sarah-jones-harry-styles-drummer-kitchen-video |title=Sarah Jones Is Harry Styles\u2019 Drummer\u2014She\u2019s Also A Half-Fake Pillow Person\n |publisher=NYLON}}</ref>\n\n==NYPC==\n[[File:Sarah-Jones-Drummer-NYPC-Neck-Of-The-Woods.png|thumb|Sarah Jones performing with NYPC, Neck of the Woods, San Francisco]]\n\nSarah Jones is a member of [[NYPC]] (originally New Young Pony Club), an [[electronic music]] band which released three albums between 2007-2013.\n\n==The Pussycat Dolls==\nSarah Jones played drums as a member of [[The Pussycat Dolls]] band tour ''[[Unfinished Business (tour)|Unfinished Business]]'' (2020).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://pillowperson.bandcamp.com/ Pillow Person (Bandcamp)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Sarah}}\n[[Category:1985 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Hereford]]\n[[Category:English rock drummers]]\n[[Category:21st-century drummers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|English drummer and singer}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| image          = Hot Chip Lollapalooza 2015-11.jpg\n| caption        = Jones drumming with [[Hot Chip]] at [[Lollapalooza]] 2015\n| name           = Sarah Jones\n| background     = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| birth_name     = \n| alias            = Pillow Person\n| birth_date     = 31 August 1985\n| birth_place    = [[London]], [[England]]\n| origin         = [[Hereford]], [[Herefordshire]], England\n| genre          = [[Alternative rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[Pop music|pop]]\n| occupation     = Musician, drummer, songwriter, composer\n| years_active   = 2000\u2013present\n| instrument     = [[Drum kit|Drums]], [[synthesizer]], vocals\n| associated_acts= [[Harry Styles]], [[NYPC]], [[Hot Chip]], Pillow Person, [[NZCA_Lines|NZCA]], [[The Pussycat Dolls]]\n| website        = [https://pillowperson.bandcamp.com/ Pillow Person]\n}}\n'''Sarah Jones''' (born 31 August 1985) is an English musician based in [[London, England|London]], best known for her work as a session and touring drummer.
