[[Gujarati cuisine]] of India is predominantly vegetarian among other Indian cuisines: Gujarati [[thali]] is very famous among Indians. There are many vegetarian [[Cuisine of India|Indian foods]] such as [[pakora]], [[samosa]], [[Khichdi|khichris]], [[Pilaf|Pulao]], [[raita (condiment)|raitas]], [[rasam]], bengain bharta, [[chana masala]], some [[korma]]s, [[Sambar (dish)|sambar]], [[jalfrezi]]s, [[saag aloo]], [[sabji|subjis]] (vegetable dishes) such as bindi subji, gobi subji, Punjabi chole, aloo matar and much South Indian food such as [[dosa]]s, [[idli]]s and [[Vada (food)|vadas]]. [[Chapati]] and other wheat/maida based breads like [[naan]], [[roti]] [[paratha]]s are often stuffed with vegetarian items to make it a satisfying meal. Many Indian dishes also qualify as [[vegan]], though many others use honey or dairy.\n** [[South Indian]] foods like [[Sambar (dish)|sambar]], [[rasam]], [[koottu]], karembadu, [[upma]], palya/taalimpu, kozhambu/koora, [[aviyal]], [[Olan (dish)|olan]], Kadala curry, [[Theeyal]], Pulihora/puliyogare, Chammandi, [[Chutney]], Chitrannams and [[bread]]s like [[Appam]], [[Puttu]], [[pathiri]], [[dosa]], [[idli]] and [[vada (food)|vada]].\n[[File:Saut\u00e9ed Tempeh cropped.jpg|thumb|Saut\u00e9ed [[tempeh]] with green beans, an Indonesian dish]]\n* In [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], vegetarianism is well served and represented, as there are plenty selection of vegetarian dishes and meat substitutes. Dishes such as [[gado-gado]], [[karedok]], [[ketoprak (food)|ketoprak]], [[pecel]], [[urap]], [[rujak]] and [[asinan]] are vegetarian. However, for dishes that use [[peanut sauce]], such as ''gado-gado, karedok'' or ''ketoprak'', might contains small amount of [[shrimp paste]] for flavor. Served solely, ''[[gudeg]]'' can be considered a vegetarian food, since it consists of unripe [[jackfruit]] and coconut milk. Fermented [[soy]] products, such as [[tempeh]], [[tofu]] and ''[[oncom]]'' are prevalent as meat substitutes, as the source of protein. Most of Indonesians do not practice strict vegetarianism and only consume vegetables or vegetarian dishes for their taste, preference, economic and health reasons. Nevertheless, there are small numbers of Indonesian Buddhists who practice vegetarianism for religious reason.\n* [[Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] foods such as [[castella]], [[dorayaki]], [[edamame]], name kojiru, [[mochi]], [[taiyaki]], [[tempura]],  vegetable [[sushi]] and [[wagashi]]. [[Miso soup]] is made from fermented white or red soy bean paste, garnished with scallions or seaweed. Although most traditional versions are made from fish stock ([[dashi]]), it can be made with vegetable stock as well.\n* [[Korean cuisine]] has some dishes that are often vegetarian. One example is [[bibimbap]], which is rice with mixed vegetables.  Sometimes this dish contains beef or other non-vegetarian ingredients. Another Korean food which is sometimes vegetarian is [[jeon (food)|jeon]], in which ingredients (most commonly vegetables and/or seafood) are coated in a flour and egg batter and then pan-fried in oil.\n* [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean]] such as [[tumbet]] and many [[polenta]]s and [[tapas]] dishes.\n* [[Mexico|Mexican]] foods such as [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]] and [[guacamole]] with [[Tortilla chip|chips]], [[rice]] and [[bean burrito]]s (without lard in the [[refried beans]] or [[chicken fat]] in the rice), [[huevos rancheros]], [[Burrito#Veggie burrito|veggie burrito]], many [[quesadilla]]s, bean tacos, some [[chilaquiles]] and bean-pies, [[Chili con carne#Variations|chili sin carne]], [[black turtle bean|black beans]] with rice, some [[chiles rellenos]], [[cheese]] [[enchilada]]s and vegetable [[fajita]]s.\n* [[Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] foods such as most [[pasta]]s, many [[pizza]]s, [[bruschetta]], [[caponata]], [[crostini]], eggplant [[parmigiana]], [[Polenta]]  and many [[risotto]]s.\n* [[Europe|Continental]] cuisine such as braised [[leek]]s with [[olive]]s and [[parsley]], [[ratatouille]], many [[quiche]]s, sauteed [[Brussels sprout]]s with mushrooms, sauteed [[Swiss chard]], [[Squash (fruit)|squash]] and vegetable-stuffed [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]].\n* In Germany, Frankfurt [[green sauce]], [[Kl\u00f6\u00dfe]] with vegetarian sauces (e.g., [[Chanterelle]]), cheese or vegetable stuffed [[Maultaschen]], combinations of [[Quark (cheese)|quark]], spinach, potatoes and herbs provide some traditional vegetarian summer dishes. Traditionally on Fridays, southern Germany broad variety of sweet dishes may be served as a main course, such as [[Germkn\u00f6del]] and [[Dampfnudel]]. Potato soup and plum cake are traditional Friday dishes in the Palatinate. [[Brenntar]] in Swabia, it is made of roasted flour, usually spelt flour or oat flour.\n* Many Greek and [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]] dishes, such as [[briam]], [[dolma]]s (when made without minced meat), [[fasolada]], [[gemista]], vegetable based [[moussaka]] and [[spanakopita]].\n[[File:Tolstoj's vegetarian breakfast.JPG|thumb|[[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s vegetarian breakfast]]\n* [[Russian cuisine]] developed a significant vegetarian tradition in czarist time, based on the example of [[Leo Tolstoy]].<ref name=\"Brang\">Peter Brang.

For reasons ranging from economics to the religious practices of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], most Egyptian dishes rely on beans and vegetables: the national dishes, [[kushari]] and [[ful medames]], are entirely vegetarian, as are usually the assorted vegetable casseroles that characterize the typical Egyptian meal.\n* Many dishes in [[Cuisine of Thailand|Thai]] cuisine can be made vegetarian if the main protein element is substituted by a vegetarian alternative such as tofu. This includes dishes such as ''phat khi mao'' and, if a vegetarian shrimp paste and fish sauce substitute is used, many [[Thai curry|Thai curries]]. Venues serving vegetarian [[Buddhist cuisine]] (''ahan che''; {{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e08}}) can be found all over Thailand.\n* [[Creole cuisine|Creole]] and Southern foods such as hush puppies, okra patties, rice and [[bean]]s, or sauteed [[kale]] or [[collards]], if not cooked with the traditional [[pork]] [[fat]] or meat [[Stock (food)|stock]].\n* Some [[Welsh cuisine|Welsh recipes]], including [[Glamorgan sausage]]s, [[laverbread]] and [[Welsh rarebit]].\n[[File:Palatschinken.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palatschinken]] with [[ice cream]], [[fruit]]s and fruit [[compote]] from [[Austria]]]]\n\n===Desserts and sweets===\nMost [[dessert]]s, including [[pie]]s, [[Cobbler (food)|cobblers]], [[cake]]s, [[chocolate brownie|brownies]], [[cookie]]s, [[Chocolate truffle|truffles]], [[Rice Krispie treat]]s (from gelatin-free [[marshmallow]]s or [[marshmallow fluff]]), [[peanut butter]] treats, [[pudding]], [[rice pudding]], [[ice cream]], [[cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e]], etc., are free of meat and fish and are suitable for ovo-lacto vegetarians. Eastern [[confectionery]] and desserts, such as [[halva]] and [[Turkish delight]], are mostly vegan, while others such as [[baklava]] (which often contains butter) are lacto vegetarian. Indian desserts and sweets are mostly vegetarian like [[peda]], [[barfi]], [[gulab jamun]], [[shrikhand]], [[basundi]], kaju katri, [[rasgulla]], cham cham, rajbhog, etc. Indian sweets are mostly made from milk products and are thus lacto vegetarian; dry fruit-based sweets are vegan.\n\n== Meat analogues ==\n[[File:SoyaBiryani.jpg|thumb|[[Pilaf]] with soya nuggets]]\nThese are vegetarian versions of popular dishes that non-vegetarians enjoy and are frequently consumed as [[fast food]], [[comfort food]], transition food for new vegetarians, or a way to show non-vegetarians that they can be vegetarians while still enjoying their favorite foods.

It is one of the most popular [[aquarium]] fish.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow tang was first described by English naturalist [[Edward Turner Bennett]] as ''Acanthurus flavescens'' in 1828 from a collection in the Hawaiian Islands. Its species name is the [[Latin]] adjective ''flavescens'' \"yellow\".\n\nYellow tang are in the [[surgeonfish]] family.\n\n==Description==\nAdult fish can grow to {{convert|20|cm|in}} in length, and {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in}} in thickness. Adult males tend to be larger than females. Yellow tang are bright yellow in color. At night, the yellow coloring fades slightly, and a prominent brownish patch develops in the middle with a horizontal white band. They rapidly resume their bright yellow color during daylight. It's important to be aware, however, that Yellow Tang can be aggressive, are prone to the fish disease called \"ich,\" and may damage coral your reef tank. Male and female yellow tang look very similar. When mating, however, males change color and have a \"shimmering\" behavior which makes them identifiable. {{r|Stan & Debbie Hauter|}}\n\n==Food==\nIn the wild, yellow tang feed on [[benthic]] turf algae and other marine plant material. In captivity they are commonly fed meat/fish based aquarium food, but the long term health effects of this diet are questionable. However, most experts in the marine aquarium industry express little skepticism that such a well rounded and balanced diet including plant and animal material would be in any way detrimental to mostly herbivorous fishes like tangs, since they still need on occasion, complex amino acids and nutrients that only ocean animals can provide. In the wild, yellow tang provide [[Cleaning station|cleaner services]] to marine turtles, by removing algal growth from their shells.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Coral reefs at kona.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow tangs in their natural habitat in [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona, Hawaii]]|alt=Photo of two fish with rock in background]]\nIt is commonly found in shallow [[reef]]s, from {{convert|2|-|46|m|ft}} deep, in the [[Pacific Ocean]], west of [[Hawaii]] and east of [[Japan]].

It is one of the most popular [[aquarium]] fish. \n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow tang was first described by English naturalist [[Edward Turner Bennett]] as ''Acanthurus flavescens'' in 1828 from a collection in the Hawaiian Islands. Its species name is the [[Latin]] adjective ''flavescens'' \"yellow\".\n\nYellow tang are in the [[surgeonfish]] family.\n\n==Description==\nAdult fish can grow to {{convert|20|cm|in}} in length, and {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in}} in thickness. Adult males tend to be larger than females. Yellow tang are bright yellow in color. At night, the yellow coloring fades slightly, and a prominent brownish patch develops in the middle with a horizontal white band. They rapidly resume their bright yellow color during daylight. It's important to be aware, however, that Yellow Tang can be aggressive, are prone to the fish disease called \"ich,\" and may damage coral your reef tank. Male and female yellow tang look very similar. When mating, however, males change color and have a \"shimmering\" behavior which makes them identifiable. {{r|Stan & Debbie Hauter|}}\n\n==Food==\nIn the wild, yellow tang feed on [[benthic]] turf algae and other marine plant material. In captivity they are commonly fed meat/fish based aquarium food, but the long term health effects of this diet are questionable. However, most experts in the marine aquarium industry express little skepticism that such a well rounded and balanced diet including plant and animal material would be in any way detrimental to mostly herbivorous fishes like tangs, since they still need on occasion, complex amino acids and nutrients that only ocean animals can provide. In the wild, yellow tang provide [[Cleaning station|cleaner services]] to marine turtles, by removing algal growth from their shells.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Coral reefs at kona.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow tangs in their natural habitat in [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona, Hawaii]]|alt=Photo of two fish with rock in background]]\nIt is commonly found in shallow [[reef]]s, from {{convert|2|-|46|m|ft}} deep, in the [[Pacific Ocean]], west of [[Hawaii]] and east of [[Japan]].
