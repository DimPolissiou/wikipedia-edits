Chandraprakash Dwivedi played the title role of Chanakya.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series is divided into three acts:\n* The early life of Vishnugupta in the kingdom of [[Magadha]] and the circumstances leading to his self-imposed exile, particularly the persecution (and subsequent death) of his father at the hands of [[Dhanananda]], King of Magadha.\n* The invasion of northwestern India by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], his death, the rebellion led by native Indian kingdoms under the leadership of Chandragupta Maurya against Alexander's successors in India, and the subsequent defeat of the Greek invaders.\n* The attack on and overthrow of the Nanda rule in Magadha and the crowning of Chandragupta as the King of Magadha.\n\nWithin this framework, Dwivedi portrays the politics that governed relations between kings and officials of that time. He covers the workings of the early Indian republics and the way of life of ordinary Indians.\n\nWhile critically acclaimed, ''Chanakya'' has been the subject of political controversy. It has been televised in many countries around the world and has won five Uptron Awards.<ref name=\"screen-pinjar\" /> The series was widely praised for its authenticity, casting and grandeur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/lessons-from-history/503533/0 |title=Lessons From History |publisher=Indian Express |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nDwivedi spent more than nine years researching ''Chanakya'' and read over 180 books on the subject including the [[Arthashastra]].<ref name=\"surya-india\" /> For him, Chanakya was \"the first man with a national consciousness.\"<ref name=\"book-qos\" /> And that is what made him take up the project:\n{{cquote|I am not interested in the present; my idea is to delve into the past and link it with the present.

Chandraprakash Dwivedi played the title role of Chanakya.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series is divided into three acts:\n* The early life of Vishnugupta in the kingdom of [[Magadha]] and the circumstances leading to his self-imposed exile, particularly the persecution (and subsequent death) of his father at the hands of [[Dhanananda]], King of Magadha.\n* The invasion of northwestern India by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], his death, the rebellion led by native Indian kingdoms under the leadership of Chandragupta Maurya against Alexander's successors in India, and the subsequent defeat of the Greek invaders.\n* The attack on and overthrow of the Nanda rule in Magadha and the crowning of Chandragupta as the King of Magadha.\n\nWithin this framework, Dwivedi portrays the politics that governed relations between kings and officials of that time. He covers the workings of the early Indian republics and the way of life of ordinary Indians.\n\nWhile critically acclaimed, ''Chanakya'' has been the subject of political controversy. It has been televised in many countries around the world and has won five Uptron Awards.<ref name=\"screen-pinjar\" /> The series was widely praised for its authenticity, casting and grandeur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/lessons-from-history/503533/0 |title=Lessons From History |publisher=Indian Express |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nDwivedi spent more than nine years researching ''Chanakya'' and read over 180 books on the subject including the [[Arthashastra]].<ref name=\"surya-india\" /> For him, Chanakya was \"the first man with a national consciousness.\"<ref name=\"book-qos\" /> And that is what made him take up the project:\n{{cquote|I am not interested in the present; my idea is to delve into the past and link it with the present.
