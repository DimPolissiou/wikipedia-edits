He was nicknamed \"'''The Worm'''\" and is famous for his fierce [[Defense (sports)|defensive]] and [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] abilities.\n\nRodman played at the [[small forward]] position in his early years before becoming a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]]. He earned [[NBA All-Defensive First Team]] honors seven times and won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships. His biography at [[NBA.com]] states that he is \"arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history\".

After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as a \"bad boy\" and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, had many [[Body piercing|piercing]]s and [[tattoo]]s, and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a [[wedding dress]] to promote his 1996 autobiography ''[[Bad As I Wanna Be]]''. Rodman pursued a high-profile affair with singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and was briefly married to actress [[Carmen Electra]]. Rodman also attracted international attention for his visits to [[North Korea]] and his subsequent befriending of North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] in 2013.\n\nIn addition to being a retired professional basketball player, Rodman is a retired part-time [[professional wrestler]] and actor. He was a member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] and fought alongside [[Hulk Hogan]] at two [[Bash at the Beach]] events. In professional wrestling, Rodman was the first ever winner of the [[Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling|Celebrity Championship Wrestling]] tournament. He had his own TV show, ''[[The Rodman World Tour]]'', and had lead roles in the action films ''[[Double Team (film)|Double Team]]'' (1997) and ''[[Simon Sez]]'' (1999). Both films were critically panned, with the former earning Rodman a triple [[Razzie Award]]. He appeared in several reality TV series and was the winner of the $222,000 main prize of the 2004 edition of ''[[The Mole (U.S. Season 4)|Celebrity Mole]]''.\n\n==Early life and education==\nRodman was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the son of Shirley and Philander Rodman, Jr., an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] enlisted member, who later fought in the [[Vietnam War]].

Ever controversial, Rodman made negative headlines after a [[Headbutt|head butt]] of referee Ted Bernhardt during a game in [[New Jersey]] on March 16, 1996; he was suspended for six games and fined $20,000, a punishment that was criticized as too lenient by the local press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goinside.com/97/6/rodman.html |title=Dennis Rodman and the $50,000 Mormon Fine |accessdate=August 9, 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111112402/http://goinside.com/97/6/rodman.html |archivedate=January 11, 1998}}.

Page Not Found|website=NBA Stats}}</ref> is an American retired professional basketball player who played for the [[Detroit Pistons]], [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and [[Dallas Mavericks]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He was nicknamed \"'''the Worm'''\" and is famous for his fierce [[Defense (sports)|defensive]] and [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] abilities.\n\nRodman played at the [[small forward]] position in his early years before becoming a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]]. He earned [[NBA All-Defensive First Team]] honors seven times and won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships. His biography at [[NBA.com]] states that he is \"arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history\". On April 1, 2011, the Pistons retired Rodman's No. 10 jersey,<ref name=\"autogenerated34\">{{cite web |last1=Lidz |first1=Franz |title=Dennis Rodman - As the Worm Turns |url=https://www.si.com/vault/2015/07/09/106342554/dennis-rodman |website=Vault |accessdate=January 7, 2020 |date=July 8, 2013}}</ref> and he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] later that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/basketball-hall-of-fame-enshrines-chris-mullin-dennis-rodman-arvydas-sabonis-tex-winter-081211|title=Rodman, Mullin enshrined in Hall of Fame|accessdate=August 12, 2011|publisher=Fox Sports|date=August 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nRodman experienced an unhappy childhood and was shy and [[introverted]] in his early years. After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as a \"bad boy\" and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, had many [[Body piercing|piercing]]s and [[tattoo]]s, and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a [[wedding dress]] to promote his 1996 autobiography ''[[Bad As I Wanna Be]]''. Rodman pursued a high-profile affair with singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and was briefly married to actress [[Carmen Electra]]. Rodman also attracted international attention for his visits to [[North Korea]] and his subsequent befriending of North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] in 2013.\n\nIn addition to being a retired professional basketball player, Rodman is a retired part-time [[professional wrestler]] and actor. He was a member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] and fought alongside [[Hulk Hogan]] at two [[Bash at the Beach]] events. In professional wrestling, Rodman was the first ever winner of the [[Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling|Celebrity Championship Wrestling]] tournament. He had his own TV show, ''[[The Rodman World Tour]]'', and had lead roles in the action films ''[[Double Team (film)|Double Team]]'' (1997) and ''[[Simon Sez]]'' (1999). Both films were critically panned, with the former earning Rodman a triple [[Razzie Award]]. He appeared in several reality TV series and was the winner of the $222,000 main prize of the 2004 edition of ''[[The Mole (U.S. Season 4)|Celebrity Mole]]''.\n\n==Early life and education==\nRodman was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the son of Shirley and Philander Rodman, Jr., an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] enlisted member, who later fought in the [[Vietnam War]].

He was suspended for the first three games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19 games.<ref name=\"nbacom\" /> After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49 games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team.<ref name=\"nbacom\" /> In the [[1995 NBA playoffs|1995 playoffs]], the 62-win Spurs with reigning [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] winner Robinson entered the Western Conference Finals and were considered favorites against the reigning champions [[Houston Rockets]] who had only won 47 games. It was thought that Rockets center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] would have a hard time asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by sitting down on the court,<ref name=\"nbacom\" /> could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3 points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.\n\nRodman admitted his frequent transgressions, but asserted that he lived his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people:\n\n<blockquote>I just took the chance to be my own man ... I just said: \"If you don't like it, kiss my ass.\" ... Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. They look at me and see someone trying to do that ... I'm the guy who's showing people, hey, it's all right to be different.

Ever controversial, Rodman made negative headlines after a [[Headbutt|head butt]] of referee Ted Bernhardt during a game in [[New Jersey]] on March 16, 1996; he was suspended for six games and fined $20,000, a punishment that was criticized as too lenient by the local press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goinside.com/97/6/rodman.html |title=Dennis Rodman and the $50,000 Mormon Fine |accessdate=August 9, 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111112402/http://goinside.com/97/6/rodman.html |archivedate=January 11, 1998}}.
