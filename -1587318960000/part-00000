During his career he won the [[European Cup]], three [[English football champions|English league titles]] and captained his national side.  He scored a goal against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]], which is regularly cited as one of the greatest scored in the competition.\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nGemmill was born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]]. His early career at [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] was ruined by a succession of injuries, not least a broken ankle in early 1966. He was sent on to replace [[Jim Clunie]] on 13 August 1966 in a [[Scottish League Cup]] tie at [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]] to become the first tactical substitute in Scottish football history.<ref>[http://www.stmirren.info/Players/Archie%20Gemmill.htm Archie Gemmill player profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504032542/http://www.stmirren.info/Players/Archie%20Gemmill.htm |date=4 May 2006 }}, www.stmirren.info</ref> Gemmill was sold for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]13,000 to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].\n\n===Derby County===\nHe came to the attention of [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]], Derby County's assistant manager. Taylor then told Derby manager, [[Brian Clough]], about Gemmill who had been considering signing for the reigning champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Clough saw him as a player who could pass well and had the type of energy that would drive an attack forward. Clough drove to Gemmill's house. When the player refused to sign for Derby (who had never won the [[English football champions|league title]]), Clough told him that he was going to sleep outside in the car. \"But my wife invited him in and he stayed the night,\" Gemmill said. Clough, eventually, got his man for \u00a360,000 over [[fried egg]]s the following morning.\n\nGemmill scored only three goals for the Rams that season, but they became Football League champions the following year. He was suspended for the [[European Cup 1972-73|1973 European Cup]] semi-final, but he became club captain in place of the injured [[Roy McFarland]] when the Rams won their second title in 1975. He made 324 appearances in total for the club and scored 25 goals. He left Derby after playing five times for them early in the 1977/78 season.<ref name=gemm>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/nottingham-forest-fc/archie-gemmill-5060/league-appearances-for-forest_a14705/ \"Archie Gemmill  Nottingham Forest FC, Sporting Heroes]</ref>\n\n===Nottingham Forest===\n\nGemmill joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] for \u00a325,000 in September 1977<ref name=gemm/> becoming the third ex Derby title winning player of Clough's to join him at Forest. [[John O'Hare]] and [[John McGovern (footballer)|John McGovern]] were the other two. He played 58 times for Forest in the league, scoring three goals. He was integral to the success of the club in the late 1970s, but was dropped for the [[1979 European Cup Final]]. Gemmill referred to the decision later:<ref name = \"BBC interview\"/> {{quote|I was devastated at the time. I was led to believe I'd be playing in the match... I was far from happy. I hated every minute of the 90 and I hated afterwards as well.}}\n\n===Later career===\n\nHe signed for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] debuting on 18 August 1979 in a 4\u20133 defeat at home to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. He played 97 League matches for the Blues, scoring 12 goals.\n\nIn early 1982, Gemmill crossed the Atlantic to play for the [[Jacksonville Tea Men]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968-1984)|NASL]]. He only stayed for one season playing 32 league games.\n\nIn September 1982, he joined up with former teammate and club manager [[Larry Lloyd]] at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] but only stayed for 11 matches. He returned to Derby County as player-coach to become [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]]'s first signing for the club in 1982. He retired from playing in 1984.\n\n==International career==\nGemmill played 43 times and scored eight goals for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], and captained the team on 22 occasions. \n\nThe most famous moment of Gemmill's career when he scored a goal against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in a Group D fixture at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]], which is regularly rated as amongst the greatest goals ever scored in a World Cup match.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/top10-goals.html TOP 10 WORLD CUP GOALS OF ALL TIME], [[CBC Sports]].</ref><ref>[http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/471494/World-Cup-Top-Tens:-Top-Ten-Goals World Cup Top Tens: Top Ten Goals]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512150249/http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/471494/World-Cup-Top-Tens%3A-Top-Ten-Goals |date=12 May 2008 }}, [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]], 3 May 2002.</ref> Scotland needed to win the game by three goals to qualify for the next stage of the tournament, having had very poor results in their first two games.

At the same time, Renton ([[Ewan McGregor]]), who had switched the tapes in their cases and borrowed Tommy and Lizzie's tape, says after [[orgasm|climaxing]] during [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], \"I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against [[Netherlands national football team|Holland]] in 1978!\" Gemmill first saw ''Trainspotting'' on a club outing with [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]], and his reaction was:<ref name = \"BBC interview\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/09/29/archie_gemmill_interview_feature.shtml Archie, Archie Gemmill!], [[BBC]].</ref> \"I got absolutely slaughtered by the lads... to be fair I was a bit embarrassed by it.\"\n\n==After playing==\nGemmill returned to Nottingham Forest to be a coach alongside [[Brian Clough]] in 1984.

During his career he won the [[European Cup]], three [[English football champions|English league titles]] and captained his national side.  He scored a goal against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]], which is regularly cited as one of the greatest scored in the competition.\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nGemmill was born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]]. His early career at [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] was ruined by a succession of injuries, not least a broken ankle in early 1966. He was sent on to replace [[Jim Clunie]] on 13 August 1966 in a [[Scottish League Cup]] tie at [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]] to become the first tactical substitute in Scottish football history.<ref>[http://www.stmirren.info/Players/Archie%20Gemmill.htm Archie Gemmill player profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504032542/http://www.stmirren.info/Players/Archie%20Gemmill.htm |date=4 May 2006 }}, www.stmirren.info</ref> Gemmill was sold for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]13,000 to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].\n\n===Derby County===\nHe came to the attention of [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]], Derby County's assistant manager. Taylor then told Derby manager, [[Brian Clough]], about Gemmill who had been considering signing for the reigning champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Clough saw him as a player who could pass well and had the type of energy that would drive an attack forward. Clough drove to Gemmill's house. When the player refused to sign for Derby (who had never won the [[English football champions|league title]]), Clough told him that he was going to sleep outside in the car. \"But my wife invited him in and he stayed the night,\" Gemmill said. Clough, eventually, got his man for \u00a360,000 over [[fried egg]]s the following morning.\n\nGemmill scored only three goals for the Rams that season, but they became Football League champions the following year. He was suspended for the [[European Cup 1972-73|1973 European Cup]] semi-final, but he became club captain in place of the injured [[Roy McFarland]] when the Rams won their second title in 1975. He made 324 appearances in total for the club and scored 25 goals. He left Derby after playing five times for them early in the 1977/78 season.<ref name=gemm>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/nottingham-forest-fc/archie-gemmill-5060/league-appearances-for-forest_a14705/ \"Archie Gemmill  Nottingham Forest FC, Sporting Heroes]</ref>\n\n===Nottingham Forest===\n\nGemmill joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] for \u00a325,000 in September 1977<ref name=gemm/> becoming the third ex Derby title winning player of Clough's to join him at Forest. [[John O'Hare]] and [[John McGovern (footballer)|John McGovern]] were the other two. He played 58 times for Forest in the league, scoring three goals. He was integral to the success of the club in the late 1970s, but was dropped for the [[1979 European Cup Final]]. Gemmill referred to the decision later:<ref name = \"BBC interview\"/> {{quote|I was devastated at the time. I was led to believe I'd be playing in the match... I was far from happy. I hated every minute of the 90 and I hated afterwards as well.}}\n\n===Later career===\n\nHe signed for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] debuting on 18 August 1979 in a 4\u20133 defeat at home to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. He played 97 League matches for the Blues, scoring 12 goals.\n\nIn early 1982, Gemmill crossed the Atlantic to play for the [[Jacksonville Tea Men]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968-1984)|NASL]]. He only stayed for one season playing 32 league games.\n\nIn September 1982, he joined up with former teammate and club manager [[Larry Lloyd]] at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] but only stayed for 11 matches. He returned to Derby County as player-coach to become [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]]'s first signing for the club in 1982. He retired from playing in 1984.\n\n==International career==\nGemmill played 43 times and scored eight goals for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], and captained the team on 22 occasions. \n\nThe most famous moment of Gemmill's career when he scored a goal against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in a Group D fixture at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]], which is regularly rated as amongst the greatest goals ever scored in a World Cup match.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/top10-goals.html TOP 10 WORLD CUP GOALS OF ALL TIME], [[CBC Sports]].</ref><ref>[http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/471494/World-Cup-Top-Tens:-Top-Ten-Goals World Cup Top Tens: Top Ten Goals]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512150249/http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/471494/World-Cup-Top-Tens%3A-Top-Ten-Goals |date=12 May 2008 }}, [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]], 3 May 2002.</ref> Scotland needed to win the game by three goals to qualify for the next stage of the tournament, having had very poor results in their first two games. With his team leading 2\u20131 in the 68th minute, Gemmill scored a goal which was described by ''[[The Scotsman]]'' as follows: {{quote|In 68 minutes, however, Scotland went 3\u20131 up when Archie Gemmill scored one of the great goals of this World Cup so far. The little midfield player homed in on goal, played a magnificent one-two with [[Kenny Dalglish|Dalglish]], then sprinted into the box and thumped a glorious goal past [[Jan Jongbloed|Jongbloed]] to revive all the hopes which had died the death this past fortnight.

The game ended 3\u20132, denying Scotland a spot in the second round.\n\nThe goal is referenced in the film ''[[Trainspotting (movie)|Trainspotting]]'', in which characters Tommy and Lizzie decide to make love while watching a homemade [[pornography|porno]] film, only to see it has been replaced with a football tape called \"100 Great Goals\" which features Gemmill's strike. At the same time, Renton ([[Ewan McGregor]]), who had switched the tapes in their cases and borrowed Tommy and Lizzie's tape, says after [[orgasm|climaxing]] during [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], \"I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against [[Netherlands national football team|Holland]] in 1978!\" Gemmill first saw ''Trainspotting'' on a club outing with [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]], and his reaction was:<ref name = \"BBC interview\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/09/29/archie_gemmill_interview_feature.shtml Archie, Archie Gemmill!], [[BBC]].</ref> \"I got absolutely slaughtered by the lads... to be fair I was a bit embarrassed by it.\"\n\n==After playing==\nGemmill returned to Nottingham Forest to be a coach alongside [[Brian Clough]] in 1984.

They are joined by Ranchoddas Chanchad, nicknamed \"Rancho\", as their roommate. They meet Manmohan a.k.a. \"Millimetre\", an adolescent boy helping the students . He is persuaded by Rancho to sneak into school and get educated. While Farhan chose to pursue engineering over his passion for photography to appease his father, Raju has taken the course in an attempt to end his family's poverty and is always afraid of failing. Rancho, on the other hand, is genuinely passionate in science and engineering. He believes in hands-on learning and tends to give unorthodox answers in class, resulting in him coming into conflict with the professors, particularly the institution's director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe, whom the ICE community nicknames \"Virus\". Virus's traditional and strict philosophies on education contrast sharply with Rancho's carefree love of learning. Meanwhile, Chatur, nicknamed \"Silencer\" (because of his nature of silently farting), is an arrogant student with little knowledge of Hindi due to his Ugandan-Tamilian upbringing, who is obsessed with topping the exams and invariably learns by rote.\n\nSometime later, the trio finds that a student named Joy Lobo, whose interest in machines was as much as Rancho, committed [[suicide]] by [[Suicide by hanging|hanging himself]], which was caused by [[Depression (mood)|depression]] after Virus informs Joy's father that Joy would be unable to graduate that year due to a delay in his submission of an assignment. Joy had taken longer as he wanted to perfect his breakthrough drone design of a quad-copter, and also due to a break on account of his father's brief illness. Rancho criticises Virus' method of teaching and tries to show him how much pressure engineers face when they study, angering him further. Rancho visits his friends' families, and later, the trio then gatecrashes the wedding of Virus' elder daughter, Mona to eat good food. They meet and befriend Pia, who turns out to be Virus' younger daughter and a resident student at the city's hospital. Rancho advises Pia not to marry her fianc\u00e9e Suhas Tandon because he's madly obsessed with expensive jewellery, brands, and prices and has no true love for her. Rancho gives Pia a demo on Suhas' attitude by spilling mint sauce on his shoes to annoy him. When Virus spots the trio, he summons Farhan and Raju on the next working day and tells them of the consequences of being friends with Rancho by comparing their families' incomes. He tells them that Rancho comes from a very rich family and does not need to worry about getting good grades and making a career. Affected, Raju moves out and into Chatur's room. During the Teachers Day celebration, Chatur is humiliated when he delivers a Hindi speech modified by Rancho and as a result, he bets Rancho that ten years later, they would see who is more successful. Sometime later, Pia is at the mall with Suhas and spots Rancho with an invention named after Virus; The Virus Inverter. Rancho explains to Pia that he dislikes the way her father teaches his students and that they end up lame like Suhas. Rancho plays a prank on Suhas, pretending that Pia lost her watch, to prove that Suhas shows more value to expensive stuff rather than her. Fed up with Suhas' behaviour, she tells him off. Rancho and Pia save Raju's dying father; Raju reconciles with his friends while Pia falls in love with Rancho.\n\nOne night during their senior year, Farhan and Raju are upset that they are trailing behind in their grades every year and that Rancho is always in the front of every school picture. Farhan exposes Rancho of not telling Pia that he is in love with her and hasn't told her for the past four years. The three friends drunkenly break into the Sahastrabuddhe residence so that Rancho can propose to Pia. As the trio escape, Virus recognises Raju and, on the next day, threatens to expel him unless he writes a letter recommending Rancho for expulsion. Unwilling to betray Rancho or disappoint his family, Raju unsuccessfully attempts suicide and ends up in a [[coma]]. With intensive care and support from his friends, Raju recovers just in time for his first job interview on the campus, which he succeeds in cracking. Meanwhile, Rancho and Pia post Farhan's letter to his favourite Hungarian wildlife photographer Andre Istvan, who offers him a position as an assistant. On Rancho's advice, he communicates his dream to his father, who though reluctant at first, gives his blessings for the sake of his son's happiness.\n\nInfuriated by this and Rancho's influence, Virus sets a difficult final exam paper to fail Raju, wherein Pia tries to help the trio by revealing to them the location of the exam paper in her father's office; unfortunately, Virus finds out and expels them. Pia confronts Virus about her brother who had committed suicide because he couldn't meet Virus' expectation of clearing the engineering exam. That same night, the pregnant Mona goes into labour during a heavy storm that cuts off all traffic and electricity in the city. Rancho and the other students help them by using their engineering knowledge to quickly modify a [[vacuum cleaner]] into a [[ventouse]] and deliver the baby with the help of Pia over a video call. A grateful Virus finally acknowledges Rancho as an extraordinary student and revokes their expulsion. On graduation day, Rancho suddenly disappears shortly after the ceremony ends.\n\nTen years later, in 2009, Farhan is a successful wildlife photographer, while Raju is married and settled with his family in a comfortable lifestyle with a corporate job and Chatur is married and the vice-president of a reputable corporation in the [[United States]] wanting to crack a business deal with a world renowned scientist and businessman with 400 patents to his name, Phunsukh Wangdu for whom he has been asking an appointment for over 1 year  ; none among the three of them have heard from Rancho since graduation. Reuniting at the ICE campus, after Chatur reminds them about the bet,they travel to Shimla, where Rancho was spotted in the background of a snapshot taken by Chatur's secretary, Tracy, who was trying to get an appointment with Wangdu. Chatur then went through the Shimla directory and found the address of Rancho. Upon arrival, they meet a man who turns out to be the real Ranchoddas Chanchad ([[Javed Jaffrey]]) at his father's funeral and the photos of the Rancho they knew replaced with the real one. From him, Farhan and Raju learn that the Rancho they knew was actually \"Chhote\", the smart son of the gardener who was a servant to the Chanchad family who would sneak into school wearing Ranchoddas' old uniform and help Ranchoddas with his schoolwork until he was found out by a teacher who told Ranchoddas' father.Ranchoddas' father then arranged for Chhote to attend ICE in his son's name so that  Ranchoddas could take credit for the degree while  he was in London for 4 years . He also told Chhote to cut off all contact with his ICE friends after graduating but Chhote was sure that Farhan and Raju would come looking for him. Ranchoddas provides Chhote's address in [[Ladakh]], where he is a schoolteacher. On the way, they pass [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] where against Chatur's wishes, they rescue and prevent Pia from marrying Suhas, who is now a changed man but reverts to his old ways when Raju, disguised as the housekeeping man, puts mint sauce on his wedding jacket, making Raju run away from the wedding in his attire. \n\nUpon arrival in Ladakh, the four head to the village school and witness the young students' inventions that resemble Chhote's college projects. They are reunited with the adult educated Manmohan, now going by the nickname \"Centimetre\" who has now become a helper for Chhote after receiving a letter from him to help him. He tells them that Chhote never forgot about them, stealing and keeping Pia's scooter helmet as a memento, reading Farhan's photography books and Raju's blog. He then tells them where to find Chhote. The four happily reunite with Chhote  to which Pia and Chhote smooch, while Chatur, unaware of Chhote's secret thinking he is Rancho, insults and asks Chhote to sign a contract stating that he is the least successful person; Chhote does so without commenting. As Chatur walks away triumphantly, Chhote reveals that his real name is Phunsukh Wangdu, to his friends' and Pia's surprise and delight. Realizing this, a horrified Chatur accepts his defeat and pleads him to sign his contract while Phunsukh and his friends run away laughing. In the end,  Wangdu tells everyone his theory: \"Follow excellence and success will by itself follow you\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Ranchoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chanchad / Chhote / Phunsukh Wangdu, one of the titular trio in the engineering college who vanishes after graduation and whom his two friends hunt for 5 years, while telling stories of their time in college together.

But I knew right from the start that I could not make a film completely on the book, as it was very anecdotal and a film needs a plot. So I had decided to rewrite it in a screenplay format. You'll see that the film is very different from the book. After I wrote the script, I called Chetan and narrated it to him. I told him that if he did not like the script, I would stop the project.

I even went to IIT with Abhijat a couple of times. But it was just not possible for me to be involved at every stage of the screenplay writing process since I was in Hong Kong at that time, working full-time and busy writing other books. Moreover, Abhijat is based in USA, Raju was in the US for quite a while working on the screenplay but it was not practical for me to do that [\u2026] The film retains the soul of the book. ''3 Idiots'' is different from the book but at the same time it does borrow many things from the book. The core theme and message of the film is coming from the book itself.

They are joined by Ranchoddas Chanchad, nicknamed \"Rancho\", as their roommate. They meet Manmohan a.k.a. \"Millimetre\", an adolescent boy helping the students . He is persuaded by Rancho to sneak into school and get educated. While Farhan chose to pursue engineering over his passion for photography to appease his father, Raju has taken the course in an attempt to end his family's poverty and is always afraid of failing. Rancho, on the other hand, is genuinely passionate in science and engineering. He believes in hands-on learning and tends to give unorthodox answers in class, resulting in him coming into conflict with the professors, particularly the institution's director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe, whom the ICE community nicknames \"Virus\". Virus's traditional and strict philosophies on education contrast sharply with Rancho's carefree love of learning. Meanwhile, Chatur, nicknamed \"Silencer\" (because of his nature of silently farting), is an arrogant student with little knowledge of Hindi due to his Ugandan-Tamilian upbringing, who is obsessed with topping the exams and invariably learns by rote.\n\nSometime later, the trio finds that a student named Joy Lobo, whose interest in machines was as much as Rancho, committed [[suicide]] by [[Suicide by hanging|hanging himself]], which was caused by [[Depression (mood)|depression]] after Virus informs Joy's father that Joy would be unable to graduate that year due to a delay in his submission of an assignment. Joy had taken longer as he wanted to perfect his breakthrough drone design of a quad-copter, and also due to a break on account of his father's brief illness. Rancho criticises Virus' method of teaching and tries to show him how much pressure engineers face when they study, angering him further. Rancho visits his friends' families, and later, the trio then gatecrashes the wedding of Virus' elder daughter, Mona to eat good food. They meet and befriend Pia, who turns out to be Virus' younger daughter and a resident student at the city's hospital. Rancho advises Pia not to marry her fianc\u00e9e Suhas Tandon because he's madly obsessed with expensive jewellery, brands, and prices and has no true love for her. Rancho gives Pia a demo on Suhas' attitude by spilling mint sauce on his shoes to annoy him. When Virus spots the trio, he summons Farhan and Raju on the next working day and tells them of the consequences of being friends with Rancho by comparing their families' incomes. He tells them that Rancho comes from a very rich family and does not need to worry about getting good grades and making a career. Affected, Raju moves out and into Chatur's room. During the Teachers Day celebration, Chatur is humiliated when he delivers a Hindi speech modified by Rancho and as a result, he bets Rancho that ten years later, they would see who is more successful. Sometime later, Pia is at the mall with Suhas and spots Rancho with an invention named after Virus; The Virus Inverter. Rancho explains to Pia that he dislikes the way her father teaches his students and that they end up lame like Suhas. Rancho plays a prank on Suhas, pretending that Pia lost her watch, to prove that Suhas shows more value to expensive stuff rather than her. Fed up with Suhas' behaviour, she tells him off. Rancho and Pia save Raju's dying father; Raju reconciles with his friends while Pia falls in love with Rancho.\n\nOne night during their senior year, Farhan and Raju are upset that they are trailing behind in their grades every year and that Rancho is always in the front of every school picture. Farhan exposes Rancho of not telling Pia that he is in love with her and hasn't told her for the past four years. The three friends drunkenly break into the Sahastrabuddhe residence so that Rancho can propose to Pia. As the trio escape, Virus recognises Raju and, on the next day, threatens to expel him unless he writes a letter recommending Rancho for expulsion. Unwilling to betray Rancho or disappoint his family, Raju unsuccessfully attempts suicide and ends up in a [[coma]]. With intensive care and support from his friends, Raju recovers just in time for his first job interview on the campus, which he succeeds in cracking. Meanwhile, Rancho and Pia post Farhan's letter to his favourite Hungarian wildlife photographer Andre Istvan, who offers him a position as an assistant. On Rancho's advice, he communicates his dream to his father, who though reluctant at first, gives his blessings for the sake of his son's happiness.\n\nInfuriated by this and Rancho's influence, Virus sets a difficult final exam paper to fail Raju, wherein Pia tries to help the trio by revealing to them the location of the exam paper in her father's office; unfortunately, Virus finds out and expels them. Pia confronts Virus about her brother who had committed suicide because he couldn't meet Virus' expectation of clearing the engineering exam. That same night, the pregnant Mona goes into labour during a heavy storm that cuts off all traffic and electricity in the city. Rancho and the other students help them by using their engineering knowledge to quickly modify a [[vacuum cleaner]] into a [[ventouse]] and deliver the baby with the help of Pia over a video call. A grateful Virus finally acknowledges Rancho as an extraordinary student and revokes their expulsion. On graduation day, Rancho suddenly disappears shortly after the ceremony ends.\n\nTen years later, in 2009, Farhan is a successful wildlife photographer, while Raju is married and settled with his family in a comfortable lifestyle with a corporate job and Chatur is married and the vice-president of a reputable corporation in the [[United States]] wanting to crack a business deal with a world renowned scientist and businessman with 400 patents to his name, Phunsukh Wangdu for whom he has been asking an appointment for over 1 year  ; none among the three of them have heard from Rancho since graduation. Reuniting at the ICE campus, after Chatur reminds them about the bet,they travel to Shimla, where Rancho was spotted in the background of a snapshot taken by Chatur's secretary, Tracy, who was trying to get an appointment with Wangdu. Chatur then went through the Shimla directory and found the address of Rancho. Upon arrival, they meet a man who turns out to be the real Ranchoddas Chanchad ([[Javed Jaffrey]]) at his father's funeral and the photos of the Rancho they knew replaced with the real one. From him, Farhan and Raju learn that the Rancho they knew was actually \"Chhote\", the smart son of the gardener who was a servant to the Chanchad family who would sneak into school wearing Ranchoddas' old uniform and help Ranchoddas with his schoolwork until he was found out by a teacher who told Ranchoddas' father.Ranchoddas' father then arranged for Chhote to attend ICE in his son's name so that  Ranchoddas could take credit for the degree while  he was in London for 4 years . He also told Chhote to cut off all contact with his ICE friends after graduating but Chhote was sure that Farhan and Raju would come looking for him. Ranchoddas provides Chhote's address in [[Ladakh]], where he is a schoolteacher. On the way, they pass [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] where against Chatur's wishes, they rescue and prevent Pia from marrying Suhas, who is now a changed man but reverts to his old ways when Raju, disguised as the housekeeping man, puts mint sauce on his wedding jacket, making Raju run away from the wedding in his attire. \n\nUpon arrival in Ladakh, the four head to the village school and witness the young students' inventions that resemble Chhote's college projects. They are reunited with the adult educated Manmohan, now going by the nickname \"Centimetre\" who has now become a helper for Chhote after receiving a letter from him to help him. He tells them that Chhote never forgot about them, stealing and keeping Pia's scooter helmet as a memento, reading Farhan's photography books and Raju's blog. He then tells them where to find Chhote. The four happily reunite with Chhote  to which Pia and Chhote smooch, while Chatur, unaware of Chhote's secret thinking he is Rancho, insults and asks Chhote to sign a contract stating that he is the least successful person; Chhote does so without commenting. As Chatur walks away triumphantly, Chhote reveals that his real name is Phunsukh Wangdu, to his friends' and Pia's surprise and delight. Realizing this, a horrified Chatur accepts his defeat and pleads him to sign his contract while Phunsukh and his friends run away laughing. In the end,  Wangdu tells everyone his theory: \"Follow excellence and success will by itself follow you\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Ranchoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chanchad / Chhote / Phunsukh Wangdu, one of the titular trio in the engineering college who vanishes after graduation and whom his two friends hunt for 5 years, while telling stories of their time in college together.

In the present story, he is vice-president of an American company (Rockledge Corporation) who discovers his success being overshadowed by Rancho in the end of the film.

But I knew right from the start that I could not make a film completely on the book, as it was very anecdotal and a film needs a plot. So I had decided to rewrite it in a screenplay format. You'll see that the film is very different from the book. After I wrote the script, I called Chetan and narrated it to him. I told him that if he did not like the script, I would stop the project.

I even went to IIT with Abhijat a couple of times. But it was just not possible for me to be involved at every stage of the screenplay writing process since I was in Hong Kong at that time, working full-time and busy writing other books. Moreover, Abhijat is based in USA, Raju was in the US for quite a while working on the screenplay but it was not practical for me to do that [\u2026] The film retains the soul of the book. ''3 Idiots'' is different from the book but at the same time it does borrow many things from the book. The core theme and message of the film is coming from the book itself.

The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of [[RSVP Movies]], Roy Kapur Films and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]] in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]] who was diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the love story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she has gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while Hindi dialogue writing was done by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[Severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same Severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Aditi and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection.\n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house. With anger, Niren leaves for London while Aditi stays back. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast has been listed below:<ref name=\"cast&crew\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/the-sky-is-pink/cast/ |title=The Sky Is Pink Cast & Crew |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] as Aditi Chaudhary\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Niren Chaudhary\n* [[Zaira Wasim]] as [[Aisha Chaudhary]]\n* [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]] as Ishaan Chaudhary\n* Vidhaan Sharma as Young Ishaan\n* Manas Mittal as Anshu Tandon\n* Rajshri Deshpande as Anita Tandon\n* Lushin Dubey as Mrs. Tandon\n* Sunil Chitkara as Mr. Chaudhary\n* Nirupama Verma as Mrs. Chaudhary\n* Puja Sarup as Mohini\n* Gurpal Singh as Rj Arjun Gill\n* Sheena Khalid as Rita\n* Sudhanva Deshpande as Dr. Nirvick Gulati\n* Manisha Chudasama as Santoshi\n* Paras Rattan Sharda as Jeet\n* Salmin Sheriff as Dr. Batliwala\n* Rishi Deshpande as Tanya's Doctor\n* Virhi as Baby Tanya\n* Mala Hashmi as Christian Woman\n* Akshay Joshi as Store Assistant\n* Nargis Nandal as Pilot\n* Raabia Marici as Ishaan's Girlfriend\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nThe production of the film started when [[Aisha Chaudhary]]'s mother Aditi approached [[Shonali Bose]] to make a film about her daughter.

The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of [[RSVP Movies]], Roy Kapur Films and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]] in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]] who was diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the love story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she has gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while Hindi dialogue writing was done by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[Severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same Severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Aditi and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection.\n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house. With anger, Niren leaves for London while Aditi stays back. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast has been listed below:<ref name=\"cast&crew\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/the-sky-is-pink/cast/ |title=The Sky Is Pink Cast & Crew |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]] |access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] as Aditi Chaudhary\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Niren Chaudhary\n* [[Zaira Wasim]] as [[Aisha Chaudhary]]\n* [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]] as Ishaan Chaudhary\n* Vidhaan Sharma as Young Ishaan\n* Manas Mittal as Anshu Tandon\n* Rajshri Deshpande as Anita Tandon\n* Lushin Dubey as Mrs. Tandon\n* Sunil Chitkara as Mr. Chaudhary\n* Nirupama Verma as Mrs. Chaudhary\n* Puja Sarup as Mohini\n* Gurpal Singh as Rj Arjun Gill\n* Sheena Khalid as Rita\n* Sudhanva Deshpande as Dr. Nirvick Gulati\n* Manisha Chudasama as Santoshi\n* Paras Rattan Sharda as Jeet\n* Salmin Sheriff as Dr. Batliwala\n* Rishi Deshpande as Tanya's Doctor\n* Virhi as Baby Tanya\n* Mala Hashmi as Christian Woman\n* Akshay Joshi as Store Assistant\n* Nargis Nandal as Pilot\n* Raabia Marici as Ishaan's Girlfriend\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nThe production of the film started when [[Aisha Chaudhary]]'s mother Aditi approached [[Shonali Bose]] to make a film about her daughter.
