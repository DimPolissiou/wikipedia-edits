Access to the community is via sealed road from Cooktown, or by the [[Bloomfield Track]], an unsealed road from Cape Tribulation which is only suitable for [[four wheel drive]] vehicles.  This is due to the gradient of the terrain and the many streams and rivers that make up the [[Daintree River|Daintree]] drainage basin which cross the path at very regular intervals. During high waterflow the road from Cape Tribulation is impassable.\n\nThe rare [[Bloomfield River Cod]] (''Guyu wujalwujalensis'') is found only in the Bloomfield River and is named after this community.\n\n== History of Wujal Wujal ==\n''[[Kuku Yalanji language|Kuku Yalanji]]''  (also known as ''Gugu Yalanji'', ''Kuku Yalaja'', and ''Kuku Yelandji'') is an [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian Aboriginal language]] of the [[Mossman, Queensland|Mossman]] and [[Daintree, Queensland|Daintree]] areas of  [[North Queensland]].

In 1872, William Hann was commissioned by the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]] to explore [[Cape York Peninsula]] to assess its mineral and land resources.

They incorporated the resources available at the mission into their social and economic life. The mission provided a reliable source of food and tobacco, and material items, such as farm tools and blankets. The mission was also used as a \u2018caring centre\u2019 where they could leave the elderly, ill and young.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOver time, the Kuku-Yalanji found other sites of more use.

Access to the community is via sealed road from Cooktown, or by the [[Bloomfield Track]], an unsealed road from Cape Tribulation which is only suitable for [[four wheel drive]] vehicles.  This is due to the gradient of the terrain and the many streams and rivers that make up the [[Daintree River|Daintree]] drainage basin which cross the path at very regular intervals.

In 1872, William Hann was commissioned by the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]] to explore [[Cape York Peninsula]] to assess its mineral and land resources.
