Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

It was released one month prior to his debut studio album ''[[Human Racing]]''. The release was Kershaw's second single, and features the non-album track \"Monkey Business\" as the B-side, which was also released as a bonus track on the 2012 re-release of the album.\n\n==Background==\n\"Wouldn't It Be Good\" was the second single from Kershaw's debut solo album ''[[Human Racing]]'' and turned out to be among his more popular single releases. It spent three weeks at #4 in the [[UK charts]] and became a hit throughout Europe, as well as a top 10 hit in Canada and Australia. Kershaw is also most closely associated with this song in the U.S., where it narrowly missed going [[Top 40]]. Kershaw performed this song at [[Live Aid]] in [[London]]'s [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in July 1985.\n\nKershaw's first single from this album had failed to be a major hit, and it was on the strength of this recording's success that the earlier single, \"[[I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]\", was promoted for a re-release. This time the single went all the way to #2 in the UK, becoming his highest-charting single there to date but not the most known.\n\n==Release==\n\"Wouldn't It Be Good\" was released in a single version and an extended 12\" version. The main synth tune was produced using a combination of PPG Wave 2.2 and a [[Yamaha DX7]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkershaw.co.uk/drum-talk.asp |title=The Official Nik Kershaw Website |publisher=Nikkershaw.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref> A [[remix]] by Simon Boswell, clocking in at 7:20, appears on the album ''Retro:Active 4: Rare & Remixed''.\n\nIn 1985, \"Wouldn't It Be Good\" appeared on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Gotcha! (film)|Gotcha]].''\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for \"Wouldn't It Be Good\", which features Kershaw cast as an alien visitor who observes the characteristics of the people around him, was directed by graphic designer [[Storm Thorgerson]],<ref>{{cite web|url= https://imvdb.com/video/nik-kershaw/wouldnt-it-be-good|title=Wouldn't It Be Good (1984)|website=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=4 October 2016}}</ref> was released in 1984 and received heavy rotation on [[MTV]], which helped the song reach No. 46 on the [[US charts]]. It used [[chroma key]] technology to achieve the alien suit's special effects. The music video was filmed primarily in and around St. James' Court Hotel, London.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thelondonsalad.com/80s-music-videos-london/|title=Nik Kershaw |website=The London Salad| accessdate=17 November 2017}}</ref> The closing scenes were recorded at the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]], near [[Cambridge]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Track listings==\n;7\" single \n# \"Wouldn't It Be Good\" \u2014 4:35\n# \"Monkey Business\" \u2014 3:28\n\n;12\" maxi\n# \"Wouldn't It Be Good\" (special extended mix) \u2014 6:50\n# \"Monkey Business\" \u2014 3:28\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 200pt;\"|Chart (1984)\n!style=\"width: 40pt;\"|Peak<br/>position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition=illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|page=165}} N.B.

It was released one month prior to his debut studio album ''[[Human Racing]]''. The release was Kershaw's second single, and features the non-album track \"Monkey Business\" as the B-side, which was also released as a bonus track on the 2012 re-release of the album.\n\n==Background==\n\"Wouldn't It Be Good\" was the second single from Kershaw's debut solo album ''[[Human Racing]]'' and turned out to be among his more popular single releases. It spent three weeks at #4 in the UK charts and became a hit throughout Europe, as well as a top 10 hit in Canada and Australia. Kershaw is also most closely associated with this song in the U.S., where it narrowly missed going [[Top 40]]. Kershaw performed this song at [[Live Aid]] in [[London]]'s [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in July 1985.\n\nKershaw's first single from this album had failed to be a major hit, and it was on the strength of this recording's success that the earlier single, \"[[I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]\", was promoted for a re-release. This time the single went all the way to #2 in the UK, becoming his highest-charting single there to date but not the most known.\n\n==Release==\n\"Wouldn't It Be Good\" was released in a single version and an extended 12\" version. The main synth tune was produced using a combination of PPG Wave 2.2 and a [[Yamaha DX7]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkershaw.co.uk/drum-talk.asp |title=The Official Nik Kershaw Website |publisher=Nikkershaw.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref> A [[remix]] by Simon Boswell, clocking in at 7:20, appears on the album ''Retro:Active 4: Rare & Remixed''.\n\nIn 1985, \"Wouldn't It Be Good\" appeared on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Gotcha! (film)|Gotcha]].''\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for \"Wouldn't It Be Good\", which features Kershaw cast as an alien visitor who observes the characteristics of the people around him, was directed by graphic designer [[Storm Thorgerson]],<ref>{{cite web|url= https://imvdb.com/video/nik-kershaw/wouldnt-it-be-good|title=Wouldn't It Be Good (1984)|website=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=4 October 2016}}</ref> was released in 1984 and received heavy rotation on [[MTV]], which helped the song reach No. 46 on the US charts. It used [[chroma key]] technology to achieve the alien suit's special effects. The music video was filmed primarily in and around St. James' Court Hotel, London.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thelondonsalad.com/80s-music-videos-london/|title=Nik Kershaw |website=The London Salad| accessdate=17 November 2017}}</ref> The closing scenes were recorded at the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]], near [[Cambridge]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Track listings==\n;7\" single \n# \"Wouldn't It Be Good\" \u2014 4:35\n# \"Monkey Business\" \u2014 3:28\n\n;12\" maxi\n# \"Wouldn't It Be Good\" (special extended mix) \u2014 6:50\n# \"Monkey Business\" \u2014 3:28\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 200pt;\"|Chart (1984)\n!style=\"width: 40pt;\"|Peak<br/>position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition=illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|page=165}} N.B.

This evil army is led by [[Hordak]], a tyrannical despot who dreams of conquering the whole of Etheria. One day, after getting lost in the woods, Adora finds a magic sword that transforms her into the Princess of Power, [[She-Ra]]. After realizing the suffering that the Horde has inflicted on Etheria and its inhabitants, Adora joins the Resistance in the fight against the Horde through rebuilding the Princess Alliance, a group of other [[magical girl]]s that once all opposed Hordak. Adora's newfound allegiance to the Resistance pits her against her former best friend [[Catra]], whose feelings of abandonment twist her personal ambitions, leading her to become Adora's mortal enemy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/53992/she-ra-reboot-netflix-news|title=She-Ra: first look at Netflix reboot|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the first season, Adora reassembles the Princess Alliance, which successfully defends the rebel stronghold of Bright Moon against the Horde's assault, although engineer princess Entrapta defects to the Horde when she believes her allies have abandoned her. In the second and third seasons, Hordak attempts to build an interdimensional portal which will allow him to contact his creator, the warlord Horde Prime; Catra activates the portal even though it threatens to tear the planet apart, and rebellion leader Queen Angella sacrifices herself to stop it. In the fourth season, friction arises between Adora and her friend Glimmer, Angella's daughter and Bright Moon's new queen, especially when Adora learns that her sword is the key to an ancient superweapon inside Etheria; she destroys the sword to prevent the weapon from activating, but not before Etheria is pulled through a portal and becomes accessible to Horde Prime's armada.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{see also|List of She-Ra: Princess of Power and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Aimee Carrero]] as [[She-Ra|Adora / She-Ra]]\n** LaLa Nestor as young Adora\n* [[Karen Fukuhara]] as Glimmer, Princess (later Queen) of Bright Moon\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as [[Catra]]\n** Juliet Donenfeld as young Catra\n* [[Marcus Scribner]] as Bow\n* [[Reshma Shetty]] as Angella, Queen of Bright Moon\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as [[Shadow Weaver (character)|Shadow Weaver]]\n* Keston John as [[Hordak]], Horde Prime, [[Grizzlor]],<ref>{{cite news |title=KESTON JOHN VOICES |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Keston-John/ |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |work=Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref> Additional Voices\n* [[Lauren Ash]] as [[Scorpia (Princesses of Power)|Scorpia]]\n* [[Christine Woods]] as [[Entrapta]], Princess of Dryl\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Perfuma, Princess of Plumeria, Additional Voices\n* [[Jordan Fisher]] as Sea Hawk, Seneschal and Soda Pop\n* [[Vella Lovell]] as Mermista, Princess of Salineas\n* Merit Leighton as Frosta, Princess of the Kingdom of Snows\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Castaspella\n* [[Krystal Joy Brown]] as Netossa, rebel princess\n* [[Noelle Stevenson]] as Spinnerella, rebel princess\n* Morla Gorrondona as Light Hope, Additional Voices\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Razz, Additional Voices\n* [[Adam Ray (comedian)|Adam Ray]] as [[Swift Wind]]\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Huntara<ref name=\"io901\">{{cite web |last1=Pulliam-Moore |first1=Charles |title=She-Ra Season 3 Is Coming This Summer and It's Bringing Geena Davis With It |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/she-ra-season-3-is-coming-this-summer-and-its-bringing-1834681402 |publisher=io9 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |date=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Zehra Fazal]] as Mara\n* Chris Jai Alex as George, one of Bow's fathers\n* Regi Davis as Lance, one of Bow's fathers\n* [[Dana Davis]] as Lonnie, Additional Voices\n* Antony Del Rio as Kyle, Additional Voices\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as King Micah\n** [[Taylor Gray]] as Young Micah\n* Jake Eberle as Norwyn and Tung Lashor\n* [[Jacob Tobia]] as Double Trouble\n* [[Amanda C.

This evil army is led by [[Hordak]], a tyrannical despot who dreams of conquering the whole of Etheria. One day, after getting lost in the woods, Adora finds a magic sword that transforms her into the Princess of Power, [[She-Ra]]. After realizing the suffering that the Horde has inflicted on Etheria and its inhabitants, Adora joins the Resistance in the fight against the Horde through rebuilding the Princess Alliance, a group of other [[magical girl]]s that once all opposed Hordak.

He found some of the tension in contemporary American politics reflected in the series' portrayal of the rebuilding of a \"coalition of powerful liberal-minded thinkers left in disarray after a brutal defeat years ago by a monstrously all-consuming bad dude\".<ref name=\"EW.com 7 November 2018\" /> ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' called the series \"visually exciting, emotionally charged, and unexpectedly hilarious\", and \"one of the best new shows of the year\".<ref>{{cite news |last= Trumbore |first= Dave |title='She-Ra and the Princesses of Power' Review: New Heroes Rise at Just the Right Time |url=http://collider.com/she-ra-review/ |accessdate=November 13, 2018 |work=Collider |date=November 13, 2018 }}</ref> David Griffin at IGN praised the series for successfully rebooting the franchise but concluded that \"Adora could have used more time with the Horde to help develop her character\".<ref>{{cite news |last= Griffin |first= David |title= SHE-RA AND THE PRINCESSES OF POWER: SEASON 1 REVIEW |url= https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/she-ra-and-the-princesses-of-power-season-1-review |date=November 13, 2018 |website= IGN |accessdate=November 23, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n''Hypable'' praised the series' diversity and the multifaceted relationships among some of its core characters, but found much of the first season's plot \"simplistic\", and the rotating cast of princesses given short shrift.<ref name=\"Hypable 7 November 2018\" /> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' highlighted the \"top-notch\" voice cast and particularly the work of [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as the sorceress Shadow Weaver.<ref name=\"Washington Post 7 November 2018\" /> ''The Verge'' commented that the series' biggest problem was that it was \"retreading territory that ''[[Steven Universe]]'' and the two ''Avatar'' [[Avatar: The Last Airbender|animated]] [[The Legend of Korra|series]] did better\", with several characters and plot points heavily reminiscent of elements from these earlier animated series, and also criticized the early episodes' shallow plot.<ref name=\"The Verge 11 November 2018\" />\n\nThe second season has an 85% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 7.84/10.

They are sometimes used along with a TriggerBot, which automatically shoots when an opponent appears within the field-of-view or aiming reticule of the player, like an instantaneous reflex.\n\nAimbotting relies on each player's client computer receiving information about all other players, whether they are visible from the player's position or not. Targeting is a matter of determining the location of any opponent relative to the player's location and pointing the player's weapon at the target. This targeting works regardless of whether the opponent is behind walls or too far away to be seen directly.\n\nSome servers allow inactive players to spectate, watching the game from the viewpoints of the active players. Recording of gameplay actions is also often possible. If someone was using a targeting aimbot, the bot would be obvious to the spectator as unnatural exact position tracking. Some aimbots and triggerbots attempt to hide from spectators the fact they are being used through a number of methods, such as delaying firing to hide the fact it shoots the instant an opponent is in the cheater's crosshair. Some Triggerbot programs can be easily toggled on and off using the mouse or keyboard.\n\nCheat suites may incorporate these in addition to other features, including adjustments to extrasensory perception (ESP), move speed, ammo count, and player radar. Neophytes may colloquially define these suites as aimbot programs.\n\n===Artificial lag/lag switch===\nIn the peer-to-peer gaming model, lagging is what happens when the stream of data between one or more players gets slowed or interrupted, causing movement to stutter and making opponents appear to behave erratically. By using a lag switch, a player is able to disrupt uploads from the client to the server, while their own client queues up the actions performed. The goal is to gain advantage over another player without reciprocation; opponents slow down or stop moving, allowing the lag switch user to easily outmaneuver them. From the opponent's perspective, the player using the device may appear to be teleporting, invisible or invincible, while the opponents suffer delayed animations and fast-forwarded game play, delivered in bursts.<ref name=\"about lag switch\">{{cite web |url=http://compnetworking.about.com/od/consumerelectronicsnetworks/f/lag_switches.htm |title=What Is a Lag Switch? |date= |author=Bradley Mitchell |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}</ref> Some gaming communities refer to this method as \"tapping\" which refers to the users \"tapping\" on and off their internet connection to create the lag.\n\nThe term \"lag switch\" encompasses many methods of disrupting the network communication between a client and its server. One method is by attaching a physical device, called a hardware lag switch, to a standard Ethernet cable. By flipping the switch on and off, the physical connection between the client and the server is disrupted. The designers of [[video game console]] hardware have started to introduce built-in protection against lag switches in the form of voltage detectors, which detect a change in voltage when the switch is flipped. Some manufacturers have taken counter measures to bypass or trick this detector.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://premiumlag.com/competitors/ |title=What Our Competitors Won\u2019t Tell You |date=September 3, 2009 |author= |publisher=Premium Lag |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Source is a lag switch seller and does not back up claim.|date=May 2019}} This can also be achieved by simply unplugging the Ethernet cord going to the client, causing a disruption in the player's internet connection. Other methods, called a software or wireless lag switch, involve using a computer program. In this method, the cheater runs an application on a computer connected to the same network as the client. The application hogs the network bandwidth, disrupting the communication between the client and its server. However, one cannot do this for an unlimited amount of time. At some point, if no traffic is being received, most game clients and/or game servers will decide that the connection has been lost and will remove the player from the game.\n\nMore advanced methods are firewall or router rules that apply bandwidth shaping and network latency, a cheat is able to adjust limits on both bandwidth and latency to stay relevant to a P2P network yet have considerable advantage over other players.\n\n===Look-ahead===\nLook-ahead cheating is a method of cheating within a peer-to-peer multiplayer gaming architecture where the cheating client gains an unfair advantage by delaying their actions to see what other players do before announcing its own action.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jouni Smed and Harri Hakonen |coauthors= |title=Algorithms and Networking for Computer Games |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0470029749 }}</ref>\n\nA client can cheat using this method by acting as if it is suffering from high [[latency (engineering)|latency]]; the outgoing packet is forged by attaching a time-stamp that is prior to the actual moment the packet is sent, thereby fooling other clients into thinking that the action was sent at the correct time, but was delayed in arrival. A partial solution is the [[lockstep protocol]].\n\n===World-hacking===\n'''World-hacking''' is a method or [[third-party software component|third-party program]] that enables a [[user (computing)|user]] to exploit bugs and to view more of a [[Level (video games)|level]] than intended by the [[video game developer|developer]].\n\nA common aspect of [[real-time strategy]] games is the player's partial limitation or complete inability to see beyond the visibility range of individual game objects that are under their ownership (typically units and structures); this concept is controlled by a mechanism known as the [[Fog of war#Simulations and games|fog of war]]. World-hacking usually enables the user to bypass this mechanism, either by removing it entirely and/or by [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] objects through the fog that would not normally be visible. In multiplayer modes, this allows for a distinct advantage against the other players who are subject to the intended settings. The advantage gained can be substantial, especially for the average real-time strategy games that rely on the [[rock paper scissors]] dynamic to [[game balance|balance]] out individual objects' varying strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWorld-hacking may also allow a player to see through solid or opaque objects and/or manipulate or remove textures, to know in advance when an opponent is about to come into targeting range from an occluded area. This can be done by making wall textures transparent, or modifying the game maps to insert polygonal holes into otherwise solid walls. This variation is commonly known as a \"wallhack\" since it basically allows to the player to see enemies through walls.\n\nWorld-hacking relies on the fact that an FPS server usually sends raw positional information for all players in the game, and leaves it up to the client's 3D renderer to hide opponents behind walls, in plant foliage, or in dark shadows. If the game map rendering could be turned off completely, all players could be seen moving around in what appears to be empty space. Complete map hiding offers no advantage to a cheater as they would be unable to navigate the invisible map pathways and obstacles. However, if only certain surfaces are made transparent or removed, this leaves just enough of an outline of the world to allow the cheater still to navigate it easily.\n\n[[Asus]] released wireframe display drivers in 2001 that enabled players to use wallhacks, announcing the settings as \"special weapons\" that users could employ in multiplayer games. In a poll by the [[Online Gamers Association]], 90% of its members were against the release of the drivers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/05/10/asus_releases_games_cheat_drivers/ |title=ASUS releases games cheat drivers |date=May 10, 2013 |author= |publisher=The Register |accessdate=2013-06-06 }}</ref>\n\n===Removal of game elements===\nRemovals allow the cheater to remove a game's inhibitors or annoyances. These include gun recoil, bullet spread, and obfuscating visual effects. Such removals can significantly decrease a user's skill requirement levels.\n\n==Unsporting play==\n\n===Boosting / Win trading===\nPlayers will set up multiple accounts and play one against the other. Usually, the primary account will get an easy win due to a deliberate lack of resistance from the second account due to it being unplayed or agreed by the player of that account to lose. The major problem with this method is its high cost because the boosting player requires at least two instances of the program usually through different PCs, IP addresses, and copies of the game. Additionally, some games allow the replays of matches to be uploaded and viewed by others. If the boosting player accidentally allows this, their boosting match can be seen by others. Some players will reverse roles between games, giving each account an equal win/loss record.\n\nEven without matches being seen, players who boost can usually be easily identified, since they will have an unnaturally high number of points in relation to the number of matches played.\n\n===Disconnecting===\nIn games where wins and losses are recorded on a player's account, a player may disconnect when he or she is about to lose in order to prevent that loss from being recorded. This is usually done by activating known in-game glitches and through third-party sources via \"IP booting\" (a feature of firewall software). Some players do this if they feel their opponent is being unfair.\nSome games implement a disconnection penalty, usually by recording the disconnect as a loss or a deduction of experience points. Certain games also have a 'disconnect delay' period before the player can disconnect that can last 10\u201330 seconds. This prevents a player from instantly disconnecting if they are about to die or lose. In some games, if a player disconnects they can receive a warning or even get locked out of online play for a short period.\n\n===Rapid Fire Modifications===\nIn many games the weapons featured can be fired in burst fire or single shot fire modes. Modifying a controller or keyboard/mouse to gain the advantage of having a faster firing weapon than the standard player can be considered a method of cheating.\n\nThese modifications can create an imbalance within the game. In addition to modifying a console or its controller, it is possible to achieve a similar effect on the PC by binding the firing button to the scroll wheel of a mouse or using a macro setting that will simulate rapid key presses automatically. However, most games limit the rate at which weapons can be fired regardless of how fast a player presses the button, in order to limit this form of cheating.\n\n===Environmental exploits===\n{{Main|Exploit (online gaming)}}\nExploiting is the application of an unintended feature or [[computer bug|bug]] that gives the player an advantage not intended by the game design. Exploiting is generally considered cheating by the gaming community at large due to the unfair advantage usually gained by the exploiter. Most software developers of online games prohibit exploiting in their terms of service and often issue sanctions against players found to be exploiting. There is some contention by exploiters that exploiting should not be considered cheating as it is merely taking advantage of actions allowed by the software. Some players view exploiting as a skill because certain exploits take a significant amount of time to find, or dexterity and timing to use.{{elucidate|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Farming and stat-padding===\nIn games where achievements and rewards are unlocked by defeating human enemies, especially in unorthodox ways, players may arrange to win or lose against one another in order to obtain the achievements without having to play the game linearly. This is also known as stat-padding, swapping, or boosting.\n\nThe term farming also refers to the practice of garnering achievements or virtual property for the purpose of [[Virtual economy|real-money-trading]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dibbell |first=Julian |url=http://archive.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/16-12/ff_ige?currentPage=all |title=Wired Magazine: 16.12, The Decline and Fall of an Ultra Rich Online Gaming Empire |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2008-11-24|accessdate=2015-01-05}}</ref> With rare exception, this has no direct effect on the gaming experience of other players; instead, it is a violation of most [[End-user license agreement|EULAs]] and could devalue the virtual property being farmed.\n\n===Character sharing===\nSharing is when multiple people take turns playing as a single character \u2014 mainly in [[MMORPG]]s \u2014 to gain an advantage by spending more time per day on leveling or farming than an average player would, and consequently having higher stats or better equipment.\n\n===Twinking===\n{{Main|Twinking}}\nTwinking is the act of transferring gear intended for higher level characters to lower level characters that would be incapable of obtaining the gear on their own. Twinked characters have a huge advantage over untwinked characters, as well as the rest of the game world. This is usually used by players who wish to create a new character, either to help them level more rapidly or to gain an unfair advantage in PvP (''i.e.'' player versus player, a type of multiplayer interactive conflict). Most MMORPGs tolerate it, provided that the twinked character is not used in PvP combat against non-twinked characters. Often limits on twinking are placed into the game, usually through strict level or stat requirements to equip the item. Circumventing these level requirements would then be further cheating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.weflyspitfires.com/2009/09/17/twinking-is-just-another-form-of-cheating/ |title=Twinking Is Just Another Form Of Cheating &#124; We Fly Spitfires - MMORPG Blog |publisher=Blog.weflyspitfires.com |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727020911/http://blog.weflyspitfires.com/2009/09/17/twinking-is-just-another-form-of-cheating/ |archivedate=2010-07-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Ghosting===\nMost games allow other participants to observe the game as it is played from a variety of perspectives; depending on the game, perspectives allow an observer a map overview or attach a \"camera\" to the movement of a specific player. In doing so, the observer can communicate with an accomplice using a secondary communication methodology (in-game [[private message]], third party communication, or even off-line) to inform friendly players of traps or the position of opponents. An observer can be an active player, using a separate computer, connection and account.\n\nSome systems prevent inactive players from observing the game if they are on the same [[IP address]] as an active player, on the grounds that they are probably in close physical proximity; when all players from a single IP address are no longer active participants, they are all allowed to observe. However, this restriction can be easily evaded if there are multiple IP addresses available at one location (a common feature of broadband subscriptions), or if the observer installs [[remote desktop software]] on their computer, thus enabling their computer screen to be viewed by select other players in real time.\n\nAdditionally, this may be used against players livestreaming to platforms like [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] to observe the player and their team's position and stats. This is often referred to as [[stream sniping]].\n\n===Secret alliances===\nAlso known as \"teaming\", this form of cheating occurs when two or more players conspire to engage a secret, unofficial alliance of co-operative play to give themselves an unfair advantage over other players. It is considered cheating in many games that have a [[Deathmatch|free for all deathmatch]] or [[Last man standing (gaming)|Last man standing]] mode. Characteristics of this cheating, in particular, is when players in the same multiplayer server engage in secondary communication between each other using third party software and/or using remote desktop software to observe the screens of the secret \"allies\" while one is playing that offers considerable tactical and/or strategic advantages over all other players outside of the \"alliance\". This type of cheating is very problematic in some games because it is often very difficult to prove as there is no hacking, exploits or game modifications involved, usually requiring the intervention of game server admins to monitor multiplayer sessions in order to catch players engaging in acts of teaming.\n\n===Stacking===\nStacking involves altering game settings or team lineups to give one or more teams an unfair advantage over others. One example includes arranging a team composed of skilled or professional players against a team with members of lesser skill. Although this may be a valid and accepted practice in real-life sports, in online games stacking upsets less-skilled players who feel that they aren't being given a fair chance. Less ethical rigging involves weighting the game by providing a player or team with an advantage by outfitting them with better (or more familiar) weapons or equipment, or creating a play field that caters to a certain player, team or playing style. This also may involve creating team-size inequalities, for example a 5 vs 10 match. Many games prevent this by preventing players from joining a team with more players than the opposing side, forcing newcomers to balance the teams.\n\n===Scripting===\nScripting is the use of a program or game feature to automate certain actions or behaviors. The use of scripts may or may not be considered cheating, depending on the behavior involved, and whether said behavior is replicable without the use of such script. A script may give the user unusually fast firing rate, unobtainable otherwise, or may perform seemingly trivial tasks such as reloading. Some scripts can also tamper with other players systems by spoofing commands.\n\n==Implementation of cheats==\nIn the [[client\u2013server model]], the server is responsible for information security and enforcing game rules. (See \"[[#Anti-cheating methods and limitations|Anti-cheating methods and limitations]]\" below for drawbacks.) In the [[peer-to-peer]] gaming model, clients run equal code but are still subject to most of the same type of cheats found in the client\u2013server multiplayer model; however, the peer-to-peer multiplayer model has deprecated in favor of the client\u2013server model with the wider adoption of high-speed networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=729907 |title=Gartner Says 17 Countries to Surpass 60 Percent Broadband Penetration into the Home by 2012 |publisher=Gartner.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-15}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2017}}\n\n\"Never trust the client\" is a maxim among game developers (as well as other 'types' of developers) that summarizes the model of [[client\u2013server]] game design. It means that no information sent from a client should be accepted by a server if it breaks the game rules or the basic mechanics of the game, and that no information should be sent to a client unless it is \"need-to-know.\" For example, a server with no rule enforcement or data integrity checking will synchronize all of the clients with all of the information about all of the other clients. The server will be very fast, but any wallhack program will reveal where all the players in the game are, what team they are on, and what state they're in \u2014 health, weapon, ammo etc. At the same time, altered and erroneous data from a client will allow a player to break the game rules, manipulate the server, and even manipulate other clients.\n\n===Game code modification===\nMany cheats are implemented by modifying game software, despite EULAs which forbid modification. While game software distributed in binary-only versions makes it harder to modify code, [[reverse engineering]] is possible. Also game data files can be edited separately from the main program and thereby circumvent protections implemented in software.\n\n===System software modification===\nRather than modifying the game code (which the game itself or a 3rd-party protection system may detect), some cheats modify underlying system components. An example of this is graphics driver modifications that ignore depth checking and draw all objects on the screen\u2014a primitive wallhack. System or driver modification is harder to detect, as there are a large number of system drivers that differ from user to user.\n\n===Packet interception, tampering & manipulation===\nThe security of game software can be circumvented by intercepting and/or manipulating data in real-time while in transit from the client to the server or vice versa (i.e. a [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). Interception can be passive or result in active manipulation; either method{{vague|date=April 2018}}{{Ambiguous|date=April 2018}} can be performed on the client machine itself or via an external communication proxy; some [[aimbot]]s incorporate this method.{{vague|date=April 2018}}{{Ambiguous|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Anti-cheating methods and limitations==\nThere are many facets of cheating in online games which make the creation of a system to stop cheating very difficult; however, game developers and third party software developers have created or are developing<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1041400/intel-plays-tattle-tale |title=Intel plays tattle-tale |date=June 22, 2007 |author=Wily Ferret |publisher=The Inquirer |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1023279/more-on-intel-anti-cheat-technology-revealed |title=More on Intel anti-cheat technology revealed |date=June 24, 2007 |author=Charlie Demerjian |publisher=the Inquirer |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}</ref> technologies that attempt to prevent cheating. Such countermeasures are commonly used in video games, with notable anti-cheat software being [[GameGuard]], [[PunkBuster]], [[Valve Anti-Cheat]] (specifically used on games on the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platform),{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} and EasyAntiCheat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/watch-dogs-2-cheat-multiplayer/|title=Watch Dogs 2 Anti-Cheat System Preventing Users from Playing Online|website=gamerant.com|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref>\n\nExploits of bugs are usually resolved/removed via a patch to the game; however, not all companies force the patches/updates on users, leaving the actual resolution to individual users.\n\n===Authoritative and mirrored server design===\nGenerally, the better the server is at enforcing the rules, the less of a problem cheating will be in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://udn.epicgames.com/Three/NetworkingOverview.html|author=Tim Sweeney|title=The Server is the Man|accessdate=2015-07-06}}</ref> In this approach all client functionality either runs purely on the game server or alternatively the game server mirrors the client gameplay and continuously validates the game state. In many mobile games, it is a common practice to run the client game sessions synchronously on the server, using exactly the same user input. The client session is reset when the game sessions become unsynced, thereby preventing cheating.\n\nServer-side game code makes a trade-off between calculating and sending results for display on a just-in-time basis or trusting the client to calculate and display the results in appropriate sequence as a player progresses. It can do this by sending the parts of the world state needed for immediate display, which can result in client ''lag'' under bandwidth constraints, or sending the player the entire world state, which results in faster display for the player under the same bandwidth constraints, but exposes that data to interception or manipulation\u2014a trade-off between security and efficiency.\n\nWhen [[Online game|game servers]] were restricted by limited available resources such as storage, memory, internal bandwidth, and computational capacity due to the technologies available and the cost of the hardware, coupled with internet connections that were slow, it was believed to be necessary to compromise on security for optimization to minimize the impact on the end-user. Today however, with the increased speed and power of multi-core computers, lower-priced hardware, and the increased availability of broadband internet, this has become less of an issue.\n\n===Software obfuscation===\nAdditionally to storing data in non-standard formats, some games also utilize runtime protection through software protectors. The key target is to keep attackers from directly inspecting or modifying compiled software. Protectors utilize either of three methods to protect software.\n\nEncryption solutions will encrypt the code instructions and typically use a multi\u2013layered defense mechanism against any reversing or tampering attempts that target the decryption code directly. Most protection systems in this category encrypt the code and then decrypt it at the application's startup or during runtime. This is the moment at which an attacker will breakpoint, reverse, and inject custom code. Runtime decryption may also add significant processing overhead and lower the game's framerate. Alternatively, some solutions focus on obfuscating the code by inserting jump statements and seemingly random instruction paths. The final and strongest alternative is virtualization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oreans.com/themida.php|date=2015-06-22|accessdate=2015-07-06|author=Oreans Technologies|title=Themida technology introduction}}</ref> In this approach the encrypted code runs on a virtual CPU that can be markedly different from generic x86 and x64 CPUs as the command set can be unique for each protected file.\n\nThe shared weakness of protectors and virtualizers is that they impact performance, either by requiring decryption or by introducing unnecessary CPU instructions. To reduce the overhead code virtualizers are often only used to secure the critical parts of the code base, such as those interfacing with the gamestate and rendering.\n\n===Player supervision===\nSpectator functionality can allow server administrators to monitor individual players and thereby determine whether or not a cheat is in place. One risk of the spectator mode is that in competitive matches the spectator could abuse the mode for spying on specific players and communicating player positions and tactics to the opposing team. Some games get around this limitation by not allowing spectator mode at all, or by delaying the video feed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-5-spectator-mode-included-in-beta-but-it-won-/1100-6424219/|title=Halo spectator mode|date=2014-12-15|author=Eddie Makuch|accessdate=2015-07-06}}</ref>\n\nSome games have systemized player supervision by allowing the community to review reports of disruptive behavior, determine whether those reports are valid, and apply temporary bans if appropriate. Reports can include data such as screenshots, videos, and chatlogs.\n\n===Statistical detection===\nAnomalies in player behavior can be detected by statistically analyzing game events sent by the client to the server. The great benefit is that this anti\u2013cheat method is non\u2013intrusive to the player's privacy and guaranteed to work on all end\u2013user system configurations. The restriction of this method is that it cannot always be clear whether or not a player is cheating. Highly skilled players can for example develop such a map sense that they may end up being flagged for the use of a wallhack and/or aimbot. On the other hand, players may also cheat in a way that is under the detection thresholds and remain uncaught.\n\nTo reduce the amount of false positives, statistical detection systems are often combined with a supervision system that either is community driven or managed by a professional administrator team. In such implementations unusual player behavior can trigger a clientside component to create and upload reports for review.\n\n===Pattern detection===\nPattern detection systems scan the player's hard drives and system memory for known cheat code or programs. Compared to statistical detection the key advantage is that also the subtle cheaters are detected. Other than this, a pure pattern detection approach generally has few advantages. Experience has shown that keeping detection based systems up to date is relatively slow and labor-intensive as one needs to constantly track down cheats and update detection patterns. End\u2013users may also be concerned with privacy issues, such as has been the case with VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) accessing browsing history.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/counterstrike/gabe-takes-reddit-clear-valve-anti-cheat-rumours-do-we-send-your-browsing-history-valve-no |title=Gabe takes to Reddit to clear up Valve Anti-Cheat rumours; \"Do we send your browsing history to Valve? No.\" |date=19 February 2014 |access-date=6 July 2015 |first=Jeremy |last=Peel |magazine=[[PCGamesN]]}}</ref>\n\n===Sandboxing===\n[[Sandbox (computer security)|Sandboxing]] a software process can protect against potentially malicious actions such as code injection and memory modifications that would otherwise tamper with the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://robocraftgame.com/easyanticheat-0-7-872-heavy-anti-hack-and-anti-cheat/ |title=RoboShield description |date=5 November 2014 |access-date=6 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130120242/http://robocraftgame.com/easyanticheat-0-7-872-heavy-anti-hack-and-anti-cheat/ |archive-date=30 November 2016 |work=[[Robocraft]] |url-status=dead }}</ref> One of the key benefits of sandboxing is that it can effectively prevent the underlying cheat mechanisms from working, and thereby can avoid the need for banning game community members as cheats simply don't work. Additionally, strong prevention mechanisms can stop many game hackers from targeting the game because of elevated skill requirements. Compared to pattern detection systems, sandboxing is generally not privacy invasive as the approach requires no data to be uploaded to foreign back-end systems.\n\n==Ramifications==\nGame publishers can implement a wide array of consequences for cheating players.\n\n===Banning players===\nSome companies and leagues ban suspected cheaters by blacklisting specific installation or serial keys, or user accounts, meaning that the player is effectively prevented from playing the game online.\n\nSome game publishers may decide to try and permanently ban players who are persistent in cheating and ruining the game community. Such bans are typically placed based on hardware ID or IP address. Consequently, cheaters may develop ways of getting around these bans, by either playing through proxy or VPN servers, or spoofing or changing their hardware configuration.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ccplz.net/threads/nexon-are-enforcing-their-new-tou-in-regard-to-banning-multiple-accounts.59770/ |title=Nexon hardware bans |date=16 January 2015 |access-date=8 July 2015 |author=Tryst |work=ccplz.net}}</ref>\n\nWhile game publishers are known to ban players employing cheats, the actual number of players banned is usually not revealed. Exceptions to this include [[Blizzard Entertainment]], [[Nexon]], and [[CipSoft]], known for banning cheaters in batches, and publicising the number of banned accounts, presumably in order to discourage others from cheating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maplestory.nexon.net/news/maintenance/ban-list |title=Mapplestory banlist |date=21 April 2015 |access-date=8 July 2015 |work=MapleStory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418081237/http://maplestory.nexon.net/news/maintenance/ban-list |archive-date=18 April 2015 |publisher=[[Nexon America Inc.]] |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Hellban====\nIn [[pay-to-play]] games it may be profitable to move cheaters' characters into a special environment where only cheaters play.\n\n===Suspension===\nIn some cases a ban may not be permanent and expire after a certain period of time. This approach is commonly used as a ramification for the abuse of game glitches, harassing players, or benefiting from hackers. Temporary bans may also be utilized in case a violation cannot be fully proven, as is common with anti-cheating methods based on [[#Player supervision|supervision]] or [[#Statistical detection|statistical detection]].\n\n===In-game kick===\nIn general kicking is perceived as a mild ramification, serving as a warning rather than a punishment for the player in question. Some anti-cheat systems may decide to kick players out of a game server when the system integrity cannot be enforced nor be determined with certainty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/2ksu50/for_those_with_the_debugger_error_and_eac/|title=EasyAntiCheats and Test Signing boot configuration|date=2014-10-30|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref> Other anti-cheat methods may also utilize kicks as an instant punishment for presumably unfair game play behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/2n3322/fairfight_request_can_we_put_a_temporary_halt_on/|title=FairFight kick for Phantom hunt|date=2014-11-22|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>\n\nSome games may also provide the community with the option of voting for particular players to be kicked. Such a system provides the power to self regulate and effectively get rid of abusive players without depending on [[#Player supervision|supervision]] or other anti-cheat methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Voting|title=Voting in Team Fortress 2|date=2011-04-14|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref> Even though vote kicking brings many benefits, it may also serve as a tool for trolling or [[griefer|griefing]] by allowing for legitimate players to be removed out of the game through the voting process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/864960354109863154/|title=Griefing and voting in Competitive CSGO|date=2013-02-24|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>\n\n===Demotion===\nWhen a violation is the result of farming or stat-padding, it may be too severe of a punishment to suspend or ban players. Some games, therefore, implement a system of demotion in which the offender is moved to a lower rank, the opposite of a promotion.\n\n===Progress-removal===\nIn several games where points are used, if a player is caught cheating they will get their score reset to the base value that is applied when a new player joins the server.\n\n==Legal measures==\nIn recent cases, countries such as [[South Korea]] have begun to legislate criminal sanctions for use of cheats in online games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/286852/South_Korea_cracks_down_on_cheaters_with_law_targeting_illicit_game_mods.php|title=South Korea cracks down on cheaters with law targeting illicit game mods|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref> The presence of cheaters in online games hurts sales and ultimately reduces the overall value of the industry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} This rationale is being pushed forward to pass laws that help enforce socially acceptable conduct and thereby minimize undue losses to developers.\n\nCheating thus negatively affect both developers and users alike, as unfair exploitation which ultimately lowers the value of both purchase and product. Thereby warranting action as to protect the whole of the industry.\n\nCriticism of this policy shifts the responsibility of anti-cheat policing to developers themselves. However, the Indie sector is especially vulnerable and often has limited resources with which to combat the trend.\n\nHistorically, some game companies have also filed suit against individuals or commercial entities that have created and sold cheating tools in video games as a means to curb their use. In April 2013, coder DrUnKeN ChEeTaH was sued by [[Nexon America]] for operating GameAnarchy, a popular subscription based cheat provider for [[Combat Arms]], and lost, Nexon being awarded $1.4M in damages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/cacdce/2:2012cv02083/526488/71/|title=Nexon America Inc et al v.

They are sometimes used along with a TriggerBot, which automatically shoots when an opponent appears within the field-of-view or aiming reticule of the player, like an instantaneous reflex.\n\nAimbotting relies on each player's client computer receiving information about all other players, whether they are visible from the player's position or not. Targeting is a matter of determining the location of any opponent relative to the player's location and pointing the player's weapon at the target. This targeting works regardless of whether the opponent is behind walls or too far away to be seen directly.\n\nSome servers allow inactive players to spectate, watching the game from the viewpoints of the active players. Recording of gameplay actions is also often possible. If someone was using a targeting aimbot, the bot would be obvious to the spectator as unnatural exact position tracking. Some aimbots and triggerbots attempt to hide from spectators the fact they are being used through a number of methods, such as delaying firing to hide the fact it shoots the instant an opponent is in the cheater's crosshair. Some Triggerbot programs can be easily toggled on and off using the mouse or keyboard.\n\nCheat suites may incorporate these in addition to other features, including adjustments to extrasensory perception (ESP), move speed, ammo count, and player radar. Neophytes may colloquially define these suites as aimbot programs.\n\n===Artificial lag/lag switch===\nIn the peer-to-peer gaming model, lagging is what happens when the stream of data between one or more players gets slowed or interrupted, causing movement to stutter and making opponents appear to behave erratically. By using a lag switch, a player is able to disrupt uploads from the client to the server, while their own client queues up the actions performed. The goal is to gain advantage over another player without reciprocation; opponents slow down or stop moving, allowing the lag switch user to easily outmaneuver them. From the opponent's perspective, the player using the device may appear to be teleporting, invisible or invincible, while the opponents suffer delayed animations and fast-forwarded game play, delivered in bursts.<ref name=\"about lag switch\">{{cite web |url=http://compnetworking.about.com/od/consumerelectronicsnetworks/f/lag_switches.htm |title=What Is a Lag Switch? |date= |author=Bradley Mitchell |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}</ref> Some gaming communities refer to this method as \"tapping\" which refers to the users \"tapping\" on and off their internet connection to create the lag.\n\nThe term \"lag switch\" encompasses many methods of disrupting the network communication between a client and its server. One method is by attaching a physical device, called a hardware lag switch, to a standard Ethernet cable. By flipping the switch on and off, the physical connection between the client and the server is disrupted. The designers of [[video game console]] hardware have started to introduce built-in protection against lag switches in the form of voltage detectors, which detect a change in voltage when the switch is flipped. Some manufacturers have taken counter measures to bypass or trick this detector.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://premiumlag.com/competitors/ |title=What Our Competitors Won\u2019t Tell You |date=September 3, 2009 |author= |publisher=Premium Lag |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Source is a lag switch seller and does not back up claim.|date=May 2019}} This can also be achieved by simply unplugging the Ethernet cord going to the client, causing a disruption in the player's internet connection. Other methods, called a software or wireless lag switch, involve using a computer program. In this method, the cheater runs an application on a computer connected to the same network as the client. The application hogs the network bandwidth, disrupting the communication between the client and its server. However, one cannot do this for an unlimited amount of time. At some point, if no traffic is being received, most game clients and/or game servers will decide that the connection has been lost and will remove the player from the game.\n\nMore advanced methods are firewall or router rules that apply bandwidth shaping and network latency, a cheat is able to adjust limits on both bandwidth and latency to stay relevant to a P2P network yet have considerable advantage over other players.\n\n===Look-ahead===\nLook-ahead cheating is a method of cheating within a peer-to-peer multiplayer gaming architecture where the cheating client gains an unfair advantage by delaying their actions to see what other players do before announcing its own action.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jouni Smed and Harri Hakonen |coauthors= |title=Algorithms and Networking for Computer Games |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0470029749 }}</ref>\n\nA client can cheat using this method by acting as if it is suffering from high [[latency (engineering)|latency]]; the outgoing packet is forged by attaching a time-stamp that is prior to the actual moment the packet is sent, thereby fooling other clients into thinking that the action was sent at the correct time, but was delayed in arrival. A partial solution is the [[lockstep protocol]].\n\n===World-hacking===\n'''World-hacking''' is a method or [[third-party software component|third-party program]] that enables a [[user (computing)|user]] to exploit bugs and to view more of a [[Level (video games)|level]] than intended by the [[video game developer|developer]].\n\nA common aspect of [[real-time strategy]] games is the player's partial limitation or complete inability to see beyond the visibility range of individual game objects that are under their ownership (typically units and structures); this concept is controlled by a mechanism known as the [[Fog of war#Simulations and games|fog of war]]. World-hacking usually enables the user to bypass this mechanism, either by removing it entirely and/or by [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] objects through the fog that would not normally be visible. In multiplayer modes, this allows for a distinct advantage against the other players who are subject to the intended settings. The advantage gained can be substantial, especially for the average real-time strategy games that rely on the [[rock paper scissors]] dynamic to [[game balance|balance]] out individual objects' varying strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWorld-hacking may also allow a player to see through solid or opaque objects and/or manipulate or remove textures, to know in advance when an opponent is about to come into targeting range from an occluded area. This can be done by making wall textures transparent, or modifying the game maps to insert polygonal holes into otherwise solid walls. This variation is commonly known as a \"wallhack\" since it basically allows to the player to see enemies through walls.\n\nWorld-hacking relies on the fact that an FPS server usually sends raw positional information for all players in the game, and leaves it up to the client's 3D renderer to hide opponents behind walls, in plant foliage, or in dark shadows. If the game map rendering could be turned off completely, all players could be seen moving around in what appears to be empty space. Complete map hiding offers no advantage to a cheater as they would be unable to navigate the invisible map pathways and obstacles. However, if only certain surfaces are made transparent or removed, this leaves just enough of an outline of the world to allow the cheater still to navigate it easily.\n\n[[Asus]] released wireframe display drivers in 2001 that enabled players to use wallhacks, announcing the settings as \"special weapons\" that users could employ in multiplayer games. In a poll by the [[Online Gamers Association]], 90% of its members were against the release of the drivers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/05/10/asus_releases_games_cheat_drivers/ |title=ASUS releases games cheat drivers |date=May 10, 2013 |author= |publisher=The Register |accessdate=2013-06-06 }}</ref>\n\n===Removal of game elements===\nRemovals allow the cheater to remove a game's inhibitors or annoyances. These include gun recoil, bullet spread, and obfuscating visual effects. Such removals can significantly decrease a user's skill requirement levels.\n\n==Unsporting play==\n\n===Boosting / Win trading===\nPlayers will set up multiple accounts and play one against the other. Usually, the primary account will get an easy win due to a deliberate lack of resistance from the second account due to it being unplayed or agreed by the player of that account to lose. The major problem with this method is its high cost because the boosting player requires at least two instances of the program usually through different PCs, IP addresses, and copies of the game. Additionally, some games allow the replays of matches to be uploaded and viewed by others. If the boosting player accidentally allows this, their boosting match can be seen by others. Some players will reverse roles between games, giving each account an equal win/loss record.\n\nEven without matches being seen, players who boost can usually be easily identified, since they will have an unnaturally high number of points in relation to the number of matches played.\n\n===Disconnecting===\nIn games where wins and losses are recorded on a player's account, a player may disconnect when he or she is about to lose in order to prevent that loss from being recorded. This is usually done by activating known in-game glitches and through third-party sources via \"IP booting\" (a feature of firewall software). Some players do this if they feel their opponent is being unfair.\nSome games implement a disconnection penalty, usually by recording the disconnect as a loss or a deduction of experience points. Certain games also have a 'disconnect delay' period before the player can disconnect that can last 10\u201330 seconds. This prevents a player from instantly disconnecting if they are about to die or lose. In some games, if a player disconnects they can receive a warning or even get locked out of online play for a short period.\n\n===Rapid Fire Modifications===\nIn many games the weapons featured can be fired in burst fire or single shot fire modes. Modifying a controller or keyboard/mouse to gain the advantage of having a faster firing weapon than the standard player can be considered a method of cheating.\n\nThese modifications can create an imbalance within the game. In addition to modifying a console or its controller, it is possible to achieve a similar effect on the PC by binding the firing button to the scroll wheel of a mouse or using a macro setting that will simulate rapid key presses automatically. However, most games limit the rate at which weapons can be fired regardless of how fast a player presses the button, in order to limit this form of cheating.\n\n===Environmental exploits===\n{{Main|Exploit (online gaming)}}\nExploiting is the application of an unintended feature or [[computer bug|bug]] that gives the player an advantage not intended by the game design. Exploiting is generally considered cheating by the gaming community at large due to the unfair advantage usually gained by the exploiter. Most software developers of online games prohibit exploiting in their terms of service and often issue sanctions against players found to be exploiting. There is some contention by exploiters that exploiting should not be considered cheating as it is merely taking advantage of actions allowed by the software. Some players view exploiting as a skill because certain exploits take a significant amount of time to find, or dexterity and timing to use.{{elucidate|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Farming and stat-padding===\nIn games where achievements and rewards are unlocked by defeating human enemies, especially in unorthodox ways, players may arrange to win or lose against one another in order to obtain the achievements without having to play the game linearly. This is also known as stat-padding, swapping, or boosting.\n\nThe term farming also refers to the practice of garnering achievements or virtual property for the purpose of [[Virtual economy|real-money-trading]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dibbell |first=Julian |url=http://archive.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/16-12/ff_ige?currentPage=all |title=Wired Magazine: 16.12, The Decline and Fall of an Ultra Rich Online Gaming Empire |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2008-11-24|accessdate=2015-01-05}}</ref> With rare exception, this has no direct effect on the gaming experience of other players; instead, it is a violation of most [[End-user license agreement|EULAs]] and could devalue the virtual property being farmed.\n\n===Character sharing===\nSharing is when multiple people take turns playing as a single character \u2014 mainly in [[MMORPG]]s \u2014 to gain an advantage by spending more time per day on leveling or farming than an average player would, and consequently having higher stats or better equipment.\n\n===Twinking===\n{{Main|Twinking}}\nTwinking is the act of transferring gear intended for higher level characters to lower level characters that would be incapable of obtaining the gear on their own. Twinked characters have a huge advantage over untwinked characters, as well as the rest of the game world. This is usually used by players who wish to create a new character, either to help them level more rapidly or to gain an unfair advantage in PvP (''i.e.'' player versus player, a type of multiplayer interactive conflict). Most MMORPGs tolerate it, provided that the twinked character is not used in PvP combat against non-twinked characters. Often limits on twinking are placed into the game, usually through strict level or stat requirements to equip the item. Circumventing these level requirements would then be further cheating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.weflyspitfires.com/2009/09/17/twinking-is-just-another-form-of-cheating/ |title=Twinking Is Just Another Form Of Cheating &#124; We Fly Spitfires - MMORPG Blog |publisher=Blog.weflyspitfires.com |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727020911/http://blog.weflyspitfires.com/2009/09/17/twinking-is-just-another-form-of-cheating/ |archivedate=2010-07-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Ghosting===\nMost games allow other participants to observe the game as it is played from a variety of perspectives; depending on the game, perspectives allow an observer a map overview or attach a \"camera\" to the movement of a specific player. In doing so, the observer can communicate with an accomplice using a secondary communication methodology (in-game [[private message]], third party communication, or even off-line) to inform friendly players of traps or the position of opponents. An observer can be an active player, using a separate computer, connection and account.\n\nSome systems prevent inactive players from observing the game if they are on the same [[IP address]] as an active player, on the grounds that they are probably in close physical proximity; when all players from a single IP address are no longer active participants, they are all allowed to observe. However, this restriction can be easily evaded if there are multiple IP addresses available at one location (a common feature of broadband subscriptions), or if the observer installs [[remote desktop software]] on their computer, thus enabling their computer screen to be viewed by select other players in real time.\n\nAdditionally, this may be used against players livestreaming to platforms like [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] to observe the player and their team's position and stats. This is often referred to as [[stream sniping]].\n\n===Secret alliances===\nAlso known as \"teaming\", this form of cheating occurs when two or more players conspire to engage a secret, unofficial alliance of co-operative play to give themselves an unfair advantage over other players. It is considered cheating in many games that have a [[Deathmatch|free for all deathmatch]] or [[Last man standing (gaming)|Last man standing]] mode. Characteristics of this cheating, in particular, is when players in the same multiplayer server engage in secondary communication between each other using third party software and/or using remote desktop software to observe the screens of the secret \"allies\" while one is playing that offers considerable tactical and/or strategic advantages over all other players outside of the \"alliance\". This type of cheating is very problematic in some games because it is often very difficult to prove as there is no hacking, exploits or game modifications involved, usually requiring the intervention of game server admins to monitor multiplayer sessions in order to catch players engaging in acts of teaming.\n\n===Stacking===\nStacking involves altering game settings or team lineups to give one or more teams an unfair advantage over others. One example includes arranging a team composed of skilled or professional players against a team with members of lesser skill. Although this may be a valid and accepted practice in real-life sports, in online games stacking upsets less-skilled players who feel that they aren't being given a fair chance. Less ethical rigging involves weighting the game by providing a player or team with an advantage by outfitting them with better (or more familiar) weapons or equipment, or creating a play field that caters to a certain player, team or playing style. This also may involve creating team-size inequalities, for example a 5 vs 10 match. Many games prevent this by preventing players from joining a team with more players than the opposing side, forcing newcomers to balance the teams.\n\n===Scripting===\nScripting is the use of a program or game feature to automate certain actions or behaviors. The use of scripts may or may not be considered cheating, depending on the behavior involved, and whether said behavior is replicable without the use of such script. A script may give the user unusually fast firing rate, unobtainable otherwise, or may perform seemingly trivial tasks such as reloading. Some scripts can also tamper with other players systems by spoofing commands.\n\n==Implementation of cheats==\nIn the [[client\u2013server model]], the server is responsible for information security and enforcing game rules. (See \"[[#Anti-cheating methods and limitations|Anti-cheating methods and limitations]]\" below for drawbacks.) In the [[peer-to-peer]] gaming model, clients run equal code but are still subject to most of the same type of cheats found in the client\u2013server multiplayer model; however, the peer-to-peer multiplayer model has deprecated in favor of the client\u2013server model with the wider adoption of high-speed networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=729907 |title=Gartner Says 17 Countries to Surpass 60 Percent Broadband Penetration into the Home by 2012 |publisher=Gartner.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-15}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2017}}\n\n\"Never trust the client\" is a maxim among game developers (as well as other 'types' of developers) that summarizes the model of [[client\u2013server]] game design. It means that no information sent from a client should be accepted by a server if it breaks the game rules or the basic mechanics of the game, and that no information should be sent to a client unless it is \"need-to-know.\" For example, a server with no rule enforcement or data integrity checking will synchronize all of the clients with all of the information about all of the other clients. The server will be very fast, but any wallhack program will reveal where all the players in the game are, what team they are on, and what state they're in \u2014 health, weapon, ammo etc. At the same time, altered and erroneous data from a client will allow a player to break the game rules, manipulate the server, and even manipulate other clients.\n\n===Game code modification===\nMany cheats are implemented by modifying game software, despite EULAs which forbid modification. While game software distributed in binary-only versions makes it harder to modify code, [[reverse engineering]] is possible. Also game data files can be edited separately from the main program and thereby circumvent protections implemented in software.\n\n===System software modification===\nRather than modifying the game code (which the game itself or a 3rd-party protection system may detect), some cheats modify underlying system components. An example of this is graphics driver modifications that ignore depth checking and draw all objects on the screen\u2014a primitive wallhack. System or driver modification is harder to detect, as there are a large number of system drivers that differ from user to user.\n\n===Packet interception, tampering & manipulation===\nThe security of game software can be circumvented by intercepting and/or manipulating data in real-time while in transit from the client to the server or vice versa (i.e. a [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). Interception can be passive or result in active manipulation; either method{{vague|date=April 2018}}{{Ambiguous|date=April 2018}} can be performed on the client machine itself or via an external communication proxy; some [[aimbot]]s incorporate this method.{{vague|date=April 2018}}{{Ambiguous|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Anti-cheating methods and limitations==\nThere are many facets of cheating in online games which make the creation of a system to stop cheating very difficult; however, game developers and third party software developers have created or are developing<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1041400/intel-plays-tattle-tale |title=Intel plays tattle-tale |date=June 22, 2007 |author=Wily Ferret |publisher=The Inquirer |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1023279/more-on-intel-anti-cheat-technology-revealed |title=More on Intel anti-cheat technology revealed |date=June 24, 2007 |author=Charlie Demerjian |publisher=the Inquirer |accessdate=2012-12-15 }}</ref> technologies that attempt to prevent cheating. Such countermeasures are commonly used in video games, with notable anti-cheat software being [[GameGuard]], [[PunkBuster]], [[Valve Anti-Cheat]] (specifically used on games on the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platform),{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} and EasyAntiCheat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/watch-dogs-2-cheat-multiplayer/|title=Watch Dogs 2 Anti-Cheat System Preventing Users from Playing Online|website=gamerant.com|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref>\n\nExploits of bugs are usually resolved/removed via a patch to the game; however, not all companies force the patches/updates on users, leaving the actual resolution to individual users.\n\n===Authoritative and mirrored server design===\nGenerally, the better the server is at enforcing the rules, the less of a problem cheating will be in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://udn.epicgames.com/Three/NetworkingOverview.html|author=Tim Sweeney|title=The Server is the Man|accessdate=2015-07-06}}</ref> In this approach all client functionality either runs purely on the game server or alternatively the game server mirrors the client gameplay and continuously validates the game state. In many mobile games, it is a common practice to run the client game sessions synchronously on the server, using exactly the same user input. The client session is reset when the game sessions become unsynced, thereby preventing cheating.\n\nServer-side game code makes a trade-off between calculating and sending results for display on a just-in-time basis or trusting the client to calculate and display the results in appropriate sequence as a player progresses. It can do this by sending the parts of the world state needed for immediate display, which can result in client ''lag'' under bandwidth constraints, or sending the player the entire world state, which results in faster display for the player under the same bandwidth constraints, but exposes that data to interception or manipulation\u2014a trade-off between security and efficiency.\n\nWhen [[Online game|game servers]] were restricted by limited available resources such as storage, memory, internal bandwidth, and computational capacity due to the technologies available and the cost of the hardware, coupled with internet connections that were slow, it was believed to be necessary to compromise on security for optimization to minimize the impact on the end-user. Today however, with the increased speed and power of multi-core computers, lower-priced hardware, and the increased availability of broadband internet, this has become less of an issue.\n\n===Software obfuscation===\nAdditionally to storing data in non-standard formats, some games also utilize runtime protection through software protectors. The key target is to keep attackers from directly inspecting or modifying compiled software. Protectors utilize either of three methods to protect software.\n\nEncryption solutions will encrypt the code instructions and typically use a multi\u2013layered defense mechanism against any reversing or tampering attempts that target the decryption code directly. Most protection systems in this category encrypt the code and then decrypt it at the application's startup or during runtime. This is the moment at which an attacker will breakpoint, reverse, and inject custom code. Runtime decryption may also add significant processing overhead and lower the game's framerate. Alternatively, some solutions focus on obfuscating the code by inserting jump statements and seemingly random instruction paths. The final and strongest alternative is virtualization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oreans.com/themida.php|date=2015-06-22|accessdate=2015-07-06|author=Oreans Technologies|title=Themida technology introduction}}</ref> In this approach the encrypted code runs on a virtual CPU that can be markedly different from generic x86 and x64 CPUs as the command set can be unique for each protected file.\n\nThe shared weakness of protectors and virtualizers is that they impact performance, either by requiring decryption or by introducing unnecessary CPU instructions. To reduce the overhead code virtualizers are often only used to secure the critical parts of the code base, such as those interfacing with the gamestate and rendering.\n\n===Player supervision===\nSpectator functionality can allow server administrators to monitor individual players and thereby determine whether or not a cheat is in place. One risk of the spectator mode is that in competitive matches the spectator could abuse the mode for spying on specific players and communicating player positions and tactics to the opposing team. Some games get around this limitation by not allowing spectator mode at all, or by delaying the video feed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-5-spectator-mode-included-in-beta-but-it-won-/1100-6424219/|title=Halo spectator mode|date=2014-12-15|author=Eddie Makuch|accessdate=2015-07-06}}</ref>\n\nSome games have systemized player supervision by allowing the community to review reports of disruptive behavior, determine whether those reports are valid, and apply temporary bans if appropriate. Reports can include data such as screenshots, videos, and chatlogs.\n\n===Statistical detection===\nAnomalies in player behavior can be detected by statistically analyzing game events sent by the client to the server. The great benefit is that this anti\u2013cheat method is non\u2013intrusive to the player's privacy and guaranteed to work on all end\u2013user system configurations. The restriction of this method is that it cannot always be clear whether or not a player is cheating. Highly skilled players can for example develop such a map sense that they may end up being flagged for the use of a wallhack and/or aimbot. On the other hand, players may also cheat in a way that is under the detection thresholds and remain uncaught.\n\nTo reduce the amount of false positives, statistical detection systems are often combined with a supervision system that either is community driven or managed by a professional administrator team. In such implementations unusual player behavior can trigger a clientside component to create and upload reports for review.\n\n===Pattern detection===\nPattern detection systems scan the player's hard drives and system memory for known cheat code or programs. Compared to statistical detection the key advantage is that also the subtle cheaters are detected. Other than this, a pure pattern detection approach generally has few advantages. Experience has shown that keeping detection based systems up to date is relatively slow and labor-intensive as one needs to constantly track down cheats and update detection patterns. End\u2013users may also be concerned with privacy issues, such as has been the case with VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) accessing browsing history.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/counterstrike/gabe-takes-reddit-clear-valve-anti-cheat-rumours-do-we-send-your-browsing-history-valve-no |title=Gabe takes to Reddit to clear up Valve Anti-Cheat rumours; \"Do we send your browsing history to Valve? No.\" |date=19 February 2014 |access-date=6 July 2015 |first=Jeremy |last=Peel |magazine=[[PCGamesN]]}}</ref>\n\n===Sandboxing===\n[[Sandbox (computer security)|Sandboxing]] a software process can protect against potentially malicious actions such as code injection and memory modifications that would otherwise tamper with the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://robocraftgame.com/easyanticheat-0-7-872-heavy-anti-hack-and-anti-cheat/ |title=RoboShield description |date=5 November 2014 |access-date=6 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130120242/http://robocraftgame.com/easyanticheat-0-7-872-heavy-anti-hack-and-anti-cheat/ |archive-date=30 November 2016 |work=[[Robocraft]] |url-status=dead }}</ref> One of the key benefits of sandboxing is that it can effectively prevent the underlying cheat mechanisms from working, and thereby can avoid the need for banning game community members as cheats simply don't work. Additionally, strong prevention mechanisms can stop many game hackers from targeting the game because of elevated skill requirements. Compared to pattern detection systems, sandboxing is generally not privacy invasive as the approach requires no data to be uploaded to foreign back-end systems.\n\n==Ramifications==\nGame publishers can implement a wide array of consequences for cheating players.\n\n===Banning players===\nSome companies and leagues ban suspected cheaters by blacklisting specific installation or serial keys, or user accounts, meaning that the player is effectively prevented from playing the game online.\n\nSome game publishers may decide to try and permanently ban players who are persistent in cheating and ruining the game community. Such bans are typically placed based on hardware ID or IP address. Consequently, cheaters may develop ways of getting around these bans, by either playing through proxy or VPN servers, or spoofing or changing their hardware configuration.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ccplz.net/threads/nexon-are-enforcing-their-new-tou-in-regard-to-banning-multiple-accounts.59770/ |title=Nexon hardware bans |date=16 January 2015 |access-date=8 July 2015 |author=Tryst |work=ccplz.net}}</ref>\n\nWhile game publishers are known to ban players employing cheats, the actual number of players banned is usually not revealed. Exceptions to this include [[Blizzard Entertainment]], [[Nexon]], and [[CipSoft]], known for banning cheaters in batches, and publicising the number of banned accounts, presumably in order to discourage others from cheating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maplestory.nexon.net/news/maintenance/ban-list |title=Mapplestory banlist |date=21 April 2015 |access-date=8 July 2015 |work=MapleStory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418081237/http://maplestory.nexon.net/news/maintenance/ban-list |archive-date=18 April 2015 |publisher=[[Nexon America Inc.]] |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Hellban====\nIn [[pay-to-play]] games it may be profitable to move cheaters' characters into a special environment where only cheaters play.\n\n===Suspension===\nIn some cases a ban may not be permanent and expire after a certain period of time. This approach is commonly used as a ramification for the abuse of game glitches, harassing players, or benefiting from hackers. Temporary bans may also be utilized in case a violation cannot be fully proven, as is common with anti-cheating methods based on [[#Player supervision|supervision]] or [[#Statistical detection|statistical detection]].\n\n===In-game kick===\nIn general kicking is perceived as a mild ramification, serving as a warning rather than a punishment for the player in question. Some anti-cheat systems may decide to kick players out of a game server when the system integrity cannot be enforced nor be determined with certainty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/2ksu50/for_those_with_the_debugger_error_and_eac/|title=EasyAntiCheats and Test Signing boot configuration|date=2014-10-30|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref> Other anti-cheat methods may also utilize kicks as an instant punishment for presumably unfair game play behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/2n3322/fairfight_request_can_we_put_a_temporary_halt_on/|title=FairFight kick for Phantom hunt|date=2014-11-22|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>\n\nSome games may also provide the community with the option of voting for particular players to be kicked. Such a system provides the power to self regulate and effectively get rid of abusive players without depending on [[#Player supervision|supervision]] or other anti-cheat methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Voting|title=Voting in Team Fortress 2|date=2011-04-14|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref> Even though vote kicking brings many benefits, it may also serve as a tool for trolling or [[griefer|griefing]] by allowing for legitimate players to be removed out of the game through the voting process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/864960354109863154/|title=Griefing and voting in Competitive CSGO|date=2013-02-24|accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>\n\n===Demotion===\nWhen a violation is the result of farming or stat-padding, it may be too severe of a punishment to suspend or ban players. Some games, therefore, implement a system of demotion in which the offender is moved to a lower rank, the opposite of a promotion.\n\n===Progress-removal===\nIn several games where points are used, if a player is caught cheating they will get their score reset to the base value that is applied when a new player joins the server.\n\n==Legal measures==\nIn recent cases, countries such as [[South Korea]] have begun to legislate criminal sanctions for use of cheats in online games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/286852/South_Korea_cracks_down_on_cheaters_with_law_targeting_illicit_game_mods.php|title=South Korea cracks down on cheaters with law targeting illicit game mods|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref> The presence of cheaters in online games hurts sales and ultimately reduces the overall value of the industry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} This rationale is being pushed forward to pass laws that help enforce socially acceptable conduct and thereby minimize undue losses to developers.\n\nCheating thus negatively affect both developers and users alike, as unfair exploitation which ultimately lowers the value of both purchase and product. Thereby warranting action as to protect the whole of the industry.\n\nCriticism of this policy shifts the responsibility of anti-cheat policing to developers themselves. However, the Indie sector is especially vulnerable and often has limited resources with which to combat the trend.\n\nHistorically, some game companies have also filed suit against individuals or commercial entities that have created and sold cheating tools in video games as a means to curb their use. In April 2013, coder DrUnKeN ChEeTaH was sued by [[Nexon America]] for operating GameAnarchy, a popular subscription based cheat provider for [[Combat Arms]], and lost, Nexon being awarded $1.4M in damages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/cacdce/2:2012cv02083/526488/71/|title=Nexon America Inc et al v.

It is a [[remake]] of the [[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|1961 film of the same name]] and an adaptation of [[Erich K\u00e4stner]]'s German novel ''[[Lottie and Lisa]]'' (''Das doppelte Lottchen'').\n\n[[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Natasha Richardson]] star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters' birth; [[Lindsay Lohan]] stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]] wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on ''Lottie and Lisa''. The story is comparable to that of the 1936 [[Deanna Durbin]] film ''[[Three Smart Girls]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kawano|first1=Kelley|title=Let's Get Together: An In-Depth Look at the Ongoing Appeal of Hayley Mills' 'The Parent Trap'|url=http://www.wordandfilm.com/2012/06/lets-get-together-hayley-mills-in-depth-look-ongoing-appeal-the-parent-trap/|website=Wordandfilm.com|accessdate=November 9, 2014|date=June 26, 2012}}</ref> Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1986, [[Americans|American]] [[winery]] owner Nicholas \"Nick\" Parker and [[British people|British]] [[wedding gown]] designer Elizabeth \"Liz\" James meet, fall in love, and get married over the course of a transatlantic crossing on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]''. However, shortly after the birth of their identical twin daughters, Annie and Hallie, they get divorced and each has sole custody of one girl. Nick raises Hallie in [[Napa Valley, California]] and Elizabeth raises Annie in [[London, England]].\n\nEleven years and nine months later in the summer of 1998, Nick and Elizabeth coincidentally send their daughters to Camp Walden, a girls' [[sleep away camp]] in [[Maine]]. Annie and Hallie, who do not know each other, meet after a fencing match and take an immediate dislike to one another.\n\nAnnie and Hallie\u2019s dislike for each other grows and they begin to pull a series of pranks on each other. After a prank goes too far, the two are isolated together as punishment until camp is over. They ecstatically discover that they are twins and hatch a plan: for each girl to switch and meet the parent she has never met and reunite them. After a makeover, where Annie gets a haircut and pierces her ears, Hallie imitates Annie's British accent and flies to London to meet their mother, maternal grandfather Charles, and the James' butler, Martin.\n\nAnnie imitates Hallie's American accent, and flies to Napa Valley to meet their father, Hallie's nanny Chessy, and their dog Sammy. Eventually the plan unravels, as Charles catches Hallie sneaking out to a phone booth to call Annie in California, and gets her to confess that she is Hallie over a walk in the park. Soon after, Chessy is suspicious of \"Hallie's\" behavior, and Annie confirms her suspicions. After discovering that their father is engaged to the child-hating [[gold digger]] Meredith Blake, Annie and Hallie come clean and tell their parents they switched, it was part of their plot to reunite Elizabeth and Nick by falsely telling Elizabeth that Nick wants to meet her in [[San Francisco]]. Chessy, Martin, and Charles decide to help the girls' plan, and want to help them get their parents back together. Nick is shocked, but delighted to see Elizabeth for the first time in years, and to learn that he's had Annie in his care since the end of camp. Meanwhile, Chessy and Martin grow romantically attracted to each other.\n\nThe girls' pull out all the stops, including recreating the night their parents met, by having Charles pay to rent out a yacht for an evening, and having Chessy and Martin act as a waitress and [[sommelier]] respectively. However, they ultimately fail to rekindle Nick and Elizabeth's relationship. The twins resort to a last-ditch effort, by demanding a three-day family camping trip, refusing to reveal which twin is ''which'' until after they return; Elizabeth tricks Meredith into taking her place on the camping trip.\n\nAnnie and Hallie play a number of pranks on Meredith, who becomes enraged after waking up in the middle of the lake on her air mattress and gives Nick an ultimatum; choose either the girls or her. Nick, finally seeing Meredith for who she truly is, chooses the girls over Meredith much to her dismay, and as a result, she angrily breaks off the engagement. Being a responsible father, Nick punishes the girls for their mischief; however, he comments to Elizabeth that he will have to thank them one day.\n\nNick shows Elizabeth his wine collection, including the one from their wedding. Both realize they still have feelings for one another, but decide it is better to go their separate ways. Elizabeth and Annie later board a flight for London, but when they arrive, they find Nick and Hallie waiting for them (having taken a faster flight on the [[Concorde]]). Nick realizes his previous mistake of not going after Elizabeth when she left him and proposes to her. Elizabeth yields to Nick's unwavering confidence and tearfully accepts. Photos show Nick and Elizabeth getting remarried aboard the ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', with Annie and Hallie as bridesmaids, while Charles also presenting, and Martin proposing to Chessy.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Lindsay Lohan]] as Hallie Parker and Annie James, eleven-year-old twin sisters who were separated after birth.

It is a [[remake]] of the [[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|1961 film of the same name]] and an adaptation of [[Erich K\u00e4stner]]'s German novel ''[[Lottie and Lisa]]'' (''Das doppelte Lottchen'').\n\n[[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Natasha Richardson]] star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters' birth; [[Lindsay Lohan]] stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]] wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on ''Lottie and Lisa''. The story is comparable to that of the 1936 [[Deanna Durbin]] film ''[[Three Smart Girls]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kawano|first1=Kelley|title=Let's Get Together: An In-Depth Look at the Ongoing Appeal of Hayley Mills' 'The Parent Trap'|url=http://www.wordandfilm.com/2012/06/lets-get-together-hayley-mills-in-depth-look-ongoing-appeal-the-parent-trap/|website=Wordandfilm.com|accessdate=November 9, 2014|date=June 26, 2012}}</ref> Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1986, [[Americans|American]] [[winery]] owner Nicholas \"Nick\" Parker and [[British people|British]] [[wedding gown]] designer Elizabeth \"Liz\" James meet, fall in love, and get married over the course of a transatlantic crossing on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]''. However, shortly after the birth of their identical twin daughters, Annie and Hallie, they get divorced and each has sole custody of one girl. Nick raises Hallie in [[Napa Valley, California]] and Elizabeth raises Annie in [[London, England]].\n\nEleven years and nine months later in the summer of 1998, Nick and Elizabeth coincidentally send their daughters to Camp Walden, a girls' [[sleep away camp]] in [[Maine]]. Annie and Hallie, who do not know each other, meet after a fencing match and take an immediate dislike to one another.\n\nAnnie and Hallie\u2019s dislike for each other grows and they begin to pull a series of pranks on each other. After a prank goes too far, the two are isolated together as punishment until camp is over. They ecstatically discover that they are twins and hatch a plan: for each girl to switch and meet the parent she has never met and reunite them. After a makeover, where Annie gets a haircut and pierces her ears, Hallie imitates Annie's British accent and flies to London to meet their mother, maternal grandfather Charles, and the James' butler, Martin.\n\nAnnie imitates Hallie's American accent, and flies to Napa Valley to meet their father, Hallie's nanny Chessy, and their dog Sammy. Eventually the plan unravels, as Charles catches Hallie sneaking out to a phone booth to call Annie in California, and gets her to confess that she is Hallie over a walk in the park. Soon after, Chessy is suspicious of \"Hallie's\" behavior, and Annie confirms her suspicions. After discovering that their father is engaged to the child-hating [[gold digger]] Meredith Blake, Annie and Hallie come clean and tell their parents they switched, it was part of their plot to reunite Elizabeth and Nick by falsely telling Elizabeth that Nick wants to meet her in [[San Francisco]]. Chessy, Martin, and Charles decide to help the girls' plan, and want to help them get their parents back together. Nick is shocked, but delighted to see Elizabeth for the first time in years, and to learn that he's had Annie in his care since the end of camp. Meanwhile, Chessy and Martin grow romantically attracted to each other.\n\nThe girls' pull out all the stops, including recreating the night their parents met, by having Charles pay to rent out a yacht for an evening, and having Chessy and Martin act as a waitress and [[sommelier]] respectively. However, they ultimately fail to rekindle Nick and Elizabeth's relationship. The twins resort to a last-ditch effort, by demanding a three-day family camping trip, refusing to reveal which twin is ''which'' until after they return; Elizabeth tricks Meredith into taking her place on the camping trip.\n\nAnnie and Hallie play a number of pranks on Meredith, who becomes enraged after waking up in the middle of the lake on her air mattress and gives Nick an ultimatum; choose either the girls or her. Nick, finally seeing Meredith for who she truly is, chooses the girls over Meredith much to her dismay, and as a result, she angrily breaks off the engagement. Being a responsible father, Nick punishes the girls for their mischief; however, he comments to Elizabeth that he will have to thank them one day.\n\nNick shows Elizabeth his wine collection, including the one from their wedding. Both realize they still have feelings for one another, but decide it is better to go their separate ways. Elizabeth and Annie later board a flight for London, but when they arrive, they find Nick and Hallie waiting for them (having taken a faster flight on the [[Concorde]]). Nick realizes his previous mistake of not going after Elizabeth when she left him and proposes to her. Elizabeth yields to Nick's unwavering confidence and tearfully accepts. Photos show Nick and Elizabeth getting remarried aboard the ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', with Annie and Hallie as bridesmaids, while Charles also presenting, and Martin proposing to Chessy.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Lindsay Lohan]] as Hallie Parker and Annie James, eleven-year-old twin sisters who were separated after birth.

He played more than 100&nbsp;league games for Bradford during five years in the first team. Colbeck nearly left Bradford in 2007 when he was made available for transfer and played six games on loan for [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. However, he returned following his loan spell and went on to win Bradford City's player of the season award during the [[Bradford City A.F.C. season 2007-08|2007\u201308]] campaign. He turned down a new deal a year later and joined [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on transfer deadline day in September 2009 to rejoin manager [[Dave Penney]], for whom he played at Darlington. When Penney was sacked after less than a year in charge, Colbeck also soon left and joined [[Hereford United]] before spending several years with [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and moving to [[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate Town]].\n\n==Career==\n===Bradford City===\nColbeck was born in [[Bradford]]<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/yorkshire-soccer/Home-comfort-a-boon-for.3762714.jp?articlepage=1\n|title=Home comfort a boon for Joe\n|date=10 February 2008\n|accessdate=6 December 2008\n|newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post\n|first=Leon\n|last=Wobschall}}</ref> and attended Pudsey Tyersal School.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/1730563.A_tale_of_two_Cities/ |title=A tale of two Cities |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=19 September 2010 |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus}}</ref> [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] youth team coach Jon Pepper brought him to the club in 2002,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/2268081.pepper_leaves_healthy_legacy/ |title=Pepper leaves healthy legacy |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=19 September 2010 |first=Simon |last=Parker}}</ref> and having rising through the junior ranks at City, Colbeck had barely featured for the reserves when he made his senior debut in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] defeat to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on 25 August 2004 at [[Valley Parade]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2004/8/26/97870.html\n|title=City quick to find exit\n|newspaper=Telegraph & Argus\n|date=26 August 2004\n|accessdate=20 January 2008}}</ref> It was his only first-team game during the season.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/squad_season.sd?seasonid=134&teamid=234\n|title=Bradford 2004/2005 player appearances\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|publisher=Soccerbase}}</ref> It was another 17&nbsp;months before his next appearance for City when he was a late substitute on 7 January 2006 in a 1\u20130 defeat to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2006/1/9/183943.html\n|title=Spireites cash in on comical City defending\n|date=9 January 2006\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|newspaper=Telegraph & Argus}}</ref> Colbeck broke into the team on a more regular basis and made 11&nbsp;appearances, including five starts, during the latter half of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306 season]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/squad_season.sd?seasonid=135&teamid=234\n|title=Bradford 2005/2006 player appearances\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|publisher=Soccerbase}}</ref> and was one of six junior players to earn a one-year contract at the [[Football League One|League One]] club.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/4858626.stm\n|title=Youngsters net professional deals\n|date=29 March 2006\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\nHis first full season in the first team was during [[Bradford City A.F.C. season 2006\u201307|2006\u201307]],<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1598433.0.league_two_bullies_dont_scare_colbeck.php\n|title=League Two bullies don't scare Colbeck\n|date=6 August 2007\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|newspaper=Telegraph & Argus\n|first=Simon\n|last=Parker}}</ref> although he was kept out of the team during the early part of the season by winger [[Jermaine Johnson]].

He played more than 100&nbsp;league games for Bradford during five years in the first team. Colbeck nearly left Bradford in 2007 when he was made available for transfer and played six games on loan for [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. However, he returned following his loan spell and went on to win Bradford City's player of the season award during the [[Bradford City A.F.C. season 2007-08|2007\u201308]] campaign. He turned down a new deal a year later and joined [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on transfer deadline day in September 2009 to rejoin manager [[Dave Penney]], for whom he played at Darlington. When Penney was sacked after less than a year in charge, Colbeck also soon left and joined [[Hereford United]] before spending several years with [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and moving to [[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate Town]].\n\n==Career==\n===Bradford City===\nColbeck was born in [[Bradford]]<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/yorkshire-soccer/Home-comfort-a-boon-for.3762714.jp?articlepage=1\n|title=Home comfort a boon for Joe\n|date=10 February 2008\n|accessdate=6 December 2008\n|newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post\n|first=Leon\n|last=Wobschall}}</ref> and attended Pudsey Tyersal School.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/1730563.A_tale_of_two_Cities/ |title=A tale of two Cities |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=19 September 2010 |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus}}</ref> [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] youth team coach Jon Pepper brought him to the club in 2002,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/2268081.pepper_leaves_healthy_legacy/ |title=Pepper leaves healthy legacy |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=19 September 2010 |first=Simon |last=Parker}}</ref> and having rising through the junior ranks at City, Colbeck had barely featured for the reserves when he made his senior debut in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] defeat to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on 25 August 2004 at [[Valley Parade]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2004/8/26/97870.html\n|title=City quick to find exit\n|newspaper=Telegraph & Argus\n|date=26 August 2004\n|accessdate=20 January 2008}}</ref> It was his only first-team game during the season.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/squad_season.sd?seasonid=134&teamid=234\n|title=Bradford 2004/2005 player appearances\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|publisher=Soccerbase}}</ref> It was another 17&nbsp;months before his next appearance for City when he was a late substitute on 7 January 2006 in a 1\u20130 defeat to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2006/1/9/183943.html\n|title=Spireites cash in on comical City defending\n|date=9 January 2006\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|newspaper=Telegraph & Argus}}</ref> Colbeck broke into the team on a more regular basis and made 11&nbsp;appearances, including five starts, during the latter half of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306 season]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/squad_season.sd?seasonid=135&teamid=234\n|title=Bradford 2005/2006 player appearances\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|publisher=Soccerbase}}</ref> and was one of six junior players to earn a one-year contract at the [[Football League One|League One]] club.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/4858626.stm\n|title=Youngsters net professional deals\n|date=29 March 2006\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\nHis first full season in the first team was during [[Bradford City A.F.C. season 2006\u201307|2006\u201307]],<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1598433.0.league_two_bullies_dont_scare_colbeck.php\n|title=League Two bullies don't scare Colbeck\n|date=6 August 2007\n|accessdate=20 April 2008\n|newspaper=Telegraph & Argus\n|first=Simon\n|last=Parker}}</ref> although he was kept out of the team during the early part of the season by winger [[Jermaine Johnson]].
