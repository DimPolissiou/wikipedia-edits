There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The [[housing tenure]] of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale [[public housing]], to [[owner occupancy]] within what is legally a [[condominium]] ([[strata title]] or [[commonhold]]), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see [[leasehold estate]]).\n\n==Terminology==\n===\"Flat\" vs \"apartment\"===\nBoth words refer to a self-contained residential unit with its own front door, kitchen, toilet, and [[bathroom]]. In some parts of the world, the word ''apartment'' refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word ''flat'' means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In other places the terms are interchangeable.\n\nThe term ''apartment'' is favored in North America (although in some cities ''flat'' is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/apartment|title=Apartment {{!}} Meaning of Apartment by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}). In the UK, the term  ''apartment'' is more usual in professional [[real estate]] and [[architectural]] circles where otherwise the term ''flat'' is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment).\n\nIn some countries, the word \"[[Unit (housing)|unit]]\" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business [[Suite (address)|suite]]s. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., \"This building has three units\" or \"I'm going to rent a unit in this building\", but not \"I'm going to rent a unit somewhere\".\n\nSome buildings can be characterized as 'mixed-use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.\n\n===By housing tenure===\n[[File:St James Town1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Low-income housing]] of the [[St. James Town]] neighborhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]\n[[File:Cove, Punggol Field.JPG|thumb|right|[[Housing Development Board]] flats in [[Punggol]], [[Singapore]] ]]\n\n([[Condominium]], [[public housing]], [[owner-occupancy]], etc.)\n\n[[Tenement (law)|Tenement law]] refers to the [[feudalism|feudal]] basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in \"[[Messuage]] or Tenement\" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.\n\nIn the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a [[housing cooperative]], in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a [[condominium]], whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older [[house]]s are sometimes divided into apartments. The word ''apartment'' denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.\n\nIn England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease.  This arrangement is commonly known as a \"share of freehold\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.<ref>{{cite web| title=Long Leases (Scotland) Act 2012| website=UK Legislation| date=2012| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/9/contents/enacted | accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===By size of the unit===\nBachelor apartment, one-[[bedroom]], etc.; see below.\n\n===By size of the building===\n[[File:English Bay Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-rise building]]s in the [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] area of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada]]\n[[File:Fatima 0549 (19531851070).jpg|thumb|left|A [[low-rise building]] of flats above shops in [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal]]]]\n\nApartment buildings are [[multi-story]] buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment complex'', ''flat complex'', ''block of flats'', ''tower block'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally, ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a ''residential tower'', ''apartment tower'', or ''block of flats'' in Australia.\n\nA [[high-rise building]] is defined by its height differently in various [[jurisdiction]]s. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a [[skyscraper]], although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper|title=skyscraper|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their [[structural system]] usually is made of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]].\n\nA [[low-rise building]] and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. [[Emporis]] defines a low-rise as \"an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&lng=3&esn=49213 |title=Data Standards: Structures - low-rise building |publisher=Emporis Standards |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The city of [[Toronto]] defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.<ref>http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid-rise%20study.pdf</ref>\n\n===By country===\nIn [[American English]], the distinction between rental apartments and [[condominium]]s is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] building (or \"co-op\"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.\n\nIn [[British English]] the usual word is \"flat\", but ''apartment'' is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as [[Belgravia]] and [[Hampstead]]. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a ''[[tenement]]'', a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.\n\nIn India, the word flat is used to refer to multi-storey dwellings that have lifts.<ref>[https://www.magicbricks.com/flats-in-new-delhi-for-sale-pppfs]</ref>\n\n[[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] traditionally used the term ''flat'' (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms ''unit'' or ''apartment''. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even [[semi-detached]] houses. In Australia, the terms \"unit\", \"flat\" and \"apartment\" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as \"apartments\", as the term \"flats\" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.\n\nIn [[South African English]], an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building.\n\nIn [[Malaysian English]], ''flat'' often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,<ref>[https://www.propsocial.my/topic/226/categories-of-homes-in-malaysia-posted-by-propsocial-editor?all=1 Categories of Homes in Malaysia.]</ref> while ''apartment'' is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.\n\nIn Japanese English [[loanword]]s (''[[Wasei-eigo]]''), the term ''apartment'' (''apaato'') is used for lower-income housing and ''mansion'' (''manshon'') is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment (or condominium) and not the level of luxury of a [[mansion]] in English parlance. See [[Housing in Japan]]. ''[[Danchi]]'' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as [[public housing]] by government authorities.\n\n==Types and characteristics==\n===Studio apartment===\n[[File:Cuisinette studio in Sherbrooke April 2010.jpg|thumb|Studio apartment in [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]], Canada, showing double bed, kitchenette, and entrance way with sliding door to closet]]\n{{Main|Studio apartment}}\n{{See also|Microapartment}}\nThe smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term \"one room\" (''wonroom'') refers to a studio apartment.<ref>{{cite web | title='Konglish' Not Spoken Here: Asia Society Korea Center Targets Signs and Schoolbooks | website=Asia Society | date=11 October 2012  | url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/konglish-not-spoken-here-asia-society-korea-center-targets-signs-and-schoolbooks | accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nA [[bedsit]] is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed-sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom. A bedsit is not self-contained and so is not an apartment or flat as this article uses the terms; it forms part of what the UK government calls a [[House in multiple occupation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Private renting: Houses in multiple occupation - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Garden apartment (US)===\n[[Merriam-Webster]] defines a garden apartment in [[American English]] as \"a multiple-unit low-rise dwelling having considerable lawn or garden space\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Garden apartment |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garden%20apartment |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> The apartment buildings are often arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a [[townhouse]]: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack [[elevator]]s. However, the first \"garden apartment\" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/garden_apartments/ New York City Garden Apartments] retrieved 17 October 2009</ref><ref>Hogan, Meghan.

The interior grounds are often landscaped.\n\n===Garden flat (UK)===\n[[File:Streets of Bayswater.jpg|thumb|[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraced [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]]. The black railings enclose the basement areas, which in the twentieth century were converted to garden flats.]]\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the use of \"garden flat\" in [[British English]] as \"a basement or ground-floor flat with a view of and access to a garden or lawn\", although its citations acknowledge that the reference to a garden may be illusory. \"Garden flat\" can serve simply as a euphemism for a basement. The large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|Georgian or Victorian townhouse]] was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as [[Area (architecture)|an area]], often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a \"tradesman's entrance\" via the area stairs. This \"lower ground floor\" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained \"garden flat\". One American term for this arrangement is an [[English basement]].\n\n===Basement apartment===\n{{Main|Basement apartment}}\nGenerally on the lowest floor of a building.\n\n===Secondary suite===\n{{Main|Secondary suite}}\nWhen part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an \"in-law apartment\", \"annexe\", or \"granny flat\", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore \"basement suites\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Another term is an \"accessory dwelling unit\", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.\n\n===Salon apartment===\n''Salon apartment'' is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in [[Belgrade]] and in certain towns in [[Yugoslavia]] in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>Alfirevi\u0107 \u0110or\u0111e, Simonovi\u0107 Alfirevi\u0107 San\u0458a.

This is a very common arrangement in much post-War British public housing, serving both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the 'traditional' two-storey terrace house to which many of the residents would have been accustomed.\n\nA maisonette could encompass [[Tyneside flat]]s, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey [[terraced house|terrace]]. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat.<ref name=\"Housing in Gateshead\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Housing in Gateshead\n  |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/housing/Leaflets/display_boards.pdf\n  |publisher=Gateshead Council\n  |year=2006\n}}</ref> \"Maisonette\" could also stretch to [[cottage flat]]s, also known as 'Four-in-a-block flats', a style of housing common in Scotland.\n\n===One dwelling with two storeys===\n[[File:ScissorFlat.jpg|thumb|Plan of scissor flats.]]\nThe vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence \"flat\". Some, however, have two storeys, joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for this is \"maisonette\", as above. Some [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] was designed as [[scissor section flat]]s. On a grander level, [[penthouse apartment|penthouses]] may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury.\n\nTwo storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as \"[[townhouse]]s\".\n\n===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===\n[[File:CambridgeTripleDecker.jpg|thumb|A triple-decker in New England.]]\n[[File:Dingbat MaryJane.jpg|thumb|left|Dingbat MaryJane]]\n\n\"[[Duplex (building)|Duplex]]\" refers to two separate units with a [[party wall|common demising wall]] or floor-ceiling assembly.\n\nDuplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate - referred to as '[[Duplex (building)|duplex]]' indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story. The term duplex is largely unknown in the UK; there, buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are known as ''semi-detached'' or just ''a semi'' (the i pronounced \"ee\" not \"eye\"), but the dwellings are usually two storeys (excluding any use of the roof space). This form of construction is very common, and built as such rather than a later conversion.\n\nIn the United States, regional forms have developed, see [[vernacular architecture]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], a [[Polish flat]] or \"raised cottage\" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Sally |editor-last=McMurray |title=People, Power, Places|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=9781572330757|page=40|edition=1st}}</ref> In the [[Sun Belt]], boxy small apartment buildings called [[Dingbat (building)|dingbats]], often with [[carport]]s below, sprang up from the 1950s.\n\nGroups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See [[Three-decker (house)]]. Again, the term triplex is virtually unknown in the UK.\n\n===Loft apartment===\n[[File:400SGreenLoft.jpg|thumb|The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago]]\n{{Main|Loft#Loft_apartment}}\nThis type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people [[squatting]].\n\nThese loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAn industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a ''[[loft]]'', although some modern lofts are built by design.\n\n===Penthouse===\n{{Main|Penthouse apartment}}\nAn apartment located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Communal apartment===\n{{Main|Communal apartment}}\nIn [[Russia]], a communal apartment (\u00ab\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u00bb) is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naherholung gleich ums Eck|url=http://www.terrafinanz.de/brenner-park-sendling|publisher=terrafinanz.de|accessdate=17 June 2013|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Serviced apartment===\n[[File:PAJASA Service Apartment Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India]]\n{{Main|Serviced apartment}}\n{{See also|Apartment hotel|Corporate housing}}\nA \"serviced apartment\" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a [[hotel]]. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a \"lock-up and leave\" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Facilities===\n[[File:Laundry Room.jpg|thumb|Laundry Room]]\nApartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with their own furniture. [[Serviced apartment]]s, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensils]], and [[maid service]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[Laundry#Shared_laundry_rooms|Laundry facilities]] may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental [[Rental agreement|lease]]s often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of [[Letter box|mailbox]]es are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the [[mail carrier]]. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Various===\n[[File:One-by-five Apartments Austin, TX.jpg|thumb|Mid-rise [[One-plus-five]] style apartment buildings in [[Austin, Texas]].]]\nIn more urban areas, apartments close to the [[downtown]] area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or [[public transportation]]. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas.\n\nMoving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments. (Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.)\n\nSmall apartments often have only one entrance.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn many American cities, the [[One-plus-five]] style of mid-rise, wood-framed apartments have gained significant popularity following a 2009 revision to the [[International Building Code]]; these buildings typically feature four wood-framed floors above a concrete podium and are popular with developers due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs.<ref name=\"Curbed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/12/4/18125536/real-estate-modern-apartment-architecture |title=Why do all new apartment buildings look the same? |author=Sissom, Patrick |work=Curbed |date=4 December 2018 |accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Historical examples==\n\n===Pre-Columbian Americas===\nThe [[Puebloan peoples]] of what is now the Southwestern United States have constructed large, multi-room dwellings, some comprising more than 900 rooms, since the 10th century.\n\nIn the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] [[Mesoamerica]]n city of [[Teotihuacan]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jarus|first1=Owen|title=Teotihuacan: Ancient City of Pyramids|url=http://www.livescience.com/22545-teotihuacan.html|website=Livescience|publisher=Livescience|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> apartments were not only the standard means of housing the city's population of over 200,000 inhabitants, but show a remarkably even wealth distribution for the entire city, even by contemporary standards.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Living the good life in Teotihuacan|url=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html|accessdate=19 March 2016|ref=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html}}</ref> Furthermore, the apartments were inhabited by the general populace as a whole,<ref>{{cite web|title=Teotihuacan|url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Teotihuacan.htm|website=Mexican History|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> in contrast to other Pre-Modern socieites, where apartments were limited to housing the lower class members of the society, as with the somewhat contemporary Roman [[insulae]].\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:OstianInsula.JPG|thumb|Remains of an Ancient Roman apartment block from the early 2nd century AD in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]]]\nIn [[ancient Rome]], the [[insulae]] (singular ''insula'') were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (the [[plebs]]) dwelled.

Many others were built as [[council flat]]s. Many [[Tower blocks in Great Britain|tower blocks]] were built after the [[Second World War]]. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or [[housing estate]]s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a \"flat above a shop\" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house\u2014even if this was a small [[terraced house]]\u2014while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a {{Lang|fr|[[pied-\u00e0-terre]]}} in the capital. The traditional [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|London town house]] was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.\n\nThe first mansion flats in England were:\n*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and [[James Thomas Knowles (1831\u20131908)|James Knowles]] designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate \"houses\", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]], whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing. Philip Flower's son, [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea]], developed most of the mansion blocks on [[Prince of Wales Drive, London]].\n*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Victorian tenement at Boroughmuirhead, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Tenement]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1893)]]\n[[File:Tenementedin.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882]]\nIn [[Scotland]], the term \"[[tenement]]\" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older [[retirees]], and by [[absentee landlords]], often for rental to students after they leave [[dorm|halls of residence]] managed by their institution. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] [[Tenement House (Glasgow)]] is a [[historic house museum]] offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago.\n\nDuring the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in [[Scotland]]'s industrial cities, although they were very common in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour \"[[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]]\" [[terraced house|terrace]]s of [[brick]].) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a ''close'' or ''stair''\u2014both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in [[Aberdeen]] in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the \"back green\" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or \"factor\".\n\nIn [[Glasgow]], where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large [[extended families]] would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The [[Glasgow Corporation]] made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the [[Cleland Testimonial]] were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following [[World War I]] when Housing Acts sought to provide \"homes fit for heroes\". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as [[Knightswood]], were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a [[slum clearance]] programme initiated to clear areas such as the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] and the [[Garngad]].\n\nAfter [[Second World War|World War II]], more ambitious plans, known as the [[Bruce Plan]], were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns.]]<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Williamson, E., Riches, A. & Higgs, M. ''The Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow''.

These housing estates, known as \"schemes\", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as [[Castlemilk]], were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and [[public houses]] (\"deserts with windows\", as [[Billy Connolly]] once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition\u2014the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable\u2014but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.\n\nIn 1970 a team from [[Strathclyde University]] demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the ''Old Swan Corner'', [[Pollokshaws]]. Thereafter, ''Housing Action Areas'' were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in \"stone cleaning\", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed \"grey\" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm Glasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975]</ref> and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.<!-- <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> --> The [[Glasgow Housing Association]] took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180936/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building] Wednesday 31 May 2006.</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:NewtonMA TheChestnutHill.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Chestnut Hill]], an 1899 apartment house in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]\n[[File:East 57th St Apartments.jpg|thumb|right|Apartment buildings lining the residential stretch of East 57th Street between First Avenue and Sutton Place in New York]]\n[[File:LowerEastSideTenements.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tenement]] buildings in [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side]]\n\nIn 1839, the first New York City [[tenement]] was built, and soon became breeding grounds for [[outlaw]]s, [[juvenile delinquent]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their [[price gouging]] rent. ''How the Other Half Lives'' notes one tenement district:\n\n<blockquote>Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. \"Old Dan\" made a big fortune--he told me once four hundred thousand dollars-- out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|Board of Health]] at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. \"I have made my will,\" he said. \"My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand.\" In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives : studies among the tenements of New York|date=1890|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=9111562986| pages=31\u201332|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/howotherhalflive00riis_1|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany campaigners, such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Jacob Riis]], pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the [[New York State Tenement House Act]] was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[Housing Act of 1949]] to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.\n\n[[The Dakota]] (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.\n\nSome significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s.  Among them were groundbreaking designs in the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] (1951), [[New Century Guild]] (1961), [[Marina City]] (1964) and [[Lake Point Tower]] (1968).\n\nIn the United States, \"tenement\" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are \"walk-ups\" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term \"[[Dingbat (building)|dingbat]]\" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky fa\u00e7ades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.\n\n====Property classes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help [[investor]]s and [[real estate brokers]] speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows:\n\n''Class A'' properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. [[White-collar worker]]s live in them and are usually renters by choice.\n\n''Class B'' properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white- and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity.\n\n''Class C'' properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters \"for life\". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises.\n\n''Class D'' properties house many [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas.\n\n===Canada===\nApartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as [[condominium]]s instead of apartments\u2014both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Sissi |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/the-latest-threat-to-the-condo-market-apartment-buildings-rise-again/ |title=The latest threat to the condo market: apartment buildings rise again |work=Canadian Business |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=DiGianfelice |first=Lorenzo |url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/gta-cap-rate-hits-new-benchmark-low/ |title=GTA cap rate hits new benchmark low |work=Canadian Apartment Magazine |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Q1 Q Deck day.JPG|thumb|The skyline of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] is dominated by apartments.]]\n[[File:Canterbury flats st kilda.jpg|thumb|right|The Canterbury in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia.]]\n[[File:(1)One Central Park.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], Sydney, which features vertical [[Hanging garden (cultivation)|hanging gardens]] and sustainable [[green design]]]]\n\nApartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a [[body corporate]] or \"owners corporation\" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through [[strata title]]. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply [[loan to value]] ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the [[Big four banks|big four Australian banks]] will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres. These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4{{Spaces|fig=}}m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.\n\nIn Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for [[DINKY]], [[yuppie]]s, [[university student]]s and more recently [[empty nester]]s, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers.\n\nAustralia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. [[Terrace houses]] were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the [[Parliament of Queensland]] as part of the [[Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885]].\n\nThe earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] as the response to fast rising land values\u2013both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in [[Potts Point]], and The Canterbury Flats in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. [[Melbourne Mansions]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914\u2014the oldest surviving buildings contained flats).<ref>{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Richard |url=http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf |title=The Canterbury (Flats) - 236 Canterbury Road, St Kilda West |work=A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and Their People |publisher=St Kilda Historical Society |date=2005 |access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |title=High Rise has a past too |publisher=Heritage.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=25 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628220428/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |archive-date=28 June 2002 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and [[South Yarra]]), Sydney (particularly in areas such as [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghust]] and [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]) and in Brisbane (in areas such as [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]).\n\nPost-[[World War II]], with the [[Australian Dream]] apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups.\n\nThe main exceptions were Sydney and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views ([[Sydney Harbour]] and beaches such as [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]]) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.\n\nIn other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to [[public housing]]. [[Public housing in Australia]] was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]]) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] and [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio-economic areas like [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].\n\nIn the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in [[Brisbane]] (along the [[Brisbane River]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]).\n\nIn Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the [[gentrification]] of the inner city, a fashion became New York \"loft\" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of [[adaptive reuse]] extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as [[Teneriffe, Queensland]] and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies ([[Postcode 3000]]), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning policy. [[Urban renewal]] areas like [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Port Melbourne]] are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.\n\nDespite their size, other smaller cities including [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Townsville]], [[Cairns]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Geelong]] have begun building apartments in the 2000s.\n\nToday, residential buildings [[Eureka Tower]] and [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in [[inner city]] areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs.\n\nSome Australian cities, such as [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nThe development of residential architecture in [[Yugoslavia]] during the period of [[socialism]] had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to \"pack\" as many [[residential]] units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living.<ref>Lojanica, V., Risti\u0107, J., Me\u0111o, V.

There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The [[housing tenure]] of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale [[public housing]], to [[owner occupancy]] within what is legally a [[condominium]] ([[strata title]] or [[commonhold]]), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see [[leasehold estate]]).\n\n==Terminology==\n===\"Flat\" vs \"apartment\"===\nBoth words refer to hi a self-contained residential unit with its own front door, kitchen, toilet, and [[bathroom]]. In some parts of the world, the word ''apartment'' refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word ''flat'' means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In other places the terms are interchangeable.\n\nThe term ''apartment'' is favored in North America (although in some cities ''flat'' is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/apartment|title=Apartment {{!}} Meaning of Apartment by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}). In the UK, the term  ''apartment'' is more usual in professional [[real estate]] and [[architectural]] circles where otherwise the term ''flat'' is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment).\n\nIn some countries, the word \"[[Unit (housing)|unit]]\" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business [[Suite (address)|suite]]s. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., \"This building has three units\" or \"I'm going to rent a unit in this building\", but not \"I'm going to rent a unit somewhere\".\n\nSome buildings can be characterized as 'mixed-use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.\n\n===By housing tenure===\n[[File:St James Town1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Low-income housing]] of the [[St. James Town]] neighborhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]\n[[File:Cove, Punggol Field.JPG|thumb|right|[[Housing Development Board]] flats in [[Punggol]], [[Singapore]] ]]\n\n([[Condominium]], [[public housing]], [[owner-occupancy]], etc.)\n\n[[Tenement (law)|Tenement law]] refers to the [[feudalism|feudal]] basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in \"[[Messuage]] or Tenement\" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.\n\nIn the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a [[housing cooperative]], in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a [[condominium]], whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older [[house]]s are sometimes divided into apartments. The word ''apartment'' denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.\n\nIn England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease.  This arrangement is commonly known as a \"share of freehold\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.<ref>{{cite web| title=Long Leases (Scotland) Act 2012| website=UK Legislation| date=2012| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/9/contents/enacted | accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===By size of the unit===\nBachelor apartment, one-[[bedroom]], etc.; see below.\n\n===By size of the building===\n[[File:English Bay Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-rise building]]s in the [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] area of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada]]\n[[File:Fatima 0549 (19531851070).jpg|thumb|left|A [[low-rise building]] of flats above shops in [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal]]]]\n\nApartment buildings are [[multi-story]] buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment complex'', ''flat complex'', ''block of flats'', ''tower block'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally, ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a ''residential tower'', ''apartment tower'', or ''block of flats'' in Australia.\n\nA [[high-rise building]] is defined by its height differently in various [[jurisdiction]]s. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a [[skyscraper]], although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper|title=skyscraper|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their [[structural system]] usually is made of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]].\n\nA [[low-rise building]] and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. [[Emporis]] defines a low-rise as \"an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&lng=3&esn=49213 |title=Data Standards: Structures - low-rise building |publisher=Emporis Standards |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The city of [[Toronto]] defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.<ref>http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid-rise%20study.pdf</ref>\n\n===By country===\nIn [[American English]], the distinction between rental apartments and [[condominium]]s is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] building (or \"co-op\"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.\n\nIn [[British English]] the usual word is \"flat\", but ''apartment'' is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as [[Belgravia]] and [[Hampstead]]. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a ''[[tenement]]'', a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.\n\nIn India, the word flat is used to refer to multi-storey dwellings that have lifts.<ref>[https://www.magicbricks.com/flats-in-new-delhi-for-sale-pppfs]</ref>\n\n[[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] traditionally used the term ''flat'' (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms ''unit'' or ''apartment''. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even [[semi-detached]] houses. In Australia, the terms \"unit\", \"flat\" and \"apartment\" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as \"apartments\", as the term \"flats\" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.\n\nIn [[South African English]], an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building.\n\nIn [[Malaysian English]], ''flat'' often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,<ref>[https://www.propsocial.my/topic/226/categories-of-homes-in-malaysia-posted-by-propsocial-editor?all=1 Categories of Homes in Malaysia.]</ref> while ''apartment'' is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.\n\nIn Japanese English [[loanword]]s (''[[Wasei-eigo]]''), the term ''apartment'' (''apaato'') is used for lower-income housing and ''mansion'' (''manshon'') is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment (or condominium) and not the level of luxury of a [[mansion]] in English parlance. See [[Housing in Japan]]. ''[[Danchi]]'' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as [[public housing]] by government authorities.\n\n==Types and characteristics==\n===Studio apartment===\n[[File:Cuisinette studio in Sherbrooke April 2010.jpg|thumb|Studio apartment in [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]], Canada, showing double bed, kitchenette, and entrance way with sliding door to closet]]\n{{Main|Studio apartment}}\n{{See also|Microapartment}}\nThe smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term \"one room\" (''wonroom'') refers to a studio apartment.<ref>{{cite web | title='Konglish' Not Spoken Here: Asia Society Korea Center Targets Signs and Schoolbooks | website=Asia Society | date=11 October 2012  | url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/konglish-not-spoken-here-asia-society-korea-center-targets-signs-and-schoolbooks | accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nA [[bedsit]] is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed-sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom. A bedsit is not self-contained and so is not an apartment or flat as this article uses the terms; it forms part of what the UK government calls a [[House in multiple occupation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Private renting: Houses in multiple occupation - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Garden apartment (US)===\n[[Merriam-Webster]] defines a garden apartment in [[American English]] as \"a multiple-unit low-rise dwelling having considerable lawn or garden space\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Garden apartment |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garden%20apartment |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> The apartment buildings are often arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a [[townhouse]]: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack [[elevator]]s. However, the first \"garden apartment\" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/garden_apartments/ New York City Garden Apartments] retrieved 17 October 2009</ref><ref>Hogan, Meghan.

The interior grounds are often landscaped.\n\n===Garden flat (UK)===\n[[File:Streets of Bayswater.jpg|thumb|[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraced [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]]. The black railings enclose the basement areas, which in the twentieth century were converted to garden flats.]]\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the use of \"garden flat\" in [[British English]] as \"a basement or ground-floor flat with a view of and access to a garden or lawn\", although its citations acknowledge that the reference to a garden may be illusory. \"Garden flat\" can serve simply as a euphemism for a basement. The large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|Georgian or Victorian townhouse]] was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as [[Area (architecture)|an area]], often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a \"tradesman's entrance\" via the area stairs. This \"lower ground floor\" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained \"garden flat\". One American term for this arrangement is an [[English basement]].\n\n===Basement apartment===\n{{Main|Basement apartment}}\nGenerally on the lowest floor of a building.\n\n===Secondary suite===\n{{Main|Secondary suite}}\nWhen part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an \"in-law apartment\", \"annexe\", or \"granny flat\", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore \"basement suites\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Another term is an \"accessory dwelling unit\", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.\n\n===Salon apartment===\n''Salon apartment'' is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in [[Belgrade]] and in certain towns in [[Yugoslavia]] in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>Alfirevi\u0107 \u0110or\u0111e, Simonovi\u0107 Alfirevi\u0107 San\u0458a.

Most of these apartments were built in Belgrade ([[Serbia]]), along with the first examples of apartments popularly named 'salon apartments', with the concept of spatial and functional organization later spreading to other larger urban centers in Yugoslavia.<ref>Kekovi\u0107, A., Petrovi\u0107, M.

This is a very common arrangement in much post-War British public housing, serving both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the 'traditional' two-storey terrace house to which many of the residents would have been accustomed.\n\nA maisonette could encompass [[Tyneside flat]]s, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey [[terraced house|terrace]]. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat.<ref name=\"Housing in Gateshead\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Housing in Gateshead\n  |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/housing/Leaflets/display_boards.pdf\n  |publisher=Gateshead Council\n  |year=2006\n}}</ref> \"Maisonette\" could also stretch to [[cottage flat]]s, also known as 'Four-in-a-block flats', a style of housing common in Scotland.\n\n===One dwelling with two storeys===\n[[File:ScissorFlat.jpg|thumb|Plan of scissor flats.]]\nThe vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence \"flat\". Some, however, have two storeys, joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for this is \"maisonette\", as above. Some [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] was designed as [[scissor section flat]]s. On a grander level, [[penthouse apartment|penthouses]] may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury.\n\nTwo storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as \"[[townhouse]]s\".\n\n===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===\n[[File:CambridgeTripleDecker.jpg|thumb|A triple-decker in New England.]]\n[[File:Dingbat MaryJane.jpg|thumb|left|Dingbat MaryJane]]\n\n\"[[Duplex (building)|Duplex]]\" refers to two separate units with a [[party wall|common demising wall]] or floor-ceiling assembly.\n\nDuplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate - referred to as '[[Duplex (building)|duplex]]' indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story. The term duplex is largely unknown in the UK; there, buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are known as ''semi-detached'' or just ''a semi'' (the i pronounced \"ee\" not \"eye\"), but the dwellings are usually two storeys (excluding any use of the roof space). This form of construction is very common, and built as such rather than a later conversion.\n\nIn the United States, regional forms have developed, see [[vernacular architecture]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], a [[Polish flat]] or \"raised cottage\" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Sally |editor-last=McMurray |title=People, Power, Places|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=9781572330757|page=40|edition=1st}}</ref> In the [[Sun Belt]], boxy small apartment buildings called [[Dingbat (building)|dingbats]], often with [[carport]]s below, sprang up from the 1950s.\n\nGroups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See [[Three-decker (house)]]. Again, the term triplex is virtually unknown in the UK.\n\n===Loft apartment===\n[[File:400SGreenLoft.jpg|thumb|The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago]]\n{{Main|Loft#Loft_apartment}}\nThis type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people [[squatting]].\n\nThese loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAn industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a ''[[loft]]'', although some modern lofts are built by design.\n\n===Penthouse===\n{{Main|Penthouse apartment}}\nAn apartment located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Communal apartment===\n{{Main|Communal apartment}}\nIn [[Russia]], a communal apartment (\u00ab\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u00bb) is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naherholung gleich ums Eck|url=http://www.terrafinanz.de/brenner-park-sendling|publisher=terrafinanz.de|accessdate=17 June 2013|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Serviced apartment===\n[[File:PAJASA Service Apartment Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India]]\n{{Main|Serviced apartment}}\n{{See also|Apartment hotel|Corporate housing}}\nA \"serviced apartment\" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a [[hotel]]. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a \"lock-up and leave\" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Facilities===\n[[File:Laundry Room.jpg|thumb|Laundry Room]]\nApartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with their own furniture. [[Serviced apartment]]s, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensils]], and [[maid service]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[Laundry#Shared_laundry_rooms|Laundry facilities]] may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental [[Rental agreement|lease]]s often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of [[Letter box|mailbox]]es are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the [[mail carrier]]. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Various===\n[[File:One-by-five Apartments Austin, TX.jpg|thumb|Mid-rise [[One-plus-five]] style apartment buildings in [[Austin, Texas]].]]\nIn more urban areas, apartments close to the [[downtown]] area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or [[public transportation]]. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas.\n\nMoving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments.

Many others were built as [[council flat]]s. Many [[Tower blocks in Great Britain|tower blocks]] were built after the [[Second World War]]. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or [[housing estate]]s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a \"flat above a shop\" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house\u2014even if this was a small [[terraced house]]\u2014while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a {{Lang|fr|[[pied-\u00e0-terre]]}} in the capital. The traditional [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|London town house]] was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.\n\nThe first mansion flats in England were:\n*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and [[James Thomas Knowles (1831\u20131908)|James Knowles]] designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate \"houses\", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]], whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing. Philip Flower's son, [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea]], developed most of the mansion blocks on [[Prince of Wales Drive, London]].\n*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Victorian tenement at Boroughmuirhead, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Tenement]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1893)]]\n[[File:Tenementedin.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882]]\nIn [[Scotland]], the term \"[[tenement]]\" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older [[retirees]], and by [[absentee landlords]], often for rental to students after they leave [[dorm|halls of residence]] managed by their institution. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] [[Tenement House (Glasgow)]] is a [[historic house museum]] offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago.\n\nDuring the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in [[Scotland]]'s industrial cities, although they were very common in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour \"[[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]]\" [[terraced house|terrace]]s of [[brick]].) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a ''close'' or ''stair''\u2014both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in [[Aberdeen]] in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the \"back green\" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or \"factor\".\n\nIn [[Glasgow]], where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large [[extended families]] would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The [[Glasgow Corporation]] made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the [[Cleland Testimonial]] were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following [[World War I]] when Housing Acts sought to provide \"homes fit for heroes\". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as [[Knightswood]], were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a [[slum clearance]] programme initiated to clear areas such as the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] and the [[Garngad]].\n\nAfter [[Second World War|World War II]], more ambitious plans, known as the [[Bruce Plan]], were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns.]]<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Williamson, E., Riches, A. & Higgs, M. ''The Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow''.

These housing estates, known as \"schemes\", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as [[Castlemilk]], were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and [[public houses]] (\"deserts with windows\", as [[Billy Connolly]] once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition\u2014the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable\u2014but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.\n\nIn 1970 a team from [[Strathclyde University]] demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the ''Old Swan Corner'', [[Pollokshaws]]. Thereafter, ''Housing Action Areas'' were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in \"stone cleaning\", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed \"grey\" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm Glasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975]</ref> and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.<!-- <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> --> The [[Glasgow Housing Association]] took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180936/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building] Wednesday 31 May 2006.</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:NewtonMA TheChestnutHill.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Chestnut Hill]], an 1899 apartment house in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]\n[[File:East 57th St Apartments.jpg|thumb|right|Apartment buildings lining the residential stretch of East 57th Street between First Avenue and Sutton Place in New York]]\n[[File:LowerEastSideTenements.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tenement]] buildings in [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side]]\n\nIn 1839, the first New York City [[tenement]] was built, and soon became breeding grounds for [[outlaw]]s, [[juvenile delinquent]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their [[price gouging]] rent. ''How the Other Half Lives'' notes one tenement district:\n\n<blockquote>Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. \"Old Dan\" made a big fortune--he told me once four hundred thousand dollars-- out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|Board of Health]] at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. \"I have made my will,\" he said. \"My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand.\" In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives : studies among the tenements of New York|date=1890|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=9111562986| pages=31\u201332|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/howotherhalflive00riis_1|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany campaigners, such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Jacob Riis]], pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the [[New York State Tenement House Act]] was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[Housing Act of 1949]] to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.\n\n[[The Dakota]] (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.\n\nSome significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s.  Among them were groundbreaking designs in the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] (1951), [[New Century Guild]] (1961), [[Marina City]] (1964) and [[Lake Point Tower]] (1968).\n\nIn the United States, \"tenement\" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are \"walk-ups\" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term \"[[Dingbat (building)|dingbat]]\" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky fa\u00e7ades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.\n\n====Property classes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help [[investor]]s and [[real estate brokers]] speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows:\n\n''Class A'' properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. [[White-collar worker]]s live in them and are usually renters by choice.\n\n''Class B'' properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white- and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity.\n\n''Class C'' properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters \"for life\". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises.\n\n''Class D'' properties house many [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas.\n\n===Canada===\nApartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as [[condominium]]s instead of apartments\u2014both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Sissi |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/the-latest-threat-to-the-condo-market-apartment-buildings-rise-again/ |title=The latest threat to the condo market: apartment buildings rise again |work=Canadian Business |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=DiGianfelice |first=Lorenzo |url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/gta-cap-rate-hits-new-benchmark-low/ |title=GTA cap rate hits new benchmark low |work=Canadian Apartment Magazine |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Q1 Q Deck day.JPG|thumb|The skyline of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] is dominated by apartments.]]\n[[File:Canterbury flats st kilda.jpg|thumb|right|The Canterbury in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia.]]\n[[File:(1)One Central Park.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], Sydney, which features vertical [[Hanging garden (cultivation)|hanging gardens]] and sustainable [[green design]]]]\n\nApartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a [[body corporate]] or \"owners corporation\" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through [[strata title]]. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply [[loan to value]] ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the [[Big four banks|big four Australian banks]] will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres. These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4{{Spaces|fig=}}m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.\n\nIn Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for [[DINKY]], [[yuppie]]s, [[university student]]s and more recently [[empty nester]]s, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers.\n\nAustralia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. [[Terrace houses]] were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the [[Parliament of Queensland]] as part of the [[Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885]].\n\nThe earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] as the response to fast rising land values\u2013both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in [[Potts Point]], and The Canterbury Flats in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. [[Melbourne Mansions]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914\u2014the oldest surviving buildings contained flats).<ref>{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Richard |url=http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf |title=The Canterbury (Flats) - 236 Canterbury Road, St Kilda West |work=A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and Their People |publisher=St Kilda Historical Society |date=2005 |access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |title=High Rise has a past too |publisher=Heritage.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=25 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628220428/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |archive-date=28 June 2002 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and [[South Yarra]]), Sydney (particularly in areas such as [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghust]] and [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]) and in Brisbane (in areas such as [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]).\n\nPost-[[World War II]], with the [[Australian Dream]] apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups.\n\nThe main exceptions were Sydney and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views ([[Sydney Harbour]] and beaches such as [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]]) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.\n\nIn other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to [[public housing]]. [[Public housing in Australia]] was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]]) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] and [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio-economic areas like [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].\n\nIn the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in [[Brisbane]] (along the [[Brisbane River]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]).\n\nIn Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the [[gentrification]] of the inner city, a fashion became New York \"loft\" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of [[adaptive reuse]] extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as [[Teneriffe, Queensland]] and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies ([[Postcode 3000]]), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning policy. [[Urban renewal]] areas like [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Port Melbourne]] are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.\n\nDespite their size, other smaller cities including [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Townsville]], [[Cairns]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Geelong]] have begun building apartments in the 2000s.\n\nToday, residential buildings [[Eureka Tower]] and [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in [[inner city]] areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs.\n\nSome Australian cities, such as [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nThe development of residential architecture in [[Yugoslavia]] during the period of [[socialism]] had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to \"pack\" as many [[residential]] units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living.<ref>Lojanica, V., Risti\u0107, J., Me\u0111o, V.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting lang from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. At the Robledo residence, a couple of days past, authorities had found Cortez and thus begun the Battle of Belmont (see above).  \n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his mare jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The fund, largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]], saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\" (ranchers).<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== The Gonzales Trial ====\nThe battle of the courts began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M. Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further Legal Battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />.

Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, as the Columbus trial sentenced Cortez for Glover's murder assuming he had already killed Morris, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref> The defense's claim was denied by many witnesses, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[manifest destiny]]\n* [[Mexican-American]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting lang from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. At the Robledo residence, a couple of days past, authorities had found Cortez and thus begun the Battle of Belmont (see above).  \n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his mare jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The fund, largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]], saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\" (ranchers).<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== The Gonzales Trial ====\nThe battle of the courts began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M. Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further Legal Battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, as the Columbus trial sentenced Cortez for Glover's murder assuming he had already killed Morris, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref> The defense's claim was denied by many witnesses, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v. State, 83 S.W. 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 1904)] </ref>\n\nThe legal plight of Gregorio Cortez lasted upwards of three years and though he was sentenced to life behind bars, the outcry for his justice and eventual [[pardon]] began as soon as the court proceedings had concluded.\n\n=== Prison and pardon ===\nCortez was sentenced not for the death of Morris (which sparked the entire escapade), but for his alleged murder of Sheriff Robert M. Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> At long last, in July 1913, Governor Colquitt granted Gregorio an official pardon, and he was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>. Then on February 28, 1916, having been recently married for the third time to an assumed Esther Mart\u00ednez, Cortez died suddenly at the age of 40.<ref name=\"orozco\" /><ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />\n\nTo this day, the [[cause of death]] of Cortez is contested. There are assumptions of [[natural causes]], [[heart attack]], [[pneumonia]],<ref>Brown, 150</ref> or possible [[poisoning]] done unto him by \"enemies who did not want to see him free.\"<ref name= Deutsch2012 /> He was buried eight miles outside of [[Anson, Texas|Anson]], and as Paredes notes his grave lies approximately \"five hundred miles from the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Border]] on which he was born.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 104}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n=== El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez ===\n\nAs Cortez's story spread to [[Mexican-American]] settlements across the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]], it was transformed into a [[ballad]] where he was often revered as a hero of the border Mexican community and whose resilience against persecutory law enforcement inspired many. In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks. The Legacy of Am\u00e9rico Paredes. vol. no. 10, Texas A & M University Press, College Station, 2006. p71 </ref> <ref> [https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/benson/paredes/biography.html Meier, Matt. ''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido. This part integrates elements of sociolinguistics, through an analysis of the choice of words and the mixing of English and Spanish, anthropology, through an ethnographic description of the border culture, ethnomusicology with a study of the different variants of Gregorio Cortez's Ballad and their meanings <ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks. The Legacy of Am\u00e9rico Paredes. vol. no. 10, Texas A & M University Press, College Station, 2006.pp 71-82</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== In Film ===\n\nThe legend was turned into the film ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]], in 1983. It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[manifest destiny]]\n* [[Mexican-American]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

[[The Deans]] had been exiled from their planet Majesdane for criminal activities. They traveled to Earth where they encountered Xavin's father, Prince De'zean of the Skrulls, who was going to rule the planet.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/> The Deans had stopped the destruction but gave the Skrulls the location of another, more valuable planet: Majesdane.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/> In order to prove they weren't lying, they gave Prince De'zean's child their child's hand in marriage.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/> The Deans had believed that Xavin would die in the new Skrull/Majesdanian war. Xavin later arrived on Earth in order to marry her and hopefully stop the fifteen-year war between their races.<ref name=\" Vol2#8\"/> Xavin encountered Karolina shortly after her romantic advances were rejected by [[Nico Minoru]].<ref name=\"firstappearance\"/> Xavin, trying to convince Karolina to be their bride, fought and pursued her, in the form of a human male.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/> Karolina revealed that she is not attracted to men and doesn't want to live a lie, but Xavin altered their form to that of a human woman and persuaded her to leave Earth with the new female version of Xavin.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/>\n\nDuring the wedding ceremony, a fight breaks out between the two races and Xavin and Karolina barely escape before Majesdane is destroyed.<ref name=\"Vol2#17\">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #17</ref> They return to Earth, where they help rescue [[Molly Hayes]] from the New [[Pride (comics)|Pride]].<ref name=\"Vol2#17\"/> Xavin impersonates Nico and takes a bullet for her, distracting [[Geoffrey Wilder]] long enough for Nico to untie Molly and escape.<ref name=\"Vol2#18\">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #18</ref> Xavin survives the attack by shape-shifting their organs out of the way.<ref name=\"Vol2#18\"/>\n\n===Secret Invasion===\nWhen the Runaways return from a trip to the past, Xavin learns they are in the most heated phase of the Skrull Invasion.<ref name=\"si1\"/> Instead of fighting, they knock out their teammates and attempt a peaceful settlement of the war, reasoning that the Skrulls are \"religious extremists\".<ref name=\"si1\"/> Their attempts at peace fail, and they're informed that the Runaways are targeted for execution.<ref name=\"si1\"/> They urge Nico to take the rest of the team and hide, and in a last-ditch effort to halt the invasion, they flee to search for [[Hulkling]], former Skrull King and enemy of the religious extremist Skrulls' Queen, [[Veranke]].<ref name=\"si2\">''Secret Invasion'': Runaways/Young Avengers</ref> They find Hulkling injured, targeted for assassination by Veranke herself.<ref name=\"si2\"/> By siding with Hulkling, they're branded as a traitor too.<ref name=\"si2\"/>\n\n=== As a fugitive ===\nWeeks later, Xavin better adjusted, refraining from insulting Victor and becoming close to Molly (the only teammate other than Karolina to always refer to Xavin as female). However, Xavin is still more-or-less an outcast to the other members. Like the other Runaways, Xavin is an orphan (they told the group when they first appeared that their parents were dead because of the aliens' war). They also call themself a runaway when they reveal their identity to Geoffry Wilder.<ref name=\"Vol2#18\"/> Xavin joins the group but has trouble adjusting to their new surroundings and getting along with their new teammates, particularly Victor, whom they often offend with condescending remarks about robots.

[[The Deans]] had been exiled from their planet Majesdane for criminal activities. They traveled to Earth where they encountered Xavin's father, Prince De'zean of the Skrulls, who was going to rule the planet.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/> The Deans had stopped the destruction but gave the Skrulls the location of another, more valuable planet: Majesdane.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/> In order to prove they weren't lying, they gave Prince De'zean's child their child's hand in marriage.<ref name=\"Vol2#8\"/> The Deans had believed that Xavin would die in the new Skrull/Majesdanian war.

[[Jesuit]] college of San Ignacio in [[Sarri\u00e0, Barcelona|Sarri\u00e1]].<ref>Francisco, 2009, p. 7.</ref> At the end of the 1980s he worked as a textile designer for different firms, always maintaining his passion for [[oil painting]].<ref>Guerrero Acosta, Pacheco Fern\u00e1ndez y Laguardia, 2012, p. 12.</ref> His vocation for military and history also led him to paint this subject from a very young age and write a book (Batall\u00f3n Rom\u00e1n), although his first independent and self-taught works were landscapes, especially seascapes.<ref>Guerrero Acosta, Pacheco Fern\u00e1ndez y Laguardia, 2012, p. 12.</ref>\n\nLater, inspired by the work of [[Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda]], he focused on urban environments and captured in his canvases the spots of his native Barcelona.<ref>Guerrero Acosta, Pacheco Fern\u00e1ndez y Laguardia, 2012, p. 12.</ref> He exhibited in art galleries, and garnered hits and good reviews.

Sophie's major storylines start when there are problems when she is due to start secondary school. Sophie goes in on her first day but is sent home because she is not on the school's registers. When Sally finds out, she is furious however Sally is responsible as she did not fill in the application forms properly. Sophie kisses best friend [[Sian Powers]] ([[Sacha Parkinson]]). Sian later confronts Sophie, admitting that she is now confused and although she is not attracted to girls, she is now attracted to Sophie; and she deeply missed not being with her. As Sian kisses her, Sophie responds and they decided to be together, \"going out\" as a secret couple. Sophie and Sian join a Church choir so that they can see each other more often. [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) tells Sophie he saw her twin at the Manchester Gay Pride event. Sophie explains to her father that she loves Sian and they are dating. Kevin accepts their relationship.\n\nSophie is devastated to learn that Kevin is the father of [[Molly Dobbs]]'s ([[Vicky Binns]]) baby son, Jack, following an affair they had. Her mother angrily orders Kevin to leave. Rosie and Sophie stand by their mother. Sian helps Sophie through the difficult time and supports her as much as she can. In the months following, Sophie starts to spiral out of control, frequently skipping college and not doing her assignments. She tries to open up to Sally but is overlooked in favour of Jeff, her new boyfriend. As a result of all the arguments getting to her. Sophie later begins accusing Sian of cheating and they break up. Believing that their relationship is over, Sophie becomes depressed and starts drinking cider on the street, refusing [[Sunita Alahan]] ([[Shobna Gulati]])'s offers to talk. That night she ends up at the church she was rejected from previously, thinking that God hates her. Although the Pastor attempts to reason with her and ask her to come back to the choir, Sophie falls from the roof and is sent immediately to hospital. She escapes brain damage and reconciles with her family and Sian who begs Sophie to never leave her.\n\nSophie's friend [[Amber Kalirai]] ([[Nikki Patel]]) takes her to a lesbian bar. Sophie tells Amber that she wants to be with Sian and not to tell Sian where they went in case she gets the wrong idea. A few weeks later, Sian goes on holiday with her mum and Amber takes Sophie out again. Amber spikes Sophie's drink with vodka to help her loosen up and when a lad tries chatting Sophie up, Amber steps in and says that she is her girlfriend before kissing her. Amber tells Sophie the kiss was only to make the lad go away but Sophie is confused about her feelings, telling Sunita that she liked it and did not want it to end. Sunita tells Sophie the kiss did not mean anything to Amber and to focus on her relationship with Sian. Feeling guilty and taking Sunita's advice, Sophie proposes to Sian when she comes home from holiday early. Sian accepts and Sophie tells Sally and Kevin they are engaged, but they tell Sophie they would not give her permission to marry. Sophie asks Sian to talk to their parents again about getting married. They talk to Sally, but she tells them they are too young and they do not have her permission. Desperate to get married to make her feelings for Amber go away, Sophie tells Sian if they can not get married in Weatherfield, they should go to Gretna Green instead. They go to the coach station but Sally and Rosie arrive, and Sally tells Sophie she will let them get married in four weeks in Weatherfield as long as Kevin agrees too. Sophie and Sian are delighted. The wedding day soon approaches, and on the hen night, Amber tells Sophie not to marry Sian as she likes Sophie as a friend and does not want her making a mistake. She even tries to kiss her but is stopped by Sunita, who then tells Kevin that Sophie is having doubts about getting married. However, on the wedding day, Sophie tells Kevin that she still wants to marry Sian. When they arrive at the church, Sian says her vows very well, but Sophie stumbles on hers. Kevin tells her that she does not have to do this and slips out that she told Sunita she was not ready. The whole church is confused and Sian begs to know what is going on, to which Sophie admits she can not do it. Sian flees the church in tears. Sian leaves her and Weatherfield, leaving Sophie breaking down on the cobbles hysterically, shouting to Sian that she loves her.\n\nFollowing her painful split from Sian, Sophie is left feeling bitterly depressed. She decides to resign from her job at the corner shop and decides that she does not like Amber. Sophie goes on a night out with her old friend [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]). Ryan is upset after finding out [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) was only in a relationship with him to annoy his mum Michelle and to split her up with Tracy's ex-husband, Steve. Ryan gets drunk and high on cocaine and starts playing chicken on a road of busy cars. Sophie finally persuades him to come home however as he is crossing the road a car comes, Sophie pushes him out of the way but she gets run over by the car. Sally and Kevin were both distraught when they find out that Ryan was involved in the accident, but Sophie defends his actions and makes them promise not to say anything to the police. Physiotherapist [[Jenna Kamara]] (Krissi Bohn) helps Sophie's pain go away, but Sophie develops feelings for her soon afterwards. Sophie picks up the courage to finally spend time with Jenna and even kiss her, and she responds back. The pair immediately begin dating, much to the disapproval of Jenna's mother Mandy and Kevin. Sophie is not happy when Sally starts dating [[Tim Metcalfe (Coronation Street)|Tim Metcalfe]] ([[Joe Duttine]]) but they later begin to get along. Jenna later splits up with Sophie because they are so different from one another.\n\nSophie decides to go and work at a soup kitchen and forces Sally to come with her. At the soup kitchen, Sophie meets [[Maddie Heath]] ([[Amy James-Kelly]]). Sophie attempts to befriend Maddie despite her bitterness towards her. Sophie and Maddie later begin a relationship and Sophie is delighted when Sally allows Maddie to move into the house with them. Sophie discovers [[Faye Windass]] ([[Ellie Leach]]) in pain in the flat above [[Dev Alahan]]'s ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) shop. Faye reveals to Sophie and eventually her parents that she is having a baby. After giving birth to a girl, Faye comes home from the hospital and Sophie visits her. Sophie discovers that the father of Faye's daughter is a boy in Faye's class named Jackson and Sophie comforts Faye, who was devastated when Jackson rejected her after their one-night stand. Sophie soon became suspicious of Kevin's new girlfriend, [[Jenny Bradley]]'s ([[Sally Ann Matthews]]) growing attachment to her brother Jack. Jenny manages to defend herself, ensuring that everyone, especially Kevin, does not believe Sophie's concerns. However, in May 2015, Sophie's suspicions prove correct when Maddie catches Jenny attempting to kidnap Jack. Fleeing the house, Maddie rushes to tell Sophie, but not before leaving a voicemail on Sophie's phone, when she then gets caught up in an explosion at the builders' yard in the aftermath of the huge fire at the Victoria Court flats. Maddie later succumbs to her injuries in hospital, leaving Sophie devastated at the loss of another girlfriend. Whilst Sophie and Kevin attend Maddie's funeral, Jenny goes along with her plan to abduct Jack. Sophie and Kevin learn about Jenny's son, Tom, who died a few years prior and was the same age as Jack. Sophie, Kevin and Rita track Jenny down and try to talk her down from a balcony, where she is threatening to jump with Jack. The police arrive and Jenny breaks down before she is sectioned. With her dad struggling of having another garage considerably further than his main garage, Sophie decides to search for premises that are closer. In October 2016, Sophie goes to America and joins Rosie.\n\nSophie returns to the street with Rosie. The police later visit the Webster's house after receiving news that the house contains drugs. Rosie and Sophie are arrested after a white powder is discovered in one of their bags but are released without charge as they find out it is only sweetener. Rosie later has one of her bags returned after leaving in a taxi, Sophie questions her about what is in the bag however Rosie tells her it is only sweets. After opening the bag Rosie and Sophie discover [[cocaine]]. They bury it in [[Brian Packham]]'s ([[Peter Gunn (actor)|Peter Gunn]]) allotment. Sophie hands back her 21% of Kevin's business when he struggles with finances following a fire started by [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre), which Pat framed Kevin for starting, so she and Rosie join Tim's window cleaning business. When Sally is targeted by an [[internet troll]], Sally decides to resign from the council, so Rosie and Sophie find out the address of the person who placed an obituary for Sally in the paper. They meet [[Leah Buckley]] (Molly McGlynn) and confront her, however, she denies being the troll, but her stepmother is to blame and will get her to stop. Leah visits the Websters and asks Rosie and Sophie if Sally is okay. After Sophie tells Rosie about Sally's state, Rosie goes to see Leah and is surprised to spot her aunt, [[Gina Seddon]] ([[Connie Hyde]]), realising she is Leah's stepmother. Leah admits Gina is the troll and explains she is ill. Rosie tells Sophie who the troll is and they both go to confront Gina. Gina is pleased to see them but denies trolling Sally and when Leah arrives, she reveals Gina has [[bipolar disorder]]. When Gina goes missing, Rosie and Sophie help Leah find her and Gina turns up on the street. Gina wants to talk to Sally, but Leah bundles her into the car and drives off. Sally and Tim visit Gina and Leah and invite Gina and Leah to live with them.\n\nIn early 2018, Sophie begins a relationship with [[Kate Connor (Coronation Street)|Kate Connor]] ([[Faye Brookes]]), however, they split in March, leaving Sophie heartbroken. Following her break up with Kate, Sophie becomes close to Kate's brother [[Aidan Connor]] ([[Shayne Ward]]), and the pair bond due to their similar experiences. After Aidan commits suicide Sophie is left shocked and blames herself but after speaking to Kate she stops blaming herself and the pair become friends once again.

Sophie's major storylines start when there are problems when she is due to start secondary school. Sophie goes in on her first day but is sent home because she is not on the school's registers. When Sally finds out, she is furious however Sally is responsible as she did not fill in the application forms properly. Sophie kisses best friend [[Sian Powers]] ([[Sacha Parkinson]]). Sian later confronts Sophie, admitting that she is now confused and although she is not attracted to girls, she is now attracted to Sophie; and she deeply missed not being with her. As Sian kisses her, Sophie responds and they decided to be together, \"going out\" as a secret couple. Sophie and Sian join a Church choir so that they can see each other more often. [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) tells Sophie he saw her twin at the Manchester Gay Pride event. Sophie explains to her father that she loves Sian and they are dating. Kevin accepts their relationship.\n\nSophie is devastated to learn that Kevin is the father of [[Molly Dobbs]]'s ([[Vicky Binns]]) baby son, Jack, following an affair they had. Her mother angrily orders Kevin to leave. Rosie and Sophie stand by their mother. Sian helps Sophie through the difficult time and supports her as much as she can. In the months following, Sophie starts to spiral out of control, frequently skipping college and not doing her assignments. She tries to open up to Sally but is overlooked in favour of Jeff, her new boyfriend. As a result of all the arguments getting to her. Sophie later begins accusing Sian of cheating and they break up. Believing that their relationship is over, Sophie becomes depressed and starts drinking cider on the street, refusing [[Sunita Alahan]] ([[Shobna Gulati]])'s offers to talk. That night she ends up at the church she was rejected from previously, thinking that God hates her. Although the Pastor attempts to reason with her and ask her to come back to the choir, Sophie falls from the roof and is sent immediately to hospital. She escapes brain damage and reconciles with her family and Sian who begs Sophie to never leave her.\n\nSophie's friend [[Amber Kalirai]] ([[Nikki Patel]]) takes her to a lesbian bar. Sophie tells Amber that she wants to be with Sian and not to tell Sian where they went in case she gets the wrong idea. A few weeks later, Sian goes on holiday with her mum and Amber takes Sophie out again. Amber spikes Sophie's drink with vodka to help her loosen up and when a lad tries chatting Sophie up, Amber steps in and says that she is her girlfriend before kissing her. Amber tells Sophie the kiss was only to make the lad go away but Sophie is confused about her feelings, telling Sunita that she liked it and did not want it to end. Sunita tells Sophie the kiss did not mean anything to Amber and to focus on her relationship with Sian. Feeling guilty and taking Sunita's advice, Sophie proposes to Sian when she comes home from holiday early. Sian accepts and Sophie tells Sally and Kevin they are engaged, but they tell Sophie they would not give her permission to marry. Sophie asks Sian to talk to their parents again about getting married. They talk to Sally, but she tells them they are too young and they do not have her permission. Desperate to get married to make her feelings for Amber go away, Sophie tells Sian if they can not get married in Weatherfield, they should go to Gretna Green instead. They go to the coach station but Sally and Rosie arrive, and Sally tells Sophie she will let them get married in four weeks in Weatherfield as long as Kevin agrees too. Sophie and Sian are delighted. The wedding day soon approaches, and on the hen night, Amber tells Sophie not to marry Sian as she likes Sophie as a friend and does not want her making a mistake. She even tries to kiss her but is stopped by Sunita, who then tells Kevin that Sophie is having doubts about getting married. However, on the wedding day, Sophie tells Kevin that she still wants to marry Sian. When they arrive at the church, Sian says her vows very well, but Sophie stumbles on hers. Kevin tells her that she does not have to do this and slips out that she told Sunita she was not ready. The whole church is confused and Sian begs to know what is going on, to which Sophie admits she can not do it. Sian flees the church in tears. Sian leaves her and Weatherfield, leaving Sophie breaking down on the cobbles hysterically, shouting to Sian that she loves her.\n\nFollowing her painful split from Sian, Sophie is left feeling bitterly depressed. She decides to resign from her job at the corner shop and decides that she does not like Amber. Sophie goes on a night out with her old friend [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]). Ryan is upset after finding out [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) was only in a relationship with him to annoy his mum Michelle and to split her up with Tracy's ex-husband, Steve. Ryan gets drunk and high on cocaine and starts playing chicken on a road of busy cars. Sophie finally persuades him to come home however as he is crossing the road a car comes, Sophie pushes him out of the way but she gets run over by the car. Sally and Kevin were both distraught when they find out that Ryan was involved in the accident, but Sophie defends his actions and makes them promise not to say anything to the police. Physiotherapist [[Jenna Kamara]] (Krissi Bohn) helps Sophie's pain go away, but Sophie develops feelings for her soon afterwards. Sophie picks up the courage to finally spend time with Jenna and even kiss her, and she responds back. The pair immediately begin dating, much to the disapproval of Jenna's mother Mandy and Kevin. Sophie is not happy when Sally starts dating [[Tim Metcalfe (Coronation Street)|Tim Metcalfe]] ([[Joe Duttine]]) but they later begin to get along.

After giving birth to a girl, Faye comes home from the hospital and Sophie visits her. Sophie discovers that the father of Faye's daughter is a boy in Faye's class named Jackson and Sophie comforts Faye, who was devastated when Jackson rejected her after their one-night stand. Sophie soon became suspicious of Kevin's new girlfriend, [[Jenny Bradley]]'s ([[Sally Ann Matthews]]) growing attachment to her brother Jack. Jenny manages to defend herself, ensuring that everyone, especially Kevin, does not believe Sophie's concerns. However, in May 2015, Sophie's suspicions prove correct when Maddie catches Jenny attempting to kidnap Jack. Fleeing the house, Maddie rushes to tell Sophie, but not before leaving a voicemail on Sophie's phone, when she then gets caught up in an explosion at the builders' yard in the aftermath of the huge fire at the Victoria Court flats. Maddie later succumbs to her injuries in hospital, leaving Sophie devastated at the loss of another girlfriend. Whilst Sophie and Kevin attend Maddie's funeral, Jenny goes along with her plan to abduct Jack. Sophie and Kevin learn about Jenny's son, Tom, who died a few years prior and was the same age as Jack.

When Sally is targeted by an [[internet troll]], Sally decides to resign from the council, so Rosie and Sophie find out the address of the person who placed an obituary for Sally in the paper. They meet [[Leah Buckley]] (Molly McGlynn) and confront her, however, she denies being the troll, but her stepmother is to blame and will get her to stop.

After Sophie tells Rosie about Sally's state, Rosie goes to see Leah and is surprised to spot her aunt, [[Gina Seddon]] ([[Connie Hyde]]), realising she is Leah's stepmother. Leah admits Gina is the troll and explains she is ill. Rosie tells Sophie who the troll is and they both go to confront Gina.

Solovyanenko|Donetsk National Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre]] as an apprentice set designer.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|7}} Between March 1944 and June 1945 he was recalled to attend a factory trade school, a so-called FZO. (At that time in the Soviet Union, attending a trade school was compulsory. ref) In 1945 he moved to the Stalin Theater for Opera and Ballet and the following year he enrolled in the art and architecture school at [[Donetsk National Technical University|Donetsk Polytechnic Institute]] where he received specialized training.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}}\n\nBetween March 1949 and January 1950, Konovalenko worked in sculpture at the Stalinist Regional Association of Artists.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}}  In October 1950 Konovalenko was drafted into the Soviet navy but he was discharged only five months later due to unspecified and unrecorded medical reasons.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}} At some point during this service, he visited Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and he was taken by the artistic, historic and cultural environment of the city and he perceived career opportunities there.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}} Shortly after his military discharge, he moved to Leningrad and he found employment with the prestigious [[Mariinsky Theater]], then the Kirov State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet (\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0421.\u041c. \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430).<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}} Konovalenko's engagement with the Mariinsky launched him on the path of his life's work.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}}\n\n== ''The Tale of the Stone Flower'' ==\nOn April 25, 1957, the Mariinsky Theater opened [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s eighth and final ballet, ''[[The Tale of the Stone Flower (Prokofiev)|''The Tale of the Stone Flower'']]'', for which Konovalenko served as the lead set designer.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}} (''The Tale of the Stone Flower'' was premiered in 1954 by the Bolshoi Theater. The production proved to be a public disappointment<ref name=Prokofiev_bio/>{{rp|444}} and it was not produced again for another five years.<ref name=Prokofiev_bio/>{{rp|410}}) Among Konovalenko's many tasks for the production was the creation of a large malachite box as a prop.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|9}} At this point he was not known as a gem carver but he had had sculptural experience as far back as his apprenticeship at the Donetsk National Theater. With the malachite box, Konovaleko would find his life's calling.\n\n''[[The Tale of the Stone Flower (Prokofiev)|''The Tale of the Stone Flower'']]'' is based on the Russian Ural folk tale ''The Stone Flower'' by [[Pavel Bazhov]]. Briefly, the story takes place in the Ural Mountains of central Russia. The male lead, young Danilo, is engaged to the beautiful Katarina. Unfortunately the Mistress of Malachite Mountain tempts Danilo with a legendary stone flower. As a gem carver himself, Danilo becomes entranced with the stone flower and he sets out to make one of his own out of the beautiful black- and green-banded mineral [[malachite]]. In the process, Danilo becomes entranced with the Mistress of Malachite Mountain. After a long period in which Danilo developed extraordinary gem carving skills, he again professes his love for Katarina. Appreciating Danilo's honesty and loyalty, the Mistress of Malachite Mountain blesses the reunion. The blessed couple live happily ever after and Danilo becomes an extraordinary gem carver.\n\nKonovalenko continued to work at the Mariinsky Theater for the next 16 years but at the same time he continued to hone his gem carving skills. Many of his pieces from this period are on display at the State Gemstone Museum in Moscow. During this period he also traveled extensively to visit mineral sources in the Urals, Siberia and Ukraine and to meet with geologists and mineralogists.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|10}}\n\n== The State Russian Museum Exhibition ==\nBy 1971, Konovalenko's theatrical reputation was at its zenith, but his gem carving reputation was lagging because he had never had a public exhibition. Vasily's wife, Anna, decided that Vasily should be the focus of such an exhibition and that they should try to meet with authorities in Moscow toward this end. This was a bold approach, considering that they had no letter of introduction from party officials in Leningrad. That was bad enough but in addition the example of Vasily's work that they chose to present was an early version of ''Bosom Pals'' (''Brazhniki''), a rather ill-advised choice as it depicted three men carousing, definitely ''not'' the Soviet Realism style then favored by the Communist Party.<ref name=Kolesnikoff&Smymiw1994/> Anna and Vasily were summarily dismissed and they returned to Leningrad, rejected but unscathed.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|10}}\n\nTwo years later the couple decided to make a second approach and they returned to Moscow better prepared. Through mutual acquaintances, Anna obtained a meeting with [[Sergey Mikhalkov]], a well-known and well-connected author. (Also the author of the lyrics of the Soviet national anthem.) They also brought two more-appropriate works, ''Warrior'' and ''The Tsar's Henchman''. The meeting was a complete success \u2014 Mikhalkov loved the sculptures and he immediately contacted [[Mikhail Solomentsev]], chairman of the Council of Ministers. Solomentsev also loved the pieces and within minutes he decided that an exhibition should be arranged and that it should be at the [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]] in Leningrad. Solomentsev's position in the hierarchy was such that once he voiced his approval, everyone fell into line. An additional stroke of good luck was that the director of the [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]], Vasily Pushkarev, knew and admired Konovalenko's work.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|10&13}}\n\nAt the end of 1973, ten sculptures, created between 1959 and 1973, went on display at the [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]]. The exhibition was an unmitigated success. Within a week of the exhibition's opening, some 25,000 copies of the exhibit catalog were sold. The pieces in the exhibition included:<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|13}}\n\n\u2022 ''Bosom Pals (Brazhniki)'' (1953)\n\n\u2022 ''Fishing'' (1965)\n\n\u2022 ''Grandma and Grandpa'' (1963)\n\n\u2022 ''Ice Fishing'' (1968)\n\n\u2022 ''Organ Grinder''\" (1967)\n\n\u2022 ''Tea Drinker'' (1971)\n\n\u2022 ''Tsar's Henchman'' (1970)\n\n\u2022 ''Warrior'' (1961)\n\n\u2022 ''Welcome'' (1959)\n\n\u2022 ''Zemfira'' (1973)\n\n== \"Persecution\" ==\nUnfortunately, by approaching the authorities in Moscow, who in turn worked directly with Pushkarev at the State Russian Museum, the Konovalenkos bypassed local officials in Leningrad, most notably [[Grigory Romanov]], the most powerful Communist Party official in Leningrad. The Konovalenkos had inserted themselves in the middle of a long-simmering power struggle between Puskkarev and Romanov. Having been bypassed, Romanov was denied the opportunity to share the credit for the exhibition. One outward sign of his displeasure was that, even though he had been sent a special invitation to the exhibition, he did not attend. Romanov devised a plan to charge Konovalenko as a criminal, in spite of the fact that he had just been heralded as a national hero, and he engaged the [[KGB]] to investigate Konovalenko.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|48}}\n\nAccording to the letter of the law, Konovalenko was indeed guilty of three laws: he had been involved in buying and selling precious and semi-precious stones; if one were to take a cynical view, he had denigrated Soviet culture by the whimsical nature of his characters; and he was in possession of gold and silver. The KGB investigation was terrifying for the Konovalenkos. Some 1,500 (!) friends, associates and acquaintances of Konovalenko were interviewed in trying to gather evidence against him. Their house and workshop were damaged in a 12-hour long search.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|48}}\n\nThe Konovalenkos had friends working behind-the-scenes to keep him out of prison and a compromise was eventually reached. He agreed to \"donate\" all 10 of the sculptures in the exhibit to the Soviet state, to move his family from Leningrad to Moscow, and to take employment there in the State \"Samotsvety\" (Gems) Museum. Ironically, at the same time, the American capitalist [[Armand Hammer]] offered to purchase the ten pieces in the exhibit for $150,000 each.<ref name=Gillette1981/> Party officials declined the offer and the pieces are still today in the \"Samotsvety\" in Moscow. When the KGB investigation reached the desk of the Chief Prosecutor of the Soviet Union, he dismissed the case as being \"cartoonish\".<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|48}}\n\nThe Konovalenko's, however, began to fear that, if this had happened once, it could well happen again and they began to seriously consider finding a way to leave the Soviet Union.\n\n== Exodus ==\nIn 1974 at the \"Samotsvety\", Konovalenko began working as the director of the newly formed Laboratory of Small Sculptural Forms. Unfortunately he soon discovered that much of his work would consist of making pieces for Communist Party officials to offer as gifts to colleagues and friends. So in spite of the seemingly stable employment and living situations, he was not free as an artist and he realized that likely he never would be. The ultimate solution would be to emigrate from the Soviet Union, but Konovalenko himself had no basis for applying for an exit visa. However between 1966 and 1982, there was a mechanism for Jews to leave and Vasily's wife/widow was/is Jewish. The family applied under this program and in February 1981, their emigration visas arrived.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|50}}\n\nVasily was on an airplane headed to Vienna the following day and the rest of the family followed him about two weeks later. The official intent of the Jewish emigration program was for emigres to go to Israel, but Anna's brother lived in New York City and it was decided that economic and artistic opportunities would be greater there. The family arrived in New York in April 1981.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|83}}\n\n== Life in the United States ==\n\nSeveral years earlier in Moscow, Konovalenko had met Raphael Gregorian,<ref name=Obit_Gregorian/> a Russian-born medical supplies dealer and he was the first person the Konovalenkos contacted in search of support. Through Gregorian, diamond dealers Michael Kazanjian and Jack Ortman were introduced to Konovalenko and the three agreed to sponsor him.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|84}}\n\nThe contract that was drawn up called for Konovalenko to produce 18 works in two years. Still, there remained a gap in the plan - the display and permanent disposition of the pieces. Among Ortman's list of clients was Alvin Cohen,<ref name=Obit_Cohen/> a Denver-based construction magnate, who was a trustee of the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]]. He was in the position to solve the remaining issue. Through the first half of 1983 plans were formulated for an exhibition to open in Denver on November 2 of that year.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|84}}\n\nThere was however, a very unfortunate turn of events on September 1, 1983, when Soviet Air Force fighter jets shot down [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] (KAL 007), a passenger airline en route from New York to Seoul. This was obviously a serious problem for the exhibition \u2014 an exhibition of Russian art produced by a Russian immigrant. A decision was made to delay the opening by some four months.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|84}}\n\nThe Konovalenko sculptures went on display for the first time outside of the Soviet Union on March 15, 1984 to great acclaim. Included were ''Barrel Bath''; ''Bosom Pals''; ''Hunter on the Mark''; ''Ice Fishing''; ''In the Sultry Afternoon I''; ''In the Sultry Afternoon II''; ''Laundress''; ''Mower''; ''On the Stroll''; ''Painter''; ''Prisoners''; ''Spring''; ''Sauna I: The Thin and the Fat''; ''Sauna II: Woman''; ''Toper''; ''Walruses'' and ''Wanderer'' (or ''Old Believer''). ''Swan Song'' had broken en route and had to be virtually recreated from scratch.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|84}}\n\nSurprisingly, no one had given much thought to the disposition of the pieces following the exhibition. Given the popularity of the exhibition, the default solution was to simply extend the display and that was done incrementally until 1989. Several pieces were added \u2014 ''Grandmother''; ''Bread and Salt'' and ''Gold Prospectors''. ''Hunter on the Mark'' was moved to a private collection. As the years passed, thought was given to how the collection might be made permanent at the Museum.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|85}}\n\nOrtman had purchased the subscriptions of Kazanjian and Gregorian in 1984 and Cohen bought the entire collection from Ortman in 1989.

Solovyanenko|Donetsk National Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre]] as an apprentice set designer.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|7}} Between March 1944 and June 1945 he was recalled to attend a factory trade school, a so-called FZO. (At that time in the Soviet Union, attending a trade school was compulsory. ref) In 1945 he moved to the Stalin Theater for Opera and Ballet and the following year he enrolled in the art and architecture school at [[Donetsk National Technical University|Donetsk Polytechnic Institute]] where he received specialized training.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}}\n\nBetween March 1949 and January 1950, Konovalenko worked in sculpture at the Stalinist Regional Association of Artists.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}}  In October 1950 Konovalenko was drafted into the Soviet navy but he was discharged only five months later due to unspecified and unrecorded medical reasons.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}} At some point during this service, he visited Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and he was taken by the artistic, historic and cultural environment of the city and he perceived career opportunities there.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}} Shortly after his military discharge, he moved to Leningrad and he found employment with the prestigious [[Mariinsky Theater]], then the Kirov State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet (\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0421.\u041c. \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430).<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}} Konovalenko's engagement with the Mariinsky launched him on the path of his life's work.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}}\n\n== ''The Tale of the Stone Flower'' ==\nOn April 25, 1957, the Mariinsky Theater opened [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s eighth and final ballet, ''[[The Tale of the Stone Flower (Prokofiev)|''The Tale of the Stone Flower'']]'', for which Konovalenko served as the lead set designer.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|8}} (''The Tale of the Stone Flower'' was premiered in 1954 by the Bolshoi Theater. The production proved to be a public disappointment<ref name=Prokofiev_bio/>{{rp|444}} and it was not produced again for another five years.<ref name=Prokofiev_bio/>{{rp|410}}) Among Konovalenko's many tasks for the production was the creation of a large malachite box as a prop.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|9}} At this point he was not known as a gem carver but he had had sculptural experience as far back as his apprenticeship at the Donetsk National Theater. With the malachite box, Konovaleko would find his life's calling.\n\n''[[The Tale of the Stone Flower (Prokofiev)|''The Tale of the Stone Flower'']]'' is based on the Russian Ural folk tale ''The Stone Flower'' by [[Pavel Bazhov]]. Briefly, the story takes place in the Ural Mountains of central Russia. The male lead, young Danilo, is engaged to the beautiful Katarina. Unfortunately the Mistress of Malachite Mountain tempts Danilo with a legendary stone flower. As a gem carver himself, Danilo becomes entranced with the stone flower and he sets out to make one of his own out of the beautiful black- and green-banded mineral [[malachite]]. In the process, Danilo becomes entranced with the Mistress of Malachite Mountain. After a long period in which Danilo developed extraordinary gem carving skills, he again professes his love for Katarina. Appreciating Danilo's honesty and loyalty, the Mistress of Malachite Mountain blesses the reunion. The blessed couple live happily ever after and Danilo becomes an extraordinary gem carver.\n\nKonovalenko continued to work at the Mariinsky Theater for the next 16 years but at the same time he continued to hone his gem carving skills. Many of his pieces from this period are on display at the State Gemstone Museum in Moscow. During this period he also traveled extensively to visit mineral sources in the Urals, Siberia and Ukraine and to meet with geologists and mineralogists.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|10}}\n\n== The State Russian Museum Exhibition ==\nBy 1971, Konovalenko's theatrical reputation was at its zenith, but his gem carving reputation was lagging because he had never had a public exhibition. Vasily's wife, Anna, decided that Vasily should be the focus of such an exhibition and that they should try to meet with authorities in Moscow toward this end. This was a bold approach, considering that they had no letter of introduction from party officials in Leningrad. That was bad enough but in addition the example of Vasily's work that they chose to present was an early version of ''Bosom Pals'' (''Brazhniki''), a rather ill-advised choice as it depicted three men carousing, definitely ''not'' the Soviet Realism style then favored by the Communist Party.<ref name=Kolesnikoff&Smymiw1994/> Anna and Vasily were summarily dismissed and they returned to Leningrad, rejected but unscathed.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|10}}\n\nTwo years later the couple decided to make a second approach and they returned to Moscow better prepared. Through mutual acquaintances, Anna obtained a meeting with [[Sergey Mikhalkov]], a well-known and well-connected author. (Also the author of the lyrics of the Soviet national anthem.) They also brought two more-appropriate works, ''Warrior'' and ''The Tsar's Henchman''. The meeting was a complete success \u2014 Mikhalkov loved the sculptures and he immediately contacted [[Mikhail Solomentsev]], chairman of the Council of Ministers. Solomentsev also loved the pieces and within minutes he decided that an exhibition should be arranged and that it should be at the [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]] in Leningrad. Solomentsev's position in the hierarchy was such that once he voiced his approval, everyone fell into line. An additional stroke of good luck was that the director of the [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]], Vasily Pushkarev, knew and admired Konovalenko's work.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|10&13}}\n\nAt the end of 1973, ten sculptures, created between 1959 and 1973, went on display at the [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]]. The exhibition was an unmitigated success. Within a week of the exhibition's opening, some 25,000 copies of the exhibit catalog were sold. The pieces in the exhibition included:<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|13}}\n\n\u2022 ''Bosom Pals (Brazhniki)'' (1953)\n\n\u2022 ''Fishing'' (1965)\n\n\u2022 ''Grandma and Grandpa'' (1963)\n\n\u2022 ''Ice Fishing'' (1968)\n\n\u2022 ''Organ Grinder''\" (1967)\n\n\u2022 ''Tea Drinker'' (1971)\n\n\u2022 ''Tsar's Henchman'' (1970)\n\n\u2022 ''Warrior'' (1961)\n\n\u2022 ''Welcome'' (1959)\n\n\u2022 ''Zemfira'' (1973)\n\n== \"Persecution\" ==\nUnfortunately, by approaching the authorities in Moscow, who in turn worked directly with Pushkarev at the State Russian Museum, the Konovalenkos bypassed local officials in Leningrad, most notably [[Grigory Romanov]], the most powerful Communist Party official in Leningrad. The Konovalenkos had inserted themselves in the middle of a long-simmering power struggle between Puskkarev and Romanov. Having been bypassed, Romanov was denied the opportunity to share the credit for the exhibition. One outward sign of his displeasure was that, even though he had been sent a special invitation to the exhibition, he did not attend. Romanov devised a plan to charge Konovalenko as a criminal, in spite of the fact that he had just been heralded as a national hero, and he engaged the [[KGB]] to investigate Konovalenko.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|48}}\n\nAccording to the letter of the law, Konovalenko was indeed guilty of three laws: he had been involved in buying and selling precious and semi-precious stones; if one were to take a cynical view, he had denigrated Soviet culture by the whimsical nature of his characters; and he was in possession of gold and silver. The KGB investigation was terrifying for the Konovalenkos. Some 1,500 (!) friends, associates and acquaintances of Konovalenko were interviewed in trying to gather evidence against him. Their house and workshop were damaged in a 12-hour long search.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|48}}\n\nThe Konovalenkos had friends working behind-the-scenes to keep him out of prison and a compromise was eventually reached. He agreed to \"donate\" all 10 of the sculptures in the exhibit to the Soviet state, to move his family from Leningrad to Moscow, and to take employment there in the State \"Samotsvety\" (Gems) Museum. Ironically, at the same time, the American capitalist [[Armand Hammer]] offered to purchase the ten pieces in the exhibit for $150,000 each.<ref name=Gillette1981/> Party officials declined the offer and the pieces are still today in the \"Samotsvety\" in Moscow. When the KGB investigation reached the desk of the Chief Prosecutor of the Soviet Union, he dismissed the case as being \"cartoonish\".<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|48}}\n\nThe Konovalenko's, however, began to fear that, if this had happened once, it could well happen again and they began to seriously consider finding a way to leave the Soviet Union.\n\n== Exodus ==\nIn 1974 at the \"Samotsvety\", Konovalenko began working as the director of the newly formed Laboratory of Small Sculptural Forms. Unfortunately he soon discovered that much of his work would consist of making pieces for Communist Party officials to offer as gifts to colleagues and friends. So in spite of the seemingly stable employment and living situations, he was not free as an artist and he realized that likely he never would be. The ultimate solution would be to emigrate from the Soviet Union, but Konovalenko himself had no basis for applying for an exit visa. However between 1966 and 1982, there was a mechanism for Jews to leave and Vasily's wife/widow was/is Jewish. The family applied under this program and in February 1981, their emigration visas arrived.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|50}}\n\nVasily was on an airplane headed to Vienna the following day and the rest of the family followed him about two weeks later. The official intent of the Jewish emigration program was for emigres to go to Israel, but Anna's brother lived in New York City and it was decided that economic and artistic opportunities would be greater there. The family arrived in New York in April 1981.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|83}}\n\n== Life in the United States ==\n\nSeveral years earlier in Moscow, Konovalenko had met Raphael Gregorian,<ref name=Obit_Gregorian/> a Russian-born medical supplies dealer and he was the first person the Konovalenkos contacted in search of support. Through Gregorian, diamond dealers Michael Kazanjian and Jack Ortman were introduced to Konovalenko and the three agreed to sponsor him.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|84}}\n\nThe contract that was drawn up called for Konovalenko to produce 18 works in two years. Still, there remained a gap in the plan - the display and permanent disposition of the pieces. Among Ortman's list of clients was Alvin Cohen,<ref name=Obit_Cohen/> a Denver-based construction magnate, who was a trustee of the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]]. He was in the position to solve the remaining issue. Through the first half of 1983 plans were formulated for an exhibition to open in Denver on November 2 of that year.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|84}}\n\nThere was however, a very unfortunate turn of events on September 1, 1983, when Soviet Air Force fighter jets shot down [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] (KAL 007), a passenger airline en route from New York to Seoul. This was obviously a serious problem for the exhibition \u2014 an exhibition of Russian art produced by a Russian immigrant. A decision was made to delay the opening by some four months.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|84}}\n\nThe Konovalenko sculptures went on display for the first time outside of the Soviet Union on March 15, 1984 to great acclaim. Included were ''Barrel Bath''; ''Bosom Pals''; ''Hunter on the Mark''; ''Ice Fishing''; ''In the Sultry Afternoon I''; ''In the Sultry Afternoon II''; ''Laundress''; ''Mower''; ''On the Stroll''; ''Painter''; ''Prisoners''; ''Spring''; ''Sauna I: The Thin and the Fat''; ''Sauna II: Woman''; ''Toper''; ''Walruses'' and ''Wanderer'' (or ''Old Believer''). ''Swan Song'' had broken en route and had to be virtually recreated from scratch.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|84}}\n\nSurprisingly, no one had given much thought to the disposition of the pieces following the exhibition. Given the popularity of the exhibition, the default solution was to simply extend the display and that was done incrementally until 1989. Several pieces were added \u2014 ''Grandmother''; ''Bread and Salt'' and ''Gold Prospectors''. ''Hunter on the Mark'' was moved to a private collection. As the years passed, thought was given to how the collection might be made permanent at the Museum.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|85}}\n\nOrtman had purchased the subscriptions of Kazanjian and Gregorian in 1984 and Cohen bought the entire collection from Ortman in 1989. Cohen subsequently donated all 20 pieces to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science Foundation in 1999.<ref name=Nash2016/>{{rp|85}}\n\nVasily Konovalenko died on January 27, 1989, five days after suffering a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].
