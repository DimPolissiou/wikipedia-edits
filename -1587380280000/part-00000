There were no other conditions such as heritage, [[oath]] or other, unlike in [[Bourgeois of Brussels|Brussels]] at the same period. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Duties and privileges of the bourgeois of Paris ==\n\nThese privileges were numerous, diverse, verying greatly from decade to decade. The list published in 1884 in ''[[L'Interm\u00e9diaire des chercheurs et curieux]] (''The Intermediate of the Researchers and Curious) give a glimpse on the variety of these privileges. Laurence Croq, who has dedicated a thesis to the study of the notion of the bourgeois of Paris at the 18th century, explains that this status had a [[wikt:polymorphous|polymorphous]] characteristic.<ref>Laurence Croq, ''Les \u00ab Bourgeois de Paris \u00bb au <abbr>xviii<sup>e</sup></abbr> si\u00e8cle.

But [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] restricted this privilege in 1577 to the [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|Provost of the Merchants]] and the [[Alderman|Aldermen]] alone. It was suppressed in 1667, restored in 1707; suppressed again in 1715, and finally restored in 1716, as it stands today. \"<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Alexandre Aubert de La Chesnaye-Desbois, Dictionary of the nobility, Foreword, Volume I, Paris, 1770, p. IX.</ref>\n\nThe bourgeois of Paris enjoyed the right to the noble guard, called for them the bourgeois guard.\n\n== Birth of the bourgeoisie in Paris ==\nThe oldest [[Corporation (feudal Europe)|corporations]] or [[guild]]s in Paris were [[Tailor|clothiers]], [[grocers]], [[haberdasher]]s, and [[Fur clothing|furriers]].\n\nWith the water merchants, heirs of the ''nautes of Lut\u00e8ce'' who exercise the [[monopoly]] that holds the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] for the trade along the [[Seine]], and the ''Grande Boucherie'' (Big Butchery), which reunites the owners of farms of the suburbs and those of salting workshops intra and extramurals, they constitute alongside the [[clergy]] and the [[French nobility|nobility]] a [[Third estate|third power]] that will consecrate in 1357 the Great Ordinance of the [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|provost of the merchants]], [[\u00c9tienne Marcel|Etienne Marcel]], and which will become financially decisive, as the will illustrate the [[Cabochien revolt]].\n\nIn 1190, before going on a crusade, [[Philip II of France|King Philippe Auguste]] wrote his [[Will and testament|will]] and placed six \"loyal men\" at the head of the provost: Thibaut Le Riche, Athon de Greve, Evrouin Le Changeur, Robert de Chartres, Baudouin Bruneau and Nicolas Boucel.<ref>Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris'', \u00c9ditions Robert Laffont, coll. \u00ab Bouquins \u00bb, 1996, 1 590 <abbr>p.</abbr> ({{ISBN|978-2221078624}}).</ref>\n\nThe ''Livre des m\u00e9tiers'' (Book of [[Tradesman|Trades]]) and the ''Livre de la taille'' (Book of the [[Taille]]), written under the provost of [[\u00c9tienne Boileau]], allow us to better understand this rising bourgeoisie. Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organization of cities. This urban system in Europe dates back for many cities still existing today to [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Latin antiquity]], others were founded around the year one thousand.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Les villes du Moyen \u00c2ge, essai d\u2019histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'', Bruxelles, Lamertin, 1927.

Dans le domaine des techniques, l'arch\u00e9ologie ne cesse de multiplier les preuves de cette situation. (...) Forges, charronnages ou poteries rurales sont, au d\u00e9but du Moyen \u00c2ge, tout \u00e0 fait dans la tradition de l'\u00e2ge du Fer.

Ajoutons que nos campagnes ont conserv\u00e9 parfois jusqu'\u00e0 l'aube de la r\u00e9volution industrielle de vieilles techniques protohistoriques. (...)

Unlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians did not need ''[[Letters of Bourgeoisie]]'' to prove their status. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris intra-muros as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris. There were no other conditions such as heritage, [[oath]] or other, unlike in [[Bourgeois of Brussels|Brussels]] at the same period. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Duties and privileges of the bourgeois of Paris ==\n\nThese privileges were numerous, diverse, verying greatly from decade to decade. The list published in 1884 in ''[[L'Interm\u00e9diaire des chercheurs et curieux]] (''The Intermediate of the Researchers and Curious) give a glimpse on the variety of these privileges. Laurence Croq, who has dedicated a thesis to the study of the notion of the bourgeois of Paris at the 18th century, explains that this status had a [[wikt:polymorphous|polymorphous]] characteristic.<ref>Laurence Croq, ''Les \u00ab Bourgeois de Paris \u00bb au <abbr>xviii<sup>e</sup></abbr> si\u00e8cle.

IX.</ref>\n\nThe bourgeois of Paris enjoyed the right to the noble guard, called for them the bourgeois guard.\n\n== Birth of the bourgeoisie in Paris ==\nThe oldest [[Corporation (feudal Europe)|corporations]] or [[guild]]s in Paris were [[Tailor|clothiers]], [[grocers]], [[haberdasher]]s, and [[Fur clothing|furriers]].\n\nWith the water merchants, heirs of the ''nautes of Lut\u00e8ce'' who exercise the [[monopoly]] that holds the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] for the trade along the [[Seine]], and the ''Grande Boucherie'' (Big Butchery), which reunites the owners of farms of the suburbs and those of salting workshops intra and extramurals, they constitute alongside the [[clergy]] and the [[French nobility|nobility]] a [[Third estate|third power]] that will consecrate in 1357 the Great Ordinance of the [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|provost of the merchants]], [[\u00c9tienne Marcel|Etienne Marcel]], and which will become financially decisive, as the will illustrate the [[Cabochien revolt]].\n\nIn 1190, before going on a crusade, [[Philip II of France|King Philippe Auguste]] wrote his [[Will and testament|will]] and placed six \"loyal men\" at the head of the provost: Thibaut Le Riche, Athon de Greve, Evrouin Le Changeur, Robert de Chartres, Baudouin Bruneau and Nicolas Boucel.<ref>Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris'', \u00c9ditions Robert Laffont, coll. \u00ab Bouquins \u00bb, 1996, 1 590 <abbr>p.</abbr> ({{ISBN|978-2221078624}}).</ref>\n\nThe ''Livre des m\u00e9tiers'' (Book of [[Tradesman|Trades]]) and the ''Livre de la taille'' (Book of the [[Taille]]), written under the provost of [[\u00c9tienne Boileau]], allow us to better understand this rising bourgeoisie. Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organization of cities. This urban system in Europe dates back for many cities still existing today to [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Latin antiquity]], others were founded around the year one thousand.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Les villes du Moyen \u00c2ge, essai d\u2019histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'', Bruxelles, Lamertin, 1927.

It was initially developed and released as a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' [[Game mod|modification]] by [[Minh Le|Minh \"Gooseman\" Le]] and [[Jess Cliffe]] in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. ''Counter-Strike'' was released by Valve on the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform in 2000. The game spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the [[Counter-Strike|''Counter-Strike'' series]]. Several [[Video game remake|remakes]] and [[port (video gaming)|ports]] of ''Counter-Strike'' have been released on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console (by [[Xbox Game Studios|Microsoft Game Studios]]), as well as [[OS X]] and [[Linux]]. It is commonly referred to as '''''Counter-Strike 1.6''''' to distinguish it from other titles of the series, 1.6 being the final major [[software update]] the game received.\n\nSet in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams of the governmental [[Counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] forces and various [[terrorism|terrorist]] militants opposing them. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives or else eliminating all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Counter-Strike screenshot.png|thumb|left|The player standing in the terrorist starting zone of de_dust using a CV-47 ([[AK-47]]).]]\n''Counter-Strike'' is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams [[spawning (computer gaming)|spawning]] simultaneously. All players have only one life by default and start with a pistol as well as a knife.\n\nThe objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:\n:* '''Bomb defusal''': The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n:* '''Hostage rescue''': The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n:* '''Assassination''': One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n\nA player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as \"freeze time\") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral \"buy zones\" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.\n\nStandard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).\n\nThe scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and [[Ping (video gaming)|ping]] (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.\n\nKilled players become \"spectators\" for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of [[Internet cafe]]s and [[Voice over IP]] programs such as [[TeamSpeak]] or [[Ventrilo]]). This form of cheating is known as \"ghosting.\"\n\n== Development ==\n''Counter-Strike'' began as a [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] atop ''Half-Life''{{'}} engine [[GoldSrc]]. Minh Le, the mod's co-creator, had started his last semester at university, and wanted to do something in game development to help give him better job prospects. Throughout university, Le had worked on mods with the ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' engine, and on looking for this latest project, wanted to try something new and opted for GoldSrc. At the onset, Valve had not yet released the [[software development kit]] (SDK) for GoldSrc but affirmed it would be available in a few months, allowing Le to work on the character models in the interim. Once the GoldSrc SDK was available, Le estimated it took him about a month and a half to complete the programming and integrate his models for \"Beta One\" of ''Counter-Strike''. To assist, Le had help from [[Jess Cliffe]] who managed the game's website and community, and had contacts within level map making community to help build some of the levels for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra le 2001\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131481/interview_with_minh_le.php | title = Interview with Minh Le | first = John | last = McLean-Foreman | date = May 30, 2001 | accessdate = April 23, 2019 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190423220435/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131481/interview_with_minh_le.php | archive-date = April 23, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> The theme of countering terrorists was inspired by Le's own interest in guns and the military, and from games like ''Rainbow Six'' and ''Spec Ops''.<ref name=\"gamasutra le 2001\"/>\n\nLe and Cliffe continued to release Betas on a frequent basis for feedback. The initial few Betas, released starting in June 1999, had limited audiences but by the fifth one, interest in the project dramatically grew.<ref name=\"gamasutra le 2001\"/> The interest in the game drew numerous players to the website, which helped Le and Cliffe to make revenue from ads hosted on the site.<ref name=\"retro\">{{cite magazine| title = The Making of Counter-Strike | magazine = [[Retro Gamer]] | volume = 117 | pages = 84\u201387 | year = 2014 }}</ref> Around 2000 at the time of Beta 5's release, the two were approached by Valve, offering to buy the ''Counter-Strike'' [[intellectual property]] and offering both jobs to continue its development.<ref name=\"retro\"/> Both accepted the offer, and by September 2000, Valve released the first non-beta version of the game. While Cliffe stayed with Valve, Le did some additional work towards a ''Counter-Strike 2.0'' based on Valve's upcoming [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]], but left to start his own studio after Valve opted to shelve the sequel.<ref name=\"retro\"/>\n\n''Counter-Strike'' itself is a mod, and it has developed its own community of script writers and mod creators. Some mods add [[Computer game bot|bots]], while others remove features of the game, and others create different modes of play. Some mods, often called \"admin plugins\", give server administrators more flexible and efficient control over their servers. There are some mods which affect gameplay heavily, such as Gun Game, where players start with a basic pistol and must score kills to receive better weapons, and Zombie Mod, where one team consists of zombies and must \"spread the infection\" by killing the other team (using only the knife). There are also Superhero mods which mix the first-person gameplay of ''Counter-Strike'' with an experience system, allowing a player to become more powerful as they continue to play. The game is highly customizable on the player's end, allowing the user to install or even create their own custom skins, HUDs, spray graphics, sprites, and sound effects, given the proper tools.\n\n=== Valve Anti-Cheat ===\n{{Main|Valve Anti-Cheat}}\n\n''Counter-Strike'' has been a target for [[cheating in online games]] since its release. In-game, cheating is often referred to as \"[[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]\" in reference to programs or \"[[hacker (hobbyist)|hacks]]\" executed by the client. Valve has implemented an anti-cheat system called [[Valve Anti-Cheat]] (VAC). Players cheating on a VAC-enabled server risk having their account permanently banned from all VAC-secured servers.\n\nWith the first version of VAC, a ban took hold almost instantly after being detected and the cheater had to wait two years to have the account unbanned. Since VAC's second version, cheaters are not banned automatically. With the second version, Valve instituted a policy of 'delayed bans,' the theory being that if a new hack is developed which circumvents the VAC system, it will spread amongst the 'cheating' community. By delaying the initial ban, Valve hopes to identify and ban as many cheaters as possible. Like any software detection system, some cheats are not detected by VAC. To remedy this, some servers implement a voting system, in which case players can call for a vote to kick or ban the accused cheater. VAC's success at identifying cheats and banning those who use them has also provided a boost in the purchasing of private cheats.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-RADZ-6869 |title=Valve Anti-Cheat System (VAC) |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227222354/https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-RADZ-6869 |archive-date=December 27, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> These cheats are updated frequently to minimize the risk of detection, and are generally only available to a trusted list of recipients who collectively promise not to reveal the underlying design. Even with private cheats however, some servers have alternative anticheats to coincide with VAC itself. This can help with detecting some cheaters, but most paid for cheats are designed to bypass these alternative server-based anticheats.\n\n== Release ==\nIt was first released by Sierra studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petbok.com/cs-1-6-wallhack-2020-with-download-link-100-working/|title=CS 1.6 Wallhack 2020 with Download link 100% Working|last=admin|date=2020-03-25|website=Petbok - Its all about Games and Tech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>When ''Counter-Strike'' was published by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra Studios]],  it was bundled with ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'' multiplayer, and the ''Wanted'', ''Half-Life: Absolute Redemption'' and ''[[Firearms (video game)|Firearms]]'' mods.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" />\n\nOn March 24, 1999, [[Planet Half-Life]] opened its ''Counter-Strike'' section. Within two weeks, the site had received 10,000 hits. On June 19, 1999, the first public beta of ''Counter-Strike'' was released, followed by numerous further \"beta\" releases. On April 12, 2000, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] announced that the ''Counter-Strike'' developers and Valve had teamed up. In January 2013, Valve began testing a version of ''Counter-Strike'' for [[OS X]] and [[Linux]], eventually releasing the update to all users in April 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url =

''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'', a game using ''Counter-Strike's'' [[GoldSrc]] engine, was released in 2004. ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'', a remake of the original ''Counter-Strike'' game, was the first in the series to use Valve's [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]] and was also released in 2004, only eight months after the release of ''Counter-Strike: Condition Zero''. The next game in the ''Counter-Strike'' series to be developed primarily by Valve was ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'', released for Windows, OS X, Linux, [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] in 2012.\n\nThe game also spawned multiple spin-offs in the form of arcade games developed by [[Nexon Corporation]] and targeted primarily at Asian gaming markets. Four ''Counter-Strike'' games have been developed and released by Nexon Corporation thus far, ''[[Counter-Strike Neo]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike Online]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies]]'', and ''[[Counter-Strike Online 2]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of video games derived from modifications]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Counter-Strike series}}\n{{Valve}}\n{{Professional Counter-Strike competition}}\n\n[[Category:2000 video games]]\n[[Category:Asymmetrical multiplayer video games]]\n[[Category:Counter-Strike]]\n[[Category:Esports games]]\n[[Category:First-person shooters]]\n[[Category:GoldSrc games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer online games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Valve Corporation games]]\n[[Category:Censored video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Mexico]]\n[[Category:War video games set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox games]]\n[[Category:Terrorism in fiction]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2018}}\n{{original research|date=June 2019}}\n}}\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2016}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Counter-Strike\n| image = Counter-Strike Box.jpg\n| developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]\n| publisher = {{Unbulleted list|[[Sierra Studios]]|Valve (digital)}}\n| designer = {{Unbulleted list|[[Minh Le]]|[[Jess Cliffe]]}}\n| series = ''[[Counter-Strike]]''\n| engine = [[GoldSrc]]\n| released = {{Collapsible list\n| title = November 9, 2000\n| titlestyle = font-weight:normal;background:transparent;text-align:left;\n| '''Microsoft Windows'''\n| November 9, 2000<ref>{{cite web |url=http://counter-strike.net/ |title=CS V1.0 Released! |first=Jess |last=Cliffe |author-link=Jess Cliffe |date=November 9, 2000 |website=counter-strike.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001201214200/http://counter-strike.net/ |archivedate=1 December 2000 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/counter-strike-10-released/1100-2652037/ |title=Counter-Strike 1.0 Released |first=Trey |last=Walker |date=November 9, 2000 |website=[[GameSpot]] |access-date=July 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515193400/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/counter-strike-10-released/1100-2652037/ |archive-date=May 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/10411/counter-strike-v10 |title=Counter-Strike v1.0 |first=Steve |last=Gibson |date=November 9, 2000 |website=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref>\n| '''Xbox'''\n| {{Video game release|NA|November 18, 2003|EU|December 5, 2003}}\n| '''OS X''', '''Linux'''\n| {{Video game release|WW|January 24, 2013}}\n}}\n| genre = [[First-person shooter]]\n| modes = [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]\n| platforms = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[OS X]], [[Linux]]\n}}\n\n'''''Counter-Strike''''' (also known as '''''Half-Life: Counter-Strike''''') is a [[first-person shooter]] video game developed by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]. It was initially developed and released as a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' [[Game mod|modification]] by [[Minh Le|Minh \"Gooseman\" Le]] and [[Jess Cliffe]] in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. ''Counter-Strike'' was released by Valve on the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform in 2000. The game spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the [[Counter-Strike|''Counter-Strike'' series]]. Several [[Video game remake|remakes]] and [[port (video gaming)|ports]] of ''Counter-Strike'' have been released on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console (by [[Xbox Game Studios|Microsoft Game Studios]]), as well as [[OS X]] and [[Linux]]. It is commonly referred to as '''''Counter-Strike 1.6''''' to distinguish it from other titles of the series, 1.6 being the final major [[software update]] the game received.\n\nSet in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams of the governmental [[Counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] forces and various [[terrorism|terrorist]] militants opposing them. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives or else eliminating all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Counter-Strike screenshot.png|thumb|left|The player standing in the terrorist starting zone of de_dust using a CV-47 ([[AK-47]]).]]\n''Counter-Strike'' is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams [[spawning (computer gaming)|spawning]] simultaneously. All players have only one life by default and start with a pistol as well as a knife.\n\nThe objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:\n:* '''Bomb defusal''': The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n:* '''Hostage rescue''': The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n:* '''Assassination''': One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n\nA player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as \"freeze time\") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral \"buy zones\" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.\n\nStandard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).\n\nThe scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and [[Ping (video gaming)|ping]] (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.\n\nKilled players become \"spectators\" for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of [[Internet cafe]]s and [[Voice over IP]] programs such as [[TeamSpeak]] or [[Ventrilo]]). This form of cheating is known as \"ghosting.\"\n\n== Development ==\n''Counter-Strike'' began as a [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] atop ''Half-Life''{{'}} engine [[GoldSrc]]. Minh Le, the mod's co-creator, had started his last semester at university, and wanted to do something in game development to help give him better job prospects. Throughout university, Le had worked on mods with the ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' engine, and on looking for this latest project, wanted to try something new and opted for GoldSrc. At the onset, Valve had not yet released the [[software development kit]] (SDK) for GoldSrc but affirmed it would be available in a few months, allowing Le to work on the character models in the interim. Once the GoldSrc SDK was available, Le estimated it took him about a month and a half to complete the programming and integrate his models for \"Beta One\" of ''Counter-Strike''. To assist, Le had help from [[Jess Cliffe]] who managed the game's website and community, and had contacts within level map making community to help build some of the levels for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra le 2001\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131481/interview_with_minh_le.php | title = Interview with Minh Le | first = John | last = McLean-Foreman | date = May 30, 2001 | accessdate = April 23, 2019 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190423220435/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131481/interview_with_minh_le.php | archive-date = April 23, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> The theme of countering terrorists was inspired by Le's own interest in guns and the military, and from games like ''Rainbow Six'' and ''Spec Ops''.<ref name=\"gamasutra le 2001\"/>\n\nLe and Cliffe continued to release Betas on a frequent basis for feedback. The initial few Betas, released starting in June 1999, had limited audiences but by the fifth one, interest in the project dramatically grew.<ref name=\"gamasutra le 2001\"/> The interest in the game drew numerous players to the website, which helped Le and Cliffe to make revenue from ads hosted on the site.<ref name=\"retro\">{{cite magazine| title = The Making of Counter-Strike | magazine = [[Retro Gamer]] | volume = 117 | pages = 84\u201387 | year = 2014 }}</ref> Around 2000 at the time of Beta 5's release, the two were approached by Valve, offering to buy the ''Counter-Strike'' [[intellectual property]] and offering both jobs to continue its development.<ref name=\"retro\"/> Both accepted the offer, and by September 2000, Valve released the first non-beta version of the game. While Cliffe stayed with Valve, Le did some additional work towards a ''Counter-Strike 2.0'' based on Valve's upcoming [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]], but left to start his own studio after Valve opted to shelve the sequel.<ref name=\"retro\"/>\n\n''Counter-Strike'' itself is a mod, and it has developed its own community of script writers and mod creators. Some mods add [[Computer game bot|bots]], while others remove features of the game, and others create different modes of play. Some mods, often called \"admin plugins\", give server administrators more flexible and efficient control over their servers. There are some mods which affect gameplay heavily, such as Gun Game, where players start with a basic pistol and must score kills to receive better weapons, and Zombie Mod, where one team consists of zombies and must \"spread the infection\" by killing the other team (using only the knife). There are also Superhero mods which mix the first-person gameplay of ''Counter-Strike'' with an experience system, allowing a player to become more powerful as they continue to play. The game is highly customizable on the player's end, allowing the user to install or even create their own custom skins, HUDs, spray graphics, sprites, and sound effects, given the proper tools.\n\n=== Valve Anti-Cheat ===\n{{Main|Valve Anti-Cheat}}\n\n''Counter-Strike'' has been a target for [[cheating in online games]] since its release. In-game, cheating is often referred to as \"[[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]\" in reference to programs or \"[[hacker (hobbyist)|hacks]]\" executed by the client. Valve has implemented an anti-cheat system called [[Valve Anti-Cheat]] (VAC). Players cheating on a VAC-enabled server risk having their account permanently banned from all VAC-secured servers.\n\nWith the first version of VAC, a ban took hold almost instantly after being detected and the cheater had to wait two years to have the account unbanned. Since VAC's second version, cheaters are not banned automatically. With the second version, Valve instituted a policy of 'delayed bans,' the theory being that if a new hack is developed which circumvents the VAC system, it will spread amongst the 'cheating' community. By delaying the initial ban, Valve hopes to identify and ban as many cheaters as possible. Like any software detection system, some cheats are not detected by VAC. To remedy this, some servers implement a voting system, in which case players can call for a vote to kick or ban the accused cheater. VAC's success at identifying cheats and banning those who use them has also provided a boost in the purchasing of private cheats.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-RADZ-6869 |title=Valve Anti-Cheat System (VAC) |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227222354/https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-RADZ-6869 |archive-date=December 27, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> These cheats are updated frequently to minimize the risk of detection, and are generally only available to a trusted list of recipients who collectively promise not to reveal the underlying design. Even with private cheats however, some servers have alternative anticheats to coincide with VAC itself. This can help with detecting some cheaters, but most paid for cheats are designed to bypass these alternative server-based anticheats.\n\n== Release ==\nWhen ''Counter-Strike'' was published by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra Studios]],  it was bundled with ''[[Team Fortress Classic]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'' multiplayer, and the ''Wanted'', ''Half-Life: Absolute Redemption'' and ''[[Firearms (video game)|Firearms]]'' mods.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" />\n\nOn March 24, 1999, [[Planet Half-Life]] opened its ''Counter-Strike'' section. Within two weeks, the site had received 10,000 hits. On June 19, 1999, the first public beta of ''Counter-Strike'' was released, followed by numerous further \"beta\" releases. On April 12, 2000, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] announced that the ''Counter-Strike'' developers and Valve had teamed up. In January 2013, Valve began testing a version of ''Counter-Strike'' for [[OS X]] and [[Linux]], eventually releasing the update to all users in April 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url =

''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'', a game using ''Counter-Strike's'' [[GoldSrc]] engine, was released in 2004. ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'', a remake of the original ''Counter-Strike'' game, was the first in the series to use Valve's [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]] and was also released in 2004, only eight months after the release of ''Counter-Strike: Condition Zero''. The next game in the ''Counter-Strike'' series to be developed primarily by Valve was ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'', released for Windows, OS X, Linux, [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] in 2012.\n\nThe game also spawned multiple spin-offs in the form of arcade games developed by [[Nexon Corporation]] and targeted primarily at Asian gaming markets. Four ''Counter-Strike'' games have been developed and released by Nexon Corporation thus far, ''[[Counter-Strike Neo]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike Online]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies]]'', and ''[[Counter-Strike Online 2]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of video games derived from modifications]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Counter-Strike series}}\n{{Valve}}\n{{Professional Counter-Strike competition}}\n\n[[Category:2000 video games]]\n[[Category:Asymmetrical multiplayer video games]]\n[[Category:Counter-Strike]]\n[[Category:Esports games]]\n[[Category:First-person shooters]]\n[[Category:GoldSrc games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer online games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Valve Corporation games]]\n[[Category:Censored video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Mexico]]\n[[Category:War video games set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox games]]\n[[Category:Terrorism in fiction]]\n", "name_user": "Fatin90", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I have added more info about the publisher)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike_(video_game)"}

The only Archies song not to feature Ron Dante on lead was 1971's \"Love Is Living In You\", sung by Bob Levine (co-author of the song) and produced by Ritchie Adams. The last single, released 1972, was \"Strangers in the Morning\"; its B-side song was \"Plum Crazy\".\n\n[[Jeff Barry]], [[Andy Kim]], [[Ellie Greenwich]], Susan Morse, [[Ritchie Adams]], Maeretha Stewart, [[Bobby Bloom]] and [[Lesley Miller]], contributed background vocals at various times, with Barry contributing his trademark bass voice (portrayed as being sung by Jughead in the cartoon) on cuts such as \"Jingle Jangle\", \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\", \"A Summer Prayer For Peace\" (which hit number one in South Africa and Scandinavia in 1971), and \"You Little Angel, You\".

Fred Weinberg is an award-winning composer and producer in his own right.

Archies''' is an American fictional band that featured in the animated TV series, ''[[The Archie Show]]''. In the context of the series, the band was founded by vocalist/guitarist [[Archie Andrews]], bassist [[Reggie Mantle]], drummer [[Forsythe \"Jughead\" Jones]], vocalist/keyboardist [[Veronica Lodge]] and vocalist/lead guitarist/percussionist [[Betty Cooper]]. In the cartoons, Veronica is shown playing a large keyboard instrument styled after the X-66, a then-current top-of-the-line organ made by the Hammond Organ Company.\n\nThe music featured in the series was recorded by [[session musician]]s, including [[Ron Dante]] on lead vocals and [[Toni Wine]] on duet and backing vocals.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=49}}</ref> The recordings were released as a series of singles and albums that achieved worldwide chart success.

Every member sings vocals, with Jughead handling the bass voice on a few tracks. Though their singing voices were soft and appropriate for pop vocals, their speaking voices are much different. The roles the teens played in the fictional band were:\n\n* [[Archie Andrews]] \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar\n* [[Reggie Mantle]] \u2013 bass, vocals\n* [[Forsythe \"Jughead\" Jones]] \u2013 drums\n* [[Betty Cooper]] \u2013 vocals, lead guitar, percussion\n* [[Veronica Lodge]] \u2013 vocals, keyboards\n\nOne distribution mode for the Archies' music was embossing [[cardboard record]]s directly onto the back of cereal boxes, which were cut out and played on a turntable (although their music was also available on standard issue LPs and 45s).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4npg_o5Snk|title=Vintage Old 1970's Post Alpha Bits and Honeycombs Cereal Commercial with free record|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKIJKqMTAw|title=YouTube|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 19, 2019}}</ref>.\n\nThough the group no longer appears in animation, they are still frequently used in stories published by [[Archie Comics]]. In 2020, the group made its second live action appearance on ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'', with [[Kevin Keller (comics)|Kevin Keller]] replacing Reggie Mantle.\n\n==Production==\nA set of [[studio musician]]s was assembled by [[Don Kirshner]] in 1968 to perform various songs.

The only Archies song not to feature Ron Dante on lead was 1971's \"Love Is Living In You\", sung by Bob Levine (co-author of the song) and produced by Ritchie Adams. The last single, released 1972, was \"Strangers in the Morning\"; its B-side song was \"Plum Crazy\".\n\n[[Jeff Barry]], [[Andy Kim]], [[Ellie Greenwich]], Susan Morse, [[Ritchie Adams]], Maeretha Stewart, [[Bobby Bloom]] and [[Lesley Miller]], contributed background vocals at various times, with Barry contributing his trademark bass voice (portrayed as being sung by Jughead in the cartoon) on cuts such as \"Jingle Jangle\", \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\", \"A Summer Prayer For Peace\" (which hit number one in South Africa and Scandinavia in 1971), and \"You Little Angel, You\".
