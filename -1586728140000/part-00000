It espoused the more radical forms of [[Jacksonian Democracy]] and published essays by the most prominent writers in America, including and the cause of a democratic, American literature. Contributors included Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, John Greenleaf Whittier, William Cullen Bryant, and Walt Whitman. O'Sullivan was an aggressive reformer in the New York State Legislature, where he led the unsuccessful movement to abolish capital punishment. By 1846, investors were dissatisfied with his poor management, and he lost control of his magazine.<ref>Robert D. Sampson. \"O'Sullivan, John Louis\" ''American National Biography Online'' Feb. 2000</ref>\n\n==\"Manifest destiny\"==\nIn the July\u2013August 1845 issue of the ''Democratic Review'', O'Sullivan published an essay entitled \"Annexation\", which called on the U.S. to admit the [[Republic of Texas]] into the Union. Because of concerns in the Senate over the expansion of the number of slave states and the possibility of war with [[Mexico]], the [[annexation of Texas]] had long been a controversial issue. Congress had voted for annexation early in 1845, but Texas had yet to accept, and opponents were still hoping to block the annexation. O'Sullivan's essay urged that \"It is now time for the opposition to the Annexation of Texas to cease.\" O'Sullivan argued that the United States had a divine mandate to expand throughout North America, writing of \"our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.\" Texas was annexed shortly thereafter, but O'Sullivan's first usage of the phrase \"manifest destiny\" attracted little attention.\n\nO'Sullivan's second use of the phrase became extremely influential. In a column, which appeared in the ''New York Morning News'' on December 27, 1845, O'Sullivan addressed the ongoing [[Oregon boundary dispute|boundary dispute]] with Great Britain in the [[Oregon Country]].\n\n<blockquote>And that claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us.</blockquote>\n\nThat is, O'Sullivan believed that God (\"[[Divine Providence|Providence]]\") had given the United States a mission to spread [[republican democracy]] (\"the great experiment of liberty\") throughout North America. Because Great Britain would not use Oregon for the purposes of spreading democracy, thought O'Sullivan, British claims to the territory could be disregarded. O'Sullivan believed that manifest destiny was a moral ideal (a \"higher law\") that superseded other considerations, including international laws and agreements. He made clear he did not include eastern Canada as part of the destiny, and worked to defuse tensions between the two countries in the 1840s.\n\nO'Sullivan's original conception of manifest destiny was not a call for territorial expansion by force. He believed that the expansion of U.S.-style democracy was inevitable, and would happen without military involvement as [[whites]] (or \"Anglo-Saxons\") emigrated to new regions. O'Sullivan disapproved of U.S. involvement in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, although he came to believe that the outcome would be beneficial to both countries. However, O'Sullivan would eventually submit that the inevitable fate of the Mexican race was to integrate and be lost \"in the superior vigor of the Anglo-Saxon race, or they must utterly perish\".<ref>Miller, R.H., 1970. American imperialism in 1898; the quest for national fulfillment., New York: Wiley, p. 26</ref> Sullivan claimed while the Mexicans may delay their fate, it is only a matter of time when their \"nationality will cease\".<ref>The United States democratic review. v.20 1847 (Washington, D.C.: Langtree and O'Sullivan), p. 100.</ref>\n\nO'Sullivan's phrase provided a label for sentiments which had become particularly popular during the 1840s, but the ideas themselves were not new. O'Sullivan himself had earlier expressed some of these ideas, notably in an 1839 essay entitled \"The Great Nation of Futurity\". O'Sullivan was not the originator of the concept of manifest destiny, but he was one of its foremost advocates.\n\nAt first, O'Sullivan was not aware that he had created a new catch phrase. The term became popular after [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]]  opponents of the Polk administration criticized it. On January 3, 1846, Representative [[Robert Charles Winthrop|Robert Winthrop]] ridiculed the concept in [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], saying \"I suppose the right of a manifest destiny to spread will not be admitted to exist in any nation except the universal [[Yankee]] nation\". Despite this criticism, Democrats embraced the phrase. It caught on so quickly that it was forgotten that O'Sullivan had coined it. It was not until 1927 that historian [[Julius Pratt]] determined that the phrase had originated with O'Sullivan.\n\n==Later years==\nO'Sullivan was at the peak of his fame and influence at the time of the \"manifest destiny\" articles. For example, at a [[Tammany Hall]] victory celebration on January 8, 1845, he proposed erecting a statue to the Democratic Party's founder and hero, [[Andrew Jackson]]. The monument that eventually emerged from his proposal was the famous equestrian statue of Jackson in [[President's Park#Lafayette Square|Lafayette Square]], across from the [[White House]], which was dedicated in 1853.\n\nFinancial troubles abruptly brought an end to his editorial career. The ''New York Morning News'' was losing money, and in May 1846, the paper's investors fired O'Sullivan. The new management was unable to turn things around, and the paper ceased publication in September. Around the same time, O'Sullivan sold the ''Democratic Review'', although he would still occasionally write for the magazine. Now thirty-two years old, he began looking for new opportunities.\n\nO'Sullivan married Susan Kearny Rodgers on October 21, 1846. The couple went to [[Cuba]] for their honeymoon, where one of O'Sullivan's sisters lived. O'Sullivan thereafter became involved in a movement to win Cuban independence from Spanish rule. Composed of Cuban dissidents and American \"[[filibuster (military)|filibusters]]\", the movement hoped to have Cuba annexed to the United States. On May 10, 1848, O'Sullivan had the first of several meetings with President Polk to try to convince the president to buy Cuba from Spain. Polk offered Spain one hundred million dollars for Cuba\u2014the amount suggested by O'Sullivan\u2014but the offer was declined.\n\nO'Sullivan continued to work for Cuban independence, raising money for the failed filibustering expedition of [[Venezuela]]n adventurer [[Narciso L\u00f3pez]]. As a result, O'Sullivan was charged in federal court in New York with violation of the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]]. His trial in March 1852 ended in a [[hung jury]]. Although O'Sullivan's reputation was tarnished, he was appointed by the [[Franklin Pierce|Pierce administration]] as the [[United States Ambassador to Portugal|U.S. Minister to Portugal]], serving from 1854 to 1858. This proved to be his last steady employment; he and his wife would spend the rest of their lives on the edge of poverty.\n\nO'Sullivan opposed the coming of the [[American Civil War]], hoping that a peaceful solution\u2014or a peaceful separation of North and South\u2014could be worked out. In Europe when the war began, O'Sullivan became an active supporter of the [[Confederate States of America]]; he may have been on the Confederate payroll at some point. O'Sullivan wrote a number of pamphlets promoting the Confederate cause, arguing that the presidency had become too powerful and that [[states' rights]] needed to be protected against encroachment by the central government. Although he had earlier supported the \"[[free soil]]\" movement, he now defended the institution of slavery, writing that blacks and whites could not live together in harmony without it. His activities greatly disappointed some of his old friends, including Hawthorne.  Towards the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], O'Sullivan appealed to his southern \"comrades in arms\" to burn [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], stating \"let every man set fire to his own house\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Political Culture of Northern Democrats in the Mid-Nineteenth Century. p.337|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=DmdQh7xsbboC&pg=PA337&lpg=PA337&dq=john+o%27sullivan+confederate+london&source=bl&ots=0nepDFNdTZ&sig=KKFAD7cSjpDhZS_LEbRrTCfX0Nw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy3-31kK_PAhVKOBQKHVAyCGoQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&q=john%20o'sullivan%20confederate%20london&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAfter the War, he spent several more years in self-imposed exile in Europe.\n\nO'Sullivan returned to New York in the late 1870s, where he unsuccessfully tried to use his Democratic contacts to get appointed to some office. His political life, however, was over. After the death of his mother, he became a believer in [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], then a popular religious movement, and claimed to have used the services of one of the [[Fox sisters]] to communicate with the spirits of people such as William Shakespeare.\n\nO'Sullivan suffered a stroke in 1889. He died in obscurity from influenza in a residential hotel in New York City in 1895, just as the phrase \"manifest destiny\" was being revived. He is buried in the [[Moravian Cemetery]] on [[Staten Island]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Politics}}\n*[[Young America movement|Young America Movement]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n*Johannsen, Robert W. \"The Meaning of Manifest Destiny\", in Sam W.

Kircher has been compared to fellow Jesuit [[Roger Boscovich]] and to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] for his enormous range of interests, and has been honoured with the title \"Master of a Hundred Arts\".<ref name=\"Woods108\">Woods, p 108</ref> He taught for more than forty years at the [[Roman College]], where he set up a [[wunderkammer]]. A resurgence of interest in Kircher has occurred within the scholarly community in recent decades.\n\nKircher claimed to have deciphered the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] of the ancient [[Egyptian language]], but most of his assumptions and translations in this field were later found to be incorrect. He did, however, correctly establish the link between the ancient Egyptian and the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages, and some commentators regard him as the founder of [[Egyptology]]. Kircher was also fascinated with [[Sinology]] and wrote an encyclopedia of [[China]], in which he noted the early presence there of [[Nestorian Christians]] while also attempting to establish links with Egypt and Christianity.\n\nKircher's work in geology included studies of [[volcano]]es and [[fossil]]s. One of the first people to observe microbes through a [[microscope]], Kircher was ahead of his time in proposing that the [[Black Death|plague]] was caused by an infectious [[microorganism]] and in suggesting effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Kircher also displayed a keen interest in technology and mechanical inventions; inventions attributed to him include a magnetic clock, various [[automaton]]s and the first [[megaphone]]. The invention of the [[magic lantern]] is often misattributed to Kircher,<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Athanasius-Kircher |title=Athanasius Kircher |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=June 4, 2016 }}</ref> although he did conduct a study of the principles involved in his ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.\n\nA scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by the [[rationalism]] of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and others. In the late 20th century, however, the [[aesthetic]] qualities of his work again began to be appreciated. One modern scholar, Alan Cutler, described Kircher as \"a giant among seventeenth-century scholars\", and \"one of the last thinkers who could rightfully claim all knowledge as his domain\".<ref>Cutler, p 68 <!--quoted by Woods, p 109--></ref> Another scholar, Edward W. Schmidt, referred to Kircher as \"the last [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]\". In ''[[A Man of Misconceptions]],'' his 2012 book about Kircher, John Glassie writes that while \"many of Kircher's actual ideas today seem wildly off-base, if not simply bizarre,\"<ref>John Glassie: A Man of Misconceptions: The Life of an Eccentric in an Age of Change. New York, Riverhead, 2012, p xiv.</ref> he was \"a champion of wonder, a man of awe-inspiring erudition and inventiveness,\" whose work was read \"by the smartest minds of the time.\"<ref>Glassie, p xv</ref>\n\n==Life==\nKircher was born on 2 May in either 1601 or 1602 (he himself did not know) in [[Geisa]], [[Buchonia]], near [[Fulda]], currently [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]]. From his birthplace, he took the epithets ''Bucho, Buchonius'' and ''Fuldensis'' which he sometimes added to his name. He attended the Jesuit College in Fulda from 1614 to 1618, when he entered the [[novitiate]] of the Society.\n\nThe youngest of nine children, Kircher studied volcanoes owing to his passion for rocks and eruptions. He was taught [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] by a [[rabbi]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Wo-w2sl6zEC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=Athanasius+Kircher+hebrew&source=bl&ots=W68Jsjgbt7&sig=0VaBQThyueA2L2ZZ4QSEJs0HGNE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wrAqVbSdNcPasASm44GICQ&ved=0CB8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage|title=A Study of the Life and Works of Athanasius Kircher, \u2018Germanus Incredibilis\u2019: With a Selection of His Unpublished Correspondence and an Annotated Translation of His Autobiography.|last=Fletcher|first=John Edward|date=2011-08-25|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004207120|language=en}}</ref> in addition to his studies at school.

Later, traveling to [[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]], he was caught and nearly [[hanging|hanged]] by a party of Protestant soldiers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nFrom 1622 to 1624 Kircher was sent to begin his [[regency (Jesuit)|regency]] period in [[Koblenz]] as a teacher. This was followed by his assignment to [[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]], where he taught [[mathematics]], Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Syriac]], and produced a show of [[firework]]s and moving scenery for the visiting [[Prince-Elector|Elector]] [[Archbishop of Mainz]], showing early evidence of his interest in [[mechanics|mechanical devices]]. He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Catholic priest|priesthood]] in 1628<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> and became professor of [[ethics]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]], where he also taught Hebrew and Syriac. Beginning in 1628, he also began to show an interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nIn 1631, while still at [[W\u00fcrzburg]], Kircher allegedly had a prophetic vision of bright light and armed men with horses in the city. Wurzburg was shortly afterwards attacked and captured, leading to Kircher being accorded respect for predicting the disaster via astrology, though Kircher himself privately insisted that he had not relied on that art.<ref>Newman & Grafton, 1-2</ref> This was the year that Kircher published his first book (the ''[[Ars Magnesia]]'', reporting his research on [[magnetism]]), but having been caught up in the [[Thirty Years' War]] he was driven to the papal [[University of Avignon]] in [[France]]. In 1633 he was called to [[Vienna]] by the [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] to succeed [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] as Mathematician to the [[Habsburg]] court. On the intervention of [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]], the order was rescinded, and he was sent instead to [[Rome]] to continue with his scholarly work, but he had already embarked for Vienna.\n\nOn the way, his ship was blown off course and he arrived in Rome before he knew of the changed decision. He based himself in the city for the rest of his life, and from 1634<ref>Fletcher 2011, p. 31.</ref> he taught mathematics, [[physics]] and [[Oriental language]]s at the Collegio Romano (now the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]) for several years before being released to devote himself to research. He studied [[malaria]] and the [[Black Death|plague]], amassing a collection of [[Archaeology|antiquities]], which he exhibited along with devices of his own creation in the Museum Kircherianum.\n\nIn 1661, Kircher discovered the ruins of a [[Church (building)|church]] said to have been constructed by [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] on the site of [[Saint Eustace]]'s vision of [[Jesus Christ]] in a stag's horns. He raised money to pay for the church's reconstruction as the ''Santuario della Mentorella'', and his heart was buried in the church on his death.\n\n{{anchor|Published work}}\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Latium.tif|thumb|''Latium'', 1671]]\nKircher published a large number of substantial books on a very wide variety of subjects, such as [[Egyptology]], [[geology]], and [[music theory]]. His [[Syncretism|syncretic]] approach disregarded the boundaries between disciplines which are now conventional: his ''Magnes'', for example, was ostensibly a discussion of [[magnetism]], but also explored other forms of attraction such as [[gravity]] and [[love]]. Perhaps Kircher's best-known work today is his ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652\u201354), a vast study of Egyptology and [[comparative religion]].<ref name=\"Kircher, Athanasius 2008\">\"Kircher, Athanasius.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica from ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite''. (2008).</ref>\n\nHis books, written in [[Latin]], were widely circulated in the 17th century, and they contributed to the dissemination of scientific information to a broader circle of readers. Kircher is not now considered to have made any significant original contributions, although a number of discoveries and inventions (e.g., the [[magic lantern]]) have sometimes been mistakenly attributed to him.<ref name=\"Kircher, Athanasius 2008\"/>\n\nIn his foreword to ''Ars Magna Sciendi Sive Combinatoria'' (The Great Art of Knowledge, or the Combinatorial Art), the inscription reads:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5mqDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA565&ots=sW_IReVdqd&dq=Athanasius%20Kircher%20und%20seine%20erste%20Prager%20Korrespondenz&pg=PA35#v=snippet&q=Athanasius%20Kircher&f=false|page=35|title=Unsolved!

He learned [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in 1633 and published the first grammar of that language in 1636, the ''Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus''. Kircher then broke with Horapollon's interpretation of the language of the hieroglyphs with his ''Lingua aegyptiaca restituta''. Kircher argued that Coptic preserved the last development of [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]].<ref name=\"Frimmer38\"/><ref name=\"Woods109\">Woods, p 109</ref> For this Kircher has been considered the true \"founder of Egyptology\", because his work was conducted \"before the discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]] rendered Egyptian hieroglyphics comprehensible to scholars\".<ref name=\"Woods109\"/> He also recognized the relationship between [[hieratic]] and hieroglyphic scripts.\n\n[[File:oed-aegyp.png|Oedipus Aegyptiacus|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to Kircher's ''Oedipus \u00c6gyptiacus''; the [[Sphinx]], confronted by Kircher's learning, admits he has solved her [[riddle]].]]\n\nBetween 1650 and 1654, Kircher published four volumes of \"translations\" of hieroglyphs in the context of his Coptic studies.<ref name=\"Frimmer38\"/> However, according to Steven Frimmer, \"none of them even remotely fitted the original texts\".<ref name=\"Frimmer38\"/> In ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'', Kircher argued under the impression of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' that [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]] was the language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]], that [[Hermes Trismegistus]] was [[Moses]], and that hieroglyphs were [[occult]] [[symbol]]s which \"cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures.\" This led him to translate simple hieroglyphic texts now known to read as ''\u1e0fd Wsr'' (\"Osiris says\") as \"The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis\"<ref>for such translations, see e.g. his ''Sphinx mystagoga'', p. 49.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Egyptologist Sir [[E.

The data which he collected were later consulted by [[Champollion]] in his successful efforts to decode the script. According to Joseph MacDonnell, it was \"because of Kircher's work that scientists knew what to look for when interpreting the Rosetta stone\".<ref>MacDonnell, p 12 <!--quoted by Woods, p 109--></ref> Another scholar of ancient Egypt, Erik Iversen, concluded:\n{{Blockquote|It is, therefore, Kircher's incontestable merit that he was the first to have discovered the phonetic value of an Egyptian hieroglyph.

In 1667 he published a treatise whose full title was  ''China monumentis, qua sacris qua profanis, nec non variis naturae & artis spectaculis, aliarumque rerum memorabilium argumentis illustrata'', and which is commonly known simply as ''[[China Illustrata]]'', i.e. \"China Illustrated\". It was a work of encyclopedic breadth, combining material of unequal quality, from  accurate [[cartography]] to mythical elements, such as a study of [[dragon]]s. The work drew heavily on the reports of Jesuits working in China, in particular [[Michael Boym]]<ref>{{citation|first=Hartmut |last=Walravens |url=http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf |title=Michael Boym und die Flora Sinensis |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152210/http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref> and [[Martino Martini]].\n\n''China Illustrata'' emphasized the Christian elements of Chinese history, both real and imagined: the book noted the early presence of [[Nestorian Christian]]s (with a Latin translation of the [[Nestorian Stele]] of [[Xi'an]] provided by Boym and his Chinese collaborator, Andrew Zheng),<ref name=tuyl>[http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf ''China Illustrata''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818014556/http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf |date=August 18, 2011 }}; Modern English translation and preface by Dr Charles D. Van Tuyl</ref> but also claimed that the Chinese were descended from the sons of [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]], that [[Confucius]] was Hermes Trismegistus/Moses and that the [[Chinese character]]s were abstracted hieroglyphs.\n\nIn Kircher's system, [[ideogram]]s were inferior to hieroglyphs because they referred to specific ideas rather than to mysterious complexes of ideas, while the signs of the [[Maya civilization#Writing system|Maya]] and [[Aztec]]s were yet lower [[pictogram]]s which referred only to objects. [[Umberto Eco]] comments that this idea reflected and supported the ethnocentric European attitude toward Chinese and native American civilizations;\n\n\"China was presented not as an unknown barbarian to be defeated but as a prodigal son who should return to the home of the common father\". (p.&nbsp;69)\n\n====Biblical studies and exegesis====\nIn 1675, he published ''[[Arca No\u00eb]]'', the results of his research on the biblical [[Noah's Ark|Ark of Noah]] \u2014  following the [[Counter-Reformation]], [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorical interpretation]] was giving way to the study of the Old Testament as literal truth among Scriptural scholars. Kircher analyzed the dimensions of the Ark; based on the number of species known to him (excluding insects and other forms thought to [[spontaneous generation|arise spontaneously]]), he calculated that overcrowding would not have been a problem. He also discussed the logistics of the Ark voyage, speculating on whether extra livestock was brought to feed carnivores and what the daily schedule of feeding and caring for animals must have been.\n\n====Other cultural work====\nKircher was sent the [[Voynich Manuscript]] in 1666 by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in the hope of Kircher being able to decipher it.<ref name=nsa>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf |author=Tiltman, John H. |date=Summer 1967 |title=The Voynich Manuscript: \"The Most Mysterious Manuscript in the World\" |volume=XII |number=3 |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |publisher=NSA Technical Journal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018025101/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf |archivedate=October 18, 2011 }}</ref> The manuscript remained in the Collegio Romano until [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] annexed the [[Papal States]] in 1870, though scepticism as to the authenticity of the story and of the origin of the manuscript itself exists.  In his ''Polygraphia nova'' (1663), Kircher proposed an artificial [[universal language]].\n\n===Physical sciences===\n====Geology====\n[[File:Kircherearthfires.jpg|thumb|250px|Kircher's model of the [[Earth]]'s internal fires, from ''Mundus Subterraneus''.]]\n\nOn a visit to [[southern Italy]] in 1638, the ever-curious Kircher was lowered into the [[Volcano|crater]] of [[Vesuvius]], then on the brink of eruption, to examine its interior. He was also intrigued by the subterranean rumbling which he heard at the [[Strait of Messina]]. His geological and geographical investigations culminated in his ''[[Mundus Subterraneus (book)|Mundus Subterraneus]]'' of 1664, in which he suggested that the [[tide]]s were caused by water moving to and from a subterranean [[ocean]].\n\nKircher was also puzzled by [[fossil]]s. He understood that fossils were the remains of animals. He ascribed large bones to giant races of humans.<ref>Palmer, Douglas (2005) Earth Time: Exploring the Deep Past from Victorian England to the Grand Canyon. Wiley, Chichester. {{ISBN|978-0-470-02221-4}}</ref> Not all the objects which he was attempting to explain were in fact fossils, hence the diversity of explanations.

Additionally, he held that many species were hybrids of other species, for example, [[armadillo]]s from a combination of [[turtle]]s and [[porcupine]]s. He also advocated the theory of [[spontaneous generation]].<ref>O Breidbach, MT Ghiselin (2006) Athanasius Kircher (1602\u20131680) on Noah's Ark: Baroque \"Intelligent Design\" Theory, Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, Volume 57, No. 36, pp. 991\u20131002 <{{cite web|url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/scipubs/pdfs/v57/proccas_v57_n36.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009153435/http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/scipubs/pdfs/v57/proccas_v57_n36.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-09 }}></ref> Because of such hypotheses, some historians have held that Kircher was a proto-evolutionist.<ref>Fairfield Osborn, Henry (1902) From the Greeks to Darwin: An Outline of the Development of the Evolution Idea. MacMillan: London, page 106</ref>\n\n====Medicine====\n[[File:Kircherears.jpg|thumb|right|The [[ear]]s of a human, cow, horse, dog, leopard, cat, rat, pig, sheep and goose illustrated in ''Musurgia Universalis''.]]\n\nKircher took a notably modern approach to the study of [[disease]]s, as early as 1646 using a [[microscope]] to investigate the [[blood]] of [[Black Death|plague]] victims. In his ''Scrutinium Pestis'' of 1658, he noted the presence of \"little worms\" or \"[[animalcules]]\" in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by [[microorganism]]s. The conclusion was correct, although it is likely that what he saw were in fact [[red blood cell|red]] or [[white blood cell|white]] [[blood cell]]s and not the plague agent, ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. He also proposed [[hygiene|hygienic]] measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, [[quarantine]], burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing [[Orthodontic headgear#Facemask and reverse-pull headgear|facemasks]] to prevent the inhalation of [[Microorganism|germ]]s.\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Kirchermagneticclock.jpg|thumb|250px|Kircher's magnetic clock.]]\n\nIn 1646, Kircher published ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'', on the subject of the display of images on a screen using an apparatus similar to the [[magic lantern]] as developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and others. Kircher described the construction of a \"catastrophic lamp\" that used reflection to project images on the wall of a darkened room. Although Kircher did not invent the device, he made improvements over previous models, and suggested methods by which exhibitors could use his device. Much of the significance of his work arises from Kircher's rational approach towards the demystification of projected images.<ref>Musser, p 613</ref>\n\nPreviously such images had been used in Europe to mimic supernatural appearances (Kircher himself cites the use of displayed images by the rabbis in the court of [[King Solomon]]). Kircher stressed that exhibitors should take great care to inform spectators that such images were purely naturalistic, and not magical in origin.\n\nKircher also constructed a [[magnetism|magnetic]] clock, the mechanism of which he explained in his ''Magnes'' (1641). The device had originally been invented by another Jesuit, Fr. [[Linus of Liege]], and was described by an acquaintance of Line's in 1634. Kircher's patron Peiresc had claimed that the clock's motion supported the [[Copernican principle|Copernican]] cosmological model, the argument being that the magnetic sphere in the clock was caused to rotate by the magnetic force of the [[sun]].<ref name=\"Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock\">[http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/kircher/intro.html Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816044854/http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/kircher/intro.html |date=August 16, 2010 }}, accessed 23 Apr 2011</ref>\n\nKircher's model disproved the hypothesis, showing that the motion could be produced by a [[water clock]] in the base of the device. Although Kircher wrote against the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican]] model in his ''Magnes'', supporting instead that of [[Tycho Brahe]], his later ''Itinerarium exstaticum'' (1656, revised 1671), presented several systems&nbsp;\u2014 including the Copernican&nbsp;\u2014 as distinct possibilities. The clock has been reconstructed by Caroline Bouguereau in collaboration with Michael John Gorman and is on display at the Green Library at Stanford University.<ref name=\"Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock\"/>\n\nThe ''Musurgia Universalis'' (1650) sets out Kircher's views on [[music]]: he believed that the [[harmony]] of music reflected the proportions of the [[universe]]. The book includes plans for constructing water-powered [[automatic organ]]s, [[Musical notation|notations]] of [[bird vocalization|birdsong]] and diagrams of [[musical instrument]]s. One illustration shows the differences between the [[ear]]s of humans and other animals. In ''[[Phonurgia Nova]]'' (1673) Kircher considered the possibilities of transmitting music to remote places.\n\nOther machines designed by Kircher include an [[aeolian harp]], [[automaton]]s such as a statue which spoke and listened via a [[speaking tube]], a [[perpetual motion machine]], and a [[Katzenklavier]] (\"cat piano\"). The last of these would have driven spikes into the tails of cats, which would yowl to specified [[Pitch (music)|pitches]], although Kircher is not known to have actually constructed the instrument.\n\nIn ''Phonurgia Nova'', literally new methods of sound production, Kircher examined acoustic phenomena. He explores the use of horns and cones in amplifying sound with architectural applications. He also examines the phenomena of echoes in rooms with domes of different shapes including the muffling effect of an elliptical dome from Heidelberg. In one section he also explores the therapeutic effects of music especially in [[tarantism]], a theme from southern Italy.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1121/1.2992053|title=The 'Phonurgia Nova' of Athanasius Kircher: The Marvellous sound world of 17th century|pages=015002|series=Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics|year=2008|last1=Tronchin|first1=Lamberto|first2=I.|last2= Durvilli |first3= V.|last3= Tarabusi}}</ref>\n\n===Combinatorics===\nAlthough Kircher's work was not mathematically based, he did develop various systems for generating and counting all combinations of a finite collection of objects (i.e., a finite [[Set theory|set]]), based on the previous work of [[Ramon Llull]]. His methods and diagrams are discussed in ''Ars Magna Sciendi, sive Combinatoria'', 1669. They include what may be the first recorded [[graph drawing|drawings]] of [[complete bipartite graph]]s, extending a similar technique used by Llull to visualize [[complete graph]]s.<ref>{{citation|contribution=Two thousand years of combinatorics|first=Donald E.|last=Knuth|authorlink=Donald Knuth|pages=7\u201337|title=Combinatorics: Ancient and Modern|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|editor1-first=Robin|editor1-last=Wilson|editor2-first=John J.|editor2-last=Watkins}}.\n</ref>  Kircher also employed combinatorics in his [[Arca Musarithmica]], an [[aleatoric music]] composition device capable of producing millions of church hymns by combining randomly selected musical phrases.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Turris Babel-Why the Tower Could Not Reach the Moon.jpg|thumb|''Turris Babel'': with typical eclecticism, Kircher illustrates the impossibility of the Tower of Babel having reached the moon, 1679]]\n\n===Scholarly influence===\nFor most of his professional life, Kircher was one of the scientific stars of his world: according to historian Paula Findlen, he was \"the first scholar with a global reputation\". His importance was twofold: to the results of his own [[experiment]]s and research he added information gleaned from his correspondence with over 760 scientists, physicians and above all his fellow Jesuits in all parts of the globe. The ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' calls him a \"one-man intellectual clearing house\". His works, illustrated to his orders, were extremely popular, and he was the first scientist to be able to support himself through the sale of his books. His near-exact contemporary, the English philosopher-physician, [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605\u201382) collected his books avidly while his eldest son Edward Browne in 1665 visited the Jesuit priest resident at Rome. Towards the end of Kircher's life, however, his stock fell, as the [[rationalism|rationalist]] [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartesian]] approach began to dominate (Descartes himself described Kircher as \"more quacksalver than savant\").\n\n===Cultural legacy===\nKircher was largely neglected until the late 20th century. One writer attributes his rediscovery to the similarities between his eclectic approach and [[postmodernism]].\n\nAs few of Kircher's works have been translated, the contemporary emphasis has been on their [[aesthetic]] qualities rather than their actual content, and a succession of exhibitions have highlighted the beauty of their illustrations. Historian [[Anthony Grafton]] has said that \"the staggeringly strange dark continent of Kircher's work [is] the setting for a [[Borges]] story that was never written\", while [[Umberto Eco]] has written about Kircher in his novel ''[[The Island of the Day Before]]'', as well as in his non-fiction works ''[[The Search for the Perfect Language]]'' and ''[[Serendipities]]''. In ''Where Tigers Are At Home'', by [[Jean-Marie Blas de Robl\u00e8s]], the protagonist works on a  translation of a bogus 17th-century biography of  Kircher. The contemporary artist [[Cyb\u00e8le Varela]] has paid tribute to Kircher in her exhibition ''Ad Sidera per Athanasius Kircher'', held in the [[Collegio Romano]], in the same place where the [[Museum Kircherianum]] was.\n\nThe [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] in [[Los Angeles]] has a hall dedicated to the life of Kircher. His ethnographic collection is in the [[Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography]] in Rome.\n\nJohn Glassie's book, ''[[A Man of Misconceptions]],'' traces connections between Kircher and figures such as [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. It also suggests influences on [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Franz Anton Mesmer]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]].\n\nIn the end, Glassie writes, Kircher should be acknowledged \u201cfor his effort to know everything and to share everything he knew, for asking a thousand questions about the world around him, and for getting so many others to ask questions about his answers; for stimulating, as well as confounding and inadvertently amusing, so many minds; for having been a source of so many ideas\u2014right, wrong, half-right, half-baked, ridiculous, beautiful, and all-encompassing.\u201d<ref>Glassie, p 272.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nKircher's life and research are central to the plot of [[James Rollins|James Rollin's]] 2015 novel ''The Bone Labyrinth''.\n\nHe is also mentioned in the Book of Life the 3rd book in the All Souls Trilogy by Deborah Harkness. \n\nHe further appears in two separate episodes in [[Daniel Kehlmann|Daniel Kehlmann's]] novel ''Tyll''.\n\nThe permanent exhibition ''The World Is Bound with Secret Knots'' at the [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] is based on the life and work of Kircher. <ref>[http://mjt.org/exhibits/kircher/Knots.html Exhibition at the museum's website, retrieved July, 2019]</ref>\n\nHe is also a character (though largely off-stage, he is often mentioned by other characters) in the 'Ring of Fire' alternate history megaseries (published by Baen); in it, he was sent back to Germany in the early 1630s, where he became the unofficial pastor of the Catholic church in the temporally-transplanted town of Grantville, Thuringia-Franconia.\n\n<br />\n\n==Bibliography==\nKircher's principal works, in chronological order, are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Kircher has been compared to fellow Jesuit [[Roger Boscovich]] and to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] for his enormous range of interests, and has been honoured with the title \"Master of a Hundred Arts\".<ref name=\"Woods108\">Woods, p 108</ref> He taught for more than forty years at the [[Roman College]], where he set up a [[wunderkammer]]. A resurgence of interest in Kircher has occurred within the scholarly community in recent decades.\n\nKircher claimed to have deciphered the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] of the ancient [[Egyptian language]], but most of his assumptions and translations in this field were later found to be incorrect. He did, however, correctly establish the link between the ancient Egyptian and the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages, and some commentators regard him as the founder of [[Egyptology]]. Kircher was also fascinated with [[Sinology]] and wrote an encyclopedia of [[China]], in which he noted the early presence there of [[Nestorian Christians]] while also attempting to establish links with Egypt and Christianity.\n\nKircher's work in geology included studies of [[volcano]]es and [[fossil]]s. One of the first people to observe microbes through a [[microscope]], Kircher was ahead of his time in proposing that the [[Black Death|plague]] was caused by an infectious [[microorganism]] and in suggesting effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Kircher also displayed a keen interest in technology and mechanical inventions; inventions attributed to him include a magnetic clock, various [[automaton]]s and the first [[megaphone]]. The invention of the [[magic lantern]] is often misattributed to Kircher,<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Athanasius-Kircher |title=Athanasius Kircher |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=June 4, 2016 }}</ref> although he did conduct a study of the principles involved in his ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.\n\nA scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by the [[rationalism]] of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and others. In the late 20th century, however, the [[aesthetic]] qualities of his work again began to be appreciated. One modern scholar, Alan Cutler, described Kircher as \"a giant among seventeenth-century scholars\", and \"one of the last thinkers who could rightfully claim all knowledge as his domain\".<ref>Cutler, p 68 <!--quoted by Woods, p 109--></ref> Another scholar, Edward W. Schmidt, referred to Kircher as \"the last [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]\". In ''[[A Man of Misconceptions]],'' his 2012 book about Kircher, John Glassie writes that while \"many of Kircher's actual ideas today seem wildly off-base, if not simply bizarre,\"<ref>John Glassie: A Man of Misconceptions: The Life of an Eccentric in an Age of Change.

From his birthplace, he took the epithets ''Bucho, Buchonius'' and ''Fuldensis'' which he sometimes added to his name. He attended the Jesuit College in Fulda from 1614 to 1618, when he entered the [[novitiate]] of the Society.\n\nThe youngest of nine children, Kircher studied volcanoes owing to his passion for rocks and eruptions.

Later, traveling to [[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]], he was caught and nearly [[hanging|hanged]] by a party of Protestant soldiers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nFrom 1622 to 1624 Kircher was sent to begin his [[regency (Jesuit)|regency]] period in [[Koblenz]] as a teacher. This was followed by his assignment to [[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]], where he taught [[mathematics]], Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Syriac]], and produced a show of [[firework]]s and moving scenery for the visiting [[Prince-Elector|Elector]] [[Archbishop of Mainz]], showing early evidence of his interest in [[mechanics|mechanical devices]]. He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Catholic priest|priesthood]] in 1628<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> and became professor of [[ethics]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg]], where he also taught Hebrew and Syriac. Beginning in 1628, he also began to show an interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nIn 1631, while still at [[W\u00fcrzburg]], Kircher allegedly had a prophetic vision of bright light and armed men with horses in the city. Wurzburg was shortly afterwards attacked and captured, leading to Kircher being accorded respect for predicting the disaster via astrology, though Kircher himself privately insisted that he had not relied on that art.<ref>Newman & Grafton, 1-2</ref> This was the year that Kircher published his first book (the ''[[Ars Magnesia]]'', reporting his research on [[magnetism]]), but having been caught up in the [[Thirty Years' War]] he was driven to the papal [[University of Avignon]] in [[France]]. In 1633 he was called to [[Vienna]] by the [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] to succeed [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] as Mathematician to the [[Habsburg]] court. On the intervention of [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]], the order was rescinded, and he was sent instead to [[Rome]] to continue with his scholarly work, but he had already embarked for Vienna.\n\nOn the way, his ship was blown off course and he arrived in Rome before he knew of the changed decision. He based himself in the city for the rest of his life, and from 1634<ref>Fletcher 2011, p. 31.</ref> he taught mathematics, [[physics]] and [[Oriental language]]s at the Collegio Romano (now the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]) for several years before being released to devote himself to research. He studied [[malaria]] and the [[Black Death|plague]], amassing a collection of [[Archaeology|antiquities]], which he exhibited along with devices of his own creation in the Museum Kircherianum.\n\nIn 1661, Kircher discovered the ruins of a [[Church (building)|church]] said to have been constructed by [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] on the site of [[Saint Eustace]]'s vision of [[Jesus Christ]] in a stag's horns. He raised money to pay for the church's reconstruction as the ''Santuario della Mentorella'', and his heart was buried in the church on his death.\n\n{{anchor|Published work}}\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Latium.tif|thumb|''Latium'', 1671]]\nKircher published a large number of substantial books on a very wide variety of subjects, such as [[Egyptology]], [[geology]], and [[music theory]]. His [[Syncretism|syncretic]] approach disregarded the boundaries between disciplines which are now conventional: his ''Magnes'', for example, was ostensibly a discussion of [[magnetism]], but also explored other forms of attraction such as [[gravity]] and [[love]]. Perhaps Kircher's best-known work today is his ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652\u201354), a vast study of Egyptology and [[comparative religion]].<ref name=\"Kircher, Athanasius 2008\">\"Kircher, Athanasius.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica from ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite''.

Kircher is not now considered to have made any significant original contributions, although a number of discoveries and inventions (e.g., the [[magic lantern]]) have sometimes been mistakenly attributed to him.<ref name=\"Kircher, Athanasius 2008\"/>\n\nIn his foreword to ''Ars Magna Sciendi Sive Combinatoria'' (The Great Art of Knowledge, or the Combinatorial Art), the inscription reads:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5mqDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA565&ots=sW_IReVdqd&dq=Athanasius%20Kircher%20und%20seine%20erste%20Prager%20Korrespondenz&pg=PA35#v=snippet&q=Athanasius%20Kircher&f=false|page=35|title=Unsolved!

He learned [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in 1633 and published the first grammar of that language in 1636, the ''Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus''. Kircher then broke with Horapollon's interpretation of the language of the hieroglyphs with his ''Lingua aegyptiaca restituta''. Kircher argued that Coptic preserved the last development of [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]].<ref name=\"Frimmer38\"/><ref name=\"Woods109\">Woods, p 109</ref> For this Kircher has been considered the true \"founder of Egyptology\", because his work was conducted \"before the discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]] rendered Egyptian hieroglyphics comprehensible to scholars\".<ref name=\"Woods109\"/> He also recognized the relationship between [[hieratic]] and hieroglyphic scripts.\n\n[[File:oed-aegyp.png|Oedipus Aegyptiacus|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to Kircher's ''Oedipus \u00c6gyptiacus''; the [[Sphinx]], confronted by Kircher's learning, admits he has solved her [[riddle]].]]\n\nBetween 1650 and 1654, Kircher published four volumes of \"translations\" of hieroglyphs in the context of his Coptic studies.<ref name=\"Frimmer38\"/> However, according to Steven Frimmer, \"none of them even remotely fitted the original texts\".<ref name=\"Frimmer38\"/> In ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'', Kircher argued under the impression of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' that [[Egyptian language|ancient Egyptian]] was the language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]], that [[Hermes Trismegistus]] was [[Moses]], and that hieroglyphs were [[occult]] [[symbol]]s which \"cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures.\" This led him to translate simple hieroglyphic texts now known to read as ''\u1e0fd Wsr'' (\"Osiris says\") as \"The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis\"<ref>for such translations, see e.g. his ''Sphinx mystagoga'', p. 49.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Egyptologist Sir [[E.

The data which he collected were later consulted by [[Champollion]] in his successful efforts to decode the script. According to Joseph MacDonnell, it was \"because of Kircher's work that scientists knew what to look for when interpreting the Rosetta stone\".<ref>MacDonnell, p 12 <!--quoted by Woods, p 109--></ref> Another scholar of ancient Egypt, Erik Iversen, concluded:\n{{Blockquote|It is, therefore, Kircher's incontestable merit that he was the first to have discovered the phonetic value of an Egyptian hieroglyph.

In 1667 he published a treatise whose full title was  ''China monumentis, qua sacris qua profanis, nec non variis naturae & artis spectaculis, aliarumque rerum memorabilium argumentis illustrata'', and which is commonly known simply as ''[[China Illustrata]]'', i.e. \"China Illustrated\". It was a work of encyclopedic breadth, combining material of unequal quality, from  accurate [[cartography]] to mythical elements, such as a study of [[dragon]]s. The work drew heavily on the reports of Jesuits working in China, in particular [[Michael Boym]]<ref>{{citation|first=Hartmut |last=Walravens |url=http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf |title=Michael Boym und die Flora Sinensis |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152210/http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref> and [[Martino Martini]].\n\n''China Illustrata'' emphasized the Christian elements of Chinese history, both real and imagined: the book noted the early presence of [[Nestorian Christian]]s (with a Latin translation of the [[Nestorian Stele]] of [[Xi'an]] provided by Boym and his Chinese collaborator, Andrew Zheng),<ref name=tuyl>[http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf ''China Illustrata''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818014556/http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf |date=August 18, 2011 }}; Modern English translation and preface by Dr Charles D. Van Tuyl</ref> but also claimed that the Chinese were descended from the sons of [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]], that [[Confucius]] was Hermes Trismegistus/Moses and that the [[Chinese character]]s were abstracted hieroglyphs.\n\nIn Kircher's system, [[ideogram]]s were inferior to hieroglyphs because they referred to specific ideas rather than to mysterious complexes of ideas, while the signs of the [[Maya civilization#Writing system|Maya]] and [[Aztec]]s were yet lower [[pictogram]]s which referred only to objects. [[Umberto Eco]] comments that this idea reflected and supported the ethnocentric European attitude toward Chinese and native American civilizations;\n\n\"China was presented not as an unknown barbarian to be defeated but as a prodigal son who should return to the home of the common father\". (p.&nbsp;69)\n\n====Biblical studies and exegesis====\nIn 1675, he published ''[[Arca No\u00eb]]'', the results of his research on the biblical [[Noah's Ark|Ark of Noah]] \u2014  following the [[Counter-Reformation]], [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorical interpretation]] was giving way to the study of the Old Testament as literal truth among Scriptural scholars. Kircher analyzed the dimensions of the Ark; based on the number of species known to him (excluding insects and other forms thought to [[spontaneous generation|arise spontaneously]]), he calculated that overcrowding would not have been a problem. He also discussed the logistics of the Ark voyage, speculating on whether extra livestock was brought to feed carnivores and what the daily schedule of feeding and caring for animals must have been.\n\n====Other cultural work====\nKircher was sent the [[Voynich Manuscript]] in 1666 by [[Johannes Marcus Marci]] in the hope of Kircher being able to decipher it.<ref name=nsa>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf |author=Tiltman, John H. |date=Summer 1967 |title=The Voynich Manuscript: \"The Most Mysterious Manuscript in the World\" |volume=XII |number=3 |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |publisher=NSA Technical Journal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018025101/https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf |archivedate=October 18, 2011 }}</ref> The manuscript remained in the Collegio Romano until [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] annexed the [[Papal States]] in 1870, though scepticism as to the authenticity of the story and of the origin of the manuscript itself exists.

He was also intrigued by the subterranean rumbling which he heard at the [[Strait of Messina]]. His geological and geographical investigations culminated in his ''[[Mundus Subterraneus (book)|Mundus Subterraneus]]'' of 1664, in which he suggested that the [[tide]]s were caused by water moving to and from a subterranean [[ocean]].\n\nKircher was also puzzled by [[fossil]]s. He understood that fossils were the remains of animals. He ascribed large bones to giant races of humans.<ref>Palmer, Douglas (2005) Earth Time: Exploring the Deep Past from Victorian England to the Grand Canyon. Wiley, Chichester. {{ISBN|978-0-470-02221-4}}</ref> Not all the objects which he was attempting to explain were in fact fossils, hence the diversity of explanations.

In his ''Scrutinium Pestis'' of 1658, he noted the presence of \"little worms\" or \"[[animalcules]]\" in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by [[microorganism]]s. The conclusion was correct, although it is likely that what he saw were in fact [[red blood cell|red]] or [[white blood cell|white]] [[blood cell]]s and not the plague agent, ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. He also proposed [[hygiene|hygienic]] measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, [[quarantine]], burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing [[Orthodontic headgear#Facemask and reverse-pull headgear|facemasks]] to prevent the inhalation of [[Microorganism|germ]]s.\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Kirchermagneticclock.jpg|thumb|250px|Kircher's magnetic clock.]]\n\nIn 1646, Kircher published ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'', on the subject of the display of images on a screen using an apparatus similar to the [[magic lantern]] as developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and others. Kircher described the construction of a \"catastrophic lamp\" that used reflection to project images on the wall of a darkened room. Although Kircher did not invent the device, he made improvements over previous models, and suggested methods by which exhibitors could use his device. Much of the significance of his work arises from Kircher's rational approach towards the demystification of projected images.<ref>Musser, p 613</ref>\n\nPreviously such images had been used in Europe to mimic supernatural appearances (Kircher himself cites the use of displayed images by the rabbis in the court of [[King Solomon]]). Kircher stressed that exhibitors should take great care to inform spectators that such images were purely naturalistic, and not magical in origin.\n\nKircher also constructed a [[magnetism|magnetic]] clock, the mechanism of which he explained in his ''Magnes'' (1641). The device had originally been invented by another Jesuit, Fr. [[Linus of Liege]], and was described by an acquaintance of Line's in 1634. Kircher's patron Peiresc had claimed that the clock's motion supported the [[Copernican principle|Copernican]] cosmological model, the argument being that the magnetic sphere in the clock was caused to rotate by the magnetic force of the [[sun]].<ref name=\"Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock\">[http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/kircher/intro.html Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816044854/http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/kircher/intro.html |date=August 16, 2010 }}, accessed 23 Apr 2011</ref>\n\nKircher's model disproved the hypothesis, showing that the motion could be produced by a [[water clock]] in the base of the device. Although Kircher wrote against the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican]] model in his ''Magnes'', supporting instead that of [[Tycho Brahe]], his later ''Itinerarium exstaticum'' (1656, revised 1671), presented several systems&nbsp;\u2014 including the Copernican&nbsp;\u2014 as distinct possibilities. The clock has been reconstructed by Caroline Bouguereau in collaboration with Michael John Gorman and is on display at the Green Library at Stanford University.<ref name=\"Athanasius Kircher's Magnetic Clock\"/>\n\nThe ''Musurgia Universalis'' (1650) sets out Kircher's views on [[music]]: he believed that the [[harmony]] of music reflected the proportions of the [[universe]]. The book includes plans for constructing water-powered [[automatic organ]]s, [[Musical notation|notations]] of [[bird vocalization|birdsong]] and diagrams of [[musical instrument]]s. One illustration shows the differences between the [[ear]]s of humans and other animals. In ''[[Phonurgia Nova]]'' (1673) Kircher considered the possibilities of transmitting music to remote places.\n\nOther machines designed by Kircher include an [[aeolian harp]], [[automaton]]s such as a statue which spoke and listened via a [[speaking tube]], a [[perpetual motion machine]], and a [[Katzenklavier]] (\"cat piano\"). The last of these would have driven spikes into the tails of cats, which would yowl to specified [[Pitch (music)|pitches]], although Kircher is not known to have actually constructed the instrument.\n\nIn ''Phonurgia Nova'', literally new methods of sound production, Kircher examined acoustic phenomena. He explores the use of horns and cones in amplifying sound with architectural applications. He also examines the phenomena of echoes in rooms with domes of different shapes including the muffling effect of an elliptical dome from Heidelberg. In one section he also explores the therapeutic effects of music especially in [[tarantism]], a theme from southern Italy.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1121/1.2992053|title=The 'Phonurgia Nova' of Athanasius Kircher: The Marvellous sound world of 17th century|pages=015002|series=Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics|year=2008|last1=Tronchin|first1=Lamberto|first2=I.|last2= Durvilli |first3= V.|last3= Tarabusi}}</ref>\n\n===Combinatorics===\nAlthough Kircher's work was not mathematically based, he did develop various systems for generating and counting all combinations of a finite collection of objects (i.e., a finite [[Set theory|set]]), based on the previous work of [[Ramon Llull]]. His methods and diagrams are discussed in ''Ars Magna Sciendi, sive Combinatoria'', 1669. They include what may be the first recorded [[graph drawing|drawings]] of [[complete bipartite graph]]s, extending a similar technique used by Llull to visualize [[complete graph]]s.<ref>{{citation|contribution=Two thousand years of combinatorics|first=Donald E.|last=Knuth|authorlink=Donald Knuth|pages=7\u201337|title=Combinatorics: Ancient and Modern|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|editor1-first=Robin|editor1-last=Wilson|editor2-first=John J.|editor2-last=Watkins}}.\n</ref>  Kircher also employed combinatorics in his [[Arca Musarithmica]], an [[aleatoric music]] composition device capable of producing millions of church hymns by combining randomly selected musical phrases.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Turris Babel-Why the Tower Could Not Reach the Moon.jpg|thumb|''Turris Babel'': with typical eclecticism, Kircher illustrates the impossibility of the Tower of Babel having reached the moon, 1679]]\n\n===Scholarly influence===\nFor most of his professional life, Kircher was one of the scientific stars of his world: according to historian Paula Findlen, he was \"the first scholar with a global reputation\". His importance was twofold: to the results of his own [[experiment]]s and research he added information gleaned from his correspondence with over 760 scientists, physicians and above all his fellow Jesuits in all parts of the globe. The ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' calls him a \"one-man intellectual clearing house\". His works, illustrated to his orders, were extremely popular, and he was the first scientist to be able to support himself through the sale of his books. His near-exact contemporary, the English philosopher-physician, [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605\u201382) collected his books avidly while his eldest son Edward Browne in 1665 visited the Jesuit priest resident at Rome. Towards the end of Kircher's life, however, his stock fell, as the [[rationalism|rationalist]] [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartesian]] approach began to dominate (Descartes himself described Kircher as \"more quacksalver than savant\").\n\n===Cultural legacy===\nKircher was largely neglected until the late 20th century. One writer attributes his rediscovery to the similarities between his eclectic approach and [[postmodernism]].\n\nAs few of Kircher's works have been translated, the contemporary emphasis has been on their [[aesthetic]] qualities rather than their actual content, and a succession of exhibitions have highlighted the beauty of their illustrations. Historian [[Anthony Grafton]] has said that \"the staggeringly strange dark continent of Kircher's work [is] the setting for a [[Borges]] story that was never written\", while [[Umberto Eco]] has written about Kircher in his novel ''[[The Island of the Day Before]]'', as well as in his non-fiction works ''[[The Search for the Perfect Language]]'' and ''[[Serendipities]]''. In ''Where Tigers Are At Home'', by [[Jean-Marie Blas de Robl\u00e8s]], the protagonist works on a  translation of a bogus 17th-century biography of  Kircher. The contemporary artist [[Cyb\u00e8le Varela]] has paid tribute to Kircher in her exhibition ''Ad Sidera per Athanasius Kircher'', held in the [[Collegio Romano]], in the same place where the [[Museum Kircherianum]] was.\n\nThe [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] in [[Los Angeles]] has a hall dedicated to the life of Kircher. His ethnographic collection is in the [[Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography]] in Rome.\n\nJohn Glassie's book, ''[[A Man of Misconceptions]],'' traces connections between Kircher and figures such as [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. It also suggests influences on [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Franz Anton Mesmer]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]].\n\nIn the end, Glassie writes, Kircher should be acknowledged \u201cfor his effort to know everything and to share everything he knew, for asking a thousand questions about the world around him, and for getting so many others to ask questions about his answers; for stimulating, as well as confounding and inadvertently amusing, so many minds; for having been a source of so many ideas\u2014right, wrong, half-right, half-baked, ridiculous, beautiful, and all-encompassing.\u201d<ref>Glassie, p 272.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nKircher's life and research are central to the plot of [[James Rollins|James Rollin's]] 2015 novel ''The Bone Labyrinth''.\n\nHe is also mentioned in the Book of Life the 3rd book in the All Souls Trilogy by Deborah Harkness. \n\nHe further appears in two separate episodes in [[Daniel Kehlmann|Daniel Kehlmann's]] novel ''Tyll''.\n\nThe permanent exhibition ''The World Is Bound with Secret Knots'' at the [[Museum of Jurassic Technology]] is based on the life and work of Kircher. <ref>[http://mjt.org/exhibits/kircher/Knots.html Exhibition at the museum's website, retrieved July, 2019]</ref>\n\nHe is also a character (though largely off-stage, he is often mentioned by other characters) in the 'Ring of Fire' alternate history megaseries (published by Baen); in it, he was sent back to Germany in the early 1630s, where he became the unofficial pastor of the Catholic church in the temporally-transplanted town of Grantville, Thuringia-Franconia.\n\n<br />\n\n==Bibliography==\nKircher's principal works, in chronological order, are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He had been a prominent member of the [[Populares|populist faction]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna|Cinna]] and [[Gaius Marius|Marius]]. During the latter years of the [[Sulla's Second Civil War|civil war]] he was sent to recover the Iberian Peninsula. When his faction lost the war he was [[Proscription|proscribed]] (outlawed) by the dictator [[Sulla]]. Supported by a majority of the native Spanish tribes, Sertorius skillfuly used [[irregular warfare]] to repeatedly defeat various commanders sent by Rome to subdue him. He was never decisively beaten on the battlefield and remained a thorn in the Senate's side until his murder in 72 BC.\n\nThe Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] dedicated one of his [[Parallel Lives]] to Sertorius; in it he pairs Sertorius with [[Eumenes]]. Like Eumenes, Sertorius was betrayed by his own men.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Parallel Lives, Life of Sertorius''; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', {{ISBN|1-84884-787-4}}</ref><ref name=\"britannica\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/535908/Quintus-Sertorius \"Quintus Sertorius\"]. ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]''.</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nSertorius was born in [[Nursia]] (a town which citizens had received Roman citizenship in 268 BC) in [[Sabine]] territory. We do not know exactly when Sertorius was born, but best estimates are in the range of 127-118 BC.<ref>Generally 123 BC is used as his year of birth.</ref> The Sertorius family were minor aristocrats, almost certainly [[Equites Romani]], the class directly below the senatorial class. His father died before he became of age and his mother, Rhae, focused all her energies on raising her only son. She made sure he received the best education possible for a young man of his status. In return, according to Plutarch, he became excessively fond of his mother. Like many other young ''domi nobiles'' Sertorius moved to Rome in his mid-to-late teens trying to make it big as an orator and jurist.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 2-3.</ref> \n\nHe made enough of an impression on the young Cicero to merit a special mention in a later treatise on oratory:\n\n::Of all the totally illiterate and crude orators, well, actually ranters, I ever knew \u2013 and I might as well add 'completely coarse and rustic' \u2013 the roughest and readiest were Q. Sertorius ...<ref>Cicero, ''Brutus'', 180.</ref>\n\nAfter his undistinguished career in [[Rome]] as a [[jurist]] and an [[orator]], he entered the military. His first recorded campaign was under [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]] and ended at the [[Battle of Arausio]] in 105 BC, where he showed unusual courage. Serving under [[Gaius Marius]], Sertorius succeeded in spying on the wandering Germanic tribes that had defeated Caepio.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.57; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 6-7; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 3.</ref> After this success, he almost certainly fought at the great [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]] (now [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[France]]) in 102 BC in which the [[Teutones]] and the [[Ambrones]] were decisively defeated.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.11.</ref> He probably also fought at the [[battle of Vercellae]] in 101 BC where the [[Cimbri]] were decisively defeated ending the German invasion.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.15.</ref> A few years after the [[Cimbrian War|Cimbric wars]] Sertorius's patron Gaius Marius fell out of grace for his support of the demagogue [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] and he and Sertorius had to get out of Rome for a while. Sertorius went to the [[Hispania Ulterior]] as a military [[tribune]] under [[Titus Didius]]. There he was rewarded with the [[Grass Crown]] for crushing an insurrection in and around [[Castulo]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Marius'', 27; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.17.</ref>\n\n==Social War and Civil War==\n{{main|Social War (91-88 BC)|Sulla's first civil war|Sulla's second civil war}}\nIn 91 BC, he was elected [[quaestor]] and served in [[Cisalpine Gaul]], where he was in charge of recruiting and training legionaries for the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]]. During the war he sustained a wound that cost him the use of one of his eyes.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p. 22; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 8.</ref> \n::Sertorius used his wounds as personal propaganda. Being scarred in the face had its advantages. 'Other men, he used to say, could not always carry about them the evidence of their heroic achievements. Their tokens, wreaths and spears of honour must at some times be set aside. His proof of valour remained with him at all times.'<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 8.</ref>\nUpon his return to Rome he ran for [[tribune of the Plebs]], but [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] thwarted his efforts (for reasons unknown, but probably because he was in Marius's [[Client (Roman)|clientele]] and Sulla and Marius were at odds), causing Sertorius to oppose Sulla.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 164.</ref> Sertorius, however, did manage to become a senator on the strength of his earlier quaestorship.\n\nIn 88 BC, after being sidelined by his political opponents, Sulla [[Sulla's first civil war|marched his legions on Rome]] and took the capital. He took revenge on his enemies and forced Marius into exile, Sulla then left Italy to fight the [[First Mithridatic War]] against [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]]. After Sulla left, violence erupted between the [[optimates]], led by the consul [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]], and the [[populares]], led by the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]]. Sertorius, being a former subordinate of Marius, declared for Cinna and the populares.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p.26</ref> When Cinna was driven from Rome he and Sertorius started recruiting ex-legionaries and drumming up enough support to enable them, in their turn, to march on Rome. Though he had a very bad opinion of Marius by then, he consented to Marius's return upon understanding that Marius came at Cinna's request and not of his own accord.\n\n::Oh, really? Here I was thinking that Marius had decided for himself to come to Italy, and so I was trying to decide what good it would do. But it turns out there's nothing to discuss. Since after all, you invited him, then you have to receive and employ him. There's no question about it.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 5.</ref>\n\nIn October of 87 BC, Cinna marched on Rome, Sertorius commanded one of Cinna's divisions and fought a battle with troops commanded by [[Pompeius Strabo]].<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p.20; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.111; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p.27.</ref> After Octavius surrendered Rome to the forces of Marius, Cinna, and Sertorius, Sertorius abstained from the [[proscriptions]] his fellow commanders engaged in. Sertorius went so far as to rebuke Marius, and move Cinna to moderation.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 114.</ref> After Marius' death he annihilated Marius' slave army which was still terrorizing Rome.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 28-29; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe years 87-84 BC are often described as spent 'waiting for Sulla'.<ref>E. Badian, ''Waiting for Sulla, Journal of Roman Studies, vol 52 (1962)'', pp 47-61.</ref> Marius died in January 86 BC. Cinna was murdered in 84 BC, lynched by his own troops. It is probable that Sertorius became praetor in the year Cinna died.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 29-31.</ref> \n\nOn Sulla's return from the East in 83 BC a [[Sulla's second civil war|second civil war]] broke out. Sertorius, a praetor now, was called upon to serve in the government's armies. When the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (consul 83 BC)|Scipio Asiaticus]] marched against Sulla, Sertorius was part of his staff. Sulla arrived in [[Campania]] and found the other consul, [[Gaius Norbanus]], blocking the road to [[Capua]]. At the [[Battle of Mount Tifata]] Sulla inflicted a crushing defeat on Norbanus, with Norbanus losing six thousand of his men to Sulla's seventy.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.162; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 133.</ref>  The beaten Norbanus withdrew with the remnants of his army to [[Capua]]. Sulla was stopped in his pursuit by Scipio's advance. However, Scipio was unwilling to risk a battle and started negotiations. Sertorius did not trust Sulla, and advised Scipio to force a decisive action. Instead he was sent to Norbanus to explain that an armistice was in force and negotiations were underway. Sertorius made a detour along his way and captured the town of Suessa which had gone over to Sulla. When Sulla complained to Scipio about this breach of trust he was given back his hostages as a sign of good faith. This behavior of their commander caused Scipio's troops to lose faith in him. Unwilling to fight Sulla's battle hardened veterans they defected. Scipio and his son were found cowering in their tents and brought to Sulla, who released them after extracting a promise that they would never again fight against him or rejoin Carbo.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 32-33; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 162-165; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 133-134.</ref>  In 82 BC, Marius' son, [[Gaius Marius the Younger]], became consul without having held the offices which a candidate for the consulship should have held, and at the unconstitutional age of 27. Sertorius, who probably qualified for the office, objected but his opinion was ignored.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 32.</ref> Plutarch sums up the events:\n\n:: Cinna was murdered and against the wishes of Sertorius, and against the law, the younger Marius took the consulship while [ineffectual] men as Carbo, Norbanus and Scipio had no success in stopping Sulla's advance on Rome, so the Marian cause was being ruined and lost; cowardice and weakness by the generals played its part, and treachery did the rest, and there was no reason why Sertorius should stay to watch things going from bad to worse through the inferior judgement of men with superior power.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref>\n\n==Propraetor of Hispania and Fugitive==\n[[File:Hispania 1a division provincial.PNG|right|290px|thumb|Iberia, showing the Roman Provinces in the time of Sertorius.]]\nAfter having fallen out with the new populares leadership Sertorius was sent to [[Hispania]] as [[propraetor]], representing the Cinna-Marian faction and their cause in Spain.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 32-33; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> When Sertorius marched through the [[Pyrenee Mountains|Pyrenees mountain range]] he ran into severe weather and a mountain tribe which demanded a tribute for allowing his passage. His companions indignantly claimed it was an outrage; but while they considered it disgraceful to give in to extortion, Sertorius simply paid the tribe and commented that he was buying himself time, and that if a man had a lot to do, nothing is more precious than time.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 52; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> The governor of the two Spanish provinces, [[Hispania Ulterior]] and [[Hispania Citerior]], [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus (consul)|Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] did not recognize his authority, but Sertorius had an army at his back and used it to assume control. Then he persuaded the local chieftans of accepting him as the new governor and endeared himself with the general population by cutting taxes.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 53; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> After gaining control of both provinces Sertorius sought to hold them by sending an army, under Julius Salinator, to fortify the pass through the Pyrenees; however, Sulla's forces, under the command of Gaius Annius Luscus, broke through after Salinator was assassinated by Calpurnius Lanarius, who defected to the Sullans.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 57; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 7.</ref>\n\nUnable to convince the Spanish tribes to fight for him, Sertorius was seriously outnumbered and he decided to abandon his provinces. With 3,000 of his most loyal followers he fled to [[Mauritania]], but was driven off by the locals who wanted no part of his rebellion.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 57-58.</ref> He then fell in with a band of [[Cilician pirates]] who were pillaging the Spanish coast. Together they attacked and took [[Pityusic Islands|Pityussa]], the most southerly of the [[Balearic Islands]], which they started using as a base. When this was reported to Annius Luscus, he sent a fleet of warships and almost a full legion which drove Sertorius and his pirate allies from the Balearics.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 59.</ref> The pirates defected and went to Africa to help install the tyrant Ascalis<ref>A local client of Sulla</ref> on the throne of [[Tangier|Tingis]]. Sertorius followed them to Africa, rallied the locals around Tingis, who were unhappy with Ascalis for they saw him as a puppet of Sulla, and defeated Ascalis's men and the pirates in battle.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 60-61.</ref>\n\nAfter gaining control over Tingis Sertorius defeated Paccianus, one of Sulla's generals, who had been sent to put Ascalis on the throne.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 60-61; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 9.</ref>\n\nLocal legend had it that [[Antaeus]], the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Gaia]], and the husband of Tinge who gave name to Tingis, was buried in Mauritania. Sertorius had the tomb excavated for he wanted to see the body of Antaeus which was reported to be sixty cubits<ref>Sixty cubits is about ninety feet.</ref> in size. According to Plutarch, Sertorius was dumbfounded by what he saw and after performing a sacrifice, he filled the tomb up again, and thereafter was among those promoting its traditions and honours.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 9.</ref>\n\nThe North African success won him the fame and admiration of the [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|people of Hispania]], particularly that of the warlike [[Lusitanians]] in the west, whom Roman generals and proconsuls of Sulla's party had plundered and oppressed. The Lusitanians, being treatened by a Sullan governor again, asked Sertorius to be their war leader. Sertorius decided to accept the Lusitanian offer and prepared his army and fleet to return to Hispania.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 63.</ref>\n\n==Sertorian War==\n{{Main|Sertorian War}}\n[[File:Gerard van Kuijl - Quintus Sertorius and the horse tail 1638.jpg|thumb|Quintus Sertorius and the horse tail, by [[Gerard van der Kuijl]], 1638]]\nOn a moonless night in the year 80 BC, Sertorius sailed his forces from Tingis across the Gibraltar strait back to Hispania.<ref>He chose a moonless night in order to remain undetected, but was detected nevertheless.</ref> A small fleet from the coastal town of Mellaria tried to stop him, but he pushed them aside and landed his army at the small fishing town of Baelo near the [[Pillars of Hercules]].<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 63-64.</ref> After being reinforced by the Lusitanians he marched on Fufidius, the local Roman governor, intend on defeating him to strengthen his support and prestige. At the [[Battle of the Baetis River]], fought at the Baetis estuary, he defeated Fufidius and started to consolidate his power in Hispania.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 64-65.</ref>\n\nBrave, noble, and gifted with eloquence, Sertorius was just the man to impress the native warriors, whom he organized into an army. They spoke of him as the \"new [[Hannibal]]\" whom he resembled physically (having one eye) and in military skill; he was an extraordinary general who repeatedly defeated forces many times his own force's size. Many Roman and Italian refugees and deserters joined him, and with these and his Spanish and African volunteers and mercenaries he completely defeated several of Sulla's generals (Fufidius, [[Marcus Domitius Calvinus (praetor 80 BC)|Domitius Calvinus]] and to some less-direct extent Thorius and Manlius). In 77 BC he drove [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] the proconsul of Hispania Ulterior, who had been given a proconsular command specifically to defeat him, out of his own province.\n\nIn 76 BC, after Sertorius had been reinforced by the rebel army of [[Marcus Perperna Vento|Marcus Perperna]], the Roman Senate resorted to giving an extraordinary command (pro consulibus) to [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus]] to help out Metellus who was doing miserably against Sertorius.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 17.</ref> Pompey recruited a large army from among his father's and Sulla's veterans and marched to Spain. Confident of success he engaged Sertorius at the [[Battle of Lauron]] in eastern Spain only to suffer a major defeat.<ref>Frontinus, ''Stratagems'', 2.5.31; Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 18.3; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 18; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 96-101.</ref>\n\nThe turning point came in 75 BC when Pompey and Metellus started scoring victories against Sertorius's subordinates. Pompey defeated Sertorius's legates [[Marcus Perperna Vento|Perperna]] and Herrenius at the [[Battle of Valentia 75 BC|Battle of Valentia]]<ref>Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.48; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 117-118.</ref> and Metellus defeated [[Lucius Hirtuleius|Hirtuleius]] at the [[Battle of Italica]]<ref>Livy, ''Epitome'', 91.4; Frontinus, ''Stratagems'', 2.1.2 and 2.3.5; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p.47; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp.118-119.</ref>. Sertorius then ruined his army at the [[Battle of Sucro]]<ref>[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', 1.110; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 19; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'', 18.</ref> and the [[Battle of Saguntum (75 BC)|Battle of Saguntum]]<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 21.</ref>, forcing him on the defensive. From then on Sertorius refrained from fighting battles and reverted to guerrilla warfare. Although Pompey and Metellus had gained the initiative the war was far from over. Sertorius still enjoyed the support of the inland tribes and their warriors still flocked to his cause.\n\nSertorius owed some of his success to his prodigious ability as a statesman. His goal was to build a stable government in Hispania with the consent and co-operation of the people, whom he wished to [[civilize]] along the lines of the Roman model. He established a senate of 300 members, drawn from Roman emigrants (probably also including some from the highest aristocrats of Hispania) and kept a Hispanian bodyguard. For the children of the chief native families he provided a school at Osca ([[Huesca]]), where they received a Roman education and even adopted the dress and education of Roman youths. This followed the Roman practice of taking [[hostage]]s. Late in his campaigns, a revolt of the native people arose and Sertorius killed several of the children that he had sent to school at Osca, selling many others into slavery.<ref name=plutarch>[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/lives/chapter41.html Sertorius], by [[Plutarch]]</ref>\n[[File:Setorius and the Example of the Horses, after Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|400px|left|''Sertorius and the Example of the Horses'', after [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. The drawing illustrates the example Sertorius gave to his followers that in the same way a horse's tail can be picked out hair by hair but not pulled out all at once, so smaller forces could defeat the Roman armies.<ref>Christian M\u00fcller in ''Hans Holbein the Younger: The Basel Years, 1515\u20131532,'' Christian M\u00fcller; Stephan Kemperdick; Maryan Ainsworth; ''et al'', Munich: Prestel, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3580-3}}, {{nowrap|pp. 263\u201364}}.</ref>]]\nAlthough he was strict and severe with his soldiers, he was particularly considerate to the people in general, and made their burdens as light as possible. It seems clear that he had a peculiar gift for evoking the enthusiasm of the native tribes, and we can understand well how he was able to use a famous white fawn, a present from one of the natives that was supposed to communicate to him the advice of the goddess [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], to his advantage.\n\n[[File:White Fawn Drawing.jpg|right|thumb|Sertorius claimed to receive messages from [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] via a white fawn.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>]]\n::Spanus, one of the commononers who lived in the country came across a doe trying to escape from hunters. The doe fled faster than he could pursue, but the animal had newly given birth. He [Spanus] was struck by the unusual colour of the fawn, for it was pure white. He pursued and caught it.\nAs it happened, Sertorius was in the area, and it was known that he amply rewarded those who brought him game and produce. So Spanus gave the fawn to Sertorius, who at that time felt only the usual pleasure of one who receives such gift. \nAfter a while the animal became so tame and well-trained that it came when he called it, and followed him on his walks without minding the crowds and bustle of life in camp. [That the fawn did this tells us something more about the character of Sertorius.] Eventually it occurred to him that the barbarians easily fall into superstition, so he started to give the fawn religious significance.\nHe announced that the doe had been sent by [the goddess] Diana, and solemnly claimed that through the doe she revealed hidden information to him. He helped the idea along by various tricks. If he heard of an enemy raid into his territory, or an attempt to subvert a city from its allegiance to him, he would claim that the fawn had told him of this in a dream, and tell his men to prepare.\nOr when his commanders sent him messages of victory, he would hide the messenger and bring out the white fawn wearing celebratory garlands. He would sacrifice to the gods, and tell his men to celebrate because they would soon hear something good had happened.\nBy such stratagems he persuaded his people they were not by the fallible wisdom of some foreigner, but by divine power. So the people were made tractable and all the more ready to help him with his plans, and consequently the extraordinary growth of Sertorius's power led to reinforcing this belief.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 11</ref>\n\nFor six years he held sway over Hispania. In 76 BC, he was joined \u2014 at the insistence of the forces he brought with him \u2014 by [[Marcus Perpenna Vento]] from Rome, with a following of Roman and Italian aristocrats and a sizeable Roman-style army of fifty-three [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]].<ref name=plutarch/> In the same year, [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (now better known as Pompey) was sent to help Metellus take back Hispania and crush Sertorius's rebelion. Contemptuously calling Pompey 'the young pup' and Metellus 'the old woman' Sertorius proved himself more than a match for his adversaries. After the [[Battle of Lauron]], in which he out-generaled Pompey and massacred part of his army, he razed the city (proving Pompey and Metellus could not protect their allies). In 75 BC, Pompey and Metellus made a comeback, Pompey defeated Sertorius' legates Herrenius and Perpenna in the [[Battle of Valentia 75 BC|battle of Valentia]] and Metellus was able to crush another Sertorian army when he defeated Hirtuleius at the [[Battle of Italica]]. Sertorius responded by marching against Pompey and nearly capturing him at the [[Battle of Sucro]], when Pompey decided to fight him without waiting for Metellus. After these battles Sertorius was indecisively beaten at the [[Battle of Saguntum (75 BC)|Battle of Saguntum]] and had to revert to guerrilla combat again. Pompey wrote to Rome for reinforcements, without which, he said, he and Metellus would be driven from Hispania. With these reinforcements Pompey and Metellus were gaining the upper hand, grinding down their enemy by war of attrition, capturing stronghold after stronghold. Though Sertorius was still able to win some victories, he was losing the war, and his authority over his men was declining. He lost much of his acumen and authority, descending into alcoholism and debauchery<ref>Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.152.</ref>\n\nSertorius was in league with the [[Cilician Pirates]], who had bases and fleets all around the [[Mediterranean]], was negotiating with the formidable [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], and was in communication with the insurgent slaves of [[Spartacus]] in [[Italy]]. But due to jealousies among his high ranking Roman officers and some Iberian chieftains as well a conspiracy was beginning to take form.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 25.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn 74 and 73 BC, Pompey and Metellus had been slowly grinding down Sertorius's rebellion. Unable to defeat him in battle they had opted for attritional warfare, what had worked against Hannibal a century and a half before would now be brought to bear on Sertorius. Metellus seeing that the key to victory was removing Sertorius had made his pitch toward the Romans still with Sertorius. 'Should any Roman kill Sertorius he would be given a hundred talents of silver and twenty-thousand acres of land. If he was an exile he would be free to return to Rome'.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 22.</ref> This turned Sertorius paranoid, he started distrusting his Roman retinue. He also no longer trusted his Roman bodyguard, exchanging it for a Spanish one.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe war was not going well, so the Roman aristocrats and senators who made up the higher classes of his domain became discontented with Sertorius. They had grown jealous of Sertorius's power, and Perperna, aspiring to take Sertorius's place, encouraged that jealousy for his own ends. The conspirators took to damaging Sertorius by oppressing the local [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] tribes in his name. This stirred discontent and revolt in the tribes, which resulted in a cycle of oppression and revolt, with Sertorius none the wiser as to who was creating such mischief.\n\nPerperna and his fellow conspirator invited Sertorius to a feast to celebrate a supposed victory. While under most circumstances, any festivities to which Sertorius was invited were conducted with great propriety, this particular feast was vulgar, designed to offend the skillful general and get him off his couch and among the crowd where a knife could be shoved through his ribs without difficulty. Disgusted, Sertorius changed his posture on the couch, intent on ignoring them all. This presented something of a problem as Sertorius, although in late middle age, had a well deserved reputation as a skilled fighter. They changed their tactic, Perperna gave the signal to his fellow conspirators, and they rushed and stabbed the unsuspecting Sertorius until he was dead.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 153-154.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nUpon learning of the death of Sertorius, some of his Iberian allies sent ambassadors to Pompey or to Metellus and made peace, most simply went home. To make matters worse for Perperna when Sertorius's will was read he had named him his chief beneficiary. Perperna already disgraced as the man who had slain his commander, the man who had given him sanctuary, was now also revealed to have killed his main benefactor and friend. And now that he was dead, the virtues of Sertorius were remembered, and his recent atrocities forgotten.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 156-157.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text= People are generally less angry with those who have died, and when they no longer see him alive before them they tend to dwell tenderly on his virtues. So it was with Sertorius. Anger against him suddenly turned to affection and the soldiers clamorously rose up in protest against Perperna.<ref>Appian, ''Civil Wars'', 1.114.</ref>}}\n\nSertorius's independent \"Roman\" Republic in Spain crumbled with the renewed onslaught of Pompey and Metellus, who crushed Perperna's army and eliminated the remaining opposition.\n\n==In Modern Fiction==\n*In [[Colleen McCullough]]'s novels [[The First Man in Rome (novel)|The First Man in Rome]] and [[Fortune's Favourites]], Quintus Sertorius features as one of the secondary characters.\n*In [[Steven Saylor]]'s short story ''The White Fawn'', Quintus Sertorius features as one of the secondary characters.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sertoria (gens)]]\n* [[Sertorian War]]\n* [[Timeline of Portuguese history]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n===Ancient sources===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Plutarch]], [[Parallel Lives]], Life of Sertorius (in his ''Parallel Lives'' Plutarch pairs Sertorius with [[Eumenes]] \u2212 Plutarch saw many parallels between the lives of these two men)\n* Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18.\n* [[Appian]], ''Bell. civ.''

He had been a prominent member of the [[Populares|populist faction]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna|Cinna]] and [[Gaius Marius|Marius]]. During the latter years of the [[Sulla's Second Civil War|civil war]] he was sent to recover the Iberian Peninsula. When his faction lost the war he was [[Proscription|proscribed]] (outlawed) by the dictator [[Sulla]]. Supported by a majority of the native Spanish tribes, Sertorius skillfuly used [[irregular warfare]] to repeatedly defeat various commanders sent by Rome to subdue him. He was never decisively beaten on the battlefield and remained a thorn in the Senate's side until his murder in 72 BC.\n\nThe Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] dedicated one of his [[Parallel Lives]] to Sertorius; in it he pairs Sertorius with [[Eumenes]]. Like Eumenes, Sertorius was betrayed by his own men.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Parallel Lives, Life of Sertorius''; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', {{ISBN|1-84884-787-4}}</ref><ref name=\"britannica\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/535908/Quintus-Sertorius \"Quintus Sertorius\"]. ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]''.</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nSertorius was born in [[Nursia]] (a town which citizens had received Roman citizenship in 268 BC) in [[Sabine]] territory. We do not know exactly when Sertorius was born, but best estimates are in the range of 127-118 BC.<ref>Generally 123 BC is used as his year of birth.</ref> The Sertorius family were minor aristocrats, almost certainly [[Equites Romani]], the class directly below the senatorial class. His father died before he became of age and his mother, Rhae, focused all her energies on raising her only son. She made sure he received the best education possible for a young man of his status. In return, according to Plutarch, he became excessively fond of his mother. Like many other young ''domi nobiles'' Sertorius moved to Rome in his mid-to-late teens trying to make it big as an orator and jurist.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 2-3.</ref> \n\nHe made enough of an impression on the young Cicero to merit a special mention in a later treatise on oratory:\n\n::Of all the totally illiterate and crude orators, well, actually ranters, I ever knew \u2013 and I might as well add 'completely coarse and rustic' \u2013 the roughest and readiest were Q. Sertorius ...<ref>Cicero, ''Brutus'', 180.</ref>\n\nAfter his undistinguished career in [[Rome]] as a [[jurist]] and an [[orator]], he entered the military. His first recorded campaign was under [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]] and ended at the [[Battle of Arausio]] in 105 BC, where he showed unusual courage. Serving under [[Gaius Marius]], Sertorius succeeded in spying on the wandering Germanic tribes that had defeated Caepio.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.57; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 6-7; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 3.</ref> After this success, he almost certainly fought at the great [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]] (now [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[France]]) in 102 BC in which the [[Teutones]] and the [[Ambrones]] were decisively defeated.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.11.</ref> He probably also fought at the [[battle of Vercellae]] in 101 BC where the [[Cimbri]] were decisively defeated ending the German invasion.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.15.</ref> A few years after the [[Cimbrian War|Cimbric wars]] Sertorius's patron Gaius Marius fell out of grace for his support of the demagogue [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] and he and Sertorius had to get out of Rome for a while. Sertorius went to the [[Hispania Ulterior]] as a military [[tribune]] under [[Titus Didius]]. There he was rewarded with the [[Grass Crown]] for crushing an insurrection in and around [[Castulo]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Marius'', 27; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.17.</ref>\n\n==Social War and Civil War==\n{{main|Social War (91-88 BC)|Sulla's first civil war|Sulla's second civil war}}\nIn 91 BC, he was elected [[quaestor]] and served in [[Cisalpine Gaul]], where he was in charge of recruiting and training legionaries for the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]]. During the war he sustained a wound that cost him the use of one of his eyes.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p. 22; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 8.</ref> \n::Sertorius used his wounds as personal propaganda. Being scarred in the face had its advantages. 'Other men, he used to say, could not always carry about them the evidence of their heroic achievements. Their tokens, wreaths and spears of honour must at some times be set aside. His proof of valour remained with him at all times.'<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 8.</ref>\nUpon his return to Rome he ran for [[tribune of the Plebs]], but [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] thwarted his efforts (for reasons unknown, but probably because he was in Marius's [[Client (Roman)|clientele]] and Sulla and Marius were at odds), causing Sertorius to oppose Sulla.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 164.</ref> Sertorius, however, did manage to become a senator on the strength of his earlier quaestorship.\n\nIn 88 BC, after being sidelined by his political opponents, Sulla [[Sulla's first civil war|marched his legions on Rome]] and took the capital. He took revenge on his enemies and forced Marius into exile, Sulla then left Italy to fight the [[First Mithridatic War]] against [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]]. After Sulla left, violence erupted between the [[optimates]], led by the consul [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]], and the [[populares]], led by the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]]. Sertorius, being a former subordinate of Marius, declared for Cinna and the populares.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p.26</ref> When Cinna was driven from Rome he and Sertorius started recruiting ex-legionaries and drumming up enough support to enable them, in their turn, to march on Rome. Though he had a very bad opinion of Marius by then, he consented to Marius's return upon understanding that Marius came at Cinna's request and not of his own accord.\n\n::Oh, really? Here I was thinking that Marius had decided for himself to come to Italy, and so I was trying to decide what good it would do. But it turns out there's nothing to discuss. Since after all, you invited him, then you have to receive and employ him. There's no question about it.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 5.</ref>\n\nIn October of 87 BC, Cinna marched on Rome, Sertorius commanded one of Cinna's divisions and fought a battle with troops commanded by [[Pompeius Strabo]].<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p.20; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.111; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p.27.</ref> After Octavius surrendered Rome to the forces of Marius, Cinna, and Sertorius, Sertorius abstained from the [[proscriptions]] his fellow commanders engaged in. Sertorius went so far as to rebuke Marius, and move Cinna to moderation.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 114.</ref> After Marius' death he annihilated Marius' slave army which was still terrorizing Rome.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 28-29; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe years 87-84 BC are often described as spent 'waiting for Sulla'.<ref>E. Badian, ''Waiting for Sulla, Journal of Roman Studies, vol 52 (1962)'', pp 47-61.</ref> Marius died in January 86 BC. Cinna was murdered in 84 BC, lynched by his own troops. It is probable that Sertorius became praetor in the year Cinna died.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 29-31.</ref> \n\nOn Sulla's return from the East in 83 BC a [[Sulla's second civil war|second civil war]] broke out. Sertorius, a praetor now, was called upon to serve in the government's armies. When the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (consul 83 BC)|Scipio Asiaticus]] marched against Sulla, Sertorius was part of his staff. Sulla arrived in [[Campania]] and found the other consul, [[Gaius Norbanus]], blocking the road to [[Capua]]. At the [[Battle of Mount Tifata]] Sulla inflicted a crushing defeat on Norbanus, with Norbanus losing six thousand of his men to Sulla's seventy.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.162; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 133.</ref>  The beaten Norbanus withdrew with the remnants of his army to [[Capua]]. Sulla was stopped in his pursuit by Scipio's advance. However, Scipio was unwilling to risk a battle and started negotiations. Sertorius did not trust Sulla, and advised Scipio to force a decisive action. Instead he was sent to Norbanus to explain that an armistice was in force and negotiations were underway. Sertorius made a detour along his way and captured the town of Suessa which had gone over to Sulla. When Sulla complained to Scipio about this breach of trust he was given back his hostages as a sign of good faith. This behavior of their commander caused Scipio's troops to lose faith in him. Unwilling to fight Sulla's battle hardened veterans they defected. Scipio and his son were found cowering in their tents and brought to Sulla, who released them after extracting a promise that they would never again fight against him or rejoin Carbo.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 32-33; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 162-165; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 133-134.</ref>  In 82 BC, Marius' son, [[Gaius Marius the Younger]], became consul without having held the offices which a candidate for the consulship should have held, and at the unconstitutional age of 27. Sertorius, who probably qualified for the office, objected but his opinion was ignored.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 32.</ref> Plutarch sums up the events:\n\n:: Cinna was murdered and against the wishes of Sertorius, and against the law, the younger Marius took the consulship while [ineffectual] men as Carbo, Norbanus and Scipio had no success in stopping Sulla's advance on Rome, so the Marian cause was being ruined and lost; cowardice and weakness by the generals played its part, and treachery did the rest, and there was no reason why Sertorius should stay to watch things going from bad to worse through the inferior judgement of men with superior power.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref>\n\n==Propraetor of Hispania and Fugitive==\n[[File:Hispania 1a division provincial.PNG|right|290px|thumb|Iberia, showing the Roman Provinces in the time of Sertorius.]]\nAfter having fallen out with the new populares leadership Sertorius was sent to [[Hispania]] as [[propraetor]], representing the Cinna-Marian faction and their cause in Spain.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 32-33; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> When Sertorius marched through the [[Pyrenee Mountains|Pyrenees mountain range]] he ran into severe weather and a mountain tribe which demanded a tribute for allowing his passage. His companions indignantly claimed it was an outrage; but while they considered it disgraceful to give in to extortion, Sertorius simply paid the tribe and commented that he was buying himself time, and that if a man had a lot to do, nothing is more precious than time.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 52; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> The governor of the two Spanish provinces, [[Hispania Ulterior]] and [[Hispania Citerior]], [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus (consul)|Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] did not recognize his authority, but Sertorius had an army at his back and used it to assume control. Then he persuaded the local chieftans of accepting him as the new governor and endeared himself with the general population by cutting taxes.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 53; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> After gaining control of both provinces Sertorius sought to hold them by sending an army, under Julius Salinator, to fortify the pass through the Pyrenees; however, Sulla's forces, under the command of Gaius Annius Luscus, broke through after Salinator was assassinated by Calpurnius Lanarius, who defected to the Sullans.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 57; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 7.</ref>\n\nUnable to convince the Spanish tribes to fight for him, Sertorius was seriously outnumbered and he decided to abandon his provinces. With 3,000 of his most loyal followers he fled to [[Mauritania]], but was driven off by the locals who wanted no part of his rebellion.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 57-58.</ref> He then fell in with a band of [[Cilician pirates]] who were pillaging the Spanish coast. Together they attacked and took [[Pityusic Islands|Pityussa]], the most southerly of the [[Balearic Islands]], which they started using as a base. When this was reported to Annius Luscus, he sent a fleet of warships and almost a full legion which drove Sertorius and his pirate allies from the Balearics.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 59.</ref> The pirates defected and went to Africa to help install the tyrant Ascalis<ref>A local client of Sulla</ref> on the throne of [[Tangier|Tingis]]. Sertorius followed them to Africa, rallied the locals around Tingis, who were unhappy with Ascalis for they saw him as a puppet of Sulla, and defeated Ascalis's men and the pirates in battle.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 60-61.</ref>\n\nAfter gaining control over Tingis Sertorius defeated Paccianus, one of Sulla's generals, who had been sent to put Ascalis on the throne.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 60-61; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 9.</ref>\n\nLocal legend had it that [[Antaeus]], the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Gaia]], and the husband of Tinge who gave name to Tingis, was buried in Mauritania. Sertorius had the tomb excavated for he wanted to see the body of Antaeus which was reported to be sixty cubits<ref>Sixty cubits is about ninety feet.</ref> in size. According to Plutarch, Sertorius was dumbfounded by what he saw and after performing a sacrifice, he filled the tomb up again, and thereafter was among those promoting its traditions and honours.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 9.</ref>\n\nThe North African success won him the fame and admiration of the [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|people of Hispania]], particularly that of the warlike [[Lusitanians]] in the west, whom Roman generals and proconsuls of Sulla's party had plundered and oppressed. The Lusitanians, being treatened by a Sullan governor again, asked Sertorius to be their war leader. Sertorius decided to accept the Lusitanian offer and prepared his army and fleet to return to Hispania.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 63.</ref>\n\n==Sertorian War==\n{{Main|Sertorian War}}\n[[File:Gerard van Kuijl - Quintus Sertorius and the horse tail 1638.jpg|thumb|Quintus Sertorius and the horse tail, by [[Gerard van der Kuijl]], 1638]]\nOn a moonless night in the year 80 BC, Sertorius sailed his forces from Tingis across the Gibraltar strait back to Hispania.<ref>He chose a moonless night in order to remain undetected, but was detected nevertheless.</ref> A small fleet from the coastal town of Mellaria tried to stop him, but he pushed them aside and landed his army at the small fishing town of Baelo near the [[Pillars of Hercules]].<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 63-64.</ref> After being reinforced by the Lusitanians he marched on Fufidius, the local Roman governor, intend on defeating him to strengthen his support and prestige. At the [[Battle of the Baetis River]], fought at the Baetis estuary, he defeated Fufidius and started to consolidate his power in Hispania.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 64-65.</ref>\n\nBrave, noble, and gifted with eloquence, Sertorius was just the man to impress the native warriors, whom he organized into an army. They spoke of him as the \"new [[Hannibal]]\" whom he resembled physically (having one eye) and in military skill; he was an extraordinary general who repeatedly defeated forces many times his own force's size. Many Roman and Italian refugees and deserters joined him, and with these and his Spanish and African volunteers and mercenaries he completely defeated several of Sulla's generals (Fufidius, [[Marcus Domitius Calvinus (praetor 80 BC)|Domitius Calvinus]] and to some less-direct extent Thorius and Manlius). In 77 BC he drove [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] the proconsul of Hispania Ulterior, who had been given a proconsular command specifically to defeat him, out of his own province.\n\nIn 76 BC, after Sertorius had been reinforced by the rebel army of [[Marcus Perperna Vento|Marcus Perperna]], the Roman Senate resorted to giving an extraordinary command (pro consulibus) to [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus]] to help out Metellus who was doing miserably against Sertorius.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 17.</ref> Pompey recruited a large army from among his father's and Sulla's veterans and marched to Spain. Confident of success he engaged Sertorius at the [[Battle of Lauron]] in eastern Spain only to suffer a major defeat.<ref>Frontinus, ''Stratagems'', 2.5.31; Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 18.3; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 18; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 96-101.</ref>\n\nThe turning point came in 75 BC when Pompey and Metellus started scoring victories against Sertorius's subordinates. Pompey defeated Sertorius's legates [[Marcus Perperna Vento|Perperna]] and Herrenius at the [[Battle of Valentia 75 BC|Battle of Valentia]]<ref>Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.48; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 117-118.</ref> and Metellus defeated [[Lucius Hirtuleius|Hirtuleius]] at the [[Battle of Italica]]<ref>Livy, ''Epitome'', 91.4; Frontinus, ''Stratagems'', 2.1.2 and 2.3.5; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p.47; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp.118-119.</ref>. Sertorius then ruined his army at the [[Battle of Sucro]]<ref>[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', 1.110; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 19; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'', 18.</ref> and the [[Battle of Saguntum (75 BC)|Battle of Saguntum]]<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 21.</ref>, forcing him on the defensive. From then on Sertorius refrained from fighting battles and reverted to guerrilla warfare. Although Pompey and Metellus had gained the initiative the war was far from over. Sertorius still enjoyed the support of the inland tribes and their warriors still flocked to his cause.\n\nSertorius owed some of his success to his prodigious ability as a statesman. His goal was to build a stable government in Hispania with the consent and co-operation of the people, whom he wished to [[civilize]] along the lines of the Roman model. He established a senate of 300 members, drawn from Roman emigrants (probably also including some from the highest aristocrats of Hispania) and kept a Hispanian bodyguard. For the children of the chief native families he provided a school at Osca ([[Huesca]]), where they received a Roman education and even adopted the dress and education of Roman youths. This followed the Roman practice of taking [[hostage]]s. Late in his campaigns, a revolt of the native people arose and Sertorius killed several of the children that he had sent to school at Osca, selling many others into slavery.<ref name=plutarch>[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/lives/chapter41.html Sertorius], by [[Plutarch]]</ref>\n[[File:Setorius and the Example of the Horses, after Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|400px|left|''Sertorius and the Example of the Horses'', after [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. The drawing illustrates the example Sertorius gave to his followers that in the same way a horse's tail can be picked out hair by hair but not pulled out all at once, so smaller forces could defeat the Roman armies.<ref>Christian M\u00fcller in ''Hans Holbein the Younger: The Basel Years, 1515\u20131532,'' Christian M\u00fcller; Stephan Kemperdick; Maryan Ainsworth; ''et al'', Munich: Prestel, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3580-3}}, {{nowrap|pp. 263\u201364}}.</ref>]]\nAlthough he was strict and severe with his soldiers, he was particularly considerate to the people in general, and made their burdens as light as possible. It seems clear that he had a peculiar gift for evoking the enthusiasm of the native tribes, and we can understand well how he was able to use a famous white fawn, a present from one of the natives that was supposed to communicate to him the advice of the goddess [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], to his advantage.\n\n[[File:White Fawn Drawing.jpg|right|thumb|Sertorius claimed to receive messages from [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] via a white fawn.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>]]\n::Spanus, one of the commononers who lived in the country came across a doe trying to escape from hunters. The doe fled faster than he could pursue, but the animal had newly given birth. He [Spanus] was struck by the unusual colour of the fawn, for it was pure white. He pursued and caught it.\nAs it happened, Sertorius was in the area, and it was known that he amply rewarded those who brought him game and produce. So Spanus gave the fawn to Sertorius, who at that time felt only the usual pleasure of one who receives such gift. \nAfter a while the animal became so tame and well-trained that it came when he called it, and followed him on his walks without minding the crowds and bustle of life in camp. [That the fawn did this tells us something more about the character of Sertorius.] Eventually it occurred to him that the barbarians easily fall into superstition, so he started to give the fawn religious significance.\nHe announced that the doe had been sent by [the goddess] Diana, and solemnly claimed that through the doe she revealed hidden information to him. He helped the idea along by various tricks. If he heard of an enemy raid into his territory, or an attempt to subvert a city from its allegiance to him, he would claim that the fawn had told him of this in a dream, and tell his men to prepare.\nOr when his commanders sent him messages of victory, he would hide the messenger and bring out the white fawn wearing celebratory garlands. He would sacrifice to the gods, and tell his men to celebrate because they would soon hear something good had happened.\nBy such stratagems he persuaded his people they were not by the fallible wisdom of some foreigner, but by divine power. So the people were made tractable and all the more ready to help him with his plans, and consequently the extraordinary growth of Sertorius's power led to reinforcing this belief.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 11</ref>\n\nFor six years he held sway over Hispania. In 76 BC, he was joined \u2014 at the insistence of the forces he brought with him \u2014 by [[Marcus Perpenna Vento]] from Rome, with a following of Roman and Italian aristocrats and a sizeable Roman-style army of fifty-three [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]].<ref name=plutarch/> In the same year, [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (now better known as Pompey) was sent to help Metellus take back Hispania and crush Sertorius's rebelion. Contemptuously calling Pompey 'the young pup' and Metellus 'the old woman' Sertorius proved himself more than a match for his adversaries. After the [[Battle of Lauron]], in which he out-generaled Pompey and massacred part of his army, he razed the city (proving Pompey and Metellus could not protect their allies). In 75 BC, Pompey and Metellus made a comeback, Pompey defeated Sertorius' legates Herrenius and Perpenna in the [[Battle of Valentia 75 BC|battle of Valentia]] and Metellus was able to crush another Sertorian army when he defeated Hirtuleius at the [[Battle of Italica]]. Sertorius responded by marching against Pompey and nearly capturing him at the [[Battle of Sucro]], when Pompey decided to fight him without waiting for Metellus. After these battles Sertorius was indecisively beaten at the [[Battle of Saguntum (75 BC)|Battle of Saguntum]] and had to revert to guerrilla combat again. Pompey wrote to Rome for reinforcements, without which, he said, he and Metellus would be driven from Hispania. With these reinforcements Pompey and Metellus were gaining the upper hand, grinding down their enemy by war of attrition, capturing stronghold after stronghold. Though Sertorius was still able to win some victories, he was losing the war, and his authority over his men was declining. He lost much of his acumen and authority, descending into alcoholism and debauchery<ref>Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.152.</ref>\n\nSertorius was in league with the [[Cilician Pirates]], who had bases and fleets all around the [[Mediterranean]], was negotiating with the formidable [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], and was in communication with the insurgent slaves of [[Spartacus]] in [[Italy]]. But due to jealousies among his high ranking Roman officers and some Iberian chieftains as well a conspiracy was beginning to take form.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 25.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn 74 and 73 BC, Pompey and Metellus had been slowly grinding down Sertorius's rebellion. Unable to defeat him in battle they had opted for attritional warfare, what had worked against Hannibal a century and a half before would now be brought to bear on Sertorius. Metellus seeing that the key to victory was removing Sertorius had made his pitch toward the Romans still with Sertorius. 'Should any Roman kill Sertorius he would be given a hundred talents of silver and twenty-thousand acres of land. If he was an exile he would be free to return to Rome'.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 22.</ref> This turned Sertorius paranoid, he started distrusting his Roman retinue. He also no longer trusted his Roman bodyguard, exchanging it for a Spanish one.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe war was not going well, so the Roman aristocrats and senators who made up the higher classes of his domain became discontented with Sertorius. They had grown jealous of Sertorius's power, and Perperna, aspiring to take Sertorius's place, encouraged that jealousy for his own ends. The conspirators took to damaging Sertorius by oppressing the local [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] tribes in his name. This stirred discontent and revolt in the tribes, which resulted in a cycle of oppression and revolt, with Sertorius none the wiser as to who was creating such mischief.\n\nPerperna and his fellow conspirator invited Sertorius to a feast to celebrate a supposed victory. While under most circumstances, any festivities to which Sertorius was invited were conducted with great propriety, this particular feast was vulgar, designed to offend the skillful general and get him off his couch and among the crowd where a knife could be shoved through his ribs without difficulty. Disgusted, Sertorius changed his posture on the couch, intent on ignoring them all. This presented something of a problem as Sertorius, although in late middle age, had a well deserved reputation as a skilled fighter. They changed their tactic, Perperna gave the signal to his fellow conspirators, and they rushed and stabbed the unsuspecting Sertorius until he was dead.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 153-154.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nUpon learning of the death of Sertorius, some of his Iberian allies sent ambassadors to Pompey or to Metellus and made peace, most simply went home. To make matters worse for Perperna when Sertorius's will was read he had named him his chief beneficiary. Perperna already disgraced as the man who had slain his commander, the man who had given him sanctuary, was now also revealed to have killed his main benefactor and friend. And now that he was dead, the virtues of Sertorius were remembered, and his recent atrocities forgotten.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 156-157.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text= People are generally less angry with those who have died, and when they no longer see him alive before them they tend to dwell tenderly on his virtues. So it was with Sertorius. Anger against him suddenly turned to affection and the soldiers clamorously rose up in protest against Perperna.<ref>Appian, ''Civil Wars'', 1.114.</ref>}}\n\nSertorius's independent \"Roman\" Republic in Spain crumbled with the renewed onslaught of Pompey and Metellus, who crushed Perperna's army and eliminated the remaining opposition.\n\n==In Modern Fiction==\n*In [[Colleen McCullough]]\u2018s novels [[The First Man in Rome (novel)|The First Man in Rome]] and [[Fortune's Favourites]] Quintus Sertorius features as one of the secondary characters.\n*In [[Steven Saylor]]\u2019s short story ''The White Fawn'' Quintus Sertorius features as one of the secondary characters. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Sertoria (gens)]]\n* [[Sertorian War]]\n* [[Timeline of Portuguese history]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n===Ancient sources===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Plutarch]], [[Parallel Lives]], Life of Sertorius (in his ''Parallel Lives'' Plutarch pairs Sertorius with [[Eumenes]] \u2212 Plutarch saw many parallels between the lives of these two men)\n* Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18.\n* [[Appian]], ''Bell. civ.''

The cabinet was named after ''Reichskanzler'' (chancellor) [[Gustav Stresemann]] and took office on 13 August 1923 when it replaced the [[Cuno cabinet]] under [[Wilhelm Cuno]]. The cabinet resigned late on 3 October 1923 and was replaced on 6 October by [[Second Stresemann cabinet|another cabinet formed by Stresemann]].\n\n==Establishment==\nThe resignation of the Cuno cabinet was officially transmitted to ''Reichspr\u00e4sident'' [[Friedrich Ebert]] late on 12 August 1923. At roughly the same time, Ebert asked the chairman of the [[German People's Party|DVP]], Gustav Stresemann, to form a new government. On the evening of 13 August, Ebert appointed Stresemann Chancellor. At that point, the list of ministers for the new cabinet was mostly completed. This was the fastest formation of a government between the time when the [[Weimar National Assembly]] was replaced by the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] in 1920 and the period of the \"presidential cabinets\" in 1930. The first cabinet meeting took place on 14 August, within 36 hours of the resignation of Cuno.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\nStresemann's cabinet was based on the ''Gro\u00dfe Koalition'' (grand coalition) of DVP, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD), [[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]] and [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP). There was no coalition agreement and the government declaration of 14 August did not offer a political program. The most pressing tasks for the government were stabilizing the currency and solving the related problem of the occupied territories. After the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] by French and Belgian troops in January 1923, the Cuno government had increasingly resorted to the printing presses to finance the extra spending and replace the loss of tax revenue caused by \"passive resistance\" against the occupation. As a result, the already high rate of inflation [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|had spiked]]. By the summer, the resulting collapse of the [[German Papiermark|Mark]] in the currency markets had led to shortages of foreign currencies to pay for vital food imports.<ref name=Akten2>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/0000/str/str1p/kap1_1/para2_2.html|title= Das erste Kabinett der Gro\u00dfen Koalition  (German)|publisher=Bundesarchiv|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Overview of the members==\nThe members of the cabinet were as follows:<ref name=DHM>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/weimar/verfassung/kabinette/index.html |title=Kabinette von 1919 bis 1933 (German) |publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum |accessdate=30 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305070147/http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/weimar/verfassung/kabinette/index.html |archivedate=5 March 2012 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!colspan=\"3\"| '''First Stresemann cabinet'''<br /> ''13 August 1923 to 3 October 1923''\n|-----\n| ''[[German Chancellor|Reichskanzler]]'' and <br> ''[[Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt]]'' (Foreign Office) \n| [[Gustav Stresemann]] || [[German People's Party|DVP]]\n|-----\n| Deputy of the ''Reichskanzler'' and <br> ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau'' (Reconstruction)\n| [[Robert Schmidt (German politician)|Robert Schmidt]]|| [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n|----\n| ''Reichsministerium des Innern'' (Interior)\n| [[Wilhelm Sollmann]] || SPD\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium der Finanzen'' (Finance) \n| [[Rudolf Hilferding]] || SPD\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft'' (Economic Affairs)\n| [[Hans von Raumer]] || DVP\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Arbeit'' (Labour)\n| [[Heinrich Brauns]]  || [[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]]\n|-----\n| ''[[Reichsministerium der Justiz]]'' (Justice)\n| [[Gustav Radbruch]]|| SPD\n|-----\n| ''Reichswehrministerium'' (Defence)\n| [[Otto Gessler]] || DDP\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr das Postwesen'' (Mail)\n| {{Interlanguage link multi|Anton H\u00f6fle|de}} || Zentrum\n|-----\n| ''[[Reich Ministry of Transport|Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Verkehr]]'' (Transport)\n| [[Rudolf Oeser]]|| [[German Democratic Party|DDP]]\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung und Landwirtschaft'' (Food and Agriculture)\n| [[Hans Luther]]|| independent\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr die besetzten Gebiete'' (Occupied Territories) \n| {{Interlanguage link multi|Johannes Fuchs|de|3=Johannes Fuchs (Politiker)|lt=Johannes Fuchs}}  || Zentrum\n|}\nNotes: Stresemann kept the ''Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt'' and thus was his own foreign minister.

However, Fuchs was appointed acting head of the yet-to-be created ministry on 13 August 1923.

During that time, the government relied on [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the constitution which allowed the Reichspr\u00e4sident to issue emergency decrees.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\nIn the cabinet meeting of 30 September, the government discussed the necessity of a further transfer of power from parliament to the cabinet. In particular, the situation in Bavaria \u2014 which was moving towards a right-wing dictatorship under [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr|''Staatskommissar'' von Kahr]] \u2014 gave rise to concern over the unity of the Reich. Several cabinet members argued in favour of a farreaching independence of the government from the political parties. However, the Reichstag fractions refused to cooperate. The first Stresemann government resigned over their diverging views on the range of powers that should be granted to the cabinet. There was consensus on the need to put an extra burden both on wealth and on workers, by extending working hours from the current norm of an eight-hour workday and a six-day working week (seven hours in the crucial coal industry). However, the extent and manner of boosting working hours was controversial.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\nOn 1 October, the cabinet agreed on the need for an ''Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz'' that would give the government wide-ranging powers not just in the financial and economic sphere but also in increasing working hours in \"vital\" industries. However, the next day the party leaders clashed on this issue. [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]], chairman of the SPD, with an eye towards the unions and political competition from the Communists, argued against this. [[Ernst Scholz]] of the DVP by contrast demanded a decree raising working hours in addition to including the right-wing [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] in the government.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\nOn the evening of 2 October, the increase in the working day was included in the government proclamation, whilst the ''Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz'' would be limited to \"financial and economic\" issues - with the understanding that the latter would encompass \"social\" measures. The Reichstag fraction of the SPD refused to agree and insisted on the parliament's involvement in changes to working hours. DDP and Zentrum were willing to go along with this. Luther and Gessler were opposed, with the latter arguing against the asymmetry of \"burdening wealth by decree, but the working class only by law\". Stresemann tried and failed to win agreement from his party. As a result, the cabinet resigned late on 3 October. It was followed by a [[Second Stresemann cabinet|reshuffled cabinet]], led once again by Stresemann, on 6 October.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{German Cabinets}}\n\n[[Category:Historic German cabinets|Stresemann I]]\n[[Category:1923 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:Cabinets established in 1923]]\n[[Category:Cabinets disestablished in 1923]]\n[[Category:Coalition governments of Germany|Stresemann I]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-040-27, Gustav Stresemann.jpg|thumb|Gustav Stresemann]]\n[[File:Robert Schmidt (politician).jpg|thumb|Robert Schmidt]]\n\nThe '''First Stresemann cabinet''' (German: ''Erstes Kabinett Stresemann'') was the eighth democratically elected ''Reichsregierung'' of the [[German Reich]], during the period in which it is now usually referred to as the [[Weimar Republic]].

The first cabinet meeting took place on 14 August, within 36 hours of the resignation of Cuno.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\nStresemann's cabinet was based on the ''Gro\u00dfe Koalition'' (grand coalition) of DVP, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD), [[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]] and [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP). There was no coalition agreement and the government declaration of 14 August did not offer a political program. The most pressing tasks for the government were stabilizing the currency and solving the related problem of the occupied territories. After the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] by French and Belgian troops in January 1923, the Cuno government had increasingly resorted to the printing presses to finance the extra spending and replace the loss of tax revenue caused by \"passive resistance\" against the occupation. As a result, the already high rate of inflation [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|had spiked]]. By the summer, the resulting collapse of the [[German Papiermark|Mark]] in the currency markets had led to shortages of foreign currencies to pay for vital food imports.<ref name=Akten2>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/0000/str/str1p/kap1_1/para2_2.html|title= Das erste Kabinett der Gro\u00dfen Koalition  (German)|publisher=Bundesarchiv|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Overview of the members==\nThe members of the cabinet were as follows:<ref name=DHM>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/weimar/verfassung/kabinette/index.html |title=Kabinette von 1919 bis 1933 (German) |publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum |accessdate=30 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305070147/http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/weimar/verfassung/kabinette/index.html |archivedate=5 March 2012 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!colspan=\"3\"| '''First Stresemann cabinet'''<br /> ''13 August 1923 to 3 October 1923''\n|-----\n| ''[[German Chancellor|Reichskanzler]]'' and <br> ''[[Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt]]'' (Foreign Office) \n| [[Gustav Stresemann]] || [[German People's Party|DVP]]\n|-----\n| Deputy of the ''Reichskanzler'' and <br> ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau'' (Reconstruction)\n| [[Robert Schmidt (politician)|Robert Schmidt]]|| [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n|----\n| ''Reichsministerium des Innern'' (Interior)\n| [[Wilhelm Sollmann]] || SPD\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium der Finanzen'' (Finance) \n| [[Rudolf Hilferding]] || SPD\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft'' (Economic Affairs)\n| [[Hans von Raumer]] || DVP\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Arbeit'' (Labour)\n| [[Heinrich Brauns]]  || [[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]]\n|-----\n| ''[[Reichsministerium der Justiz]]'' (Justice)\n| [[Gustav Radbruch]]|| SPD\n|-----\n| ''Reichswehrministerium'' (Defence)\n| [[Otto Gessler]] || DDP\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr das Postwesen'' (Mail)\n| {{Interlanguage link multi|Anton H\u00f6fle|de}} || Zentrum\n|-----\n| ''[[Reich Ministry of Transport|Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Verkehr]]'' (Transport)\n| [[Rudolf Oeser]]|| [[German Democratic Party|DDP]]\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung und Landwirtschaft'' (Food and Agriculture)\n| [[Hans Luther]]|| independent\n|-----\n| ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr die besetzten Gebiete'' (Occupied Territories) \n| {{Interlanguage link multi|Johannes Fuchs|de|3=Johannes Fuchs (Politiker)|lt=Johannes Fuchs}}  || Zentrum\n|}\nNotes: Stresemann kept the ''Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt'' and thus was his own foreign minister. The ''Reichsministerium f\u00fcr die besetzten Gebiete'', responsible for the territories occupied by France and Belgium, was created by presidential order on 24 August 1923. However, Fuchs was appointed acting head of the yet-to-be created ministry on 13 August 1923. Since the cabinet resigned at 11:30&nbsp;p.m. on 3 October the end of its tenure is sometimes given as 4 October or 6 October, when Stresemann's reshuffled second cabinet took office.<ref name=Akten>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/0000/str/str2p/kap1_3/para2_1.html|title= Das Kabinett Stresemann I (German)|publisher=Bundesarchiv|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nFour of the cabinet members were not members of the Reichstag: Hilferding, Fuchs, Oeser and Luther.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\n==Resignation==\n[[File:Rudolf Hilferding and Gattin, cropped.jpg|thumb|Rudolf Hilferding in 1928]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-008A-07, Hans Luther.jpg|thumb|Hans Luther]]\n\nFrom 15 August to 27 September, the Reichstag was not in session. During that time, the government relied on [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the constitution which allowed the Reichspr\u00e4sident to issue emergency decrees.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\nIn the cabinet meeting of 30 September, the government discussed the necessity of a further transfer of power from parliament to the cabinet. In particular, the situation in Bavaria \u2014 which was moving towards a right-wing dictatorship under [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr|''Staatskommissar'' von Kahr]] \u2014 gave rise to concern over the unity of the Reich. Several cabinet members argued in favour of a farreaching independence of the government from the political parties. However, the Reichstag fractions refused to cooperate. The first Stresemann government resigned over their diverging views on the range of powers that should be granted to the cabinet. There was consensus on the need to put an extra burden both on wealth and on workers, by extending working hours from the current norm of an eight-hour workday and a six-day working week (seven hours in the crucial coal industry). However, the extent and manner of boosting working hours was controversial.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\nOn 1 October, the cabinet agreed on the need for an ''Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz'' that would give the government wide-ranging powers not just in the financial and economic sphere but also in increasing working hours in \"vital\" industries. However, the next day the party leaders clashed on this issue. [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]], chairman of the SPD, with an eye towards the unions and political competition from the Communists, argued against this. [[Ernst Scholz]] of the DVP by contrast demanded a decree raising working hours in addition to including the right-wing [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] in the government.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\nOn the evening of 2 October, the increase in the working day was included in the government proclamation, whilst the ''Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz'' would be limited to \"financial and economic\" issues - with the understanding that the latter would encompass \"social\" measures. The Reichstag fraction of the SPD refused to agree and insisted on the parliament's involvement in changes to working hours. DDP and Zentrum were willing to go along with this. Luther and Gessler were opposed, with the latter arguing against the asymmetry of \"burdening wealth by decree, but the working class only by law\". Stresemann tried and failed to win agreement from his party. As a result, the cabinet resigned late on 3 October. It was followed by a [[Second Stresemann cabinet|reshuffled cabinet]], led once again by Stresemann, on 6 October.<ref name=Akten2/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{German Cabinets}}\n\n[[Category:Historic German cabinets|Stresemann I]]\n[[Category:1923 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:Cabinets established in 1923]]\n[[Category:Cabinets disestablished in 1923]]\n[[Category:Coalition governments of Germany|Stresemann I]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Robert Schmidt (politician)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Stresemann_cabinet"}
