The club dismissed manager [[Bruce Rioch]] in the close season, who spent a year in-charge. After much speculation, Frenchman [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] was appointed as his replacement \u2013 the club's first manager born outside of the British Isles. At the end of the campaign, Arsenal finished third in the [[Premier League]] and missed out on [[UEFA Champions League]] qualification. They made exits in the fourth round of both the [[FA Cup]] and [[Football League Cup]] to [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] respectively. In Europe, the club were eliminated in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] first round to [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] of Germany.\n\nArsenal sold several fringe players in the [[transfer window]], notably [[David Hillier]] to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Paul Dickov]] to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Midfielders [[R\u00e9mi Garde]] and [[Patrick Vieira]] were purchased from [[RC Strasbourg]] and [[AC Milan|Milan]] respectively. [[John Hartson]] moved to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in January 1997; he was replaced in the squad by teenager [[Nicolas Anelka]], who joined Arsenal a month later from [[Paris Saint-Germain]].\n\nA strong start to their league campaign, with one defeat in their first 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first spot. Although the club were winless during the Christmas period, their chances of winning the title remained intact. A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe, as it moved Arsenal down to fourth spot. Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his team out of the title race and make priority to second spot, which came with a qualifying spot for the Champions League. Defeat to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the penultimate game of the season all but ended Arsenal's chances of finishing second, given Newcastle's superior [[goal difference]]. A win on the final day against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] meant the club finished third, level on points with Newcastle and Liverpool.\n\n28 different players represented the club in four competitions and there were 12 different goalscorers.

The club dismissed manager [[Bruce Rioch]] in the close season, who spent a year in-charge. After much speculation, Frenchman [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] was appointed as his replacement \u2013 the club's first manager born outside of the British Isles. At the end of the campaign, Arsenal finished third in the [[Premier League]] and missed out on [[UEFA Champions League]] qualification. They made exits in the fourth round of both the [[FA Cup]] and [[Football League Cup]] to [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] respectively. In Europe, the club were eliminated in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] first round to [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] of Germany.\n\nArsenal sold several fringe players in the [[transfer window]], notably [[David Hillier]] to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Paul Dickov]] to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Midfielders [[R\u00e9mi Garde]] and [[Patrick Vieira]] were purchased from [[RC Strasbourg]] and [[AC Milan|Milan]] respectively. [[John Hartson]] moved to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in January 1997; he was replaced in the squad by teenager [[Nicolas Anelka]], who joined Arsenal a month later from [[Paris Saint-Germain]].\n\nA strong start to their league campaign, with one defeat in their first 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first spot. Although the club were winless during the Christmas period, their chances of winning the title remained intact. A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe, as it moved Arsenal down to fourth spot. Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his team out of the title race and make priority to second spot, which came with a qualifying spot for the Champions League. Defeat to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the penultimate game of the season all but ended Arsenal's chances of finishing second, given Newcastle's superior [[goal difference]]. A win on the final day against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] meant the club finished third, level on points with Newcastle and Liverpool.\n\n28 different players represented the club in four competitions and there were 12 different goalscorers. [[Ian Wright]] was Arsenal's top goalscorer of the season; he scored 30 goals in 41 appearances.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|1995\u201396 Arsenal F.C. season}}\nIn June 1995, Arsenal appointed [[Bruce Rioch]], who had just guided [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] to the [[1995 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]] and promotion to the top flight, as manager.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rioch named Arsenal boss |first=Michael |last=Hart |page=72 |newspaper=Evening Standard |location=London |date=8 June 1995}}</ref> Under his stewardship, the club broke the English transfer record by paying [[Internazionale Milano F.C.|Internazionale]] \u00a37.5million for Dutch striker [[Dennis Bergkamp]] and the new signing formed an impressive partnership with [[Ian Wright]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Soccer stars on the move |first=Shiv |last=Sharma |page=31 |newspaper=The Guardian Weekly |location=London |date=2 July 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=I've got Wright on my side |first=Richard |last=Tanner |page=40 |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=26 October 1995}}</ref> Arsenal reached the League Cup semi-finals and finished fifth in the Premier League at the end of [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396]], securing a place in the following season's [[UEFA Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Arsenal fear the power of Fowler |page=27 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=1 May 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bergkamp sends Arsenal into Europe |page=S6 |first=Tom |last=Chesshyre |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=6 May 1996}}</ref>\n\n===Managerial changes===\nA week before the start of the league season, Arsenal sacked manager Rioch and cited the decision was in the \"best long-term interest of the club\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Pass notes, no. 868: Bruce Rioch |page=T3 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=13 August 1996}}</ref> It was alleged that a dispute over transfer funds with the board of directors prompted his departure; his relationship moreover with David Dein according to an insider was \"no longer cordial\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Rioch's reign brought to sudden end |first=Russell |last=Kempson |page=48 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=13 August 1996}}</ref> [[Stewart Houston]] was once again put in temporary charge, with [[Pat Rice]] serving as first team coach.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arsenal ditch Rioch and look abroad |first=Martin |last=Thorpe |page=22 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=13 August 1996 }}</ref> [[Johan Cruyff]] was considered the favourite for the job; [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]], [[Terry Venables]] and [[David O'Leary]] were other names linked to the managerial position.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cruyff appears Arsenal's likely target|first=Rob |last=Hughes |page=48 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=13 August 1996}}</ref> Houston put his name forward for the job, but upon being told that he would not be considered, resigned to take over as manager of Division One side [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], leaving Rice as the team's second caretaker manager of the season.

A special branch of the family originates from a great-grandson of Hajji Theodoros who changed his name to Kassiotis. Georgios Kassiotis served as an officer of the [[Hellenic Army|Greek cavalry]] during the [[Greco-Italian War|Second World War]] and later distinguished himself as a stockbroker and [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|politician]]. The descendants of George Kassiotis include shipping magnates such as George and [[Evangelos Marinakis|Athanasia Kassiotis]].

Established in [[Melbourne]] as the '''South Melbourne Football Club''' in 1874, the Swans relocated to [[Sydney]] in 1982, thus making it the first club in the competition to be based outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\nInitially playing in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), the Swans joined seven other clubs in founding the breakaway Victorian Football League (now known as the AFL) in 1896.

The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].\n\n===VFL entry: 1897\u20131909===\nSouth Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.\n\n===Premiership success: 1909\u20131945===\nThe club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933.  The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne's \"Foreign Legion\".<ref>The caricature at the foot of [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/149547747/17704724 page 10 of ''Table Talk'' (22 June 1933)] was created by Richard \"Dick\" Ovenden (1897\u20131972).

Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.<ref>Shaw, I.W. (2006) ''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a [[Herald and Weekly Times]] artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the [[black swan]] being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|date=24 January 1934|location=Melbourne|title=Real story behind South Melbourne's football premiership|page=7|author=J. M. Rohan}}</ref> The name stuck, in part due to the club's association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its [[swan]]s (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).\n\nAfter several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as \"the Bloodbath\", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.\n\n===Struggling times: 1946\u20131981===\nIn the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] failed to help, as the [[Riverina Football League]] proved to be one of the least profitable zones.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they \"won\" three [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]]. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.\n\n==Sydney history==\n{{recentism|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Early years in Sydney: 1982\u20131987===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the [[Fitzroy Lions]] staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. The club had been operating at a loss of at least $150,000 for the previous five years. News of the proposal broke on 2 July 1981, after which a letter was sent to members outlining the board's reasons for making the proposal and noting that the coach and current players were in favour of the move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2019-07-02/on-this-day-swans-move-to-sydney|title=On This Day: Swans move to Sydney|website=sydneyswans.com.au|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.\n\nThe move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South at South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|title=VFL 'no' sends South to Sydney|author=Mike Coward|date=15 October 1981|page=32}}</ref> The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|page=40|author=Geoff Slattery|date=7 November 1981|title=South Players on strike}}</ref> The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.<ref name=\"saga\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Roar|title=Revisiting the South Melbourne to Sydney saga|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/07/06/the-south-to-sydney-saga/|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1982 Escort Championships|1982 Escort Championships Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Swa}}|| '''13''' ||'''12''' ||'''90'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Nor}} || 8 || 10 || 58\n|-\n| Venue: [[Waverley Park]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 20,028\n|}\n\nUpon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name \"South Melbourne\" in June 1982, becoming known as simply \"the Swans\" for the rest of that season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|location=Melbourne|first=Peter|last=Simunovich|title=The Swans \u2013 officially|date=3 June 1982|page=67}}</ref> It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.<ref name=\"saga\" /> Its physical \"home club\" was the \"Southern Cross Social Club\" at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]\n\nOn 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be [[Australian dollar|$]]6.3&nbsp;million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten]] \"bought\" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9&nbsp;million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong's contracts to recruit [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref> The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', p. 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref>\n\nDuring the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field \u2013 all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans\u2019 successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the \"Swanettes\", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no club has had cheerleaders since then.\n\nIn 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992.<ref>[[1992 AFL season]]</ref> However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.\n\n===Dark times: 1988\u20131994===\nThe club's form was to slump in the following year.\n\nLosses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willesee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.\n\nMorale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128</ref> Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).\n\nCapper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club's finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney's goalkicking was led by [[Bernard Toohey]] (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Barry Mitchell (footballer)|Barry Mitchell]].

The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.\n\nThe AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.\n\nDuring this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Kelly]].\n\nDesperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.\n\n===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995\u20132001===\nA big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony \"Plugger\" Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the dominant rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.\n\n1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won eight games \u2013 as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined \u2013 and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1996 AFL season|1996 AFL Home & Away Season]]'' || ''W'' || ''L'' || ''D'' ||''Total'' || ''%''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''16''' || '''5''' || '''1''' || '''66''' || '''123.9'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=9 | ''Minor Premiers''\n|}\n\nFormer Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].\n\nThe Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL StK}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].\n\nThe 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.\n\nAfter missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Colonial Stadium]].\n\n===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002\u20132004===\nFormer Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumors that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with [[Terry Wallace]].\n\nRoos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.\n\nA new home ground in [[ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against {{AFL Ess}} attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.\n\n2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended {{AFL StK}}'s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for [[Leo Barry]]'s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Fraser Gehrig]], whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.\n\nSydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL StK}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.\n\n===Premiership glory: 2005===\n{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}\n{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}\nIn 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO [[Andrew Demetriou]], for their unorthodox, \"boring\" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans).

This dropped them into a semi-final against the [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] at the SCG on 9 September, and the Swans trailed the Cats 31\u201353 before [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] kicked four consecutive goals, with the last one a matter of seconds before the siren, to win the game for Sydney by 7.14 (56) to 7.11 (53). In the first preliminary final at the MCG on 16 September against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the Swans used a seven-goal blitz in 11 minutes of the fourth quarter to overturn an 8-point deficit and overrun the Saints by 15.6 (96) to 9.11 (65).\n\nThe Swans faced the Eagles in a rematch in the [[AFL Grand Final]] on 24 September 2005, and this time, they prevailed by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth Premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[2005 AFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''8''' || '''10''' || '''58'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[West Coast Eagles]] || 7  || 12 || 54\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 91,898\n|}\n\nOn Friday, 30 September 2005, a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city.

He led the club to a seventh-place finish at the end of the regular season, therefore qualifying for the finals for the 13th time in the past 16 seasons. The Swans defeated {{AFL StK}} in an elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium]] before losing to {{AFL Haw}} in the semi-finals the following week.\n\nIt was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] on its home ground, [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Skilled Stadium]], where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]] during the regular season. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain [[Jarrad McVeigh]]'s baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match.\n\n[[File:Sydney Swans banner.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Swans players run through the banner before the inaugural Sydney Derby on 24 March 2012.]]\nThe 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers {{AFL GWS}}. After an even and physical first half, Sydney went on to win by 63 points. Subsequent wins over {{AFL Fre}}, {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL Nor}} and {{AFL Haw}} saw the Swans sit second behind {{AFL WC}} on percentage after Round 5, but the Swans would proceed to lose three of their next four matches before embarking on a nine-match winning streak between Rounds 10 and 19 inclusive. The Swans eventually finished the regular season in third place after losing three of their final four matches, all against their fellow top-four rivals (Collingwood, Hawthorn and Geelong in Rounds 20, 22 and 23 respectively).\n\nThe Swans defeated {{AFL Ade}} by 29 points in their qualifying final at [[AAMI Stadium]], thus earning a week off and a home preliminary final, where they then defeated {{AFL Col}} by 26 points to qualify for their first grand final since 2006, ending an eleven-match losing streak against the Magpies in the process.\n\nIn the grand final, the Swans defeated Hawthorn [[2012 AFL Grand Final|by ten points]] in front of 99,683 people at the MCG, with [[Nick Malceski]] kicking a snap goal with 34 seconds left to seal the Swans' fifth premiership and first since 2005.

After a loss to North Melbourne in Round 4, the Swans' won twelve games in a row, including victories against 2013 grand finalists Fremantle and Hawthorn, Geelong by 110 points at the SCG and then ladder leaders Port Adelaide. In Round 17, the Swans defeated Carlton to match a winning streak set three times in club history, the last of which came way back in 1935,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenewdaily.com.au/sport/2014/07/12/dozen-unstoppable-sydney-swans/|title=Dozen up for unstoppable Swans \u2013 The New Daily|date=12 July 2014|publisher=}}</ref> and eventually closed out the season with their first minor premiership in 18 years and a club record 17 wins for the season, eclipsing the previous highest of 16, which was achieved on six past occasions in 2012, 1996, 1986, 1945, 1936 and 1935. In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the [[2014 AFL Grand Final]]. They defeated [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against [[North Melbourne Kangaroos|North Melbourne]], which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The [[2014 AFL Grand Final]] was played on Saturday 27 September 2014 in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player [[Lance Franklin]] would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137). The 63-point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season, meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history.\n\nThe Swans started the 2015 AFL season well, winning their first three, before losing their next 2 games against [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], where they trailed by as many as 8 goals before half-time, and the [[Western Bulldogs]]. They won their next 6 leading into the bye, including home wins against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], and an upset away win against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the grand final replay. The Swans lost their first game after the bye, their 3rd of the season to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at the SCG, 11.11 (77) to 14.11. (95). The Swans rebounded with unconvincing wins against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane Lions Football Club|Brisbane Lions]], before suffering their heaviest defeat for 17 seasons against the [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawks]] by 89 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/biggest-loss-in-17-years-a-humiliation-for-swans-says-luke-parker-20150719-gifoiw.html|title=Biggest loss in 17 years a humiliation for Swans, says Luke Parker|first=Sebastian|last=Hassett|date=19 July 2015|website=The Age}}</ref> The following week was no better with a road trip to Perth and another loss, this time to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]] by 52 points, the scoreline ultimately flattering the Swans. The Swans bounced back against Adelaide with a convincing win 52-point win, but lost their next game to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Simmonds stadium]]; a close affair that Geelong blew apart in the 3rd quarter. The Swans won their final 4 games to secure a top 4 finish, against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], {{AFL GWS}}, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and {{AFL GCS}}.\n\nThe Swans faced minor premiers [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] in the first qualifying final, their first finals match without Franklin, who had withdrawn from the finals due to illness.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-08/star-swan-franklin-out-of-final-against-freo-with-ongoing-mental-health-condition], AFL.com.au official website, 8 September 2015</ref> Ultimately the Swans would go down in a low scoring affair, effectively kicking themselves out of the game after losing [[Sam Reid (Australian footballer born 1991)|Sam Reid]] to a hamstring injury midway through the 2nd quarter.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/video-sam-reid-subbed-out-of-sydneys-qualifying-final-with-fremantle-with-hamstring-injury/story-e6frf3e3-1227524180065], Fox Sports, 12 September 2015</ref> The following week the Swans were knocked out of the finals in a one-sided contest against [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], struggling to score throughout the first half with the game effectively over by half-time. For the first time since 2011, the Swans failed to make a preliminary final.\n\nThe Swans' continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a [[salary cap]] concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/salary-cap-gave-swans-the-flag-say-hawks/story-e6frexx0-1226497327257|title=Hawks and Crows critical of Swans' salary cap \u2013 thetelegraph.com.au|publisher=|date=16 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/afl-turns-up-heat-on-sydneys-cost-of-living-allowance/story-e6frexwr-1226497138805|title=Dailytelegraph.com.au \u2013 Subscribe to The Daily Telegraph for exclusive stories|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au}}</ref> It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-03-04/afl-to-scrap-cola AFL to scrap COLA], AFL.com.au official website, 4 March 2014</ref> The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000).<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-01-21/swans-ok-to-trade-afl], AFL.com.au official website, 21 January 2015</ref> During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-08-14/swans-chairman-calls-for-trade-ban-to-be-banished], AFL.com.au official website, 14 August 2015</ref> In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA,<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-players-association-joins-fight-over-sydney-swans-trading-ban-20150820-gj4504.html], ''The Age'', 20 August 2015</ref> the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for [[Callum Sinclair]] in a swap deal,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-14/eagles-swans-agree-to-straight-sinclairjetta-swap], AFL.com.au official website, 14 October 2015</ref> as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, [[Michael Talia]] from the Western Bulldogs.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-trade-period-2015-former-bulldog-michael-talia-moves-to-swans-in-lastminute-trade-deal-20151022-gkfzhi.html], ''The Age'', 22 October 2015</ref>\n\nThe Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], with new Swans recruit [[Michael Talia]] suffering a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit [[Callum Sinclair]] kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with [[Lance Franklin]] kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, [[Isaac Heeney]] starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain [[Kieren Jack]] and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.\n\nAhead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant [[Jeremy Cameron]] outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the [[Adelaide Crows]] by 6 goals, with Franklin and [[Tom Papley]] kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the [[Geelong Cats]] at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.\n\nThe Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0\u20136. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.\n\nThe Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether. However three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the Elimination Final.\n\nThe Swans' golden era of finals appearances came to an end in 2019. They missed the finals for the first time in a decade, finishing 15th on the ladder with eight wins and 14 losses. They started the season poorly with just one win in their first seven matches, although they would briefly recover after winning five of the next seven games. Six losses on the trot ended any chance of a tenth consecutive finals appearance, but strong wins over also-rans Melbourne and St Kilda in the final two rounds ensured the season ended on a positive note.\n\nThey won their first match of the interrupted 2020 season against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval by three points.\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Guernsey===\nThe jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke.

The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the [[Brisbane Lions]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]]) and cross town rivals [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] are the only clubs with which there is a clash.<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2012-10-31/swans-2013-fixture-released Swans 2013 fixture released], Sydney Swans official website, 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] have manufactured the Swans' apparel since [[2010 AFL season|2010]], replacing long-time sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104222641/http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-11-04|title=ISC 2018 COMING SOON|website=www.isc-sports.com.au}}</ref>\n\n====Uniform evolution====\nSince the club was called \"South Melbourne\", the team has worn different designs with the traditional red and white colors, as follows:<ref>[https://www.footyjumpers.com/seasons.htm VFL Uniforms by season (since 1897)] on FootyJumpers.com</ref>\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_white|body= 002D62 |shorts= 002D62|socks= 002D62|title= 1874\u20131879}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000 |shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1880-1904}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _3whitestripes|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1905\u201306}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redrightsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1907-11 & 13-31}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redleftsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1912}}\n|}\n{|\n|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= |pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= |socks= ffffff|title= 1920-1922}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1932\u201374}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= ff0000|socks= ffffff|title= 1975\u201386}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= ff0000|title= 1987\u20132005}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= _hoops_red |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= |title= 2006\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Song===\nThe club song is known as ''Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White''' and is to the tune of the ''[[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]]'', the fight song of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in South Bend, Indiana, USA, which was written by [[University of Notre Dame]] graduates and brothers Rev. Michael J. Shea and John F. Shea. In 1961, the school and other musical houses granted South Melbourne a copyright to adapt the ''Victory March'' into the new club song, which replaced an adaptation of ''[[Springtime in the Rockies (1937 film)|Springtime in the Rockies]]'' by [[Gene Autry]].<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/club/our-club/club-song Sydney Swans Club Song] SydneySwans.com.au</ref> Port Adelaide also has used the ''Victory March'' as the basis for their club song since 1971, though their senior team changed their club song to their current original ''Power To Win'' after their entry into the AFL.\n\nGeorge Gershwin's ''[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]'' (1919) was used by the club in marketing promotions during the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Swans mascot.jpg|thumb|Syd 'Swannie' Skilton, Sydney Swans Mascot Manor mascot]]The Sydney Swans' mascot for the [[Mascot Manor|AFL's Mascot Manor]] is Syd 'Swannie' Skilton.\nHe is named after Swans legend [[Bob Skilton]].

The rivalry grew in 2013, when Hawthorn forward Lance Franklin transferred to the Swans as a free agent on a nine-year, $10&nbsp;million deal. In 2014, the Swans finished minor premiers and were favourites to win the grand final, however Hawthorn beat Sydney by 63 points.

Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the [[Sydney AFL]] competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the [[AFL Canberra]] competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the [[Brisbane Lions]], [[Gold Coast Suns]] and [[GWS Giants]]. The team plays home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.\n\nIn [[2011 NEAFL season|2011]] the Swans reserves finished the home and away season with the Eastern Conference minor premiership. In the Eastern Conference grand final [[Ainslie Football Club|Ainslie]] caused a major upset when they defeated the Swans by 52 points. The team suffered the same fate in [[2012 NEAFL season|2012]] when [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] defeated them by 30 points in the Eastern Conference grand final. The Swans reserves would then go on to play in an astonishing five losing NEAFL grand finals; 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Premierships (4)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[2005 AFL Canberra season|2005]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''12.8 (80) \u2013 8.15 (63)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2006 AFL Canberra season|2006]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''10.16 (76) \u2013 6.7 (43)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2007 AFL Canberra season|2007]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] || '''18.14 (122) \u2013 14.10 (94)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2008 AFL Canberra season|2008]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''11.4 (70) \u2013 9.15 (69)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Runners-up (9)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[1927 VFL season|1927]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] || '''11.9 (75) \u2013 12.22 (94)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1956 VFL season|1956]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''10.12 (72) \u2013 16.14 (110)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1980 VFL season|1980]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] || '''19.12 (126) \u2013 24.15 (159)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n|1995\n|AFL Reserves\n|North Melbourne\n|'''13.16 (94) - 11.14 (80)'''\n|MCG\n|-\n| [[2013 NEAFL season|2013]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.13 (73) \u2013 12.9 (81)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2014 NEAFL season|2014]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Aspley Australian Football Club|Aspley Hornets]] || '''15.10 (100) \u2013 15.12 (102)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2016 NEAFL season|2016]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club|WSU Giants]] || '''11.12 (78) \u2013 11.16 (82)''' || [[Blacktown International Sportspark]]\n|-\n| [[2017 NEAFL season|2017]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.22 (82) \u2013 12.13 (85)''' || [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n|-\n| [[2018 NEAFL season|2018]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| Southport {{ref label|1|b}}||'''14.6 (90) \u2013  5.5 (35)''' || [[Fankhauser Reserve]]\n|}\n{{note label|1|a}} Competed as South Melbourne.\n\n{{ref label|1|b}} In the final quarter with Southport leading 76 - 16, Southport were found to have 19 men on the field.

Morning Herald]] and their respective counterpart publications, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] and [[The Sun-Herald]]. Articles about the Swans can occasionally be found in local community newspapers, free magazines and Sydney street press publications.\n\n===Radio===\n\nThe Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match. Matches played at other times and days are broadcast on the [[ABC NewsRadio]] station's analogue AM/FM frequencies for listeners in Sydney, Newcastle, the NSW Central Coast and Canberra. Most Swans matches can be heard by listeners in the Riverina region of N.S.W. via the [[ABC Riverina]] \u2013 [[Wagga Wagga]] ([[2RVR]]) service, on the 675 AM frequency. Match coverage can be heard anywhere in the world via live streaming at the official AFL website or by downloading the AFL app for smartphones such as the [[iPhone]] and [[Samsung Galaxy]].\n\n===Television===\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 [[Network Ten]] televised all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside [[New South Wales]] live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney for Sydney viewers and via affiliated stations in N.S.W and [[Canberra]]. In past and recent years the [[Seven Network]] broadcast Swans games to viewers in Sydney and most of N.S.W. and Canberra via the Prime TV network (now branded as [[Prime7]]). Matches were telecast either live, on a 30\u201390-minute delayed broadcast or late-night replay. Commencing 2002 all their games were broadcast live or on same day delay by Subscription television provider [[Foxtel]] across Australia on either the [[Fox Footy Channel]] or [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, the AFL commenced a new broadcast deal requiring the [[Seven Network]] and their affiliate station [[Prime7]] to broadcast all Sydney Swans (and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]) games live to viewers in Sydney and most of regional [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]]. These games are screened on the [[7mate]] channel in these regions. [[Foxtel]] also signed a new broadcast deal for the 2012 \u2013 2016 seasons which included screening all AFL matches (including all Swans games) live across Australia on their [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[Fox Footy]] channels.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports|Australia}}\n*[[:Category:Sydney Swans players|List of former and current Swans' players' entries]]\n*[[List of South Melbourne/Sydney Football Club coaches]] (includes their W/L records)\n*[[Australian rules football in New South Wales]]\n*[[Lake Oval]] \u2013 former home of the Swans\n*[[North East Australian Football League]] \u2013 Sydney Swans reserves fields a team in this competition.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Jim Main|title=Plugger and the Mighty Swans|publisher=Wilkinson Books|year=1996|isbn=1-86350-229-7|author-link=Jim Main}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.afl.com.au/ Official website of the AFL]\n*[http://sydneyswans.com.au/ Official website of the Sydney Swans Football Club]\n*[http://www.aroundthegrounds.bellestorie.com/lakeside/lakeside.html \"Around the Grounds\" web documentary about the Lakeside Oval]\n\n{{Sydney Swans}}\n{{VFL/AFL minor premiers}}\n{{VFL/AFL premiers}}\n{{Australian Football League}}\n{{NEAFL}}\n{{VFL}}\n{{Aussie Rules in New South Wales}}\n{{Sydney Sports Teams}}\n\n[[Category:Sydney Swans|*]]\n[[Category:Australian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1874]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football clubs in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Former Victorian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:1874 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n[[Category:Sports team relocations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=January 2018}} \n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Infobox Australian football club\n|color1 = #ED171F\n|color2 = white\n|color3 = solid white\n| clubname  = Sydney Swans\n| image     = Sydney Swans Logo.svg\n| image_size      = 125px\n| caption   = \n| fullname  = Sydney Swans Limited<ref>{{cite web|url=https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/adf.task-flow?adf.tfId=panelSearch&adf.tfDoc=/taskflows/panelSearch.xml&searchText=063349708&searchType=OrgAndBusNm|title=ASIC Registry Search}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/staticfile/AFL%20Tenant/SydneySwans/Club%20HQ/Swans%20Constitution.pdf|title=Sydney Swans Constitution|access-date=24 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916123719/http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/staticfile/AFL%20Tenant/SydneySwans/Club%20HQ/Swans%20Constitution.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| formernames = South Melbourne Football Club<br/>(1874\u20131982)<br />Swans Football Club<br/>(1982)<ref>[http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/Sydney_part_2.htm Sydney \u2013 Part 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107085620/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/Sydney_part_2.htm |date=7 January 2009 }} \u2013 FullPointsFooty.

Established in [[Melbourne]] as the '''South Melbourne Football Club''' in 1874, the Swans relocated to [[Sydney]] in 1982, thus making it the first club in the competition to be based outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\nInitially playing in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), the Swans joined seven other clubs in founding the breakaway Victorian Football League (now known as the AFL) in 1896. It won premierships in [[1909 VFL Grand Final|1909]], [[1918 VFL Grand Final|1918]] and [[1933 VFL Grand Final|1933]] before experiencing a 72-year premiership drought\u2014the longest in the competition's history. The club broke the drought in [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005]] and won another premiership in [[2012 AFL season|2012]].\n\nThe club has proven to be one of the most consistent teams in the AFL era, failing to make the finals in only four seasons since [[1995 AFL season|1995]], playing the most number of finals matches and winning the second-most matches overall (only behind {{AFL Gee}}) since 2000 and boasting a finals winning record of over 50% in the same time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKBlqPdAo0WO-F_PQzFLuRX-TDz7xsg7TFb-gQ1C3F0/pubhtml?gid=388289766&single=true|title=AFL Finals Summary All Clubs 2000\u20132015|accessdate=9 November 2015|location=Google Docs|first=Justin|last=Mitchell|year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2017-02-06/which-was-the-best-club-since-2000|title=Which was the best club since 2000?|work=Staff writers|publisher=Australian Football League|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Swans' headquarters and training facilities are located at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], the club's playing home ground since 1982.\n\n==South Melbourne history==\n[[File:Smfc.png|thumb|Old South Melbourne Football Club shield.

The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].\n\n===VFL entry: 1897\u20131909===\nSouth Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.\n\n===Premiership success: 1909\u20131945===\nThe club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933.  The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne's \"Foreign Legion\".<ref>The caricature at the foot of [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/149547747/17704724 page 10 of ''Table Talk'' (22 June 1933)] was created by Richard \"Dick\" Ovenden (1897\u20131972). From left to right those represented are: [[Jack Bisset]], the team's captain; [[Dick Mullaly]], the club's secretary; [[Brighton Diggins]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Bert Beard]], from South Fremantle (WAFL); [[Bill Faul]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jim O'Meara]], from East Perth (WAFL); [[Frank Davies (footballer, born 1907)|Frank Davies]], from City (NTFA); [[Laurie Nash]], from City (NTFA); [[John Bowe (footballer)|John Bowe]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jack Wade (footballer)|Jack Wade]], from Port Adelaide (SANFL); [[Ossie Bertram]], from West Torrens (SANFL); and [[Wilbur Harris]], from West Torrens (SANFL).</ref>\n\nOn grand final eve, 1935, as the Swans prepared to take on Collingwood, star full-forward Bob Pratt was clipped by a truck moments after stepping off a tram and subsequently missed the match for South. Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.<ref>Shaw, I.W. (2006) ''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a [[Herald and Weekly Times]] artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the [[black swan]] being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|date=24 January 1934|location=Melbourne|title=Real story behind South Melbourne's football premiership|page=7|author=J. M. Rohan}}</ref> The name stuck, in part due to the club's association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its [[swan]]s (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).\n\nAfter several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as \"the Bloodbath\", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.\n\n===Struggling times: 1946\u20131981===\nIn the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] failed to help, as the [[Riverina Football League]] proved to be one of the least profitable zones.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they \"won\" three [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]]. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.\n\n==Sydney history==\n{{recentism|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Early years in Sydney: 1982\u20131987===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the [[Fitzroy Lions]] staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. The club had been operating at a loss of at least $150,000 for the previous five years. News of the proposal broke on 2 July 1981, after which a letter was sent to members outlining the board's reasons for making the proposal and noting that the coach and current players were in favour of the move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2019-07-02/on-this-day-swans-move-to-sydney|title=On This Day: Swans move to Sydney|website=sydneyswans.com.au|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.\n\nThe move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South at South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|title=VFL 'no' sends South to Sydney|author=Mike Coward|date=15 October 1981|page=32}}</ref> The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|page=40|author=Geoff Slattery|date=7 November 1981|title=South Players on strike}}</ref> The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.<ref name=\"saga\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Roar|title=Revisiting the South Melbourne to Sydney saga|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/07/06/the-south-to-sydney-saga/|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1982 Escort Championships|1982 Escort Championships Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Swa}}|| '''13''' ||'''12''' ||'''90'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Nor}} || 8 || 10 || 58\n|-\n| Venue: [[Waverley Park]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 20,028\n|}\n\nUpon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name \"South Melbourne\" in June 1982, becoming known as simply \"the Swans\" for the rest of that season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|location=Melbourne|first=Peter|last=Simunovich|title=The Swans \u2013 officially|date=3 June 1982|page=67}}</ref> It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.<ref name=\"saga\" /> Its physical \"home club\" was the \"Southern Cross Social Club\" at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]\n\nOn 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be [[Australian dollar|$]]6.3&nbsp;million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten]] \"bought\" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9&nbsp;million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong's contracts to recruit [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref> The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', p. 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref>\n\nDuring the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field \u2013 all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans\u2019 successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the \"Swanettes\", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no club has had cheerleaders since then.\n\nIn 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992.<ref>[[1992 AFL season]]</ref> However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.\n\n===Dark times: 1988\u20131994===\nThe club's form was to slump in the following year.\n\nLosses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willesee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.\n\nMorale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128</ref> Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).\n\nCapper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club's finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney's goalkicking was led by [[Bernard Toohey]] (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Barry Mitchell (footballer)|Barry Mitchell]]. The careers of stars such as [[Dennis Carroll]], [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Ian Roberts (footballer)|Ian Roberts]], [[Tony Morwood]] and [[David Murphy (Australian rules footballer)|David Murphy]] wound down,<ref>Cowley, Michael (19 October 2009) [http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/gen-next-must-fly-for-swans-as-wily-old-birds-go-20091124-j2aa.html Gen Next must fly for Swans as wily old birds go]</ref> while promising young players like [[Jamie Lawson (Australian footballer)|Jamie Lawson]], [[Robert Teal]] and [[Paul Bryce]] had their careers cut short by injury.\n\nAttendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994. The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.\n\nThe AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.\n\nDuring this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Kelly]].\n\nDesperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.\n\n===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995\u20132001===\nA big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony \"Plugger\" Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the dominant rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.\n\n1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won eight games \u2013 as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined \u2013 and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1996 AFL season|1996 AFL Home & Away Season]]'' || ''W'' || ''L'' || ''D'' ||''Total'' || ''%''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''16''' || '''5''' || '''1''' || '''66''' || '''123.9'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=9 | ''Minor Premiers''\n|}\n\nFormer Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].\n\nThe Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL StK}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].\n\nThe 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.\n\nAfter missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Colonial Stadium]].\n\n===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002\u20132004===\nFormer Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumors that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with [[Terry Wallace]].\n\nRoos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.\n\nA new home ground in [[ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against {{AFL Ess}} attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.\n\n2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended {{AFL StK}}'s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for [[Leo Barry]]'s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Fraser Gehrig]], whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.\n\nSydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL StK}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.\n\n===Premiership glory: 2005===\n{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}\n{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}\nIn 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO [[Andrew Demetriou]], for their unorthodox, \"boring\" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]] maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=35%\n|align=right\n|quote=Nick Davis!

This dropped them into a semi-final against the [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] at the SCG on 9 September, and the Swans trailed the Cats 31\u201353 before [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] kicked four consecutive goals, with the last one a matter of seconds before the siren, to win the game for Sydney by 7.14 (56) to 7.11 (53). In the first preliminary final at the MCG on 16 September against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the Swans used a seven-goal blitz in 11 minutes of the fourth quarter to overturn an 8-point deficit and overrun the Saints by 15.6 (96) to 9.11 (65).\n\nThe Swans faced the Eagles in a rematch in the [[AFL Grand Final]] on 24 September 2005, and this time, they prevailed by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth Premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[2005 AFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''8''' || '''10''' || '''58'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[West Coast Eagles]] || 7  || 12 || 54\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 91,898\n|}\n\nOn Friday, 30 September 2005, a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city.

It was their earliest exit from the finals since 2001 and was a culmination of a mostly disappointing season, as only victories against lesser teams saw them through to a fifth consecutive finals campaign.\n\nThe conclusion of the 2007 trade saw the loss of [[Adam Schneider]] and [[Sean Dempster]] to [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the delisting of [[Simon Phillips (footballer)|Simon Phillips]], Jonathan Simpkin and [[Luke Vogels]], and the gain of [[Henry Playfair]] from [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Martin Mattner]] from [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]].\n\n[[File:Sydney banner honouring Amon Buchanon and Paul Roos.jpg|thumb|A Sydney Swans banner honouring Amon Buchanon's 100th game as a player [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]]' 500th game as player and coach]]\n\nThe Swans spent the middle part of the 2008 season inside the top four, however a late form slump which yielded only three wins in the last nine rounds saw the Swans drop to sixth at the conclusion of the 2008 regular season. Having qualified for the finals for a sixth consecutive season, the Swans defeated {{AFL Nor}} in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] the following week.\n\n2009 saw the club register only eight victories as they failed to reach the finals for the first time since 2002, finishing 12th with a percentage of below 100% for the first time since 1994. [[Barry Hall]], [[Leo Barry]], [[Jared Crouch]], [[Michael O'Loughlin]], [[Amon Buchanan]] and [[Darren Jolly]] all departed at the conclusion of the season, with [[Mark Seaby]], [[Daniel Bradshaw]] and [[Shane Mumford]], among others, joining the club during the trade period.\n\nThe 2010 season saw Sydney return to the finals by virtue of a fifth-place finish at the end of the regular season. The club defeated {{AFL Car}} by five points in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons.

The Swans defeated {{AFL StK}} in an elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium]] before losing to {{AFL Haw}} in the semi-finals the following week.\n\nIt was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] on its home ground, [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Skilled Stadium]], where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]] during the regular season. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain [[Jarrad McVeigh]]'s baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match.\n\n[[File:Sydney Swans banner.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Swans players run through the banner before the inaugural Sydney Derby on 24 March 2012.]]\nThe 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers {{AFL GWS}}.

Subsequent wins over {{AFL Fre}}, {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL Nor}} and {{AFL Haw}} saw the Swans sit second behind {{AFL WC}} on percentage after Round 5, but the Swans would proceed to lose three of their next four matches before embarking on a nine-match winning streak between Rounds 10 and 19 inclusive. The Swans eventually finished the regular season in third place after losing three of their final four matches, all against their fellow top-four rivals (Collingwood, Hawthorn and Geelong in Rounds 20, 22 and 23 respectively).\n\nThe Swans defeated {{AFL Ade}} by 29 points in their qualifying final at [[AAMI Stadium]], thus earning a week off and a home preliminary final, where they then defeated {{AFL Col}} by 26 points to qualify for their first grand final since 2006, ending an eleven-match losing streak against the Magpies in the process.\n\nIn the grand final, the Swans defeated Hawthorn [[2012 AFL Grand Final|by ten points]] in front of 99,683 people at the MCG, with [[Nick Malceski]] kicking a snap goal with 34 seconds left to seal the Swans' fifth premiership and first since 2005.

In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the [[2014 AFL Grand Final]]. They defeated [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against [[North Melbourne Kangaroos|North Melbourne]], which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The [[2014 AFL Grand Final]] was played on Saturday 27 September 2014 in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player [[Lance Franklin]] would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137). The 63-point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season, meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history.\n\nThe Swans started the 2015 AFL season well, winning their first three, before losing their next 2 games against [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], where they trailed by as many as 8 goals before half-time, and the [[Western Bulldogs]]. They won their next 6 leading into the bye, including home wins against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], and an upset away win against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the grand final replay. The Swans lost their first game after the bye, their 3rd of the season to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at the SCG, 11.11 (77) to 14.11. (95). The Swans rebounded with unconvincing wins against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane Lions Football Club|Brisbane Lions]], before suffering their heaviest defeat for 17 seasons against the [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawks]] by 89 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/biggest-loss-in-17-years-a-humiliation-for-swans-says-luke-parker-20150719-gifoiw.html|title=Biggest loss in 17 years a humiliation for Swans, says Luke Parker|first=Sebastian|last=Hassett|date=19 July 2015|website=The Age}}</ref> The following week was no better with a road trip to Perth and another loss, this time to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]] by 52 points, the scoreline ultimately flattering the Swans. The Swans bounced back against Adelaide with a convincing win 52-point win, but lost their next game to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Simmonds stadium]]; a close affair that Geelong blew apart in the 3rd quarter. The Swans won their final 4 games to secure a top 4 finish, against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], {{AFL GWS}}, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and {{AFL GCS}}.\n\nThe Swans faced minor premiers [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] in the first qualifying final, their first finals match without Franklin, who had withdrawn from the finals due to illness.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-08/star-swan-franklin-out-of-final-against-freo-with-ongoing-mental-health-condition], AFL.com.au official website, 8 September 2015</ref> Ultimately the Swans would go down in a low scoring affair, effectively kicking themselves out of the game after losing [[Sam Reid (Australian footballer born 1991)|Sam Reid]] to a hamstring injury midway through the 2nd quarter.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/video-sam-reid-subbed-out-of-sydneys-qualifying-final-with-fremantle-with-hamstring-injury/story-e6frf3e3-1227524180065], Fox Sports, 12 September 2015</ref> The following week the Swans were knocked out of the finals in a one-sided contest against [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], struggling to score throughout the first half with the game effectively over by half-time.

There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000).<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-01-21/swans-ok-to-trade-afl], AFL.com.au official website, 21 January 2015</ref> During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-08-14/swans-chairman-calls-for-trade-ban-to-be-banished], AFL.com.au official website, 14 August 2015</ref> In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA,<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-players-association-joins-fight-over-sydney-swans-trading-ban-20150820-gj4504.html], ''The Age'', 20 August 2015</ref> the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for [[Callum Sinclair]] in a swap deal,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-14/eagles-swans-agree-to-straight-sinclairjetta-swap], AFL.com.au official website, 14 October 2015</ref> as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, [[Michael Talia]] from the Western Bulldogs.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-trade-period-2015-former-bulldog-michael-talia-moves-to-swans-in-lastminute-trade-deal-20151022-gkfzhi.html], ''The Age'', 22 October 2015</ref>\n\nThe Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], with new Swans recruit [[Michael Talia]] suffering a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit [[Callum Sinclair]] kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with [[Lance Franklin]] kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, [[Isaac Heeney]] starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain [[Kieren Jack]] and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.\n\nAhead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant [[Jeremy Cameron]] outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the [[Adelaide Crows]] by 6 goals, with Franklin and [[Tom Papley]] kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the [[Geelong Cats]] at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.\n\nThe Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0\u20136. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.\n\nThe Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether. However three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the Elimination Final.\n\nThe Swans' golden era of finals appearances came to an end in 2019. They missed the finals for the first time in a decade, finishing 15th on the ladder with eight wins and 14 losses. They started the season poorly with just one win in their first seven matches, although they would briefly recover after winning five of the next seven games. Six losses on the trot ended any chance of a tenth consecutive finals appearance, but strong wins over also-rans Melbourne and St Kilda in the final two rounds ensured the season ended on a positive note.\n\nThey won their first match of the interrupted 2020 season against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval by three points.\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Guernsey===\nThe jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red \"V\" on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club's major sponsor is [[QBE Insurance]]. In 2004 the club added the initials 'SMFC' in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club's past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans. The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the [[Brisbane Lions]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]]) and cross town rivals [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] are the only clubs with which there is a clash.<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2012-10-31/swans-2013-fixture-released Swans 2013 fixture released], Sydney Swans official website, 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] have manufactured the Swans' apparel since [[2010 AFL season|2010]], replacing long-time sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104222641/http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-11-04|title=ISC 2018 COMING SOON|website=www.isc-sports.com.au}}</ref>\n\n====Uniform evolution====\nSince the club was called \"South Melbourne\", the team has worn different designs with the traditional red and white colors, as follows:<ref>[https://www.footyjumpers.com/seasons.htm VFL Uniforms by season (since 1897)] on FootyJumpers.com</ref>\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_white|body= 002D62 |shorts= 002D62|socks= 002D62|title= 1874\u20131879}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000 |shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1880-1904}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _3whitestripes|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1905\u201306}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redrightsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1907-11 & 13-31}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redleftsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1912}}\n|}\n{|\n|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= |pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= |socks= ffffff|title= 1920-1922}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1932\u201374}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= ff0000|socks= ffffff|title= 1975\u201386}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= ff0000|title= 1987\u20132005}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= _hoops_red |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= |title= 2006\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Song===\nThe club song is known as ''Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White''' and is to the tune of the ''[[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]]'', the fight song of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in South Bend, Indiana, USA, which was written by [[University of Notre Dame]] graduates and brothers Rev.

Both teams have had close games since their grand final encounters, with their matches often finishing within single digit margins.\n\n==VFL and AFL premierships==\n\n===Premiers===\n* 1909 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Carlton 4.14 (38) to 4.12 (36)\n* 1918 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Collingwood 9.8 (62) to 7.15 (57)\n* 1933 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Richmond 9.17 (71) to 4.5 (29)\n* 2005 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated West Coast 8.10 (58) to 7.12 (54)\n* 2012 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated Hawthorn 14.7 (91) to 11.15 (81)\n\n===Defeated in grand finals===\n* 1899 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Fitzroy 3.9 (27) to 3.8 (26)\n* 1907 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 6.14 (50) to 6.9 (45)\n* 1912 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Essendon 5.17 (47) to 4.9 (33)\n* 1914 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 6.9 (45) to 4.15 (39)\n* 1934 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Richmond 19.14 (128) to 12.17 (89)\n* 1935 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Collingwood 11.12 (78) to 7.16 (58)\n* 1936 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Collingwood 11.23 (89) to 10.18 (78)\n* 1945 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 15.13 (103) to 10.15 (75)\n* 1996 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by North Melbourne 19.17 (131) to 13.10 (88); first grand final appearance after relocation\n* 2006 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by West Coast 12.13 (85) to 12.12 (84)\n* 2014 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by Hawthorn 21.11 (137) to 11.8 (74)\n* 2016 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by Western Bulldogs 13.11 (89) to 10.7 (67)\n\n==Players and staff==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Sydney Swans current squad}}\n\n===Officials===\n* '''Chairman:''' [[Andrew Pridham]]\n* '''Directors:'''\n** Andrew McMaster (Deputy chairman)\n** Rob Morgan\n** Alexandra Goodfellow\n** Greg Paramor\n** Robert Pascoe\n** Brian Tyson\n** Brad Seymour\n** Tim Worner\n* '''Chief executive:''' [[Tom Harley]]\n* '''general manager \u2013 Football:''' [[Charlie Gardiner (footballer)|Charlie Gardiner]]\n* '''Player Welfare & Development:''' [[Dennis Carroll]]\n\n==Reserves team==\n{{Main|Australian Football League reserves affiliations}}\nThe Swans currently field a reserves team in the [[North East Australian Football League]]. Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the [[Sydney AFL]] competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the [[AFL Canberra]] competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the [[Brisbane Lions]], [[Gold Coast Suns]] and [[GWS Giants]]. The team plays home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.\n\nIn [[2011 NEAFL season|2011]] the Swans reserves finished the home and away season with the Eastern Conference minor premiership. In the Eastern Conference grand final [[Ainslie Football Club|Ainslie]] caused a major upset when they defeated the Swans by 52 points. The team suffered the same fate in [[2012 NEAFL season|2012]] when [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] defeated them by 30 points in the Eastern Conference grand final. The Swans reserves would then go on to play in an astonishing five losing NEAFL grand finals; 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Premierships (4)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[2005 AFL Canberra season|2005]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''12.8 (80) \u2013 8.15 (63)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2006 AFL Canberra season|2006]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''10.16 (76) \u2013 6.7 (43)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2007 AFL Canberra season|2007]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] || '''18.14 (122) \u2013 14.10 (94)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2008 AFL Canberra season|2008]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''11.4 (70) \u2013 9.15 (69)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Runners-up (9)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[1927 VFL season|1927]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] || '''11.9 (75) \u2013 12.22 (94)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1956 VFL season|1956]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''10.12 (72) \u2013 16.14 (110)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1980 VFL season|1980]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] || '''19.12 (126) \u2013 24.15 (159)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n|1995\n|AFL Reserves\n|North Melbourne\n|'''13.16 (94) - 11.14 (80)'''\n|MCG\n|-\n| [[2013 NEAFL season|2013]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.13 (73) \u2013 12.9 (81)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2014 NEAFL season|2014]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Aspley Australian Football Club|Aspley Hornets]] || '''15.10 (100) \u2013 15.12 (102)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2016 NEAFL season|2016]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club|WSU Giants]] || '''11.12 (78) \u2013 11.16 (82)''' || [[Blacktown International Sportspark]]\n|-\n| [[2017 NEAFL season|2017]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.22 (82) \u2013 12.13 (85)''' || [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n|-\n| [[2018 NEAFL season|2018]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| Southport {{ref label|1|b}}||'''14.6 (90) \u2013  5.5 (35)''' || [[Fankhauser Reserve]]\n|}\n{{note label|1|a}} Competed as South Melbourne.\n\n{{ref label|1|b}} In the final quarter with Southport leading 76 - 16, Southport were found to have 19 men on the field.

(SAFF)\n\n==Media coverage==\n\n===Print===\n\nThe Sydney Swans receive regular exposure from Sydney's two major daily newspapers, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]], the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] and their respective counterpart publications, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] and [[The Sun-Herald]]. Articles about the Swans can occasionally be found in local community newspapers, free magazines and Sydney street press publications.\n\n===Radio===\n\nThe Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match. Matches played at other times and days are broadcast on the [[ABC NewsRadio]] station's analogue AM/FM frequencies for listeners in Sydney, Newcastle, the NSW Central Coast and Canberra. Most Swans matches can be heard by listeners in the Riverina region of N.S.W. via the [[ABC Riverina]] \u2013 [[Wagga Wagga]] ([[2RVR]]) service, on the 675 AM frequency. Match coverage can be heard anywhere in the world via live streaming at the official AFL website or by downloading the AFL app for smartphones such as the [[iPhone]] and [[Samsung Galaxy]].\n\n===Television===\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 [[Network Ten]] televised all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside [[New South Wales]] live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney for Sydney viewers and via affiliated stations in N.S.W and [[Canberra]]. In past and recent years the [[Seven Network]] broadcast Swans games to viewers in Sydney and most of N.S.W. and Canberra via the Prime TV network (now branded as [[Prime7]]). Matches were telecast either live, on a 30\u201390-minute delayed broadcast or late-night replay. Commencing 2002 all their games were broadcast live or on same day delay by Subscription television provider [[Foxtel]] across Australia on either the [[Fox Footy Channel]] or [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, the AFL commenced a new broadcast deal requiring the [[Seven Network]] and their affiliate station [[Prime7]] to broadcast all Sydney Swans (and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]) games live to viewers in Sydney and most of regional [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]]. These games are screened on the [[7mate]] channel in these regions. [[Foxtel]] also signed a new broadcast deal for the 2012 \u2013 2016 seasons which included screening all AFL matches (including all Swans games) live across Australia on their [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[Fox Footy]] channels.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports|Australia}}\n*[[:Category:Sydney Swans players|List of former and current Swans' players' entries]]\n*[[List of South Melbourne/Sydney Football Club coaches]] (includes their W/L records)\n*[[Australian rules football in New South Wales]]\n*[[Lake Oval]] \u2013 former home of the Swans\n*[[North East Australian Football League]] \u2013 Sydney Swans reserves fields a team in this competition.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Jim Main|title=Plugger and the Mighty Swans|publisher=Wilkinson Books|year=1996|isbn=1-86350-229-7|author-link=Jim Main}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.afl.com.au/ Official website of the AFL]\n*[http://sydneyswans.com.au/ Official website of the Sydney Swans Football Club]\n*[http://www.aroundthegrounds.bellestorie.com/lakeside/lakeside.html \"Around the Grounds\" web documentary about the Lakeside Oval]\n\n{{Sydney Swans}}\n{{VFL/AFL minor premiers}}\n{{VFL/AFL premiers}}\n{{Australian Football League}}\n{{NEAFL}}\n{{VFL}}\n{{Aussie Rules in New South Wales}}\n{{Sydney Sports Teams}}\n\n[[Category:Sydney Swans|*]]\n[[Category:Australian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1874]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football clubs in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Former Victorian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:1874 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n[[Category:Sports team relocations]]\n", "name_user": "Global-Cityzen", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHome ground", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans"}
