{"title_page": "Olympic Games ceremony", "text_new": "{{Olympic Games infobox}}\n'''Olympic Games ceremonies''' of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] were an integral part of these Games; the modern Olympic games have opening, closing, and medal ceremonies. Some of the elements of the modern ceremonies harken back to the Ancient Games from which the [[Olympic Games|Modern Olympics]] draw their ancestry. An example of this is the prominence of [[Greece]] in both the opening and closing ceremonies. During the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]], the medal winners received a crown of olive branches, which was a direct reference to the Ancient Games, in which the victor's prize was an [[olive wreath]]. The various elements of the ceremonies are mandated by the Olympic Charter, and cannot be changed by the host nation. This requirement of seeking the approval of the [[IOC|International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) includes the artistic portion of opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe ceremonies have evolved over the centuries. Ancient Games incorporated ceremonies to mark the beginning and ending of each successive game. There are both similarities and differences between the ancient Olympic ceremonies and their modern counterparts. While the presentation of the Games has evolved with improvements in technology and the desire of the host nations to showcase their own artistic expression, the basic events of each ceremony have remained unchanged. The presentation of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies continue to increase in scope, scale, and expense with each successive celebration of the Games, but they are still steeped in tradition. The [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028 Los Angeles Olympics]] organisers propose that the opening and closing ceremonies will each, for the first time, be staged across two different stadiums.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-la2024-olympic-ceremonies-20170116-story.html|title=L.A. organizers propose linked, simultaneous Olympic ceremonies for Coliseum, Inglewood stadium|last=Wharton|first=David|date=16 January 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Ancient forerunners ==\nThe Ancient Games, held in Greece from ca. 776&nbsp;BC to ca. 393&nbsp;AD,<ref name=\"Ancient Olympic Games\">{{cite web |title = Ancient Olympic Games|publisher = The Olympic Movement|url = http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/Ancient-Olympic-Games/ |accessdate = 2010-02-15}}</ref> provide the first examples of Olympic ceremonies.

The opening ceremony at the Beijing Games, for example, reportedly cost US$100&nbsp;million, with much of the cost incurring in the artistic portion of the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beijing Dazzles: Chinese History, on Parade as Olympics Begin|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Centre|date=2008-08-08|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2008/08/07/olympics-ceremonies.html|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref>\n\n===Parade of Nations===\nThe traditional part of the ceremonies starts with a \"'''Parade of Nations'''\", during which most participating athletes march into the stadium, country by country. It is not compulsory for athletes to participate in the opening ceremonies. Because some of the first events of the Games may start on the day before, on the day, or the day after the ceremonies, athletes competing in these early events may elect not to participate.\n\nFor every Opening Ceremony, each host country has a theme. During the \"Parade of Nations\", the host country's goal is to represent their cultural identity and to show the world their place in society.  For example, in the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] the theme was \u201cunity\u201d. On May 12, 2008, [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|a devastating earthquake]] erupted in Sichuan. As the host country, China wanted to remember this tragic event by having [[Yao Ming]], a Chinese basketball legend, walk hand-in-hand with Lin Hao, a nine-year-old boy who saved some of his classmates during the earthquake.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEach country's delegation is led by a sign with the name of their country and by their nation's flag.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> Traditionally, since the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] Greece always enters first and leads the parade due to the historical status as the progenitor of the Olympics, and the host nation enters last.<ref name=OCprotocol1/><ref>{{YouTube|id=lnPqFq1lIGg|title=Athletes Parade-Opening Ceremony London 2012 Olympics}}</ref> All other participating teams enter after Greece and before the host nation, in alphabetical order according to a language selected by the organizing committee for those games, which is usually the dominant language in the area of the host city. Announcers announce each country's name in English, French and the dominant language of the area of the host city, if neither English nor French is the dominant language. Beginning with the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (Summer or Winter) will march immediately before the current host in descending order. Therefore, in 2021 (for example), host [[Japan]] will follow the [[2028 Summer Olympics|United States]] and [[2024 Summer Olympics|France]] respectively as the final three nations to march. Also, the [[Refugee Olympic Team]] will now follow Greece as the second team to enter.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morgan|first=Liam|title=France, United States and Refugee team given prominent slots in Tokyo 2020 parade|publisher=Inside the Games|date=2019-12-03|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1087784/ioc-change-opening-ceremony-order |accessdate=2020-01-01 | location=Lausanne}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, the Greek flag led the parade, while the Greek team entered last, as the host nation; [[Saint Lucia]] (\u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 in [[Greek language|Greek]]) then entered first. In the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] were official languages of the games, but due to the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in [[French language|French]] alphabetical order. Due to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] pronunciation issues, all four games taking place in Japan, including the upcoming [[2020 Summer Olympics]], had the nations enter in English alphabetical order instead of Japanese characters. In the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 Summer Olympics]], teams were ordered by the number of strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name; this is expected to happen again in the [[2022 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Walker|first=Peter|title=Beijing Olympics open with spectacular ceremony|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2008-08-08|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china1 |accessdate=2009-01-10 | location=London}}</ref> In the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|2010 Winter Olympics]], teams entered in English alphabetical order, although the languages of the Olympics are also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of the two in Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia. In the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], the countries entered in the Cyrillic alphabetical order, which is the Russian language's official script, while in the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the countries entered in the [[Hangul]] alphabetical order, which is Korean language's official script.\n\n===Traditional events===\n{{further|List of people who have opened the Olympic Games}}\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth II opens the 2012 London Olympic Games.webm|thumb|200px|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opens the 2012 London Olympic Games]]After all nations have entered, the [[President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games|President of the Organizing Committee]] makes a speech, followed by the [[President of the International Olympic Committee|IOC president]]. At the end of his speech, he introduces the representative or head of state of the host country who officially declares the opening of the Games. Despite the Games having been awarded to a particular city and not to the country in general, the Olympic Charter presently requires the opener to be the host country's [[head of state]].<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\" /> However, there have been many cases where someone other than the host country's head of state opened the Games. The first example was at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|Games of the II Olympiad]] in Paris in 1900, which had no opening ceremony before as part of the 1900 World's Fair. There are five examples from the United States alone in which the Games were not opened by the head of state.<ref>The first case was the [[1904 Summer Olympics|St. Louis Games]] at which David Francis, President of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, performed the ceremony; nobody had thought of inviting President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In 1932, the then-[[Governor of New York]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], opened the [[1932 Winter Olympics|III Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]]. Later that year the Vice President of the United States, [[Charles Curtis]], opened the [[1932 Summer Olympics|Games of the X Olympiad]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], stating, however, that he was doing so on behalf of President [[Herbert Hoover]]. In 1960, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] was sent by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] to open the [[1960 Winter Olympics|VIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], California, and finally, in 1980, Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] stood in for President [[Jimmy Carter]] to open the [[1980 Winter Olympics|XIII Olympic Winter Games]], also in Lake Placid.</ref>\n\nThe Olympic Charter provides<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\">{{cite web |title=Olympic Charter|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|year=2015|url=https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf|accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref> that the person designated to open the Games should do so by reciting whichever of the following lines is appropriate:\n\n* If at the Games of the [[Olympiad]] (Summer Olympics): ''I declare open the Games of [name of the host city] celebrating the [ordinal number of the Olympiad] Olympiad of the modern era''.\n* If at the Winter Games: ''I declare open the [ordinal number] Olympic Winter Games of [name of the host city].''\n\nBefore 1936, the opening official would often make a short welcoming speech before declaring the Games open. However, since 1936, when [[Adolf Hitler]] opened both the [[1936 Winter Olympics|Garmisch Partenkirchen Winter Olympics]] and the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Summer Olympics]], the openers have used the standard formula. Recent editions of the Winter Games have seen a trend of using the first version instead of the second, which happened in both the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]] and [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Opening Ceremony: 2010 Winter Games declared open  |publisher=Vancouver 2010| date=12 February 2010|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/afp-news/opening-ceremony--2010-winter-games-declared-open_274384BS.html| accessdate=2010-02-19 }}</ref> Winter Games. There have been four further exceptions to the rule:\n\n* In 1976, [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Queen of Canada]], opened the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal Olympics]] (first in French followed by the English) with:\n''I declare open the Olympic Games of 1976, celebrating the XXI Olympiad of the modern era.''<ref>{{YouTube|id=aKh9881Xc8A|title=Montreal 1976 Olympics Opening}}</ref>\n\n* In 1984, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] opened the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Summer Olympics]] with:\n''Celebrating the XXIII Olympiad of the modern era, I declare open the Olympic Games of Los Angeles''.<ref>{{YouTube|id=cbbVk3AGVhE|title=1984 LA Opening Ceremonies \u2013 Lighting of the Cauldron}}</ref>\n\n* In 2002, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] opened the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City]], which took place five months after the [[September 11 attacks]], with:\n''On behalf of a proud, determined and grateful nation...,'' then the standard opening formula followed.\n\n* In 2008, Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]] opened the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in Beijing]] by speaking in Mandarin:\n''On behalf of the XXIX Olympiad, I officially declare these Olympic Games of Beijing... open!''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==bufV3EgyPGUt=3h45m21s|title=Full Opening Ceremony from Beijing 2008 - Throwback Thursday|last=Olympic|date=8 August 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n* In 2012, Elizabeth II, as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]], opened the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Summer Olympics]] with the same fashion in English, making it the second time that she opened the Games.<ref>{{YouTube|id=Ub1XpUgrza0|title=Queen Elizabeth Opened London Olympic Games 2012}}</ref>\n* In 2016, Brazilian Acting President [[Michel Temer]] opened the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics]] in Brazilian Portuguese, contrary to usual practice, he was not introduced at the beginning of the ceremony, nor was he introduced at the end of President Bach's speech, with:\n''After this wonderful show, I declare open the Rio Olympic Games, celebrating the XXXI Olympiad of the Modern Era''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_qXm9HY9Ro&t=3h36m16s|title=Rio 2016 Opening Ceremony Full HD Replay \u2013 Rio 2016 Olympic Games|last=Olympic|date=25 September 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nNext, the [[Olympic flag]] is carried horizontally (since the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]) into the stadium and hoisted as the [[Olympic Hymn]] is played. The Olympic Charter states that the Olympic flag must \"fly for the entire duration of the Olympic Games from a flagpole placed in a prominent position in the main stadium\".<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\"/> At most games, the flag has been carried into the stadium by prominent athletes of the host nation, but in [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012]], it was carried by an international group of athletes and non-athletes famous for promoting Olympic values, including [[Muhammad Ali]] as a symbolic flag-bearer.\n\nThe flag bearers of all countries then circle a rostrum, where one athlete of the host nation (since the 1920 Summer Olympics), and one judge of the host nation (since the 1972 Summer Olympics) speak the [[Olympic Oath]], declaring they will compete and judge according to the rules of their respective sport.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> Since the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, continuing with the tradition started at the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics]] a coach from the host nation speaks out the Olympic Oath. For the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in PyeongChang, the three oaths are merged into one as the Unified Oath where one athlete, judge, and coach recite one line of the oath respectively before the athlete finishes it.\n\n===Olympic flame===\n{{Further|Olympic flame|List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron}}\n[[File:Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima lights cauldron (28771915476).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vanderlei de Lima]] lights the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]]\nFinally, the [[Olympic Torch|Torch]] is brought into the [[Olympic Stadium|stadium]], passed from athlete to athlete during the [[Olympic Torch|torch relay]], until it reaches the last carrier; often a well-known athlete from the host nation, who lights the fire in the stadium's cauldron.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony for the 2010 Games]] in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was [[BC Place Stadium|BC Place]], which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist [[Catriona Le May Doan]], [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Nancy Greene]], who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Steve Nash]], a native of nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], and hockey legend [[Wayne Gretzky]], to each light one of four arms of the torch. Notably, Le May Doan's arm failed to rise; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the torch and succeeded.\n\nAfter the official conclusion of the Opening Ceremony, Gretzky was whisked away to a waiting car which took him to the secondary cauldron. Once there, he lit it to correspond with the tradition of Olympics past.\n\nDuring the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the cauldron located inside [[Olympic Stadium (London)]] was not visible from outside of the stadium.

The Summer Games would usually conduct the ceremonies immediately after the event at the respective venues, whereas the Winter editions would present the medals at a nightly victory ceremony held at a medal plaza, excluding the most of indoor events. A three\u2013tiered rostrum is used for the three medal winners, with the gold medal winner ascending to the highest platform, in the centre, with the silver and bronze medalists flanking. The medals are awarded by a member of the IOC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Olympic Games \u2013 the Medal Ceremonies|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-249556/Olympic-Games|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> The IOC member is usually accompanied by a person from sports federation governing the sport (such as IAAF in athletics or FINA in swimming), who presents each athlete with a small bouquet of flowers. When the Games were held in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the medal winners also received [[olive wreath]]s in honor of the tradition at the Ancient Olympics.

Then after the flame is extinguished, there would be a party for the athletes featuring some of the host country's music culture.\n\nThe traditional part of the closing ceremony starts with the \"Parade of Flags\",<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> where flag bearers from each participating country enter the stadium in single file, with the Greek flag in the lead and the host nation's flag bringing up the rear. Behind them march all of the athletes without any distinction or grouping by nationality. This \"Parade of Athletes,\"<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> the blending of all the athletes, is a tradition that began during the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at the suggestion of Melbourne schoolboy [[John Ian Wing]], who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as \"one nation.\" Prior to the 1956 Games, no Olympic Team had ever marched in the closing ceremony of the Modern or the Ancient Games. It was the very first International Peace March ever to be staged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwing.co.uk|title=Baron Pierre de Coubertin had a 'Dream'|website=www.johnwing.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Melbourne (Equestrian&nbsp;\u2013 Stockholm) 1956|publisher=[[British Olympic Association]] |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/gamesabout.aspx?gt=S&ga=14 |accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> (In [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]], the athletes marched in with their countrymen, then dispersed and mingled as the ceremonies went on.) The Winter Olympics followed suit in [[1960 Winter Olympics|Squaw Valley 1960]].\n\nAfter all the athletes enter the stadium, the final medals ceremony of the Games is held. The organizing committee of the respective host city, after consulting with the IOC, determines which event will have its medals presented.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> During the Summer Olympics, this is usually the men's marathon.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> Traditionally, the men's marathon is held in the last hours of competition on the last day of the Olympics, and the race is won just before the start of the closing ceremony.  However, recent Summer Olympiads in [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]], [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]], and [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio]] staged the marathon in the early morning due to heat problems in the host city. Since the [[2006 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|2006 Winter Olympics]], the medals for the men's 50&nbsp;km cross-country skiing event were presented at the closing ceremony. The medallists national flags are then hoisted and the national anthem of the gold medallist's country is played.\n\nThe newly elected members of the [[IOC Athletes' Commission]] then present a bouquet of flowers to a representative of the volunteers, as a thank you to them for their work during the Games.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/>\n\nNext, two other national flags are hoisted on flagpoles one at a time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece to again honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> \"[[Hymn to Liberty]]\", the national anthem of Greece, has been performed at every closing ceremony of the Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Anthem|url=http://www.sse.gr/page_en.php?id=77|publisher=Hellenic Army Academy|accessdate=30 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209135154/http://www.sse.gr/page_en.php?id=77|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=dmy}}</ref> In [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], during the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]] in protest of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], the flag raised to represent the next games host was that of the City of [[Los Angeles]] instead of the flag of the United States, a break from the tradition that was initiated by a host nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/multimedia-player/all-photos/1980/08/03/xaaku015/ |title=Moscow 1980 \u2014 Closing Ceremony \u2014 Los Angeles and Moscow's flags in the stadium. |publisher=Olympic.org |date=August 3, 1980 |accessdate=February 24, 2014 }}</ref> In [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], two Greek flags were raised because [[Greece]] was the next games host (in 2000) and in 2004, because Greece was hosting the games.

There are four such flags:\n* '''The Antwerp flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1920 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], and was passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Summer Olympics]] through the 1984 Games in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]].\n* '''The Oslo flag''' was presented to the IOC at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] by the city of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], and is passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Winter Olympics]].\n* '''The Seoul flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1988 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]<!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAME TO USE 'REPUBLIC'--> as a replacement for the Antwerp flag.

It'll be passed on to the next organizing city of the Summer Olympics.\n\nThis tradition was modified slightly at the 2006 Winter Games in [[Turin]], Italy. The flag was passed from [[Sergio Chiamparino]], the mayor of Turin, to [[Sam Sullivan]], the mayor of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.

Some of the elements of the modern ceremonies harken back to the Ancient Games from which the [[Olympic Games|Modern Olympics]] draw their ancestry. An example of this is the prominence of [[Greece]] in both the opening and closing ceremonies. During the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]], the medal winners received a crown of olive branches, which was a direct reference to the Ancient Games, in which the victor's prize was an [[olive wreath]]. The various elements of the ceremonies are mandated by the Olympic Charter, and cannot be changed by the host nation. This requirement of seeking the approval of the [[IOC|International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) includes the artistic portion of opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe ceremonies have evolved over the centuries. Ancient Games incorporated ceremonies to mark the beginning and ending of each successive game. There are both similarities and differences between the ancient Olympic ceremonies and their modern counterparts. While the presentation of the Games has evolved with improvements in technology and the desire of the host nations to showcase their own artistic expression, the basic events of each ceremony have remained unchanged. The presentation of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies continue to increase in scope, scale, and expense with each successive celebration of the Games, but they are still steeped in tradition. The [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028 Los Angeles Olympics]] organisers propose that the opening and closing ceremonies will each, for the first time, be staged across two different stadiums.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-la2024-olympic-ceremonies-20170116-story.html|title=L.A. organizers propose linked, simultaneous Olympic ceremonies for Coliseum, Inglewood stadium|last=Wharton|first=David|date=16 January 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Ancient forerunners ==\nThe Ancient Games, held in Greece from ca. 776&nbsp;BC to ca. 393&nbsp;AD,<ref name=\"Ancient Olympic Games\">{{cite web |title = Ancient Olympic Games|publisher = The Olympic Movement|url = http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/Ancient-Olympic-Games/ |accessdate = 2010-02-15}}</ref> provide the first examples of Olympic ceremonies.

It is not compulsory for athletes to participate in the opening ceremonies. Because some of the first events of the Games may start on the day before, on the day, or the day after the ceremonies, athletes competing in these early events may elect not to participate.\n\nFor every Opening Ceremony, each host country has a theme. During the \"Parade of Nations\", the host country's goal is to represent their cultural identity and to show the world their place in society.  For example, in the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] the theme was \u201cunity\u201d. On May 12, 2008, [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|a devastating earthquake]] erupted in Sichuan. As the host country, China wanted to remember this tragic event by having [[Yao Ming]], a Chinese basketball legend, walk hand-in-hand with Lin Hao, a nine-year-old boy who saved some of his classmates during the earthquake.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEach country's delegation is led by a sign with the name of their country and by their nation's flag.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> Traditionally, since the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] Greece always enters first and leads the parade due to the historical status as the progenitor of the Olympics, and the host nation enters last.<ref name=OCprotocol1/><ref>{{YouTube|id=lnPqFq1lIGg|title=Athletes Parade-Opening Ceremony London 2012 Olympics}}</ref> All other participating teams enter after Greece and before the host nation, in alphabetical order according to a language selected by the organizing committee for those games, which is usually the dominant language in the area of the host city. Announcers announce each country's name in English, French and the dominant language of the area of the host city, if neither English nor French is the dominant language. Beginning with the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (Summer or Winter) will march immediately before the current host in descending order. Therefore, in 2021 (for example), host [[Japan]] will follow the [[2028 Summer Olympics|United States]] and [[2024 Summer Olympics|France]] respectively as the final three nations to march. Also, the [[Refugee Olympic Team]] will now follow Greece as the second team to enter.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morgan|first=Liam|title=France, United States and Refugee team given prominent slots in Tokyo 2020 parade|publisher=Inside the Games|date=2019-12-03|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1087784/ioc-change-opening-ceremony-order |accessdate=2020-01-01 | location=Lausanne}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, the Greek flag led the parade, while the Greek team entered last, as the host nation; [[Saint Lucia]] (\u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 in [[Greek language|Greek]]) then entered first. In the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] were official languages of the games, but due to the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in [[French language|French]] alphabetical order. Due to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] pronunciation issues, all four games taking place in Japan, including the upcoming [[2020 Summer Olympics]], had the nations enter in English alphabetical order instead of Japanese characters. In the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 Summer Olympics]], teams were ordered by the number of strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name; this is expected to happen again in the [[2022 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Walker|first=Peter|title=Beijing Olympics open with spectacular ceremony|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2008-08-08|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china1 |accessdate=2009-01-10 | location=London}}</ref> In the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|2010 Winter Olympics]], teams entered in English alphabetical order, although the languages of the Olympics are also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of the two in Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia. In the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], the countries entered in the Cyrillic alphabetical order, which is the Russian language's official script, while in the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the countries entered in the [[Hangul]] alphabetical order, which is Korean language's official script.\n\n===Traditional events===\n{{further|List of people who have opened the Olympic Games}}\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth II opens the 2012 London Olympic Games.webm|thumb|200px|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opens the 2012 London Olympic Games]]After all nations have entered, the [[President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games|President of the Organizing Committee]] makes a speech, followed by the [[President of the International Olympic Committee|IOC president]]. At the end of his speech, he introduces the representative or head of state of the host country who officially declares the opening of the Games. Despite the Games having been awarded to a particular city and not to the country in general, the Olympic Charter presently requires the opener to be the host country's [[head of state]].<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\" /> However, there have been many cases where someone other than the host country's head of state opened the Games. The first example was at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|Games of the II Olympiad]] in Paris in 1900, which had no opening ceremony before as part of the 1900 World's Fair. There are five examples from the United States alone in which the Games were not opened by the head of state.<ref>The first case was the [[1904 Summer Olympics|St. Louis Games]] at which David Francis, President of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, performed the ceremony; nobody had thought of inviting President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. In 1932, the then-[[Governor of New York]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], opened the [[1932 Winter Olympics|III Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]]. Later that year the Vice President of the United States, [[Charles Curtis]], opened the [[1932 Summer Olympics|Games of the X Olympiad]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], stating, however, that he was doing so on behalf of President [[Herbert Hoover]]. In 1960, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] was sent by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] to open the [[1960 Winter Olympics|VIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], California, and finally, in 1980, Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] stood in for President [[Jimmy Carter]] to open the [[1980 Winter Olympics|XIII Olympic Winter Games]], also in Lake Placid.</ref>\n\nThe Olympic Charter provides<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\">{{cite web |title=Olympic Charter|publisher=The International Olympic Committee|year=2015|url=https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf|accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref> that the person designated to open the Games should do so by reciting whichever of the following lines is appropriate:\n\n* If at the Games of the [[Olympiad]] (Summer Olympics): ''I declare open the Games of [name of the host city] celebrating the [ordinal number of the Olympiad] Olympiad of the modern era''.\n* If at the Winter Games: ''I declare open the [ordinal number] Olympic Winter Games of [name of the host city].''\n\nBefore 1936, the opening official would often make a short welcoming speech before declaring the Games open. However, since 1936, when [[Adolf Hitler]] opened both the [[1936 Winter Olympics|Garmisch Partenkirchen Winter Olympics]] and the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Summer Olympics]], the openers have used the standard formula.

The Olympic Charter states that the Olympic flag must \"fly for the entire duration of the Olympic Games from a flagpole placed in a prominent position in the main stadium\".<ref name=\"OCprotocol2\"/> At most games, the flag has been carried into the stadium by prominent athletes of the host nation, but in [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012]], it was carried by an international group of athletes and non-athletes famous for promoting Olympic values, including [[Muhammad Ali]] as a symbolic flag-bearer.\n\nThe flag bearers of all countries then circle a rostrum, where one athlete of the host nation (since the 1920 Summer Olympics), and one judge of the host nation (since the 1972 Summer Olympics) speak the [[Olympic Oath]], declaring they will compete and judge according to the rules of their respective sport.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> Since the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, continuing with the tradition started at the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics]] a coach from the host nation speaks out the Olympic Oath. For the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in PyeongChang, the three oaths are merged into one as the Unified Oath where one athlete, judge, and coach recite one line of the oath respectively before the athlete finishes it.\n\n===Olympic flame===\n{{Further|Olympic flame|List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron}}\n[[File:Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima lights cauldron (28771915476).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vanderlei de Lima]] lights the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]]\nFinally, the [[Olympic Torch|Torch]] is brought into the [[Olympic Stadium|stadium]], passed from athlete to athlete during the [[Olympic Torch|torch relay]], until it reaches the last carrier; often a well-known athlete from the host nation, who lights the fire in the stadium's cauldron.<ref name=OCFactSheetS/><ref name=OCFactSheetW/> Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony for the 2010 Games]] in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was [[BC Place Stadium|BC Place]], which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist [[Catriona Le May Doan]], [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Nancy Greene]], who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Steve Nash]], a native of nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], and hockey legend [[Wayne Gretzky]], to each light one of four arms of the torch. Notably, Le May Doan's arm failed to rise; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the torch and succeeded.\n\nAfter the official conclusion of the Opening Ceremony, Gretzky was whisked away to a waiting car which took him to the secondary cauldron. Once there, he lit it to correspond with the tradition of Olympics past.\n\nDuring the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the cauldron located inside [[Olympic Stadium (London)]] was not visible from outside of the stadium.

In [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2004]], an [[light-emitting diode|LED]] screen was used. In [[2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|2006]], acrobats formed the shape of a dove. The [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 ceremony]] had yellow fireworks representing doves. [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|In 2010]], dove figures were projected on the stage floor. The [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012 ceremony]] had bicyclists with dove-wings, lit by LEDs. In the [[2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|2014 ceremony]] several dancers, holding strands of blue LED lights, danced on the shape of a dove projected on the stadium floor. In the [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2016 ceremony]], children with dove shaped kites were seen running with the first Olympic Laurel winner, [[Kipchoge Keino]].\n\n==Medal presentation==\n[[File:Victory ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The medal ceremony for the [[Gymnastics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's uneven bars|women's uneven bars]] at the London 2012 Summer Olympics]]\nAfter each Olympic event is completed, a medal ceremony is held. The Summer Games would usually conduct the ceremonies immediately after the event at the respective venues, whereas the Winter editions would present the medals at a nightly victory ceremony held at a medal plaza, excluding the most of indoor events. A three\u2013tiered rostrum is used for the three medal winners, with the gold medal winner ascending to the highest platform, in the centre, with the silver and bronze medalists flanking. The medals are awarded by a member of the IOC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Olympic Games \u2013 the Medal Ceremonies|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-249556/Olympic-Games|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> The IOC member is usually accompanied by a person from sports federation governing the sport (such as IAAF in athletics or FINA in swimming), who presents each athlete with a small bouquet of flowers. When the Games were held in [[Athens]] in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the medal winners also received [[olive wreath]]s in honor of the tradition at the Ancient Olympics. For the [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] Games in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], the flowers were replaced by a small 3D model of the Games' logo and [[Pyeongchang]] Games in [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]] a stuffed animal. After medals are distributed, the flags of the nations of the three medalists are raised. The flag of the gold medalist's country is in the centre and raised the highest while the flag of the silver medalist's country is on the left facing the flags and the flag of the bronze medalist's country is on the right, both at lower elevations than the gold medalist's country's flag.\n\nThe flags are raised while the [[national anthem]] of the gold medalist's country plays.<ref name=otraditions>{{cite news |title=Symbols and Traditions|newspaper=USA Today|date=1999-07-12|url=https://www.usatoday.com/olympics/owg98/osytr03.htm|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> Citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies.

For example, they are required to wear only pre-approved outfits that are standard for the athlete's national Olympic team.  They are not allowed to display any political affiliation or make a political statement while on the medal stand.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> The most famous violation of this rule was the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|Black Power salute]] of [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]].\n\nFor their actions, IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] demanded their expulsion from the Olympics.<ref>{{cite news |title=1968 Black Athletes make silent protest|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3535000/3535348.stm|accessdate=2009-01-10 | date=1968-10-17}}</ref> After the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) refused to do so, Brundage threatened to remove the entire [[United States at the 1968 Summer Olympics|United States]] track and field team from the Olympics.

Then after the flame is extinguished, there would be a party for the athletes featuring some of the host country's music culture\n\nThe traditional part of the closing ceremony starts with the \"Parade of Flags\",<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> where flag bearers from each participating country enter the stadium in single file, with the Greek flag in the lead and the host nation's flag bringing up the rear. Behind them march all of the athletes without any distinction or grouping by nationality. This \"Parade of Athletes,\"<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> the blending of all the athletes, is a tradition that began during the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at the suggestion of Melbourne schoolboy [[John Ian Wing]], who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as \"one nation.\" Prior to the 1956 Games, no Olympic Team had ever marched in the closing ceremony of the Modern or the Ancient Games. It was the very first International Peace March ever to be staged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwing.co.uk|title=Baron Pierre de Coubertin had a 'Dream'|website=www.johnwing.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Melbourne (Equestrian&nbsp;\u2013 Stockholm) 1956|publisher=[[British Olympic Association]] |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/gamesabout.aspx?gt=S&ga=14 |accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> (In [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]], the athletes marched in with their countrymen, then dispersed and mingled as the ceremonies went on.) The Winter Olympics followed suit in [[1960 Winter Olympics|1960]].\n\nAfter all the athletes enter the stadium, the final medals ceremony of the Games is held. The organizing committee of the respective host city, after consulting with the IOC, determines which event will have its medals presented.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> During the Summer Olympics, this is usually the men's marathon.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> Traditionally, the men's marathon is held in the last hours of competition on the last day of the Olympics, and the race is won just before the start of the closing ceremony.  However, recent Summer Olympiads in [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]], [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]], and [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio]] staged the marathon in the early morning due to heat problems in the host city. Since the [[2006 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|2006 Winter Olympics]], the medals for the men's 50&nbsp;km cross-country skiing event were presented at the closing ceremony. The medallists national flags are then hoisted and the national anthem of the gold medallist's country is played.\n\nThe newly elected members of the [[IOC Athletes' Commission]] then present a bouquet of flowers to a representative of the volunteers, as a thank you to them for their work during the Games.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/>\n\nNext, two other national flags are hoisted on flagpoles one at a time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece to again honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/> \"[[Hymn to Liberty]]\", the national anthem of Greece, has been performed at every closing ceremony of the Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Anthem|url=http://www.sse.gr/page_en.php?id=77|publisher=Hellenic Army Academy|accessdate=30 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209135154/http://www.sse.gr/page_en.php?id=77|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=dmy}}</ref> In [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], during the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]], the flag raised to represent the next games host was that of the City of [[Los Angeles]] instead of the flag of the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/multimedia-player/all-photos/1980/08/03/xaaku015/ |title=Moscow 1980 \u2014 Closing Ceremony \u2014 Los Angeles and Moscow's flags in the stadium. |publisher=Olympic.org |date=August 3, 1980 |accessdate=February 24, 2014 }}</ref> In [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], two Greek flags were raised because [[Greece]] was the next games host (in 2000) and in 2004, because Greece was hosting the games. Then, while the Olympic Hymn is played, the Olympic flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremony is lowered from the flagpole and carried from the stadium.<ref name=\"IOCclosing\"/>\n\nIn what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony (because the tradition began at the Antwerp Games), the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games.<ref name=OCprotocol2/> The receiving mayor then waves the flag eight times. There are four such flags:\n* '''The Antwerp flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1920 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], and was passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Summer Olympics]] through the 1984 Games in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]].\n* '''The Oslo flag''' was presented to the IOC at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] by the city of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], and is passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Winter Olympics]].\n* '''The Seoul flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 1988 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]<!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAME TO USE 'REPUBLIC'--> as a replacement for the Antwerp flag. This flag was used until the 2012 Games in [[London]], [[England]].\n* '''The Rio flag''' was presented to the IOC at the 2016 Summer Olympics by the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]  as a replacement for the Seoul flag. It'll be passed on to the next organizing city of the Summer Olympics.\n\nThis tradition was modified slightly at the 2006 Winter Games in [[Turin]], Italy. The flag was passed from [[Sergio Chiamparino]], the mayor of Turin, to [[Sam Sullivan]], the mayor of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.  Mayor Sullivan, who is a [[quadriplegic]], waved the flag by holding it in one hand and swinging his motorized wheelchair back and forth eight times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vancouver Mayor Achieves his Dreams with a Big Heart and Mechanical Help|publisher=Disabled World|last=Thomas|first=Andrew|date=2008-04-18|url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/sam-sullivan.shtml|accessdate=2009-02-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728200033/http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/sam-sullivan.shtml|archivedate=2012-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThis portion of the ceremony actually took place at the opening ceremony until the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] summer games and the [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] winter games.<ref>[[1980 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe next host nation then introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of that country or city.

It is a [[bicameral]] body: the [[upper house|upper chamber]], the [[Maryland State Senate]], has 47 representatives and the [[lower house|lower chamber]], the [[Maryland House of Delegates]], has 141 representatives.  Members of both houses serve four-year terms. Each house elects its own officers, judges the qualifications and election of its own members, establishes rules for the conduct of its business, and may punish or expel its own members.\n\nThe General Assembly meets each year for 90 days to act on more than 2,300 bills including the state's annual budget, which it must pass before [[adjournment sine die|adjourning ''sine die'']].  The General Assembly's 438th session convened on January 10, 2018.\n\n==History==\nThe forerunner of the Maryland General Assembly was the colonial institution, an assembly of free Marylanders, which bore the same name.\nMaryland's foundational charter created a state ruled by the ''[[Palatine lord]],'' Lord Baltimore. As ruler, Lord Baltimore owned directly all of the land granted in the charter, and possessed absolute authority over his domain.\n\nHowever, as elsewhere in English North America, English political institutions were re-created in the colonies, and the Maryland General Assembly fulfilled much the same function as the [[House of Commons of England]].<ref name=\"Andrews, p.70\">Andrews, p.70</ref> An act was passed providing that:\n\n<blockquote>from henceforth and for ever everyone being of the council of the Province and any other gentleman of able judgement summoned by writ (and the Lord of every Manor within this Province after Manors be erected) shall and may have his voice, seat, and place in every General Assembly ... together with two or more able and sufficient men for the hundred as the said freedmen or the major part of them ... shall think good.</blockquote>\n\nIn addition, the Lord Proprietor could summon any delegates whom he desired.<ref>Andrews, p.71</ref>\n\nIn some ways the General Assembly was an improvement upon the institutions of the mother country. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that \"assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least\", ensuring that their voices would be regularly heard.<ref name=\"Andrews, p.70\"/>\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]] the colonial Assembly ceased to exist, and was replaced by its modern successor.\n\nStarting in 1867, the Assembly became increasingly unrepresentative. As the population of [[Baltimore]] increased, it and other urban areas were [[Reynolds v. Sims|not granted additional seats.]] By 1918, the city's population had increased 175% while the entire state gained only 46% with no reallocation of political power.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Okrent |first1=Daniel |title=Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition  |date=11 May 2010 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0743277020  |at=loc 2017 (Kindle) |asin=B003JTHVHY |author-link=Daniel Okrent }}</ref>\n\nFor the first time since the [[American Civil War]], the General Assembly adjourned early on March 18, 2020, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>Collins, David.

Retrieved on 11 April 2020.</ref>\n\n==Qualifications and membership==\nEach senator or delegate must be a U.S. citizen and a resident of Maryland for at least one year preceding his or her election. A prospective legislator must have resided in the legislative district the candidate seeks to represent for the six months prior to election. A senator must be at least twenty-five years of age at the time of election and a delegate at least twenty-one. Military officers other than members of the reserves are not eligible for election to the General Assembly.\n\nEach term lasts four years. However, members of the General Assembly are not [[term limit|term-limited]]. If a vacancy occurs in either house through death, resignation, or disqualification, the [[Governor of Maryland]] appoints a replacement whose name is submitted by the State Central Committee of the same political party as the legislator whose seat is to be filled.\n\n==Legislative districts==\n[[File:Party Composition of Maryland House of Delegates Districts01.png|thumb|Party Composition of Maryland House of Delegates Districts|left|300px|thumb|Map of Maryland House of Delegates electoral districts by party composition:\n{|\n|-\n!3 sub-districts !! 2 sub-districts !! 1 sub-district\n|-\n|{{legend2|#000099|3 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#00CCFF|2 dem., 1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF00FF|1 dem., 2 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#990000|3 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |{{legend2|#0000FF|2 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#9BFF9B|1 dem., 1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF0000|2 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |{{legend2|#99CCFF|1 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF99CC|1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FFFFFF|1 ind.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Party Composition of Maryland State Senate Districts.png|left|thumb|310x310px|Districts and party composition of the Maryland Senate]]\nThe current pattern for distribution of seats began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter according to the results of the decennial [[U.S. Census]]. A Constitutional amendment, the plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district elects one senator and three delegates. In most districts, the three delegates are elected at large from the whole district via [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]. However, in some more sparsely populated areas of the state, the districts are divided into subdistricts for the election of delegates: either into three one-delegate subdistricts or one two-delegate subdistrict and one one-delegate subdistrict.\n<br />\n\n==Leadership==\nThe Senate is led by a [[President of the Maryland Senate|President]] and the House by a [[Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates|Speaker]] whose respective duties and prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except in the case of the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding points of order. As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing. The president pro tempore appoints majority and minority whips and leaders.\n\n== Overview of legislative procedure ==\nA [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] is a proposal to change, repeal, or add to existing state law. A House Bill (HB) is one introduced in the House of Delegates (for example: HB 6);<ref>{{cite web|title=House Bill 6 (2008)|publisher=Maryland Department of Legislative Services|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?tab=subject3&ys=2008rs/billfile/hb0006.htm|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref> a [[Senate Bill]] (SB), in the Senate.\n\nBills are designated by number, in the order of introduction in each house. For example, HB 16 refers to the sixteenth bill introduced in the House of Delegates. The numbering starts afresh each session. The names of the sponsor (and co-sponsors, if any), the legislator who introduced the bill, becomes part of the title. Bills listed as \"The Speaker (By Request of Administration)\", \"The President (By Request of Administration)\", \"Minority Leader (By Request of Administration)\", or \"Committee Chair (By Request of Department)\" are bills proposed by the Governor and his agencies and are not proposals of the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader, or the respective Committee Chair. They are listed with the official title of a legislator rather than the Governor due to requirements in the [[Maryland Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov|title=The Maryland General Assembly|publisher=Maryland Department of Legislative Services, Office of Information Systems|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe [[legislative procedure]], is divided into distinct stages:\n*[[wikt:draft|Drafting]]. The procedure begins when a Senator or Delegate decides to author a bill. A legislator sends the idea for the bill to the Department of Legislative Services' bill drafting division, where it is drafted into bill form. The draft of the bill is returned to the legislator for introduction.\n*Introduction or [[First reading|First Reading]]. A bill is introduced or read the first time when the bill number, the name of the sponsor, and the descriptive title of the bill are read on the floor of the house.\n*[[Committee hearing]]. After introduction, a bill is assigned to the appropriate [[policy committee]], appropriate to the subject matter, for its first hearing. Notice of the hearing is published in the Maryland Register to allow for public comment. During the committee hearing the sponsor presents the bill to the committee, and testimony may be heard in support or opposition to the bill from any member of the public. The committee then votes on whether to pass the bill out of committee, or that it be passed as amended. Bills may be amended several times. It takes a majority vote of the committee membership for a bill to be passed and sent to the next committee or to the [[floor of the house|floor]].\n*[[Second reading]]. A bill [[recommended for passage]] by committee is read a second time on the floor of the house. Legislators, not on the committee where the bill received its public hearing, may only offer amendments to the bill at this stage. House bills in the Senate may be amended by Senators on second or third reading and Senate bills in the House may also be amended on second or third reading. After all amendments are considered, the presiding officer orders the bill to be printed for third reading. This printing would include any committee or floor amendments.\n* [[Third reading]]. A [[roll call vote]] is taken. An ordinary bill needs a [[majority vote]] to pass. An emergency bill requires a three-fifths vote, and a bill requiring the [[Maryland Constitution]] to be amended requires a three-fifths vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maryland Legislator's Handbook|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/Pubs/legislegal/2014-LegislativeHandbookSeries-Vol-1.pdf|website=Maryland.gov|publisher=State of Maryland|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n* Second house. If the bill receives a [[Maryland Constitution|constitutional]] majority from the first house, the bill repeats the same steps in the other house. If the second house passes the bill without changing it, it is sent to the governor's desk.\n* Resolution of Differences ([[concurrence]] or conference). If a measure is [[Bill (proposed law)|amended]] in the second house and [[Pass (legislature)|passed]], it is returned to the house of origin for consideration of amendments. The house of origin may [[concur]] with the amendments and send the bill to the governor or reject the amendments and submit it to a two-house [[conference committee]]. Appointed by the Senate President and the House Speaker, a conference committee consists of three members of each house. The committee sends a report of its recommendations to each chamber which then can adopt or reject it. If the report is adopted, the bill is voted upon for final passage in each house. If the report is rejected by either house, the bill fails.\n\n[[File:Governor signs HB 83-2008.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Legislators pose as Governor [[Martin O'Malley|O'Malley]] signs a bill into law at a [[signing ceremony]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, on May 13, 2008.]]\n\n* Governor's action. All passed bills, except the budget bill and constitutional amendments, must be presented to the Governor within twenty days following adjournment of a session. The Governor may [[veto]] bills within thirty days after presentation. If a passed bill is not vetoed, it becomes law. The budget bill, however, becomes law upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they become law only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election.\n* [[Veto override]]s. A vetoed bill is returned to the house of origin, where a vote may be taken to override the governor's veto; a three-fifths vote of both houses is required to override a veto.\n* Effective date. Each bill that is passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor is assigned a chapter number by the [[Maryland Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].

It is a [[bicameral]] body: the [[upper house|upper chamber]], the [[Maryland State Senate]], has 47 representatives and the [[lower house|lower chamber]], the [[Maryland House of Delegates]], has 141 representatives.  Members of both houses serve four-year terms. Each house elects its own officers, judges the qualifications and election of its own members, establishes rules for the conduct of its business, and may punish or expel its own members.\n\nThe General Assembly meets each year for 90 days to act on more than 2,300 bills including the state's annual budget, which it must pass before [[adjournment sine die|adjourning ''sine die'']].  The General Assembly's 438th session convened on January 10, 2018.\n\n==History==\nThe forerunner of the Maryland General Assembly was the colonial institution, an assembly of free Marylanders, which bore the same name.\nMaryland's foundational charter created a state ruled by the ''[[Palatine lord]],'' Lord Baltimore. As ruler, Lord Baltimore owned directly all of the land granted in the charter, and possessed absolute authority over his domain.\n\nHowever, as elsewhere in English North America, English political institutions were re-created in the colonies, and the Maryland General Assembly fulfilled much the same function as the [[House of Commons of England]].<ref name=\"Andrews, p.70\">Andrews, p.70</ref> An act was passed providing that:\n\n<blockquote>from henceforth and for ever everyone being of the council of the Province and any other gentleman of able judgement summoned by writ (and the Lord of every Manor within this Province after Manors be erected) shall and may have his voice, seat, and place in every General Assembly ... together with two or more able and sufficient men for the hundred as the said freedmen or the major part of them ... shall think good.</blockquote>\n\nIn addition, the Lord Proprietor could summon any delegates whom he desired.<ref>Andrews, p.71</ref>\n\nIn some ways the General Assembly was an improvement upon the institutions of the mother country. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that \"assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least\", ensuring that their voices would be regularly heard.<ref name=\"Andrews, p.70\"/>\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]] the colonial Assembly ceased to exist, and was replaced by its modern successor.\n\nStarting in 1867, the Assembly became increasingly unrepresentative. As the population of [[Baltimore]] increased, it and other urban areas were [[Reynolds v. Sims|not granted additional seats.]] By 1918, the city's population had increased 175% while the entire state gained only 46% with no reallocation of political power.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Okrent |first1=Daniel |title=Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition  |date=11 May 2010 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0743277020  |at=loc 2017 (Kindle) |asin=B003JTHVHY |author-link=Daniel Okrent }}</ref>\n\n==Qualifications and membership==\nEach senator or delegate must be a U.S. citizen and a resident of Maryland for at least one year preceding his or her election. A prospective legislator must have resided in the legislative district the candidate seeks to represent for the six months prior to election. A senator must be at least twenty-five years of age at the time of election and a delegate at least twenty-one. Military officers other than members of the reserves are not eligible for election to the General Assembly.\n\nEach term lasts four years. However, members of the General Assembly are not [[term limit|term-limited]]. If a vacancy occurs in either house through death, resignation, or disqualification, the [[Governor of Maryland]] appoints a replacement whose name is submitted by the State Central Committee of the same political party as the legislator whose seat is to be filled.\n\n==Legislative districts==\n[[File:Party Composition of Maryland House of Delegates Districts01.png|thumb|Party Composition of Maryland House of Delegates Districts|left|300px|thumb|Map of Maryland House of Delegates electoral districts by party composition:\n{|\n|-\n!3 sub-districts !! 2 sub-districts !! 1 sub-district\n|-\n|{{legend2|#000099|3 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#00CCFF|2 dem., 1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF00FF|1 dem., 2 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#990000|3 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |{{legend2|#0000FF|2 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#9BFF9B|1 dem., 1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF0000|2 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |{{legend2|#99CCFF|1 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF99CC|1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FFFFFF|1 ind.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Party Composition of Maryland State Senate Districts.png|left|thumb|310x310px|Districts and party composition of the Maryland Senate]]\nThe current pattern for distribution of seats began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter according to the results of the decennial [[U.S. Census]]. A Constitutional amendment, the plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district elects one senator and three delegates. In most districts, the three delegates are elected at large from the whole district via [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]. However, in some more sparsely populated areas of the state, the districts are divided into subdistricts for the election of delegates: either into three one-delegate subdistricts or one two-delegate subdistrict and one one-delegate subdistrict.\n<br />\n\n==Leadership==\nThe Senate is led by a [[President of the Maryland Senate|President]] and the House by a [[Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates|Speaker]] whose respective duties and prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except in the case of the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding points of order. As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing. The president pro tempore appoints majority and minority whips and leaders.\n\n== Overview of legislative procedure ==\nA [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] is a proposal to change, repeal, or add to existing state law. A House Bill (HB) is one introduced in the House of Delegates (for example: HB 6);<ref>{{cite web|title=House Bill 6 (2008)|publisher=Maryland Department of Legislative Services|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?tab=subject3&ys=2008rs/billfile/hb0006.htm|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref> a [[Senate Bill]] (SB), in the Senate.\n\nBills are designated by number, in the order of introduction in each house. For example, HB 16 refers to the sixteenth bill introduced in the House of Delegates. The numbering starts afresh each session. The names of the sponsor (and co-sponsors, if any), the legislator who introduced the bill, becomes part of the title. Bills listed as \"The Speaker (By Request of Administration)\", \"The President (By Request of Administration)\", \"Minority Leader (By Request of Administration)\", or \"Committee Chair (By Request of Department)\" are bills proposed by the Governor and his agencies and are not proposals of the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader, or the respective Committee Chair. They are listed with the official title of a legislator rather than the Governor due to requirements in the [[Maryland Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov|title=The Maryland General Assembly|publisher=Maryland Department of Legislative Services, Office of Information Systems|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe [[legislative procedure]], is divided into distinct stages:\n*[[wikt:draft|Drafting]]. The procedure begins when a Senator or Delegate decides to author a bill. A legislator sends the idea for the bill to the Department of Legislative Services' bill drafting division, where it is drafted into bill form. The draft of the bill is returned to the legislator for introduction.\n*Introduction or [[First reading|First Reading]]. A bill is introduced or read the first time when the bill number, the name of the sponsor, and the descriptive title of the bill are read on the floor of the house.\n*[[Committee hearing]]. After introduction, a bill is assigned to the appropriate [[policy committee]], appropriate to the subject matter, for its first hearing. Notice of the hearing is published in the Maryland Register to allow for public comment. During the committee hearing the sponsor presents the bill to the committee, and testimony may be heard in support or opposition to the bill from any member of the public. The committee then votes on whether to pass the bill out of committee, or that it be passed as amended. Bills may be amended several times. It takes a majority vote of the committee membership for a bill to be passed and sent to the next committee or to the [[floor of the house|floor]].\n*[[Second reading]]. A bill [[recommended for passage]] by committee is read a second time on the floor of the house. Legislators, not on the committee where the bill received its public hearing, may only offer amendments to the bill at this stage. House bills in the Senate may be amended by Senators on second or third reading and Senate bills in the House may also be amended on second or third reading. After all amendments are considered, the presiding officer orders the bill to be printed for third reading. This printing would include any committee or floor amendments.\n* [[Third reading]]. A [[roll call vote]] is taken. An ordinary bill needs a [[majority vote]] to pass. An emergency bill requires a three-fifths vote, and a bill requiring the [[Maryland Constitution]] to be amended requires a three-fifths vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maryland Legislator's Handbook|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/Pubs/legislegal/2014-LegislativeHandbookSeries-Vol-1.pdf|website=Maryland.gov|publisher=State of Maryland|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n* Second house. If the bill receives a [[Maryland Constitution|constitutional]] majority from the first house, the bill repeats the same steps in the other house. If the second house passes the bill without changing it, it is sent to the governor's desk.\n* Resolution of Differences ([[concurrence]] or conference). If a measure is [[Bill (proposed law)|amended]] in the second house and [[Pass (legislature)|passed]], it is returned to the house of origin for consideration of amendments. The house of origin may [[concur]] with the amendments and send the bill to the governor or reject the amendments and submit it to a two-house [[conference committee]]. Appointed by the Senate President and the House Speaker, a conference committee consists of three members of each house. The committee sends a report of its recommendations to each chamber which then can adopt or reject it. If the report is adopted, the bill is voted upon for final passage in each house. If the report is rejected by either house, the bill fails.\n\n[[File:Governor signs HB 83-2008.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Legislators pose as Governor [[Martin O'Malley|O'Malley]] signs a bill into law at a [[signing ceremony]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, on May 13, 2008.]]\n\n* Governor's action. All passed bills, except the budget bill and constitutional amendments, must be presented to the Governor within twenty days following adjournment of a session. The Governor may [[veto]] bills within thirty days after presentation. If a passed bill is not vetoed, it becomes law. The budget bill, however, becomes law upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they become law only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election.\n* [[Veto override]]s. A vetoed bill is returned to the house of origin, where a vote may be taken to override the governor's veto; a three-fifths vote of both houses is required to override a veto.\n* Effective date. Each bill that is passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor is assigned a chapter number by the [[Maryland Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. These chaptered bills are [[statute]]s, and ordinarily become part of Maryland law. Ordinarily a law passed during a regular [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]] takes effect October 1 of the same year. Emergency bills [[go into effect]] as soon as the governor signs them; these include acts calling for special elections and emergency measures necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dls.state.md.us/data/libandinfser/libandinfser_docandpub/Legislative-Process.pdf|title=The Legislative Process: How A Bill Becomes Law|date=2012|publisher=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Maryland General Assemblies}}\n* [[Annotated Code of Maryland]]: codification of the statutory laws of Maryland\n* [[List of members of the Maryland State Senate]]\n* [[List of members of the Maryland House of Delegates]]\n* [[Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland#Current membership|Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland]]\n\n==References==\n*Andrews, Matthew Page, ''History of Maryland'', Doubleday, New York (1929)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/ }}\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/mdstateleg/main.htm Washington Post: Metro Report: Maryland Legislature]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070127050747/http://www.md.billhop.com/ Billhop \u2013 Maryland Legislative Wiki]\n*[http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/07leg/html/ga.html Info on General Assembly from Maryland Manual Online]\n*[http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/43const/html/03art3.html Article III of the Maryland Constitution (Legislative Department)]\n*[http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/html/legislative.html ''The Archives of Maryland'' extensive site on Maryland's various Legislative bodies.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAsimov was so prolific that his books span all major categories of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] except for category 100, [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\" /> Although Asimov did write several essays about psychology,<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/Essays/psychology.html |title=Asimov essays about psychology |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=1995 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref> and forewords for the books ''The Humanist Way'' (1988) and ''In Pursuit of Truth'' (1982),<ref name=\"Popper\" /> which were classified in the 100s category, none of his own books were classified in that category.<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\">{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#others11 |title=Did you know that Asimov is the only author to have published books in all ten categories of the Dewey Decimal System? |date=2014 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[UNESCO]]'s ''Index Translationum database'', Asimov is the world's 24th most-translated author.<ref>''[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1L=5&nTyp=min&topN=50 Index Translationum database]''</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994.

Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters.

He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]].

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Joseph Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories).

In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8.

I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model.

The Galactic Empire novels are set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot stories, creating a unified \"[[future history]]\" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAsimov was so prolific that his books span all major categories of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] except for category 100, [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\" /> Although Asimov did write several essays about psychology,<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/Essays/psychology.html |title=Asimov essays about psychology |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=1995 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref> and forewords for the books ''The Humanist Way'' (1988) and ''In Pursuit of Truth'' (1982),<ref name=\"Popper\" /> which were classified in the 100s category, none of his own books were classified in that category.<ref name=\"AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal\">{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#others11 |title=Did you know that Asimov is the only author to have published books in all ten categories of the Dewey Decimal System? |date=2014 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[UNESCO]]'s ''Index Translationum database'', Asimov is the world's 24th most-translated author.<ref>''[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1L=5&nTyp=min&topN=50 Index Translationum database]''</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994.

Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters.

He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]].

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Joseph Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories).

In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8.

I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model.
