It was developed in [[Nazi Germany]] and used extensively by the [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]].\n\nDesigned in 1938 by [[Heinrich Vollmer]] with inspiration from its predecessor the [[MP38|'''MP 38''']], it was heavily used by [[infantry]]men (particularly [[platoon]] and [[squad]] leaders), and by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|paratroopers]], on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|Western]] Fronts. Its advanced and modern features made it a favorite among soldiers and popular in countries from various parts of the world after the war. It was often called \"Schmeisser\" by the Allies, after [[Hugo Schmeisser]] who designed the [[MP 18]], although he was not involved in the design or production of the MP40. The weapon's other variants included '''MP 40/I''' and the '''MP 41'''. From 1940 to 1945, an estimated 1.1 million were produced by [[Erma Werke]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-278-0899-26, Russland, Soldat mit MP 40 im Schnee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Willy Zimmermann]], a highly decorated German [[Unteroffizier]], with an MP 40 on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in 1944|alt=]]\n\nThe ''Maschinenpistole 40'' (\"Machine pistol 40\") descended from its predecessor the MP 38, which was in turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=13}} The MP 36 was developed independently by [[Erma Werke]]'s Berthold Geipel with funding from the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. It took design elements from [[Heinrich Vollmer]]'s VPM 1930 and [[ERMA EMP-35|EMP]]. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=13}}\n\nThe MP 40 was often called the \"Schmeisser\" by the Allies, after the weapon designer [[Hugo Schmeisser]]. Schmeisser had designed the [[MP 18]], which was the first mass-produced submachine gun. He did not, however, have anything to do with the design or development of the MP 40, although he held a patent on the magazine.{{sfn|Rottman|2012|p=9}}\n\n==Design==\nThe MP 40 submachine guns are [[open-bolt]], [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]]-operated [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but the relatively low rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls.{{sfn|Peterson|2011|p=314}} The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide which serves as a pneumatic recoil buffer.{{sfn|Peterson|2011|p=314}} The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=259}} It also served as a safety by pushing the head of the handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=259}} The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop that were used to hold the bolt in the forward position.{{sfn|World Guns}}\n\nThe MP 38 receiver was made of machined steel, but this was a time-consuming and expensive process.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}} To save time and materials, and thus increase production, construction of the MP 40 receiver was simplified by using stamped steel and electro-[[spot welding]] as much as possible.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}} The MP 38 also features longitudinal grooving on the receiver and bolt, as well as a circular opening on the magazine housing. These features were eliminated on the MP 40.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-198-1394-06A, Russland, Soldat mit MP.jpg|thumb|left|A soldier of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] with an MP 38 in 1943|alt=]]\n\nOne unique feature found on most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or [[bakelite]] resting bar or support under the barrel. This was used to steady the weapon when firing over the side of open-top [[armored personnel carrier]]s such as the [[Sd.Kfz. 251]] [[half-track]]. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip.{{sfn|Hobart|1975|pp=95\u201398}} The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned.{{sfn|Hobart|1975|pp=95\u201398}} The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=90}} However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=90}}\n\nAlthough the MP 40 was generally reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert found on the [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson M1921/1928 variants]], the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated by the presence of dirt or other debris.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}} This could cause the weapon to [[Firearm malfunction|malfunction]] when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to move out of the line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}} German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}}\n\n==Usage==\nAt the outbreak of World War II, the majority of German soldiers carried either [[Karabiner 98k]] rifles or MP 40s, both of which were regarded as the standard weapons of choice for an infantryman.{{sfn|Neil|2015|p=65}}\n\nHowever, later confrontations with Soviet troops such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], where entire enemy units were armed with [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns, the Germans found themselves out-gunned in short range urban combat which caused a shift in their tactics, and by the end of the war the MP 40 and its derivatives were being issued to entire assault platoons on a limited basis.{{sfn|Priestley|Cavatore|2014|pp=105\u2013108}} Starting in 1943, the German military moved to replace both the Karabiner 98k rifle and MP 40 with the new, revolutionary [[StG 44]].{{sfn|Priestley|Cavatore|2014|pp=105\u2013108}}{{sfn|Neil|2015|p=65}} By the end of World War II in 1945, an estimated 1.1 million MP 40s had been produced of all variants.{{sfn|Willbanks|2004|p=82}}\n\n===Post-war usage===\nDuring and after the end of World War II, many MP 40s were captured or surrendered (upwards of 200,000) to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and were then redistributed to the paramilitary and irregular forces of some developing countries.{{sfn|Ingram|2001|p=75}} The Norwegian army withdrew the MP 38 from use in 1975 but used the MP 40 for some years more. In particular, the Territorials ([[Home Guard (Norway)|Heimevernet]]) used it until about 1990, when it was replaced by the [[Heckler & Koch MP5]].{{sfn|World Guns}}\n\n==Variants==\n===MP 40/I===\nThe MP 40/I (sometimes erroneously called ''MP 40/II'') was a modified version of the standard MP 40 with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to compensate for the enemies' PPSh-41 larger magazine capacity. However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===MP 41===\n[[File:German MP wooden stock.jpg|thumb|An MP 41 with wooden stock|alt=]]\nIn 1941, Hugo Schmeisser designed the MP 41, which was, in reality, an MP 40 upper receiver with a lower receiver of an [[MP 18|MP 28]] submachine gun. It saw limited service, however, and was issued only to [[SS]] and police units in 1944. The MP 41 was also supplied to Germany's [[Axis Powers|Axis ally]] Romania.{{sfn|Axworthy|1991|p=42}}\n\n===Zastava M56===\n[[File:Brzostrelka M56.jpg|thumb|A Zastava M56|alt=]]\nA clone of the MP40 developed in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after the war, the [[Zastava M56]] differs from the MP40 by the increased barrel length, curved magazine, and [[7.62x25mm Tokarev|cartridge]], which allows for better penetration than the MP40. Like its origin, it was easy and inexpensive to produce.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg91-e.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902000801/http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg91-e.htm |archivedate=2010-09-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:\"Nicole\" a French Partisan Who Captured 25 Nazis in the Chartres Area, in Addition to Liquidating Others, Poses with... - NARA - 5957431 - cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Simone Segouin]], a [[French resistance|French partisan]], posing with an MP 40 in 1944]]\n\nDuring World War II, the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] and the Allies sometimes captured MP 40s to replace or supplement their own weapons.<ref name=\"Sakaida\">{{cite book |page=59 |title=Heroines of the Soviet Union 1941-45 |first=Henry |last=Sakaida |isbn=1841765988 |date=May 20, 2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4XvCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT59 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |editor-last=Hook |editor-first=Christa}}</ref><ref name=Cornish>{{cite book |page=29 |title=Soviet Partisan 1941-45 |first=Nik |last=Cornish |editor-first=Andrei |editor-last=Karachtchouk |date=June 20, 2014 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BmKHCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT29 |isbn=9781472801456}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=200,000 Heroes: Italian Partisans and the American OSS in WWII |first=Leon |last=Weckstein |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjmGZwEACAAJ |publisher=Hellgate Press |pages=233 |isbn=9781555716981}}</ref> The MP 40 was used for several decades following World War II by many countries around the world in armed conflicts.

Neither of the GSG-manufactured variants are compatible with originally manufactured MP 40 parts and magazines.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of common World War II infantry weapons]]\n*[[List of submachine guns]]\n*[[List of World War II firearms of Germany]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notes\n| refs =30em\n{{efn\n| name = Israel\n| Used in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] and afterwards by [[Unit 101]] until replaced by the [[Uzi]].{{sfn|Katz|1988|p=9}}\n}}\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Axworthy\n | first = Mark\n | title = The Romanian Army of World War II\n | publisher = Osprey Publishing\n | year = 1991\n | isbn = 978-1855321694\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Bishop\n | first = Chris\n | title = The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II\n | publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.\n | year = 2002\n | isbn = 978-1586637620\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Dunlap\n | first = Roy\n | title = Ordnance Went Up Front\n | publisher = R & R Books\n | year = 1966\n | isbn = 978-1884849091\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Fowler\n | first = William\n | title = Stalingrad, the Vital Seven Days\n | publisher = Spellmount\n | year = 2005\n | isbn = 978-1862272781\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Hobart\n | first = Frank\n | title = Pictorial History of the Sub-machine Gun\n | publisher = Scribner Publishing\n | year = 1975\n | isbn = 978-0684141862\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | editor1-last = Hogg\n | editor1-first = Ian\n|editor1-link=Ian V.

(''Maschinenpistole 40'') is a [[submachine gun]] chambered for the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge. It was developed in [[Nazi Germany]] and used extensively by the [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]].\n\nDesigned in 1938 by [[Heinrich Vollmer]] with inspiration from its predecessor the '''MP 38''', it was heavily used by [[infantry]]men (particularly [[platoon]] and [[squad]] leaders), and by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|paratroopers]], on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|Western]] Fronts. Its advanced and modern features made it a favorite among soldiers and popular in countries from various parts of the world after the war. It was often called \"Schmeisser\" by the Allies, after [[Hugo Schmeisser]] who designed the [[MP 18]], although he was not involved in the design or production of the MP40. The weapon's other variants included '''MP 40/I''' and the '''MP 41'''. From 1940 to 1945, an estimated 1.1 million were produced by [[Erma Werke]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-278-0899-26, Russland, Soldat mit MP 40 im Schnee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Willy Zimmermann]], a highly decorated German [[Unteroffizier]], with an MP 40 on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in 1944|alt=]]\n\nThe ''Maschinenpistole 40'' (\"Machine pistol 40\") descended from its predecessor the MP 38, which was in turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=13}} The MP 36 was developed independently by [[Erma Werke]]'s Berthold Geipel with funding from the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. It took design elements from [[Heinrich Vollmer]]'s VPM 1930 and [[ERMA EMP-35|EMP]]. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=13}}\n\nThe MP 40 was often called the \"Schmeisser\" by the Allies, after the weapon designer [[Hugo Schmeisser]]. Schmeisser had designed the [[MP 18]], which was the first mass-produced submachine gun. He did not, however, have anything to do with the design or development of the MP 40, although he held a patent on the magazine.{{sfn|Rottman|2012|p=9}}\n\n==Design==\nThe MP 40 submachine guns are [[open-bolt]], [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]]-operated [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but the relatively low rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls.{{sfn|Peterson|2011|p=314}} The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide which serves as a pneumatic recoil buffer.{{sfn|Peterson|2011|p=314}} The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=259}} It also served as a safety by pushing the head of the handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=259}} The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop that were used to hold the bolt in the forward position.{{sfn|World Guns}}\n\nThe MP 38 receiver was made of machined steel, but this was a time-consuming and expensive process.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}} To save time and materials, and thus increase production, construction of the MP 40 receiver was simplified by using stamped steel and electro-[[spot welding]] as much as possible.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}} The MP 38 also features longitudinal grooving on the receiver and bolt, as well as a circular opening on the magazine housing. These features were eliminated on the MP 40.{{sfn|de Quesada|2014|p=17}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-198-1394-06A, Russland, Soldat mit MP.jpg|thumb|left|A soldier of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] with an MP 38 in 1943|alt=]]\n\nOne unique feature found on most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or [[bakelite]] resting bar or support under the barrel. This was used to steady the weapon when firing over the side of open-top [[armored personnel carrier]]s such as the [[Sd.Kfz. 251]] [[half-track]]. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip.{{sfn|Hobart|1975|pp=95\u201398}} The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned.{{sfn|Hobart|1975|pp=95\u201398}} The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=90}} However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=90}}\n\nAlthough the MP 40 was generally reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert found on the [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson M1921/1928 variants]], the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated by the presence of dirt or other debris.{{sfn|Hogg|Weeks|1977|p=33}} Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}} This could cause the weapon to [[Firearm malfunction|malfunction]] when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to move out of the line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}} German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.{{sfn|Dunlap|1966|pp=80\u201381}}\n\n==Usage==\nAt the outbreak of World War II, the majority of German soldiers carried either [[Karabiner 98k]] rifles or MP 40s, both of which were regarded as the standard weapons of choice for an infantryman.{{sfn|Neil|2015|p=65}}\n\nHowever, later confrontations with Soviet troops such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], where entire enemy units were armed with [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns, the Germans found themselves out-gunned in short range urban combat which caused a shift in their tactics, and by the end of the war the MP 40 and its derivatives were being issued to entire assault platoons on a limited basis.{{sfn|Priestley|Cavatore|2014|pp=105\u2013108}} Starting in 1943, the German military moved to replace both the Karabiner 98k rifle and MP 40 with the new, revolutionary [[StG 44]].{{sfn|Priestley|Cavatore|2014|pp=105\u2013108}}{{sfn|Neil|2015|p=65}} By the end of World War II in 1945, an estimated 1.1 million MP 40s had been produced of all variants.{{sfn|Willbanks|2004|p=82}}\n\n===Post-war usage===\nDuring and after the end of World War II, many MP 40s were captured or surrendered (upwards of 200,000) to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and were then redistributed to the paramilitary and irregular forces of some developing countries.{{sfn|Ingram|2001|p=75}} The Norwegian army withdrew the MP 38 from use in 1975 but used the MP 40 for some years more. In particular, the Territorials ([[Home Guard (Norway)|Heimevernet]]) used it until about 1990, when it was replaced by the [[Heckler & Koch MP5]].{{sfn|World Guns}}\n\n==Variants==\n===MP 40/I===\nThe MP 40/I (sometimes erroneously called ''MP 40/II'') was a modified version of the standard MP 40 with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to compensate for the enemies' PPSh-41 larger magazine capacity. However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===MP 41===\n[[File:German MP wooden stock.jpg|thumb|An MP 41 with wooden stock|alt=]]\nIn 1941, Hugo Schmeisser designed the MP 41, which was, in reality, an MP 40 upper receiver with a lower receiver of an [[MP 18|MP 28]] submachine gun. It saw limited service, however, and was issued only to [[SS]] and police units in 1944. The MP 41 was also supplied to Germany's [[Axis Powers|Axis ally]] Romania.{{sfn|Axworthy|1991|p=42}}\n\n===Zastava M56===\n[[File:Brzostrelka M56.jpg|thumb|A Zastava M56|alt=]]\nA clone of the MP40 developed in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after the war, the [[Zastava M56]] differs from the MP40 by the increased barrel length, curved magazine, and [[7.62x25mm Tokarev|cartridge]], which allows for better penetration than the MP40.

It was released on the Polyvinyl website and in stores on February 7, 2012. The band has released the album in several formats, including: [[Music download]], [[Compact cisc|CD]], [[Cassette tape|cassette]], [[Vinyl Records|vinyl]], and a special-edition \"Fuchsia Purple\" vinyl, which is limited to 1,500 copies. Later pressings of the vinyl were offered in yellow as well as black vinyl. All physical versions of the album feature free digital downloads. To support the release of the album, of Montreal toured America in early 2012.\n\n==Sound and style==\nThe recording of the album is dense, featuring dark tones and an indiscriminate eclectic nature both electronically and aesthetically. The album features a wide array of music, ranging from [[Country music|\"pseudo-country\"]] and, to a larger degree, [[Progressive rock|neo-prog]] often switching and mixing music styles multiple times through the course of a song.\nMost of the recording was done with a [[Synclavier]] 9600 workstation. Kevin Barnes's lyricism also returns to the confessional style heard in ''[[Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?]]'', entailing dark topics such as revenge, self-hatred, the human condition, and his painful relationship with his wife Nina. It has been called his most personal recording to date.<ref>[http://www.polyvinylrecords.com/store/index.php?id=2004 Polyvinyl Record Co. - of Montreal - Paralytic Stalks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nThe album was recorded in Barnes' personal studio and was mixed at Chase Park Transduction with engineer Drew Vandenberg, who has mixed albums by [[Toro y Moi]], [[Futurebirds]], and [[Kishi Bashi]]. Kevin is the producer, songwriter, and co-engineer for the album. The album features a crew of hired [[Session Musician|session musicians]] for the first time in of Montreal's history and features horn and flute player Zac Colwell as a new addition to the band's line-up.<ref>[https://www.spin.com/2011/12/montreal-taking-paralytic-stalks-ambitious-2012-tour/ Of Montreal Taking 'Paralytic Stalks' on Ambitious 2012 Tour | SPIN | Newswire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nWhile Kevin Barnes is known to take primary creative control of his recordings, K.

It was released on the Polyvinyl website and in stores on February 7, 2012. The band has released the album in several formats, including: [[Digital Music|Digital]], [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[Cassette Tape|Cassette]], [[Vinyl Records|Vinyl]], and a special-edition \"Fuchsia Purple\" vinyl, which is limited to 1,500 copies. Later pressings of the vinyl were offered in yellow as well as black vinyl. All physical versions of the album feature free digital downloads. To support the release of the album, of Montreal toured America in early 2012.\n\n==Sound and style==\nThe recording of the album is dense, featuring dark tones and an indiscriminate eclectic nature both electronically and aesthetically. The album features a wide array of music, ranging from [[Country music|\"pseudo-country\"]] and, to a larger degree, [[Progressive rock|neo-prog]] often switching and mixing music styles multiple times through the course of a song.\nMost of the recording was done with a [[Synclavier]] 9600 workstation. Kevin Barnes's lyricism also returns to the confessional style heard in ''[[Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?]]'', entailing dark topics such as revenge, self-hatred, the human condition, and his painful relationship with his wife Nina. It has been called his most personal recording to date.<ref>[http://www.polyvinylrecords.com/store/index.php?id=2004 Polyvinyl Record Co. - of Montreal - Paralytic Stalks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nThe album was recorded in Barnes' personal studio and was mixed at Chase Park Transduction with engineer Drew Vandenberg, who has mixed albums by [[Toro y Moi]], [[Futurebirds]], and [[Kishi Bashi]]. Kevin is the producer, songwriter, and co-engineer for the album. The album features a crew of hired [[Session Musician|session musicians]] for the first time in of Montreal's history and features horn and flute player Zac Colwell as a new addition to the band's line-up.<ref>[https://www.spin.com/2011/12/montreal-taking-paralytic-stalks-ambitious-2012-tour/ Of Montreal Taking 'Paralytic Stalks' on Ambitious 2012 Tour | SPIN | Newswire<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nWhile Kevin Barnes is known to take primary creative control of his recordings, K.

The Greek Orthodox Christian legacy bestowed on Greek Cypriots in this period would live on during the succeeding centuries of foreign domination. Because Cyprus was never the final goal of any external ambition, but simply fell under the domination of whichever power was dominant in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], destroying its civilization was never a military objective or necessity.\n\nThe Cypriots did however endure the oppressive rule of first the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]] and then the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] from the 1190s through to 1570. King [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amaury]], who succeeded his brother [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy de Lusignan]] in 1194, was particularly intolerant of the Orthodox Church. Greek Cypriot land was appropriated for the Latin churches after they were established in the major towns on the island. In addition, tax collection was also part of the heavy oppressive attitude of the occupiers to the locals of the island, in that it was now being conducted by the Latin churches themselves.\n\n===Early modern period===\n{{see also|Ottoman Cyprus}}\n[[File:Cyprus 19th cent costumes.png|thumb|Traditional costumes of (from right to left) a Christian resident of Magossa ([[Famagusta]]), a Christian woman of Magossa, and a Greek monk of the Monastery of Tchiko, near Lefke ([[Lefka]]).]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of Cyprus in 1571 replaced Venetian rule.

The Ottomans tended to administer their multicultural empire with the help of their subject ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]'', or religious communities. The ''millet'' system allowed the Greek Cypriot community to survive,{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} administered on behalf of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]] by the [[List of archbishops of Cyprus|Archbishop]] of the Church of Cyprus. Although religiously tolerant, Ottoman rule was generally harsh and inefficient. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch]] serving the Ottoman [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] acted as ''[[ethnarch]]'', or leader of the Greek nation, and gained secular powers as a result of the gradual dysfunction of Ottoman rule, for instance in adjudicating justice and in the collection of taxes.[[Turkish people|Turkish]] settlers suffered alongside their Greek Cypriot neighbors, and the two groups together endured centuries of oppressive governance from [[Constantinople]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} A minority of Greek Cypriots converted to [[Islam in Cyprus|Islam]] during this period, and are sometimes referred to as \"neo-Muslims\" by historians.<ref>Peter Alford Andrews, ''Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey'', Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, 1989, {{ISBN|3-89500-297-6}}</ref><ref>Savile, Albany Robert, ''Cyprus'', 1878, p.&nbsp;130</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\nPolitically, the concept of ''[[enosis]]'' \u2013 unification with the Greek \"motherland\" \u2013 became important to literate Greek Cypriots after [[Greece]] declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821.

For example, the education system was organized with two Boards of Education, one Greek and one Turkish, controlled by [[Athens]] and [[Istanbul]], respectively. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The resulting education emphasized linguistic, religious, cultural, and ethnic differences and ignored traditional ties between the two Cypriot communities. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The two groups were encouraged to view themselves as extensions of their respective motherlands, and the development of two distinct nationalities with antagonistic loyalties was ensured.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Xypolia |first=Ilia |title=Cypriot Muslims among Ottomans, Turks and Two World Wars |journal=Bogazici Journal |year=2011 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=109\u2013120 |doi=10.21773/boun.25.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nThe importance of religion within the Greek Cypriot community was reinforced when the Archbishop of the Church of Cyprus, [[Makarios&nbsp;III]], was elected the first president of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960.  For the next decade and a half, ''enosis'' was a key issue for Greek Cypriots, and a key cause of events leading up to 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern part of the island. The island remains divided today, with the two communities almost completely separated. Many Greek Cypriots, most of whom lost their homes, lands and possessions during the Turkish invasion, emigrated mainly to the UK, USA, Australia, South Africa and Europe. There are today estimated to be 335,000 [[Greek Cypriot diaspora|Greek Cypriot emigrants]] living in Great Britain. The majority of the Greek Cypriots in [[Great Britain]] currently live in [[England]]; there is an estimate of around 3,000 in [[Wales]] and 1,000 in [[Scotland]].\nBy the early 1990s, Greek Cypriot society enjoyed a high standard of living. Economic modernization created a more flexible and open society and caused Greek Cypriots to share the concerns and hopes of other secularized West European societies. The Republic of Cyprus joined the [[European Union]] in 2004, officially representing the entire island, but suspended for the time being in the Turkish occupied north.\n\n==Population==\n{{see also|Demographics of Cyprus}}\n [[Image:Cyprus 1973 ethnic neutral.svg|thumb|180px|Ethnic distribution in 1973.

The Greek Orthodox Christian legacy bestowed on Greek Cypriots in this period would live on during the succeeding centuries of foreign domination. Because Cyprus was never the final goal of any external ambition, but simply fell under the domination of whichever power was dominant in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], destroying its civilization was never a military objective or necessity.\n\nThe Cypriots did however endure the oppressive rule of first the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]] and then the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] from the 1190s through to 1570. King [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amaury]], who succeeded his brother [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy de Lusignan]] in 1194, was particularly intolerant of the Orthodox Church. Greek Cypriot land was appropriated for the Latin churches after they were established in the major towns on the island. In addition, tax collection was also part of the heavy oppressive attitude of the occupiers to the locals of the island, in that it was now being conducted by the Latin churches themselves.\n\n===Early modern period===\n{{see also|Ottoman Cyprus}}\n[[File:Cyprus 19th cent costumes.png|thumb|Traditional costumes of (from right to left) a Christian resident of Magossa ([[Famagusta]]), a Christian woman of Magossa, and a Greek monk of the Monastery of Tchiko, near Lefke ([[Lefka]]).]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of Cyprus in 1571 replaced Venetian rule.

The Ottomans tended to administer their multicultural empire with the help of their subject ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]'', or religious communities. The ''millet'' system allowed the Greek Cypriot community to survive, administered on behalf of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]] by the [[List of archbishops of Cyprus|Archbishop]] of the Church of Cyprus.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Although religiously tolerant, Ottoman rule was generally harsh and inefficient. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch]] serving the Ottoman [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] acted as ''[[ethnarch]]'', or leader of the Greek nation, and gained secular powers as a result of the gradual dysfunction of Ottoman rule, for instance in adjudicating justice and in the collection of taxes.[[Turkish people|Turkish]] settlers suffered alongside their Greek Cypriot neighbors, and the two groups together endured centuries of oppressive governance from [[Constantinople]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} A minority of Greek Cypriots converted to [[Islam in Cyprus|Islam]] during this period, and are sometimes referred to as \"neo-Muslims\" by historians.<ref>Peter Alford Andrews, ''Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey'', Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, 1989, {{ISBN|3-89500-297-6}}</ref><ref>Savile, Albany Robert, ''Cyprus'', 1878, p.&nbsp;130</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\nPolitically, the concept of ''[[enosis]]'' \u2013 unification with the Greek \"motherland\" \u2013 became important to literate Greek Cypriots after [[Greece]] declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821.

For the next decade and a half, ''enosis'' was a key issue for Greek Cypriots, and a key cause of events leading up to 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern part of the island. The island remains divided today, with the two communities almost completely separated. Many Greek Cypriots, most of whom lost their homes, lands and possessions during the Turkish invasion, emigrated mainly to the UK, USA, Australia, South Africa and Europe. There are today estimated to be 335,000 [[Greek Cypriot diaspora|Greek Cypriot emigrants]] living in Great Britain. The majority of the Greek Cypriots in [[Great Britain]] currently live in [[England]]; there is an estimate of around 3,000 in [[Wales]] and 1,000 in [[Scotland]].\nBy the early 1990s, Greek Cypriot society enjoyed a high standard of living. Economic modernization created a more flexible and open society and caused Greek Cypriots to share the concerns and hopes of other secularized West European societies. The Republic of Cyprus joined the [[European Union]] in 2004, officially representing the entire island, but suspended for the time being in the Turkish occupied north.\n\n==Population==\n{{see also|Demographics of Cyprus}}\n [[Image:Cyprus 1973 ethnic neutral.svg|thumb|180px|Ethnic distribution in 1973.

CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary [[Computer hardware|hardware]], easy to analyze mathematically, and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] in transmission channels.  Because the check value has a fixed length, the function that generates it is occasionally used as a [[hash function]].\n\nThe CRC was invented by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] in 1961; the 32-bit CRC function, used in Ethernet and many other standards, is the work of several researchers and was published in 1975.\n\n== Introduction ==\nCRCs are based on the theory of [[cyclic code|cyclic]] [[error-correcting code]]s. The use of [[systematic code|systematic]] cyclic codes, which encode messages by adding a fixed-length check value, for the purpose of error detection in communication networks, was first proposed by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] in 1961.<ref name=\"PetersonBrown1961\">{{Cite journal\n|last = Peterson |first=W. W. |last2 =Brown |first2=D.

This is important because burst errors are common transmission errors in many [[communication channel]]s, including magnetic and optical storage devices. Typically an ''n''-bit CRC applied to a data block of arbitrary length will detect any single error burst not longer than ''n'' bits, and the fraction of all longer error bursts that it will detect is {{nowrap|(1 \u2212 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>)}}.\n\nSpecification of a CRC code requires definition of a so-called [[generator polynomial]]. This polynomial becomes the [[divisor]] in a [[polynomial long division]], which takes the message as the [[division (mathematics)|dividend]] and in which the [[quotient]] is discarded and the [[remainder]] becomes the result.  The important caveat is that the polynomial [[coefficient]]s are calculated according to the arithmetic of a [[finite field]], so the addition operation can always be performed bitwise-parallel (there is no carry between digits).\n\nIn practice, all commonly used CRCs employ the [[Galois field]] of two elements, [[GF(2)]]. The two elements are usually called 0 and 1, comfortably matching computer architecture.\n\nA CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n'' bits long. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', which means it has {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms. In other words, the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}; its encoding requires {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} bits. Note that most polynomial specifications either drop the [[Most significant bit|MSB]] or [[Least significant bit|LSB]], since they are always 1. The CRC and associated polynomial typically have a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX as in the [[#table|table]] below.\n\nThe simplest error-detection system, the [[parity bit]], is in fact a 1-bit CRC: it uses the generator polynomial&nbsp;{{nowrap|''x'' + 1}} (two terms), and has the name CRC-1.\n\n== Application ==\nA CRC-enabled device calculates a short, fixed-length binary sequence, known as the ''check value'' or ''CRC'', for each block of data to be sent or stored and appends it to the data, forming a ''codeword''.\n\nWhen a codeword is received or read, the device either compares its check value with one freshly calculated from the data block, or equivalently, performs a CRC on the whole codeword and compares the resulting check value with an expected ''residue'' constant.\n\nIf the CRC values do not match, then the block contains a data error.\n\nThe device may take corrective action, such as rereading the block or requesting that it be sent again. Otherwise, the data is assumed to be error-free (though, with some small probability, it may contain undetected errors; this is inherent in the nature of error-checking).<ref name=\"ritter-1986\">{{Cite journal|first=Terry|last=Ritter|title=The Great CRC Mystery|url=http://www.ciphersbyritter.com/ARTS/CRCMYST.HTM|accessdate=21 May 2009|journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]|date=February 1986|volume=11|issue=2|pages=26\u201334, 76\u201383}}</ref>\n\n== Data integrity ==\nCRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels, where they can provide quick and reasonable assurance of the [[data integrity|integrity]] of messages delivered. However, they are not suitable for protecting against intentional alteration of data.\n\nFirstly, as there is no authentication, an attacker can edit a message and recompute the CRC without the substitution being detected. When stored alongside the data, CRCs and cryptographic hash functions by themselves do not protect against ''intentional'' modification of data. Any application that requires protection against such attacks must use cryptographic authentication mechanisms, such as [[message authentication code]]s or [[digital signatures]] (which are commonly based on [[cryptographic hash]] functions).\n\nSecondly, unlike cryptographic hash functions, CRC is an easily reversible function, which makes it unsuitable for use in digital signatures.<ref name=\"stigge-reversecrc\">{{Cite journal|last=Stigge|first=Martin|last2=Pl\u00f6tz|first2=Henryk|last3=M\u00fcller|first3=Wolf|last4=Redlich|first4=Jens-Peter|title=Reversing CRC \u2013 Theory and Practice|date=May 2006|page=17|location=Berlin|publisher=Humboldt University Berlin|url=http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2011|quote=The presented methods offer a very easy and efficient way to modify your data so that it will compute to a CRC you want or at least know in advance.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042902/http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThirdly, CRC is a [[linear function]] with a property that<ref>{{cite web |title=algorithm design - Why is CRC said to be linear? |url=https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/34013 |website=Cryptography Stack Exchange |accessdate=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{crc}(x \\oplus y \\oplus z) = \\operatorname{crc}(x) \\oplus \\operatorname{crc}(y) \\oplus \\operatorname{crc}(z);</math>\n\nas a result, even if the CRC is encrypted with a [[stream cipher]] that uses [[Exclusive or|XOR]] as its combining operation (or [[Block cipher modes of operation|mode]] of [[block cipher]] which effectively turns it into a stream cipher, such as OFB or CFB), both the message and the associated CRC can be manipulated without knowledge of the encryption key; this was one of the well-known design flaws of the [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) protocol.<ref name=\"wep\">{{Cite journal| last1=Cam-Winget | first1=Nancy | last2=Housley | first2=Russ | last3=Wagner | first3=David | last4=Walker | first4=Jesse | title=Security Flaws in 802.11 Data Link Protocols | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=35\u201339 |date = May 2003| doi=10.1145/769800.769823 | url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/wireless-cacm.pdf | citeseerx=10.1.1.14.8775 }}</ref>\n\n== CRC-32 algorithm ==\nThis is the algorithm for the CRC-32 variant of CRC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd905031.aspx|title=[MS-ABS]: 32-Bit CRC Algorithm|author=|date=|website=msdn.microsoft.com}}</ref> The CRCTable is a [[memoization]] of a calculation that would have to be repeated for each byte of the message.\n\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Function'''</span> CRC32\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Input:'''</span>\n       data:  Bytes     <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Array of bytes'''</span>\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Output:'''</span>\n       crc32: UInt32    <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//32-bit unsigned crc-32 value'''</span><br>\n <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Initialize crc-32 to starting value'''</span>\n crc32 &larr; 0xFFFFFFFF<br>\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''for each'''</span> byte <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''in'''</span> data <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''do'''</span>\n    nLookupIndex &larr; (crc32 xor byte) and 0xFF;\n    crc32 &larr; (crc32 shr 8) xor CRCTable[nLookupIndex] <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//CRCTable is anf array of 256 32-bit constants'''</span><br>\n <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Finalize the CRC-32 value by inverting all the bits'''</span>\n crc32 &larr; crc32 xor 0xFFFFFFFF\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''return'''</span> crc32\n\n== Computation ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n{{Main|Computation of cyclic redundancy checks}}\n\nTo compute an ''n''-bit binary CRC, line the bits representing the input in a row, and position the ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit pattern representing the CRC's divisor (called a \"[[polynomial]]\") underneath the left-hand end of the row.\n\nIn this example, we shall encode 14 bits of message with a 3-bit CRC, with a polynomial {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x'' + 1}}. The polynomial is written in binary as the coefficients; a 3rd-degree polynomial has 4 coefficients ({{nowrap|1''x''<sup>3</sup> + 0''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1''x'' + 1}}). In this case, the coefficients are 1, 0, 1 and 1.  The result of the calculation is 3 bits long.\n\nStart with the message to be encoded:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100\n</pre>\n\nThis is first padded with zeros corresponding to the bit length ''n'' of the CRC. This is done so that the resulting code word is in [[systematic code|systematic]] form. Here is the first calculation for computing a 3-bit CRC:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 000 <--- input right padded by 3 bits\n1011               <--- divisor (4 bits) = x\u00b3 + x + 1\n------------------\n01100011101100 000 <--- result\n</pre>\n\nThe algorithm acts on the bits directly above the divisor in each step.  The result for that iteration is the bitwise XOR of the polynomial divisor with the bits above it.  The bits not above the divisor are simply copied directly below for that step.  The divisor is then shifted one bit to the right, and the process is repeated until the divisor reaches the right-hand end of the input row. Here is the entire calculation:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 000 <--- input right padded by 3 bits\n1011               <--- divisor\n01100011101100 000 <--- result (note the first four bits are the XOR with the divisor beneath, the rest of the bits are unchanged)\n 1011              <--- divisor ...\n00111011101100 000\n  1011\n00010111101100 000\n   1011\n00000001101100 000 <--- note that the divisor moves over to align with the next 1 in the dividend (since quotient for that step was zero)\n       1011             (in other words, it doesn't necessarily move one bit per iteration)\n00000000110100 000\n        1011\n00000000011000 000\n         1011\n00000000001110 000\n          1011\n00000000000101 000\n           101 1\n-----------------\n00000000000000 100 <--- remainder (3 bits).

These ''n'' bits are the remainder of the division step, and will also be the value of the CRC function (unless the chosen CRC specification calls for some postprocessing).\n\nThe validity of a received message can easily be verified by performing the above calculation again, this time with the check value added instead of zeroes. The remainder should equal zero if there are no detectable errors.\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 100 <--- input with check value\n1011               <--- divisor\n01100011101100 100 <--- result\n 1011              <--- divisor ...\n00111011101100 100\n\n......\n\n00000000001110 100\n          1011\n00000000000101 100\n           101 1\n------------------\n00000000000000 000 <--- remainder\n</pre>\n\nThe following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code outlines a function which will return the initial CRC remainder for a chosen input and polynomial, with either 1 or 0 as the initial padding.

In this analysis, the digits of the bit strings are taken as the coefficients of a polynomial in some variable ''x''\u2014coefficients that are elements of the finite field [[GF(2)]], instead of more familiar numbers. The set of binary polynomials is a mathematical [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\n=== Designing polynomials ===\nThe selection of the generator polynomial is the most important part of implementing the CRC algorithm. The polynomial must be chosen to maximize the error-detecting capabilities while minimizing overall collision probabilities.\n\nThe most important attribute of the polynomial is its length (largest degree(exponent) +1 of any one term in the polynomial), because of its direct influence on the length of the computed check value.\n\nThe most commonly used polynomial lengths are:\n*9 bits (CRC-8)\n*17 bits (CRC-16)\n*33 bits (CRC-32)\n*65 bits (CRC-64)\n\nA CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n''-bits. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', and hence {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms (the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}). The remainder has length ''n''. The CRC has a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX.\n\nThe design of the CRC polynomial depends on the maximum total length of the block to be protected (data + CRC bits), the desired error protection features, and the type of resources for implementing the CRC, as well as the desired performance. A common misconception is that the \"best\" CRC polynomials are derived from either [[irreducible polynomial]]s or irreducible polynomials times the factor&nbsp;{{nowrap|1 + ''x''}}, which adds to the code the ability to detect all errors affecting an odd number of bits.<ref name=\"williams93\" /> In reality, all the factors described above should enter into the selection of the polynomial and may lead to a reducible polynomial. However, choosing a reducible polynomial will result in a certain proportion of missed errors, due to the quotient ring having [[zero divisor]]s.\n\nThe advantage of choosing a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] as the generator for a CRC code is that the resulting code has maximal total block length in the sense that all 1-bit errors within that block length have different remainders (also called [[Syndrome decoding|syndromes]]) and therefore, since the remainder is a linear function of the block, the code can detect all 2-bit errors within that block length. If <math>r</math> is the degree of the primitive generator polynomial, then the maximal total block length is <math>2 ^ {r} - 1 </math>, and the associated code is able to detect any single-bit or double-bit errors.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Press | first1=WH | last2=Teukolsky | first2=SA | last3=Vetterling | first3=WT | last4=Flannery | first4=BP | year=2007 | title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press |  location=New York | isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 | chapter=Section 22.4 Cyclic Redundancy and Other Checksums | chapter-url=http://apps.nrbook.com/empanel/index.html#pg=1168}}</ref> We can improve this situation. If we use the generator polynomial <math>g(x) = p(x)(1 + x)</math>, where <math>p(x)</math> is a primitive polynomial of degree <math>r - 1</math>, then the maximal total block length is <math>2^{r - 1} - 1</math>, and the code is able to detect single, double, triple and any odd number of errors.\n\nA polynomial <math>g(x)</math> that admits other factorizations may be chosen then so as to balance the maximal total blocklength with a desired error detection power. The [[BCH code]]s are a powerful class of such polynomials. They subsume the two examples above. Regardless of the reducibility properties of a generator polynomial of degree&nbsp;''r'', if it includes the \"+1\" term, the code will be able to detect error patterns that are confined to a window of ''r'' contiguous bits. These patterns are called \"error bursts\".\n\n== Specification ==\nThe concept of the CRC as an error-detecting code gets complicated when an implementer or standards committee uses it to design a practical system. Here are some of the complications:\n*Sometimes an implementation '''prefixes a fixed bit pattern''' to the bitstream to be checked. This is useful when clocking errors might insert 0-bits in front of a message, an alteration that would otherwise leave the check value unchanged.\n*Usually, but not always, an implementation '''appends ''n'' 0-bits''' (''n'' being the size of the CRC) to the bitstream to be checked before the polynomial division occurs. Such appending is explicitly demonstrated in the [[Computation of cyclic redundancy checks|Computation of CRC]] article. This has the convenience that the remainder of the original bitstream with the check value appended is exactly zero, so the CRC can be checked simply by performing the polynomial division on the received bitstream and comparing the remainder with zero. Due to the associative and commutative properties of the exclusive-or operation, practical table driven implementations can obtain a result numerically equivalent to zero-appending without explicitly appending any zeroes, by using an equivalent,<ref name=\"williams93\" /> faster algorithm that combines the message bitstream with the stream being shifted out of the CRC register.\n*Sometimes an implementation '''exclusive-ORs a fixed bit pattern''' into the remainder of the polynomial division.\n*'''Bit order:''' Some schemes view the low-order bit of each byte as \"first\", which then during polynomial division means \"leftmost\", which is contrary to our customary understanding of \"low-order\". This convention makes sense when [[serial port|serial-port]] transmissions are CRC-checked in hardware, because some widespread serial-port transmission conventions transmit bytes least-significant bit first.\n*'''[[Byte order]]''': With multi-byte CRCs, there can be confusion over whether the byte transmitted first (or stored in the lowest-addressed byte of memory) is the least-significant byte (LSB) or the most-significant byte (MSB). For example, some 16-bit CRC schemes swap the bytes of the check value.\n*'''Omission of the high-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the high-order bit is always 1, and since an ''n''-bit CRC must be defined by an ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit divisor which [[Arithmetic overflow|overflows]] an ''n''-bit [[processor register|register]], some writers assume that it is unnecessary to mention the divisor's high-order bit.\n*'''Omission of the low-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the low-order bit is always 1, authors such as Philip Koopman represent polynomials with their high-order bit intact, but without the low-order bit (the <math>x^0</math> or 1 term).  This convention encodes the polynomial complete with its degree in one integer.\n\nThese complications mean that there are three common ways to express a polynomial as an integer: the first two, which are mirror images in binary, are the constants found in code; the third is the number found in Koopman's papers.  ''In each case, one term is omitted.'' So the polynomial <math>x^4 + x + 1</math> may be transcribed as:\n*0x3 = 0b0011, representing <math>x^4 + (0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1 + 1x^0)</math> (MSB-first code)\n*0xC = 0b1100, representing <math>(1x^0 + 1x^1 + 0x^2 + 0x^3) + x^4</math> (LSB-first code)\n*0x9 = 0b1001, representing <math>(1x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1) + x^0</math> (Koopman notation)\nIn the table below they are shown as:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples of CRC representations\n|-\n!

correction|error-detecting code]] commonly used in digital [[Telecommunications network|networks]] and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data.  Blocks of data entering these systems get a short ''check value'' attached, based on the remainder of a [[Polynomial long division|polynomial division]] of their contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data corruption. CRCs can be used for [[Error correcting code|error correction]] (see [[Mathematics of cyclic redundancy checks#Bitfilters|bitfilters]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/an-algorithm-for-error-correcting-cyclic/184401662|title=An Algorithm for Error Correcting Cyclic Redundance Checks|website=drdobbs.com|access-date=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720165847/http://www.drdobbs.com/an-algorithm-for-error-correcting-cyclic/184401662|archive-date=20 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCRCs are so called because the ''check'' (data verification) value is a ''redundancy'' (it expands the message without adding [[Entropy (information theory)|information]]) and the [[algorithm]] is based on [[Cyclic code|''cyclic'' codes]]. CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary [[Computer hardware|hardware]], easy to analyze mathematically, and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] in transmission channels.  Because the check value has a fixed length, the function that generates it is occasionally used as a [[hash function]].\n\nThe CRC was invented by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] in 1961; the 32-bit CRC function, used in Ethernet and many other standards, is the work of several researchers and was published in 1975.\n\n== Introduction ==\nCRCs are based on the theory of [[cyclic code|cyclic]] [[error-correcting code]]s. The use of [[systematic code|systematic]] cyclic codes, which encode messages by adding a fixed-length check value, for the purpose of error detection in communication networks, was first proposed by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] in 1961.<ref name=\"PetersonBrown1961\">{{Cite journal\n|last = Peterson |first=W. W. |last2 =Brown |first2=D. T.\n|date=January 1961\n| title = Cyclic Codes for Error Detection\n| journal = Proceedings of the IRE\n| doi = 10.1109/JRPROC.1961.287814\n| volume = 49\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 228\u2013235\n}}</ref>\nCyclic codes are not only simple to implement but have the benefit of being particularly well suited for the detection of [[burst error]]s: contiguous sequences of erroneous data symbols in messages. This is important because burst errors are common transmission errors in many [[communication channel]]s, including magnetic and optical storage devices. Typically an ''n''-bit CRC applied to a data block of arbitrary length will detect any single error burst not longer than ''n'' bits, and the fraction of all longer error bursts that it will detect is {{nowrap|(1 \u2212 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>)}}.\n\nSpecification of a CRC code requires definition of a so-called [[generator polynomial]]. This polynomial becomes the [[divisor]] in a [[polynomial long division]], which takes the message as the [[division (mathematics)|dividend]] and in which the [[quotient]] is discarded and the [[remainder]] becomes the result.  The important caveat is that the polynomial [[coefficient]]s are calculated according to the arithmetic of a [[finite field]], so the addition operation can always be performed bitwise-parallel (there is no carry between digits).\n\nIn practice, all commonly used CRCs employ the [[Galois field]] of two elements, [[GF(2)]]. The two elements are usually called 0 and 1, comfortably matching computer architecture.\n\nA CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n'' bits long. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', which means it has {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms. In other words, the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}; its encoding requires {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} bits. Note that most polynomial specifications either drop the [[Most significant bit|MSB]] or [[Least significant bit|LSB]], since they are always 1. The CRC and associated polynomial typically have a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX as in the [[#table|table]] below.\n\nThe simplest error-detection system, the [[parity bit]], is in fact a 1-bit CRC: it uses the generator polynomial&nbsp;{{nowrap|''x'' + 1}} (two terms), and has the name CRC-1.\n\n== Application ==\nA CRC-enabled device calculates a short, fixed-length binary sequence, known as the ''check value'' or ''CRC'', for each block of data to be sent or stored and appends it to the data, forming a ''codeword''.\n\nWhen a codeword is received or read, the device either compares its check value with one freshly calculated from the data block, or equivalently, performs a CRC on the whole codeword and compares the resulting check value with an expected ''residue'' constant.\n\nIf the CRC values do not match, then the block contains a data error.\n\nThe device may take corrective action, such as rereading the block or requesting that it be sent again. Otherwise, the data is assumed to be error-free (though, with some small probability, it may contain undetected errors; this is inherent in the nature of error-checking).<ref name=\"ritter-1986\">{{Cite journal|first=Terry|last=Ritter|title=The Great CRC Mystery|url=http://www.ciphersbyritter.com/ARTS/CRCMYST.HTM|accessdate=21 May 2009|journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]|date=February 1986|volume=11|issue=2|pages=26\u201334, 76\u201383}}</ref>\n\n== Data integrity ==\nCRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels, where they can provide quick and reasonable assurance of the [[data integrity|integrity]] of messages delivered. However, they are not suitable for protecting against intentional alteration of data.\n\nFirstly, as there is no authentication, an attacker can edit a message and recompute the CRC without the substitution being detected. When stored alongside the data, CRCs and cryptographic hash functions by themselves do not protect against ''intentional'' modification of data. Any application that requires protection against such attacks must use cryptographic authentication mechanisms, such as [[message authentication code]]s or [[digital signatures]] (which are commonly based on [[cryptographic hash]] functions).\n\nSecondly, unlike cryptographic hash functions, CRC is an easily reversible function, which makes it unsuitable for use in digital signatures.<ref name=\"stigge-reversecrc\">{{Cite journal|last=Stigge|first=Martin|last2=Pl\u00f6tz|first2=Henryk|last3=M\u00fcller|first3=Wolf|last4=Redlich|first4=Jens-Peter|title=Reversing CRC \u2013 Theory and Practice|date=May 2006|page=17|location=Berlin|publisher=Humboldt University Berlin|url=http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2011|quote=The presented methods offer a very easy and efficient way to modify your data so that it will compute to a CRC you want or at least know in advance.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042902/http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThirdly, CRC is a [[linear function]] with a property that<ref>{{cite web |title=algorithm design - Why is CRC said to be linear? |url=https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/34013 |website=Cryptography Stack Exchange |accessdate=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{crc}(x \\oplus y \\oplus z) = \\operatorname{crc}(x) \\oplus \\operatorname{crc}(y) \\oplus \\operatorname{crc}(z);</math>\n\nas a result, even if the CRC is encrypted with a [[stream cipher]] that uses [[Exclusive or|XOR]] as its combining operation (or [[Block cipher modes of operation|mode]] of [[block cipher]] which effectively turns it into a stream cipher, such as OFB or CFB), both the message and the associated CRC can be manipulated without knowledge of the encryption key; this was one of the well-known design flaws of the [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) protocol.<ref name=\"wep\">{{Cite journal| last1=Cam-Winget | first1=Nancy | last2=Housley | first2=Russ | last3=Wagner | first3=David | last4=Walker | first4=Jesse | title=Security Flaws in 802.11 Data Link Protocols | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=35\u201339 |date = May 2003| doi=10.1145/769800.769823 | url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/wireless-cacm.pdf | citeseerx=10.1.1.14.8775 }}</ref>\n\n== CRC-32 algorithm ==\nThis is the algorithm for the CRC-32 variant of CRC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd905031.aspx|title=[MS-ABS]: 32-Bit CRC Algorithm|author=|date=|website=msdn.microsoft.com}}</ref> The CRCTable is a [[memoization]] of a calculation that would have to be repeated for each byte of the message.\n\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Function'''</span> CRC32\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Input:'''</span>\n       data:  Bytes     <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Array of bytes'''</span>\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Output:'''</span>\n       crc32: UInt32    <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//32-bit unsigned crc-32 value'''</span><br>\n <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Initialize crc-32 to starting value'''</span>\n crc32 &larr; 0xFFFFFFFF<br>\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''for each'''</span> byte <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''in'''</span> data <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''do'''</span>\n    nLookupIndex &larr; (crc32 xor byte) and 0xFF;\n    crc32 &larr; (crc32 shr 8) xor CRCTable[nLookupIndex] <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//CRCTable is an array of 256 32-bit constants'''</span><br>\n <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Finalize the CRC-32 value by inverting all the bits'''</span>\n crc32 &larr; crc32 xor 0xFFFFFFFF\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''return'''</span> crc32\n\n== Computation ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n{{Main|Computation of cyclic redundancy checks}}\n\nTo compute an ''n''-bit binary CRC, line the bits representing the input in a row, and position the ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit pattern representing the CRC's divisor (called a \"[[polynomial]]\") underneath the left-hand end of the row.\n\nIn this example, we shall encode 14 bits of message with a 3-bit CRC, with a polynomial {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x'' + 1}}. The polynomial is written in binary as the coefficients; a 3rd-degree polynomial has 4 coefficients ({{nowrap|1''x''<sup>3</sup> + 0''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1''x'' + 1}}). In this case, the coefficients are 1, 0, 1 and 1.  The result of the calculation is 3 bits long.\n\nStart with the message to be encoded:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100\n</pre>\n\nThis is first padded with zeros corresponding to the bit length ''n'' of the CRC. This is done so that the resulting code word is in [[systematic code|systematic]] form. Here is the first calculation for computing a 3-bit CRC:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 000 <--- input right padded by 3 bits\n1011               <--- divisor (4 bits) = x\u00b3 + x + 1\n------------------\n01100011101100 000 <--- result\n</pre>\n\nThe algorithm acts on the bits directly above the divisor in each step.  The result for that iteration is the bitwise XOR of the polynomial divisor with the bits above it.  The bits not above the divisor are simply copied directly below for that step.  The divisor is then shifted one bit to the right, and the process is repeated until the divisor reaches the right-hand end of the input row. Here is the entire calculation:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 000 <--- input right padded by 3 bits\n1011               <--- divisor\n01100011101100 000 <--- result (note the first four bits are the XOR with the divisor beneath, the rest of the bits are unchanged)\n 1011              <--- divisor ...\n00111011101100 000\n  1011\n00010111101100 000\n   1011\n00000001101100 000 <--- note that the divisor moves over to align with the next 1 in the dividend (since quotient for that step was zero)\n       1011             (in other words, it doesn't necessarily move one bit per iteration)\n00000000110100 000\n        1011\n00000000011000 000\n         1011\n00000000001110 000\n          1011\n00000000000101 000\n           101 1\n-----------------\n00000000000000 100 <--- remainder (3 bits).

These ''n'' bits are the remainder of the division step, and will also be the value of the CRC function (unless the chosen CRC specification calls for some postprocessing).\n\nThe validity of a received message can easily be verified by performing the above calculation again, this time with the check value added instead of zeroes. The remainder should equal zero if there are no detectable errors.\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 100 <--- input with check value\n1011               <--- divisor\n01100011101100 100 <--- result\n 1011              <--- divisor ...\n00111011101100 100\n\n......\n\n00000000001110 100\n          1011\n00000000000101 100\n           101 1\n------------------\n00000000000000 000 <--- remainder\n</pre>\n\nThe following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code outlines a function which will return the initial CRC remainder for a chosen input and polynomial, with either 1 or 0 as the initial padding.

In this analysis, the digits of the bit strings are taken as the coefficients of a polynomial in some variable ''x''\u2014coefficients that are elements of the finite field [[GF(2)]], instead of more familiar numbers. The set of binary polynomials is a mathematical [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\n=== Designing polynomials ===\nThe selection of the generator polynomial is the most important part of implementing the CRC algorithm. The polynomial must be chosen to maximize the error-detecting capabilities while minimizing overall collision probabilities.\n\nThe most important attribute of the polynomial is its length (largest degree(exponent) +1 of any one term in the polynomial), because of its direct influence on the length of the computed check value.\n\nThe most commonly used polynomial lengths are:\n*9 bits (CRC-8)\n*17 bits (CRC-16)\n*33 bits (CRC-32)\n*65 bits (CRC-64)\n\nA CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n''-bits. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', and hence {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms (the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}). The remainder has length ''n''. The CRC has a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX.\n\nThe design of the CRC polynomial depends on the maximum total length of the block to be protected (data + CRC bits), the desired error protection features, and the type of resources for implementing the CRC, as well as the desired performance. A common misconception is that the \"best\" CRC polynomials are derived from either [[irreducible polynomial]]s or irreducible polynomials times the factor&nbsp;{{nowrap|1 + ''x''}}, which adds to the code the ability to detect all errors affecting an odd number of bits.<ref name=\"williams93\" /> In reality, all the factors described above should enter into the selection of the polynomial and may lead to a reducible polynomial. However, choosing a reducible polynomial will result in a certain proportion of missed errors, due to the quotient ring having [[zero divisor]]s.\n\nThe advantage of choosing a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] as the generator for a CRC code is that the resulting code has maximal total block length in the sense that all 1-bit errors within that block length have different remainders (also called [[Syndrome decoding|syndromes]]) and therefore, since the remainder is a linear function of the block, the code can detect all 2-bit errors within that block length. If <math>r</math> is the degree of the primitive generator polynomial, then the maximal total block length is <math>2 ^ {r} - 1 </math>, and the associated code is able to detect any single-bit or double-bit errors.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Press | first1=WH | last2=Teukolsky | first2=SA | last3=Vetterling | first3=WT | last4=Flannery | first4=BP | year=2007 | title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press |  location=New York | isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 | chapter=Section 22.4 Cyclic Redundancy and Other Checksums | chapter-url=http://apps.nrbook.com/empanel/index.html#pg=1168}}</ref> We can improve this situation. If we use the generator polynomial <math>g(x) = p(x)(1 + x)</math>, where <math>p(x)</math> is a primitive polynomial of degree <math>r - 1</math>, then the maximal total block length is <math>2^{r - 1} - 1</math>, and the code is able to detect single, double, triple and any odd number of errors.\n\nA polynomial <math>g(x)</math> that admits other factorizations may be chosen then so as to balance the maximal total blocklength with a desired error detection power. The [[BCH code]]s are a powerful class of such polynomials. They subsume the two examples above. Regardless of the reducibility properties of a generator polynomial of degree&nbsp;''r'', if it includes the \"+1\" term, the code will be able to detect error patterns that are confined to a window of ''r'' contiguous bits. These patterns are called \"error bursts\".\n\n== Specification ==\nThe concept of the CRC as an error-detecting code gets complicated when an implementer or standards committee uses it to design a practical system. Here are some of the complications:\n*Sometimes an implementation '''prefixes a fixed bit pattern''' to the bitstream to be checked. This is useful when clocking errors might insert 0-bits in front of a message, an alteration that would otherwise leave the check value unchanged.\n*Usually, but not always, an implementation '''appends ''n'' 0-bits''' (''n'' being the size of the CRC) to the bitstream to be checked before the polynomial division occurs. Such appending is explicitly demonstrated in the [[Computation of cyclic redundancy checks|Computation of CRC]] article. This has the convenience that the remainder of the original bitstream with the check value appended is exactly zero, so the CRC can be checked simply by performing the polynomial division on the received bitstream and comparing the remainder with zero. Due to the associative and commutative properties of the exclusive-or operation, practical table driven implementations can obtain a result numerically equivalent to zero-appending without explicitly appending any zeroes, by using an equivalent,<ref name=\"williams93\" /> faster algorithm that combines the message bitstream with the stream being shifted out of the CRC register.\n*Sometimes an implementation '''exclusive-ORs a fixed bit pattern''' into the remainder of the polynomial division.\n*'''Bit order:''' Some schemes view the low-order bit of each byte as \"first\", which then during polynomial division means \"leftmost\", which is contrary to our customary understanding of \"low-order\". This convention makes sense when [[serial port|serial-port]] transmissions are CRC-checked in hardware, because some widespread serial-port transmission conventions transmit bytes least-significant bit first.\n*'''[[Byte order]]''': With multi-byte CRCs, there can be confusion over whether the byte transmitted first (or stored in the lowest-addressed byte of memory) is the least-significant byte (LSB) or the most-significant byte (MSB). For example, some 16-bit CRC schemes swap the bytes of the check value.\n*'''Omission of the high-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the high-order bit is always 1, and since an ''n''-bit CRC must be defined by an ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit divisor which [[Arithmetic overflow|overflows]] an ''n''-bit [[processor register|register]], some writers assume that it is unnecessary to mention the divisor's high-order bit.\n*'''Omission of the low-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the low-order bit is always 1, authors such as Philip Koopman represent polynomials with their high-order bit intact, but without the low-order bit (the <math>x^0</math> or 1 term).  This convention encodes the polynomial complete with its degree in one integer.\n\nThese complications mean that there are three common ways to express a polynomial as an integer: the first two, which are mirror images in binary, are the constants found in code; the third is the number found in Koopman's papers.  ''In each case, one term is omitted.'' So the polynomial <math>x^4 + x + 1</math> may be transcribed as:\n*0x3 = 0b0011, representing <math>x^4 + (0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1 + 1x^0)</math> (MSB-first code)\n*0xC = 0b1100, representing <math>(1x^0 + 1x^1 + 0x^2 + 0x^3) + x^4</math> (LSB-first code)\n*0x9 = 0b1001, representing <math>(1x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1) + x^0</math> (Koopman notation)\nIn the table below they are shown as:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples of CRC representations\n|-\n!

The Audies are sometimes promoted as \"the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] of the audiobook industry\" and serve as a way to promote audiobooks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.audiofilemagazine.com/features/A2079_Audies08.pdf |title=The Audies Finalists 2008 |work=[[AudioFile (magazine)|AudioFile]] |author= |date=2008 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578637850049098298 |title=The New Explosion in Audio Books |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |author=Alexandra Alter |date=August 1, 2013 |accessdate=June 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAwards are given in about thirty categories. Some of the awards relate to types of writing, including abridged and unabridged fiction and non-fiction, and such [[genre]]s as [[romance novels|romance]], [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[mystery novels|mystery]]; other awards recognize excellence in different styles of narration and production, such as multi-voiced performance and production values.
