The symphony is notable for its multilayered complexity\u2014typically requiring two conductors in performance\u2014and for its large and varied orchestration.

Prelude: Maestoso ===\n{{wikisource|Watchman, Tell Us of the Night}}\nThis movement and the second movement were first performed in the [[Town Hall (New York, New York)|Town Hall]], [[New York City]], on January 29, 1927, by 50 members of the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] on a Pro Musica International Referendum Concert conducted by [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]]. While 50 players are sufficient for the chamber-like scoring of the first movement, the second movement in reality requires almost twice as many players, yet this was Ives's only experience of hearing any parts of the Symphony performed live. In contrast to Ives's other works for large orchestra, which begin in quiet and meditative moods, the first-movement Prelude starts with a strong, maestoso, ''[[fortissimo]]'' bassline, immediately followed by a rising trumpet [[fanfare]]. A quiet passage follows. The movement ends with chorus singing [[John Bowring]]'s [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] [[hymn]] \"Watchman, Tell Us of the Night\". Unlike the bold beginning, the movement dies away, quadruple-pianissimo, at the end.\n\n=== II. Comedy: Allegretto ===\nIves bases this \"Comedy\" movement on [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Hawthorne]]'s story \"[[The Celestial Railroad]]\", itself a trope on [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]''. It is an orchestral expansion\u2014not merely a simple orchestration\u2014of Ives's piano solo, ''The Celestial Railroad'' (ca. 1924). As such, the \"Comedy\" movement is a composition of the 1920s, and may represent one of Ives's last orchestral endeavors. It is his most extreme essay in overlapping thematic material, found also in his [[A Symphony: New England Holidays|''Holidays'' Symphony]], but is most complex in its use of multimetrics and temporal dysynchronies, and is compositionally his most complex orchestral work. Tunes quoted include \"[[In the Sweet By-and-By]]\", \"[[Beulah Land]]\", \"[[Marching Through Georgia]]\", \"Ye Christian Heralds\", \"Jesus, Lover of my Soul\" and \"[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]\". The disjunctive metrical and temporal complexity of this movement requires at least one additional conductor. The music builds to several riotous climaxes before ebbing away.\n\n=== III. Fugue: Andante moderato con moto ===\nAn arrangement of this movement by lousy future film composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] (notable for his scores to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films) was performed in New York on May 10, 1933, but Ives's version was not performed until the integral premiere of the entire Symphony in 1965. It is a mild orchestral expansion (compared with the extreme expansion of the ''Comedy'' movement from its piano solo source) of a student [[fugue]] exercise Ives composed during his years at [[Yale University]]; in its orchestral form, it ends with a brief quotation of \"[[Joy to the World]]\". Ives called it \"an expression of the reaction of life into formalism and ritualism\". Paradoxically, because of its juxtaposition with the other three harmonically, tonally and rhythmically complex movements, Ives biographer Jan Swafford calls this most outwardly simple and conservative movement \"in a way the most revolutionary movement of all\".<ref name = Swafford/>\n\n=== IV. Finale: Very slowly \u2013 Largo maestoso ===\nThe symphony ends with what Ives called \"an [[apotheosis]] of the preceding content, in terms that have something to do with the reality of existence and its religious experience\".<ref name = Swafford/> It employs a separate [[percussion]] ensemble that plays in a [[polyrhythm|separate tempo]] from the main orchestra; the temporal relationship between the two groups changes over the course of the movement in a tightly controlled and exact manner, which is one of the many challenges facing conductors and performers. The first performance of the Finale to the symphony was part of the integral premiere of the Symphony on April 26, 1965, by the [[American Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Leopold Stokowski]], some 11 years after Ives's death.\n\n==Composition==\nIn [[Henry Bellamann]]'s program note to the 1927 premiere of the first and second movements of the symphony (a program note that seems to be ghost-written by Ives, as his tone of voice and use of language is obvious throughout), the program of the symphony is described this way:\n\n{{quote|The aesthetic program of the work is that of many of the greatest literary and musical masterpieces of the world\u2014the searching questions of What? and Why? which the spirit of man asks of life. This is particularly the sense of the prelude. The&nbsp;... succeeding movements are the diverse answers in which existence replies.}}\n\nIn his ''Memos'', Ives misquotes Bellamann's program note by attributing to it the famous description of the Finale (hence providing further proof that he had supplied descriptive text to Bellamann for the note, with Bellamann dropping the Finale's description because of its absence on the 1927 performance): \"The last movement is an apotheosis of the preceding content, in terms that have something to do with the reality of existence and its religious experience.\"\n\nThe symphony is distinguished by its use of [[polyrhythm|multimetrics]] (i.e. simultaneous use of different [[meter (music)|meters]]) as well as temporal dyssynchronies (i.e. simultaneous use of different tempos). For example, in the second movement there is a passage (famously called the \"Collapse Section\") in which the orchestra divides into two groups, one playing in a slow {{music|time|3|2}} meter, the other in {{music|time|4|4}}. Initially, the two groups are synchronized (with one [[measure (music)|measure]] of {{music|time|3|2}} equaling one measure of {{music|time|4|4}}), but then the {{music|time|4|4}} group accelerates on top of the {{music|time|3|2}} group and collapses, thereafter waiting for the {{music|time|3|2}} group to catch up with them, at which point the orchestra resynchronizes as a single unit. This is but one of many extremely novel temporal effects in this work.\n\nThe fourth movement is distinguished by a rhythmic plan in which there is a division between the main orchestra and a separate group of percussion; the two groups play in precise temporal ratios to one another, and obtaining the temporal ratios between the two groups is one of the chief challenges of performing the movement. Also novel in the symphony is the use of [[quarter tone]]s, heard both in the strings as well as in a dedicated quarter-tone piano that assumes [[24-tone equal temperament|24 notes per octave]]. In the second movement, the quarter-tone piano noodles a filigree pattern in quarter and regular tones to accompany a solo violin that intones the hymn \"[[Beulah Land]]\". (Ives here was anticipating a double-manual keyboard, with one manual at regular pitch and the other a quarter tone higher.)\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe symphony is scored for a very large orchestra:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n''Distant choir ensemble'', [[Offstage instrument or choir part in classical music|offstage]]\n: [[harp]]\n: 5 [[violin]]s\n\n'''[[woodwind instrument|Woodwinds]]'''\n: [[piccolo]]\n: 3 [[flute]]s\n: 2 [[oboe]]s\n: 3 [[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}} (the 1st clarinet optionally playing A in the first movement)\n: [[tenor saxophone]] in B{{music|flat}}\n: [[baritone saxophone]] in B{{music|flat}}\n: 2 [[bassoon]]s\n\n'''[[brass instrument|Brass]]'''\n: 4 [[horns in F]]\n: 6 [[trumpet]]s in C\n: [[cornet]] in C (played by 5th trumpet)\n: 4 [[trombone]]s\n: [[tuba]]\n{{col-3}}\n\n'''[[percussion instrument|Percussion]]'''\n: [[xylophone]] (optional)\n: 2 [[bell (instrument)|bells]], high and low\n: [[timpani]]\n: [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]\n: Indian drum\n: piccolo timpano\n: [[snare drum]]\n: [[bass drum]]\n: [[cymbal]]s\n: 2 [[tam-tam]]s, light and heavy\n\n: ''B.U.

It is the largest man-made lake in Illinois, and the largest lake wholly contained within the state.\n\n==History==\nWith the frequent flooding of the Kaskaskia River, citizens of Clinton County formed an organization in 1933 to discuss the Kaskaskia River Valley Project. This group made efforts to study all of the physical, economic, and social aspects of the Kaskaskia River throughout the state of Illinois. After completing this report the possibilities of Carlyle Lake were discussed. In 1938, Congress approved the Flood Control Act of June 28, 1938, which authorized a major reservoir at Carlyle, levees downstream, and a plan for the development of the Kaskaskia Basin, but World War II put a temporary halt to the construction of the Carlyle reservoir.\n\nShortly after settling in Carlyle, Eldon E. Hazlet became interested in the Kaskaskia River and points along the banks. Full of enthusiasm, Hazlet formed the Kaskaskia Valley Association (KVA), to sell the Kaskaskia River Project to the general public. In 1957, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a comprehensive plan for the Kaskaskia River Project and the Carlyle and Shelbyville Reservoir Projects were authorized in Congress by the Flood Control Act of July 3, 1958. \n\nConstruction of Carlyle Lake began October 18, 1958. The government purchased 25,000 acres for the lake, in addition to land surrounding the lake for flowage easement. Homesteads were moved, along with country roads and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Tracks containing five bridges span the water between Keyesport and Boulder, dividing the upper and lower parts of the lake. The rights to 69 oil wells were purchased and plugged to prevent pollution in the lake. Over 600 burial sites had to be moved from seven cemeteries. Other shoreline cemeteries had to be moved to higher ground. \n\nThe Carlyle Lake project was completed in April of 1967 and the Carlyle Lake Dam was dedicated on June 3, 1967. The damming of the Kaskaskia River at Carlyle is 107 miles from the mouth of the river and creates the largest man-made lake in Illinois. \n\n==The lake today==\nLocated around the lake are the Dam West, Dam East, McNair, Coles Creek, Boulder and Keyesport Recreation Areas operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources operates the [[Eldon Hazlet State Recreation Area|Eldon Hazlet State Park]] and the [[Carlyle Lake State Fish and Wildlife Area|Carlyle Lake Wildlife Management]] Area. Carlyle Lake has five developed campgrounds with more than 300 campsites. The lake also has five beaches, numerous boat ramps, and access areas for outdoor recreational enthusiasts to enjoy.\n\nCarlyle Lake is a multi purpose lake that was built for the primary purpose of flood risk management. The lake also supports commercial navigation, water supply, water quality, fish and wildlife conservation, and recreation.[[human swimming|ming]].\n\nCarlyle Lake is used by many for [[boating]], particularly [[sailing]].  Many use the lake to catch [[channel catfish]], [[flathead catfish|flathead]]s, [[largemouth bass]], [[white bass]], [[crappie]], and [[bluegill]].\n\nThe lake is separated into two unequal parts by a 3.5-mile-long (6&nbsp;km) railroad embankment, and five bridges, carrying the tracks of the [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]].\n\nThe lake is the subject of [[Sufjan Stevens]]' song, \"Carlyle Lake\" on ''[[The Avalanche: Outtakes and Extras from the Illinois Album]]''.\n\n==External links==\n* {{commonscat-inline}}\n* [http://mvs-wc.mvs.usace.army.mil/trans/q_plot/fc_plc.htm Carlyle Lake - U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]\n* [http://www.mvs.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/CarlyleLake/History.aspx History]\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.ifishillinois.org:80/profiles/lakes/pdfMaps/carlyle%20fishing%20guide.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070508011948/http://www.ifishillinois.org/profiles/lakes/pdfMaps/carlyle%20fishing%20guide.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2007-05-08 |title= Fishing Guide }}&nbsp;{{small|(6.20&nbsp;MB)}}  (Source of depths and shoreline)\n\n{{Clinton County, Illinois}}\n\n[[Category:Dams completed in 1966]]\n[[Category:Dams in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Bond County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Clinton County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Fayette County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Bond County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Clinton County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Fayette County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Reservoirs in Illinois]]\n[[Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers dams]]\n[[Category:1967 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "name_user": "120.29.73.191", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlyle_Lake"}

In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Continuity===\nWhile ''Bates Motel'' (1987) was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where ''Psycho'' left off, it ignored the continuity of ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'', and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in ''Psycho II''. ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" in 1992 featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" in 1992 featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O. Philippe]] running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Karyn Kusama]], [[Eli Roth]], [[Oz Perkins]], [[Leigh Whannell]], [[Walter Murch]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Richard Stanley (director)|Richard Stanley]] and [[Neil Marshall]].<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

It was based in [[Central Java]], and later in [[East Java]]. Established by King [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the kingdom was ruled by the [[Sailendra]] dynasty.\n\nDuring most of its history the kingdom seems have relied heavily on agriculture, especially extensive [[rice farming]], and later also benefited from maritime trade. According to foreign sources and archaeological findings, the kingdom seems to have been well populated and quite prosperous. The kingdom developed a complex society,<ref name=\"Peradaban35\">{{cite book| author=Rahardjo, Supratikno |title= Peradaban Jawa, Dinamika Pranata Politik, Agama, dan Ekonomi Jawa Kuno | date=2002 | publisher=Komuntas Bambu, Jakarta | language=Indonesian |page=35 | isbn=979-96201-1-2}}</ref> had a well developed culture, and achieved a degree of sophistication and refined civilization.\n\nIn the period between the late 8th century and the mid-9th century, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture reflected in the rapid growth of [[Candi of Indonesia|temple construction]].  Temples dotted the landscape of its heartland in [[Yogyakarta|Mataram]] ([[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]]). The most notable of the temples constructed in Medang Mataram are [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu]], [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]], all quite close to present-day city of [[Yogyakarta]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2012/02/18/04155621/Kisah.Mataram.di.Poros.Kedu-Prambanan|title=Kisah Mataram di Poros Kedu-Prambanan - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|date=2012-02-18|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=2018-09-08|language=id}}</ref> At its peak, the kingdom had become a dominant empire\u2014not only in Java, but also in [[Srivijaya|Sumatra]], [[Bali]], [[Ligor|southern Thailand]], Indianized kingdoms of the [[Philippines]], and the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] in [[Cambodia]].<ref name=\"Laguna Copperplate Inscription\">[[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]</ref><ref name=\"Ligor inscription\">[[Ligor inscription]]</ref><ref name=\"Coed\u00e8s, George 1968\">Coed\u00e8s, George (1968).

Civil war followed.  The outcome was that the Medang empire was divided into two powerful kingdoms; the [[Sanjaya dynasty|Shivaist dynasty]] of Medang kingdom in [[Java]] led by [[Rakai Pikatan]] and the [[Shailendra dynasty|Buddhist dynasty]] of [[Srivijaya]] kingdom in [[Sumatra]] led by [[Balaputradewa]]. Hostility between them did not end until 1006 when the Sailendra clan based in Srivijaya incited a rebellion by Wurawari, a vassal of the Medang kingdom, and sacked the capital of Watugaluh in East Java. Srivijaya rose to become the undisputed hegemonic empire in the region. The Shivaist dynasty survived, reclaimed east Java in 1019, and then established the [[Kahuripan|Kahuripan kingdom]] led by [[Airlangga]], son of [[Udayana Warmadewa|Udayana]] of Bali.<ref>{{harvp|Brown|2003|p=23}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:BUDDINGH(1) p281 - RUINEN VAN PRAMBANAN, TJANDI SEWOE.jpg|thumb|right|A lithograph of ''[[Sewu|Tjandi Sewoe]]'' ruins near Prambanan, circa 1859|alt=|220x220px]]\nIn the early 19th century, the discovery of numerous ruins of [[Candi of Indonesia|great monuments]]\u2014such as [[Borobudur]], [[Sewu]] and [[Prambanan]]\u2014 which dominated the landscape of the [[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain|Kewu]] plains in [[Yogyakarta Special Region|Yogyakarta]] and [[Central Java]], caught the attention of some historians and scholars in the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"Raffles1814\">{{cite book|title=The History of Java|author=Thomas Stamford Raffles|authorlink=Sir Thomas Raffles|year=1817|edition=1978|isbn=0-19-580347-7|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> This spurred [[archaeology|archaeological]] studies to uncover the history of this ancient civilisation.\n\nThe history of the Mataram area as the capital of the Central Javanese Medang kingdom is also part of the historical ''Yawadvipa'' or ''Bhumijava'' (the land of [[Java]]), and the classical Javanese civilisation.

These inscriptions most often recorded the political and religious deeds of the rulers. The most common theme mentioned in inscriptions is the establishment of ''Sima'' (taxed rice cultivation land recognised through royal edict), and sometimes some portion or the whole of tax collected from this ''Sima'' land is appointed to fund the construction and maintenance of [[Candi of Indonesia|religious building]]. Nevertheless, some local legends and historical records, written on ''[[Palm-leaf manuscript|lontar]]''\u2014most often dated from later period\u2014might also provides data and source to reconstruct the historical event.\n\nNative [[Javanese mythology]] and beliefs composed in the [[Mataram Sultanate]] era (circa 17th century), but probably originating from an earlier period, mentioned a semi-mythological kingdom named [[Medang Kamulan]], which in Javanese translates to \"Medang the origin\" kingdom. The kingdom is mentioned in the myth of [[Dewi Sri]] and also [[Aji Saka]]. This is probably the remnant of vague native Javanese collective memory of the existence of an ancient kingdom called \"Medang\".\n\nCurrent knowledge of historical Javanese civilisation is thus primarily derived from:\n* ''Archaeological excavations'', reconstruction and investigation of ancient structures, especially ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' (temples), and also the discovery of ancient relics, such as the [[Wonoboyo hoard]].\n* ''Stone inscriptions'', most common are those which mention the foundation and funding of temples which report on the political and religious deeds of the kings, or stating their lineage; the most notable are the [[Canggal inscription|Canggal]], [[Kalasan inscription|Kalasan]], [[Shivagrha inscription|Shivagrha]] and [[Mantyasih inscription|Balitung charter]].\n* ''[[Bas relief]]s'' in a series of temple walls with depictions of life in the palace, village, temple, ship, marketplace and also the everyday lives of the population. The most notable are the bas reliefs found on Borobudur and Prambanan temple.\n* ''Native [[Palm-leaf manuscript|manuscripts]]'' mentioning stories of kings, their deeds and exploits, that somehow link across to accounts mentioned in stone inscriptions. The notable example is the [[Carita Parahyangan]].\n* ''Reports and chronicles'' of foreign diplomats, traders and travellers, mainly from Chinese, Indian, and Arab sources.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Prambanan]] temple compound originally consisted of hundreds of temples, built and expanded in the period between the reign of Pikatan and Balitung|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nInitially, the kingdom was identified only through its location '''Yawadvipa''' ([[Java]] island) as mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732). The inscription mentioned ''Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya'' (King Sanjaya, the Rakai (lord) of Mataram). The earlier historians such as [[Soekmono]], identify this kingdom as '''Mataram''', a historic geographical name to identify the plain south of [[Mount Merapi]] in central Java, roughly corresponds to modern [[Muntilan]] (where the Canggal temple on [[Gunung Wukir]] hill is located), [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Sleman Regency|Sleman]] and [[Bantul Regency]]. This is based on the locations where large numbers of [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] were discovered in and around [[Prambanan Plain]]. The etymology of the name \"Mataram\" derived from a Sanskrit term for \"mother\".<ref>{{cite web | title = Mataram | work = Sanskrit dictionary | url = http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&tinput=mataram&trans=Translate}}</ref>\n\nThe name '''Medang''' appear later in East Javanese inscriptions such as [[Anjukladang inscription]] (937) and [[Minto Stone]] (982), Paradah inscription and some inscriptions discovered in Surabaya. As the result, historians tends to identify the Eastern Java period (929\u20141006) of this kingdom as ''Medang'' to differ it with its earlier Central Java period of ''Mataram'' (732\u2014929). However, by examining the phrase in Anjukladang inscription mentioning: ''\"Kita prasiddha mangrakpa kadatwan rahyang ta i Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' suggests that the name ''Mda\u014b'' (read: Mdang or Medang) was already used earlier in Central Java period. The phrase ''\"Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' literally means \"Medang in the land of Mataram\", which means the kingdom name is Medang with its capital in Mataram.<ref>{{cite book|title=Menuju Puncak Kemegahan|author=Slamet Muljana\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XPLpH5LOZLsC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=Medang+Anjukladang#v=onepage&q=Medang%20Anjukladang&f=false|page=84|language=Indonesian|publisher=LKiS|accessdate=3 March 2014|isbn=9789798451355\n|year=2005\n}}</ref> The etymology of the name \"Medang\" might be derived from a local name of the hardwood \"medang\" tree which refer to trees of the genus ''[[Phoebe (plant)|Phoebe]]''.<ref>{{cite web | work = KBBI | title = Medang | url = http://kbbi.web.id/medang}}</ref> However, another etymological approach suggests that it might derived from old Javanese term \"medang\" which means \"gracefully appear\". It might be related to a Javanese term \"medal\" which means \"going out\", and Sundanese term \"midang\" which refer to dress up and appear gracefully in public.<ref>{{cite web | title = Midang | work = Kamus Daerah | url = http://www.kamusdaerah.com/?bhs=a&bhs2=m&q=1%20ngageulis%202%20midang.}}</ref>\n\nThe court moved several times after Mataram (reign of Sanjaya) to Mamrati or Amrati (reign of Rakai Pikatan), Poh Pitu (reign of Balitung), again to Bhumi Mataram (reign of Dyah Wawa), Tamwlang (reign of Sindok), Watugaluh (reign of Sindok), and last to Wwatan (reign of Dharmawangsa Teguh).\n\nThe name \"Mataram\" reappeared again later in the 14th century as one of [[Majapahit]]'s province. Later in the 16th century appeared the Islamic [[Mataram Sultanate]] located in the same area in Yogyakarta vicinity. As the result, earlier historian also named this kingdom as '''Hindu Mataram''' or '''Ancient Mataram''' to differ it with later Islamic Mataram Sultanate.\n\nThis historic Javanese Kingdom of Mataram should not be confused with the [[Mataram (city)|Mataram city]] located on [[Lombok]] island, currently the capital of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] province. The latter was actually the royal capital of the Cakranegara, a branch of [[Bali]]nese [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]] nobles that colonize Lombok in early 19th century. Indeed, Lombok's Mataram city was named after the historic region of Mataram in Java, as it is a common practice for [[Balinese people|Balinese]] to name their settlements after their Javanese Majapahit heritage.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and growth===\n[[File:Canggal inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Canggal inscription (732), created by King Sanjaya.]]\nThe earliest account of the Medang Mataram Kingdom is in the [[Canggal inscription]], dated 732, discovered within the compound of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple in Canggal village, southwest of the town of [[Magelang]]. This inscription, written in [[Sanskrit]] using the [[Pallava]] script, tells of the erection of a ''[[Lingam|lingga]]'' (a symbol of [[Shiva]]) on the hill in the Kunjarakunja area, located on a noble island called Yawadwipa (Java) which was blessed with abundance of rice and gold. The establishment of lingga was under the order of [[Sri Sanjaya|Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya]] (King Sanjaya Rakai (lord) of Mataram). This inscription tells that Yawadwipa was ruled by [[King Sanna]], whose long reign was marked by wisdom and virtue. After Sanna died, the kingdom fell into disunity. [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of [[Sannaha]] (Sanna's sister) ascended to the throne. He conquered the areas around his kingdom, and his wise reign blessed his land with peace and prosperity for all of his subjects.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Drs. R.

And yet it seems to be the continuation of earlier polity ruled by King Sanna, Sanjaya's uncle. This earlier polity is linked to the earlier [[Dieng temples|temple structures]] in [[Dieng Plateau]], in the northern part of Central Java, which is the oldest surviving structure found in Central Java. The earlier kingdom linked as the predecessor of Medang Mataram kingdom is [[Kalingga]], located somewhere in Central Java northern coast.\n\nThe story of Sanna and Sanjaya are also described in the ''[[Carita Parahyangan]]'', a book from a later period composed around late 16th-century, which mainly describes the history of Pasundan (the [[Sunda Kingdom]]). This book mentions that Sanna was defeated by [[Purbasora]], King of [[Galuh]], and retreated to [[Mount Merapi]]. Later, Sanjaya reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and ruled [[West Java]], Central Java, East Java, and [[Bali]]. He also battled the [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] and [[Keling]] (against their king, Sang Srivijaya). Although the manuscript seems to be romanticised, vague and not providing certain details on the period, nevertheless the almost exact name and theme of the story with historical Canggal inscription seems to confirm that the manuscript was based or inspired from the historical event.\n\n===Golden age===\n[[File:Javanese - The Buddhist Goddess Tara - Walters 572282.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 9th century Central Javanese gold and silver image of the Mahayana Buddhist goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]]]\nThe period between the reign of King [[Panangkaran]] to King [[Balitung]] (span between 760\u2014910) that roughly lasted for 150 years, marked the apogee of Javanese classic civilisation. This period witnessed the blossoming of Javanese art and architecture, as numbers of majestic temples and monuments were erected and dominated the skyline of [[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]]. Most notable of these temples are [[Sewu]], [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] temple. The [[Sailendra]]s are known as the ardent temple builder.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89\u201390}}\n\nKing Sanjaya was a Shivaist, and yet his successor Panangkaran was a Mahayana Buddhist.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89}} This shift of faith, from Shivaist Sanjaya to Buddhist Panangkaran has raised problematic questions among scholars; whether there were two competing royal families that dominated the political landscapes in Central Java, that each are patrons of either Shivaist Hindu or Mahayana Buddhism. Or more recently suggested theory, that there were only one dynasty\u2014the [[Sailendra]]s\u2014and there was only the shift or split of royal patronage in favour to Hinduism or Buddhism.\n\n====The great builder====\n[[File:Kalasan Temple from the south-south-east, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|The construction of [[Kalasan]] temple was mentioned in [[Kalasan inscription]], under the auspices of King [[Panangkaran]].]]\n\n[[Panangkaran]] (r. 760\u2014780) was an enthusiastic developer, he was credited for at least five major temple projects conducted and started during his reign. According to the [[Kalasan inscription]], dated 778 and written in the Pranagari script in Sanskrit, the [[Candi Kalasan|Kalasan]] temple was erected by the will of ''Guru Sang Raja Sailendravam\u00e7atilaka'' (the teacher of the ornament of Sailendra family), who persuaded [[Panangkaran]] (Sanjaya's successor) to construct a holy building for the goddess (''boddhisattvadevi'') [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and build a [[vihara]] ([[monastery]]) for Buddhist monks from the Sailendra realm. Panangkaran also awarded Kala\u00e7a village to a ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' (Buddhist monastic community).<ref>{{cite book | author=Soetarno, Drs.

This hilltop compound was actually not a religious structure; consist of series of gates, ramparts, fortified walls, dry moats, walled enclosure, terraces and building bases.

Initially probably it was intended as a secluded hilltop Buddhist monastery, as mentioned in the Abhayagiri Vihara inscription. However, later it seems to be converted to become a fortified palace or a citadel, which evidence in the remnant of defensive structures.<ref>{{cite book | author=Soetarno, Drs.

The king however, never saw the completion of this grand temple complex, as it finished in 792, long after his death probably around 780. This massive temple complex with total of 249 structures was the grandest of its time, and probably served as the official state's temple that conducted important stately religious ceremonies.<ref>{{Citation|work=Harian Kompas via Youtube|title=Candi Sewu Mandala Suci Manjusrigrha|author1=Gunawan Kartapranata|author2=Septa Inigopatria|author3=Emille Junior|date=2015-04-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riCSpUwgoJQ|access-date=2018-09-08}}</ref>\n\n====The great conqueror====\n[[File:Candi Sewu viewed from the south, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|left|The construction of [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] temple was mentioned in [[Manjusrigrha inscription]], under the auspices of King [[Panangkaran]] and completed during [[Dharanindra]] reign.]]\nThere are some reports that naval Javanese raiders invaded [[T\u0129nh H\u1ea3i qu\u00e2n|Tran-nam]] in 767, [[Champa]] in 774, and Champa again in 787.<ref name=Maspero>{{cite book|author=Maspero, G.|year=2002|title=The Champa Kingdom|location=Bangkok| publisher=White Lotus Co., Ltd.|isbn=9747534991|page=48,166,50}}</ref> The successor of Panangkaran was [[Dharanindra]] (r. 780\u2014800) or commonly known as King Indra. He was mentioned in [[Kelurak inscription]] (dated 782) in his formal reign name Sri Sanggrama Dhananjaya. In this inscription he was hailed as ''Wairiwarawiramardana'' or \"the slayer of courageous enemies\". The similar title also found in [[Ligor inscription|Ligor B inscription]] discovered in Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula; ''Sarwwarimadawimathana'', which suggest it referred to the same person. Dharanindra seems to be a valiant and warlike character, as he embarked on military naval expedition overseas and has brought Sailendras' control on [[Ligor]] in Malay Peninsula.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|91\u201392}}\n\nKing Indra seems to continue the builder tradition of his predecessor. He continued the construction of Manjusrigrha temple ([[Sewu]] complex), and  according to the [[Karangtengah inscription]] (dated 824) responsible for the construction of Venuvana temple, connected to [[Mendut]] or probably [[Ngawen]] temple. He was also probably responsible for the conception and initiation of the construction of [[Borobudur]] and [[Pawon]] temple.\n\nDharanindra ascends as the Maharaja of [[Srivijaya]]. The nature of Sailendras' close relations with the neighbouring Srivijayan empire based on Sumatra is quite uncertain and complicated. It seems that in earlier times, Sailendra family belonged within Srivijayan [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala sphere of influence]]. And for later period of time Sailendras' monarch rose to become the head of Srivijayan mandala. The shift that rendered Sailendras in return to become the ruler of Srivijaya was unclear. Was it led by military campaign by Dharanindra against Srivijaya in Sumatra, or more likely formed by close alliance and kinship between the house of Sailendra and the Maharaja of Srivijaya.\n[[File:LCI.jpg|thumb|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (circa 900 CE) from the Laguna de Bay area in Luzon, the Philippines. The inscription invokes the \"chief\" (''pamegat'') of  \"Mdang\" as one of the authorities in the clearing of a debt owed to the \"chief and commander\" (''pamegat senapati'') of \"[[Tondo (historical polity)|Tundun]]\".]]\nBased on the [[Ligor inscription]], [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription|Laguna copperplate inscription]] and [[Calcutta Stone|Pucangan inscription]], the influence and knowledge of the Medang Kingdom reached as far as [[Bali]], [[Ligor|southern Thailand]], the Indianized kingdoms in the [[Philippines]], and the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] in [[Cambodia]].<ref name=\"Laguna Copperplate Inscription\"/><ref name=\"Ligor inscription\"/><ref name=\"Coed\u00e8s, George 1968\"/>\n\n====The pacifist ruler====\nDharanindra's successor was [[Samaragrawira]] (r. 800\u2014819), mentioned in [[Nalanda inscription]] (dated 860) as the father of [[Balaputradewa]], and the son of ''\u015aailendravamsatilaka'' (the ornament of \u015aailendra family) with stylised name ''\u015ar\u012bviravairimathana'' (the slayer of enemy hero), which refer to Dharanindra.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|92}} Unlike his predecessor the expansive warlike Dharanindra, Samaragrawira seems to be a pacifist, enjoying a peaceful prosperity of interior Java in [[Kedu Plain]], and more interested on completing the Borobudur project. He appointed the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] prince [[Jayavarman II|Jayavarman]] as the governor of [[Indrapura (Khmer)|Indrapura]] in the Mekong delta under Sailendran rule. This decision was proven as a mistake, as Jayavarman later revolted, moved his capital further inland north from [[Tonle Sap]] to [[Mahendraparvata]], severed the link and proclaimed [[Khmer Empire|Cambodian]] independence from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married T\u0101r\u0101, daughter of [[Dharmasetu]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} He was mentioned as his other name Rakai Warak in [[Mantyasih inscription]].\n\nEarlier historians, such as [[N. J. Krom]], and Coedes, tend to equate Samaragrawira and [[Samaratungga]] as the same person.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|92}} However, later historians such as [[Slamet Muljana]] equate Samaratungga with Rakai Garung, mentioned in Mantyasih inscription as the fifth monarch of Mataram kingdom. Which means Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira.\n\n[[Samaratungga]] (r. 819\u2013838) was credited for the completion of massive stone [[mandala]], the grand monument of [[Borobudur]] (completed in 825). Samaratungga just like Samaragrawira, seems to be deeply influenced by peaceful Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and strive to become a pacifist and a benevolent ruler. His successor was Princess [[Pramodhawardhani]] that betrothed to Shivaite [[Rakai Pikatan]], son of the influential Rakai Patapan, a landlord in Central Java. The political move that seems as an effort to secure peace and Sailendran rule on Java by reconciling the Mahayana Buddhist with Shivaist Hindus.\n\nThe rule of Shivaist [[Rakai Pikatan]] (r. 838\u2013850) and his Buddhist queen consort Pramodhawardhani marked the return of the Medang Mataram court favour to Shivaist Hindu,<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} instead of Mahayana Buddhism favoured by previous king Samaratungga. This is evident in the construction of grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound in the Mataram capital, located only few hundred meters south from [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] temple compound. Nevertheless, the inter-religious relations during Pikatan's reign seems to promote tolerance in the spirit of reconciliation. Their reign is credited to the construction and expansion of at least two of perwara temple and [[stupa]] in [[Plaosan]] complex, located east from Sewu (Manjusrigrha) temple. Plaosan temple with twin main temples is probably built and dated from an earlier period, probably started by Panangkaran, Samaragrawira or Samaratungga, but completed during Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani's reign.\n\n====The divide====\n[[File:Ratuboko Gate.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ratu Boko]], a fortified hill, probably referred in [[Shivagrha inscription]] as the location of a battle.]]\n[[Balaputra]] however, opposed the rule of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani. The relations between Balaputra and Pramodhawardhani is interpreted differently by some historians. Older theory according to Bosch and De Casparis holds that Balaputra was the son of Samaratungga, which means he was the younger brother of Pramodhawardhani. Later historians such as Muljana on the other hand, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, which means he was the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.<ref name=\"Srivijaya21\">{{cite book | author=Muljana, Slamet | title=Sriwijaya | publisher=Yogyakarta: LKiS |year=2006 | page=21 | language=Indonesian | isbn=979-8451-62-7}}</ref>\n\nIt is not known whether Balaputra was expelled from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, or was he already ruled in [[Suvarnabhumi|Suvarnadvipa]] (Sumatra). Either ways, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in [[Srivijaya]]n capital of [[Palembang]]. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother\u2014Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in [[Nalanda inscription]] dated 860.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}}\n[[File:Shivagrha Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 778 Saka (856 CE), one of the historical source dated from the Medang Mataram Kingdom.]]\nThe [[Shivagrha inscription]] (dated 856) mentioned about a war challenging Pikatan's reign, the inscription however did not mention who was the enemy that challenged Pikatan's authority. The earlier historians suggests that it was Balaputradewa that rose against Pikatan, however later historians suggest it was another enemy, argued by that time Balaputra already ruled in Srivijaya. The Shivagrha inscription only mentioned that the battle happened in a fortress on a hill protected by bulk of stone walls, this fortress hill is identified with [[Ratu Boko]] archaeological site. The eldest children of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani was Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu. Eventually the revolt was successfully defeated by Pikatan's youngest son\u2014the valiant Dyah Lokapala also known as Rakai Kayuwangi. As the reward for his heroic deed and bravery, the people and many of Pikatan's state advisors urged that Lokapala should be named as crown prince instead of Gurunwangi. Gurunwangi's loss of favour in succession\u2014despite being the eldest sibling, has raised a question among scholars. It was previously thought that the name Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu refer to a female character (princess), although it is more likely that Gurunwangi was a prince.\n\nThis revolt seems to have succeeded in taking over the capital in Mataram for a certain period. After defeating the usurper, Pikatan found that this bloodshed has made the capital in Mataram inauspicious, thus he moved the karaton (court) to Mamrati or Amrati located somewhere in Kedu Plain (Progo river valley), northwest from Mataram.\n\nLater Pikatan decided to abdicate his throne in favour of his youngest son Dyah Lokapala (r. 850\u2014890). Rakai Pikatan retired, renounce worldly affairs and become a hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat. The event also marked with the consecrated ceremony of Shiva image in [[Prambanan]] main temple. Boechari suggests that the enemy that challenged Pikatan was Rakai Walaing pu Kumbhayoni, a powerful Shivaist landlord and also the branch of the ruling dynasty as he claimed as the descendant of a king that ruled Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\">{{cite book |author1=Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro |author2=Nugroho Notosusanto | title=Sejarah Nasional Indonesia: Zaman Kuno | date=2008 | publisher=Balai Pustaka | isbn=978-9794074084 | language=Indonesian |oclc=318053182 }}</ref>{{rp|159}}\n\n====The short peace====\n[[File:Sambirejo, Prambanan, Sleman Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ijo temple|Ijo]], a 10th century Hindu temple located on Ijo Hill Southeast from Prambanan.]]\nThe Medang Mataram kings after [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]]; from Lokapala, Watuhumalang (r. 890\u2014898) and [[Balitung]] are the patrons of Shivaist Hindu, \"after the decline of the power of the Buddhist Sailendras in central Java.\"<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|125\u2013127}} Their reign seems to enjoyed a relative peace. The grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound are continuously expanded and completed with hundreds of perwara (complementary) temples surrounding the main three prasada (tower) of [[Trimurti]] Hindu Gods. It is probably during their reign that some Hindu temples are constructed in the area, such as [[Sambisari]], [[Barong temple|Barong]], [[Ijo temple|Ijo]], [[Kedulan]], [[Kimpulan]], [[Kadisoka]], [[Gebang]] and [[Merak temple]]. Barong and Ijo temples in particular are interesting, for they are built on the hill and has different layout compared to earlier temples. Sewu and Prambanan temples are arranged in concentric mandala layout. Barong and Ijo temples however, are arranged in completely different way; the main temple is located in further back of the compound on the most higher ground, while the perwara complementary temples are built in front of the main temple on the lower ground, the layout corresponds to the uneven topography of the site. This style of temple layout is most likely the predecessor and will be continued in the later East Javanese temple architecture.\n\nKing Pikatan, Lokapala (Rakai Kayuwangi), and Watuhumalang ruled from their court in Mamrati or Amrati, they are known as \"Amrati Kings\". The exact location of Mamrati is unknown, suggested somewhere in [[Kedu Plain]] (modern day [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung regencies]]), located north from Mataram along [[Progo River]] valley. It was suggested that Amrati might be located near the location of Wanua Tengah III inscription, in Kedunglo hamlet, Kaloran village, within [[Temanggung Regency]].\n\nAfter absent for several generations, the name \"Mataram\" reappears in Javanese inscription during the reign of Balitung, which probably signify the transfer of capital. King Balitung moved his capital from Amrati to Poh Pitu, and renamed Poh Pitu as Yawapura. Again the exact location of this capital is unknown, probably also located within Kedu Plain. However, it is highly possible that Poh Pitu was located around the Poh inscription (905), in Dumpoh hamlet, Potrobangsan [[Villages of Indonesia|village]], North Magelang district within [[Magelang]] city. Balitung productively issued several inscriptions, among others are Telahap inscription (dated 11 September 899), Watukura inscription (27 July 902), Telang (11 January 904), Poh (17 July 905), Kubu-Kubu (17 October 905),  Mantyasih (11 April 907), and Rukam (907).\n\nOur current knowledge of the names of kings that reign the Medang Mataram kingdom is much owed to [[Mantyasih inscription]] (dated 907), issued by King [[Balitung]] (r. 898\u2014910)\u2014that contains genealogy and the reign order of Medang Mataram kings, and he seek ancestor as far as King Sanjaya. This inscription is also known as \"Balitung charter\". The motivation of Balitung's edict has sparked various assumptions from historians\u2014as if Balitung eagerly seeks legitimacy of his rule, by stating his ancestral lineage. It is highly possible that he related to the royal family and shared common ancestry. Thus, suggested that he married to the daughter of previous king, which made him the royal son in-law as well as heir.\n\nThe Watukura inscription (902) is the oldest inscription in Javanese statecraft that mentioned the position of Rakryan Kanuruhan (Prime Minister), while the position of Rakryan Mapatih\u2014which in Balitung's era is equivalent to [[crown prince]], was held by Mpu Daksa. The relation between Balitung and his successor Daksha is quite problematic, as historians suggested Daksha was the son of previous king (Watuhumalang), while the court was held by Balitung who is probably Dakhsa's brother in-law. The Telang inscription, dated 11 January 904, revealed the development of the port complex of Paparahuan which was led by Rakai Welar Mpu Sudarsana, located on the bank of [[Solo River|Bengawan Solo river]]. By building port and ferry crossing in navigable Bengawan Solo, might signify the growing interest in maritime trade, thus the court interest has shifted eastward.\n\nThe Kubu-Kubu inscription (17 October 905) revealed the village Kubu-kubu was awarded to Rakryan Hujung Dyah Mangarak and Rakryan Matuha Dyah Majawuntan in recognition of their valor on conquering Bantan. The toponym of Bantan is unclear, it might be corresponds to the 10th century site of [[Banten Girang]] in present-day [[Banten]] province of western Java, or might be other place. While other historians speculated that Bantan might be an alternative name to [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. In old Javanese, the term Bantan means \"sacrifice\" which often used interchangeably with Bali that means \"offering\".\n[[File:Sajiwan main.JPG|thumb|left|[[Sajiwan]] Buddhist temple, linked to Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana or Sri Kahulunnan.]]\nThe Mantyasih inscription (11 April 907) revealed the gifts awarded to five junior ''patihs'' (officials) for their service on maintained peace during Balitung's wedding. Also in 907, in Rukam inscription, Balitung offers that the Sima taxes being collected from the village of Rukam to be allocated for the construction and maintenance of a temple dedicated to his grandmother, Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana. The temple mentioned here is [[Sajiwan]] Buddhist temple, located not far south from Prambanan, probably was built during the end of Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala) reign and completed in Balitung's reign. The temple is dedicated to Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana, linked to Sri Kahulunnan, another name of queen [[Pramodhawardhani]]. This temple probably was a mortuary temple dedicated as ''pedharmaan'' (dedication) for the deceased queen mother.\n\nThe rivalry between Balitung and Daksha was probably a result of the previous contest of succession between Rakai Gurunwangi and Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala)\u2014both are descendants of Rakai Pikatan. During the rule of his brother-in-law\u2014Balitung, Mpu Daksa held the position as Rakai Hino, according to Taji Gunung inscription (dated 21 December 910), that mentioned about the partition of Taji Gunung area between him and Rakai Gurunwangi. It seems that Rakai Gurunwangi allied himself with his nephew Daksha. Historian Boechari is certain that the reign of Balitung was ended as the result of Mpu Daksha's rebellion. According to Taji Gunung inscription (910) Daksha was still as Rakai Hino, while in the stele of Timbangan Wungkal (913) he already ascended to the throne as the king. Although the kingdom also enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, after King Balitung, it seems that the construction of grand temples are decreased in both quality and quantity.\n\nDaksha ruled over the centre and the east portions of Java.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|127}} King Daksha (r. 910\u2014919) and his successor King [[Tulodong]] (r. 919\u2014924) also ruled from Poh Pitu. The next monarch, King [[Wawa of Mataram|Wawa]] (r. 924\u2014929) returned the capital back from Poh Pitu to Mataram. The [[Minto Stone|Sanggurah inscription]] (dated 2 August 928)\u2014found in [[Malang]] area in East Java is particularly interesting, since it mentioned about the deed of Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa) that granted the Sima status to the land in and around the source of Brantas river in present-day Batu and Malang area. This means that during the reign of Wawa, the kingdom has expanded eastward by establishing settlements (Sima lands) along the river Bengawan Solo and [[Brantas River|Brantas]].\n\n===Moving eastward===\n[[File:Prambanan Java243.jpg|thumb|right|Towering [[Mount Merapi|Merapi volcano]] overlooking [[Prambanan]] prasad tower. It was suggested that Merapi volcanic eruption had devastated Mataram capital, forcing them to relocate in the east.]]\nAround the year 929, the centre of the kingdom was shifted from Central Java to East Java by [[Mpu Sindok]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|128}} who established the [[Isyana Dynasty]]. The exact cause of the move is still uncertain. Historians have proposed various possible causes; from natural disaster, epidemic outbreak, politics and power struggle, to religious or economic motives.\n\nAccording to van Bemmelen's theory, which was supported by Prof. Boechari a severe eruption of [[Mount Merapi]] volcano probably has caused the move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\">{{cite news |title = Merapi and the demise of the Mataram kingdom |date = 13 June 2006 |author = Handewi Soegiharto |newspaper = The Jakarta Post |url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/13/merapi-and-demise-mataram-kingdom.html |accessdate = 31 August 2015}}</ref> Historians suggest that, some time during the reign of King [[Wawa of Mataram]] (924\u2014929), Merapi volcano erupted and devastated the kingdom's capital in Mataram. The historic massive volcano eruption is popularly known as ''Pralaya Mataram'' (the debacle of Mataram). The evidence for this eruption can be seen in several temples that were virtually buried under Merapi's [[lahar]] and volcanic debris, such as the [[Sambisari]], Morangan, Kedulan, [[Kadisoka]] and [[Kimpulan]] temples.\n[[File:Sambisari 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sambisari]] temple buried five metres under volcanic debris of [[Mount Merapi]].]]\n\nArcheologist Agus Aris Munandar proposed a hypothesis, that the move was caused by a religious motives. He mentions that the incessant eruptions of Mount Merapi has caused the kingdom to move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> Pointing out that in ancient Javanese beliefs, Merapi was considered as the [[Mount Meru|Mahameru]] for the people in the ancient Mataram. According to Hindu teachings, the Mahameru peak symbolises the centre of the universe, the sacred realm where the gods live. Since their Mahameru in Central Java continued to erupt, they decided to move, but they still looked for another Mahameru. As East Java was still part of Mataram territory, it is possible that some of the people informed the Central Java kingdom that there was another Mahameru in the east. He suggests that the new sacred mountain was [[Mount Penanggungan]] in East Java, which resembles Mahameru.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis proposed by N.J. Krom says that the demise was caused by an epidemic break-out, forcing people to seek a new place to live.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> On the other hand, B. Schrieke says the move was caused by economic reasons; the vigorous temple construction boom during the era of Sailendran kings has put a tremendous economic burden upon the peasant. People were suffering as they were forced to build grand temples by the kings, instead of working their farms. Slowly they moved to the east to avoid the kings' orders.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nA power struggle is also proposed as the cause of the move. Coedes suggested that the move to East Java was probably in response to the Buddhist [[Sailendra]]s.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|79,90}} This theory is inline with the one proposed by J.G. de Casparis which suggests, that the shift of capital city eastward was to avoid a Srivijaya invasion from Sumatra.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nHowever, it was most likely motivated by economic reasons. De Casparis then expands his theory, saying that the location of the kingdom in Central Java was less accessible than East Java. The [[Brantas]] river valley was considered to be a strategic location, as the river provides easy access to reach ports on East Java's north coast and [[Java Sea]], strategic for the control of maritime trade routes to the eastern parts of archipelago, being especially vital for control of the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] spice trade. This is in contrast with Mataram's Kedu and Kewu Plain that relatively isolated from the north coast of Central Java. Despite its fertility, ideal for rice agricultural kingdom, the Mataram Plain is quite isolated, its northern borders are protected by natural barrier of Merapi, Merbabu, Sumbing, Sundoro, Dieng and Ungaran volcanoes. Ideal for inward-looking agricultural polity, but insufficient to develop a maritime trading kingdom.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nThe recent studies suggest, that the move eastward was not an abrupt event. During the Mataram period in Central Java, the kingdom most likely already expanded eastward and established settlements along Brantas river in East Java. It was more likely that the move was done in gradual manner over long period. The cause of the move was also motivated from multiple factors; either natural, economy or politics. The Sanggurah inscription or popularly known as the \"[[Minto Stone]]\", dated to 982 \u2014 found in [[Malang]], East Java in early 19th century \u2014 mentions the name of a Javanese king, Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa Wijayaloka<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Verhandelingen van Het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen|volume=60|year=1913| title=Oud-Javaansche Oorkonden.

This suggests that even during the reign of King Wawa, the Malang region in East Java already belongs within the realm of Medang Kingdom. The inscription contains elements about the shift of power that consequently took place to East Java.<ref>{{cite book|page=55|title=Handbook of Oriental Studies. Part 3|author=de Longh, R.C.|year=1977| publisher=Brill}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the true reasons behind the move of political centre from Central to East Java, this event marked the end of an era profoundly. Indeed, the temple-building activity has decreased since the era of King Balitung in scale, quality and quantity, and yet the Eastern Java period of Medang kingdom leave no tangible traces of any temple structure comparable to those of the previous Central Javanese Sailendra era. It seems that the kingdom no longer has the intention and the resource to embark on a grand scale construction project.\n\n====Establishing the eastern country====\n[[File:Anjuk Ladang Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Anjukladang inscription]] (937), issued by King Sindok during his power consolidation in East Java.]]\nAccording to [[Turyan inscription]] (dated 929), [[Mpu Sindok|Sindok]] moved the capital to Tamwlang and later moved it again to Watugaluh. Historian identify those names with the Tambelang and Megaluh area near modern [[Jombang Regency|Jombang]], East Java. Although Sindok establishes a new dynasty, the [[Isyana dynasty]] named after his daughter, Sindok seems to be closely related to the royal house of Medang Mataram, thus he can be viewed as the continuation of a long line of Javanese Kings lineage stretched from [[Sri Sanjaya|King Sanjaya]]. During his reign Sindok created quite a number of inscriptions, most are related to the establishment of ''Sima'' lands; these inscriptions are among others; Linggasutan (929), Gulung-Gulung (929), Cunggrang (929), Jru-Jru (930), Waharu (931), Sumbut (931), Wulig (935), and [[Anjuk Ladang inscription|Anjukladang]] (937). Most of these inscription mentioned about the establishment of ''Sima'' or ''Swatantra'' lands. This signify that Sindok seems to consolidated his authority over East Java as collections of villages are declared as ''Sima'' lands, which means the settlements have developed wet rice cultivation and can be taxed and swore allegiance as part of Sindok's kingdom.\n\nThe [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 in particular is interesting, because it stated the ''Sima'' status is awarded to Anjukladang village and a temple is erected in recognition of their service on repelling the invading forces from Malayu. The temple mentioned here is probably the Candi Lor made of bricks which is now in ruins, located in Candirejo village in [[Nganjuk Regency]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://museumanjukladang.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/prasasti-anjukladang/|title=Prasasti Anjukladang|date=2016-02-13|work=Museum Anjuk Ladang|access-date=2018-05-21|language=id-ID}}</ref> The mentioning of invading ''Malayu'' forces refer to the old name of Sumatran Malayu Kingdom, which probably means [[Srivijaya]] instead. This means the relations between East Javanese Medang kingdom with Srivijaya has badly deteriorated to the state of hostility.\n\n====Expansion to Bali====\n[[File:Buddha Manjucri from Goa Raja cave Bali.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjushri]] from [[Goa Gajah]] cave, Bali, demonstrated the influence of Javanese Medang Mataram Sailendran art.]]\nSindok was succeeded by his daughter [[Isyana Tunggawijaya]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} According to [[Gedangan inscription]] (dated 950), Queen Isyana married to Sri Lokapala, a nobleman from [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. She later succeeded by her son [[Makutawangsa Wardhana]] c. 985. According to [[Pucangan inscription]] (dated 1041), King Makutawangsa Wardhana has a daughter named [[Mahendradatta]], Makutawangsa Wardhana was replaced by his son [[Dharmawangsa|Dharmawangsa Tguh]] c. 990s.\n\nA later king, [[Dharmawangsa]], moved the capital again to Wwatan, identified as the Wotan area near modern [[Madiun]]. Dharmawangsa's sister, [[Mahendradatta]] later would be betrothed to a Balinese king [[Udayana Warmadewa]]. This report indicated that somehow [[Bali]] had been absorbed into the Medang Kingdom's mandala sphere of influence, probably as vassal. In literature development, King Dharmawangsa also ordered the translation of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' into [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]] in 996.\n\n===Collapse===\nIn the late 10th century, the rivalry between the Sumatran Srivijaya and Javanese Mataram became more hostile.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|130}} The animosity was probably caused by the Srivijayan effort to reclaim Sailendra lands in Java, as [[Balaputra]] and his offspring&nbsp;\u2014 a new dynasty of Srivijaya [[maharaja]]s&nbsp;\u2014 belonged to the Sailendra dynasty, or by Medang aspirations to challenge Srivijaya dominance as the regional power. Previously the [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 mentioned about infiltration attack from Malayu which refer to a Srivijayan attack.\n\n====War against Srivijaya====\n[[File:032 Avadana Level 1, Ship and Crew.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Borobudur ship|Javanese vessel]] depicted in Borobudur.

The news of Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese accounts from Song period. In 988, an envoy from ''San-fo-qi'' (Srivijaya) was sent to Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourned for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country has been attacked by ''She-po'' (Java) thus made him unable to return home. In 992 the envoy from ''She-po'' (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with Srivijaya. In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed Chinese Emperor for the protection of China against Javanese invaders.<ref name=\"Kulke\">{{cite book |title=Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions to Southeast Asia, Volume 1 of Nalanda-Sriwijaya series |editor=Hermann Kulke |editor2=K Kesavapany |editor3=Vijay Sakhuja |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2009 |isbn= 9789812309372 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2swhCXJVRzwC&dq=Dharmawangsa+Srivijaya+envoy+China}}</ref>{{rp|229}}\n\nDharmawangsa's invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]] to seek protection from China.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|141}} Srivijayan Maharaja, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa was an able and astute ruler, with shrewd diplomatic skills. In the midst of crisis brought by Javanese invasion, he secured Chinese political support by appeasing the Chinese Emperor. In 1003, a Song historical record reported that the envoy of ''San-fo-qi'' dispatched by the king Sri Cudamani Warmadewa, informed that a Buddhist temple had been erected in their country to pray for the long life of Chinese Emperor, thus asked the emperor to give the name and the bell for this temple which was built in his honor. Rejoiced, the Chinese Emperor named the temple ''Ch'eng-t'en-wan-shou'' ('ten thousand years of receiving blessing from heaven, which is China) and a bell was immediately cast and sent to Srivijaya to be installed in the temple.<ref name=\"Kulke\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nAfter 16 years of war, in 1006, Srivijaya managed to repelled the Medang invaders and liberated Palembang. This attack opened the eyes of the Srivijayan Maharaja to how dangerous the Medang kingdom could be, and he planned to destroy his new Javanese nemesis.\n\n====Mahapralaya====\n[[File:Java, predating Nganjuk style, 10th century - Bodhisattva Padmapani - 1967.149 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddhist bronze figure depicting Boddhisattva Padmapani, 10th-century dated from late period of Medang Kingdom.]]\nIn retaliation, in 1016-1017, Srivijaya forces assisted Haji (king) Wurawari to revolt.

This sudden and unexpected attack took place during the wedding ceremony of Dharmawangsa's daughter, which rendered the court unprepared and shocked.\n\nThis calamity was recorded in Javanese account as the ''pralaya'' (the debacle) the death of the Mataram kingdom.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|144}} With the death of Dharmawangsa and the fall of the capital, under military pressure from Srivijaya, the kingdom finally collapsed and fell to chaos. With the absence of Medang paramount ruler, warlords in regional provinces and settlements in central and east Java rebelled and break loose from the central Medang government and forming their own polities serving local dynasties. Raids and robbery were rampant ravaging the country. There was further unrest and violence several years after the kingdom's demise.\n\n[[Airlangga]], a son of King [[Udayana Warmadewa]] of [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]] and Queen [[Mahendradatta]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} also a nephew of slain King Dharmawangsa, managed to escape the destruction and went into exile in [[Wonogiri|Vanagiri]] forest in interior Central Java. He later rallied popular support, reunited the remnants of the Medang Kingdom and re-established the kingdom (including Bali) under the name of [[Kingdom of Kahuripan]] in 1019. The Kingdom of Kahuripan can be considered as the successor state of Medang, and from this point on, the kingdom was known as [[Kahuripan]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|144\u2013147}} with its capital located near Brantas river estuarine, somewhere around modern Surabaya, Sidoarjo or Pasuruan in East Java.\n\n==The Dynasty==\n\n=== The dual dynasties theory ===\n{{Main|Sanjaya Dynasty}}\nBosch  in his book ''\"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\"'' (1952) suggested that king Sanjaya was the progenitor of the [[Sanjaya Dynasty]], and there was two dynasties that ruled Central Java; the Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and the Shivaist Sanjaya dynasty.<ref>Dr. Bosch, \"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\", 1952.</ref> The inscription also states that Sanjaya was an ardent follower of [[Shaivism]]. From its founding in the early 8th century until 928, the kingdom was ruled by the Sanjaya dynasty. The first king was Sanjaya, who ruled in the Mataram region in the vicinity of modern Yogyakarta and Prambanan, and left the written records on the Canggal inscription. However, around the mid 8th century, the [[Sailendra]] dynasty emerged in Central Java and challenged Sanjaya domination in the region.\n\nThe prevailing historical interpretation holds that the Sailendra dynasty co-existed next to the Sanjaya dynasty in Central Java, and much of the period was characterised by peaceful co-operation. The Sailendra, with their strong connections to [[Srivijaya]], managed to gain control of Central Java and become overlords of the ''Rakai'' (local Javanese lords), including the Sanjayas, thus making the Sanjaya kings of Mataram their [[vassal]]s. Little is known about the kingdom due to the dominance of the Sailendra, who during this period constructed [[Borobudur]], a Buddhist monument. [[Samaratungga]], the monarch of the Sailendra, tried to secure the Sailendra position in Java, cementing an alliance with the Sanjayas by arranging the marriage of his daughter [[Pramodhawardhani]] with [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]].\n\nAround the middle of the 9th century, relations between the Sanjaya and the Sailendra deteriorated. In 852, the Sanjaya ruler, Pikatan, defeated [[Balaputra]], the offspring of the Sailendra monarch Samaratunga and the princess Tara. This ended the Sailendra presence in Java; Balaputra retreated to the Srivijayan capital in [[Sumatra]], where he became the paramount ruler.<ref>cf. De Casparis, 1956; Hall, 1985:111</ref> The victory of Pikatan was recorded in [[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 856, created by Rakai Kayuwangi, Pikatan's successor.\n\n=== The single dynasty theory ===\n[[File:Borobudur relief 1.jpg|thumb|right|The scene of the Javanese court depicted in Borobudur bas relief]]\n{{Main|Sailendra Dynasty}}\nHowever, this dual Sailendra\u2014Sanjaya dynasties theory proposed by Bosch and De Casparis was opposed by some Indonesian historians in later period. An alternate theory, proposed by [[Poerbatjaraka]], suggests there was only one kingdom and one dynasty, the kingdom called Medang, with the capital in the Mataram area (thus the name of the kingdom: ''\"Medang i Bhumi Mataram\"''), and the ruling dynasty being the [[Sailendra]].\n\nThis theory is supported with Boechari interpretation on [[Sojomerto inscription]] and Poerbatjaraka study on [[Carita Parahyangan]] manuscript, Poerbatjaraka holds that Sanjaya and all of his offspring belongs to the Sailendra family, which initially was [[Shivaist]] Hindu. However, according to [[Raja Sankhara inscription]] (now missing); Sanjaya's son, Panangkaran, converted to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. And because of that conversion, the later series of Sailendra kings who ruled Medang become Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists also and gave Buddhism royal patronage in Java until the end of Samaratungga's reign.<ref>Poerbatjaraka, 1958: 254\u2013264</ref> The Shivaist Hindus regained royal patronage with the reign of Pikatan, which lasted until the end of the Medang Kingdom. During the reign of Kings Pikatan and [[Balitung]], the royal Hindu [[Trimurti]] temple of [[Prambanan]] was built and expanded in the vicinity of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]].\n\n== Government and economy ==\nThe complex stratified ancient Javan society, with its refined aesthetic taste in art and culture, is evidenced through the various scenes in narrative [[bas-relief]]s carved on various temples dated from the Medang era.\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Hindu Temple in Java, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prambanan]] pr\u0101s\u0101da (towers) viewed from [[Ratu Boko]] hill, the area in [[Prambanan Plain]] was the location of the Mataram capital]] \nDuring this period the common concept of [[city]], as it known in Europe, Middle East or China, as the urban concentration centre of politics, administration, religious and economic activities, was not quite established yet in ancient Java. The proper urban development as a city took place later in 13th century [[Majapahit]]'s [[Trowulan]].\n\nThe capital itself is more likely refer to the [[palace]], a walled compound called ''pura'' in Sanskrit, or in local [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as ''karaton'' or ''kadatwan'', this is where the king and his family reside and rule his court. The palace itself is more of a collection of ''[[pendopo]]'' style pavilions surrounded by walls. These pavilions and halls are made from organic wooden and thatched materials, so they had decayed over centuries leaving only stone walls, gates, terraces and bases. The example of this type of secular buildings can be found in [[Ratu Boko]] compound. The Javanese urban centre in this period did not recognise walled-city as it found in Chinese or Indian counterparts, the only walled, well-guarded and protected compound was the king's palace and temple compound. The ''nagara'' or capital itself was more of a collection of densely populated villages surrounding the ''pura'' (king's palace).\n\nThe religious activity centres, which refer to the location of where the temples stood, did not necessarily signify the administrative or economic centre as well. As according to inscriptions, numbers of lands has been awarded a ''Sima'' status with portion or the whole of its rice tax revenue was allocated to funding the construction and maintaining the temple. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that the [[Prambanan Plain]] with high concentration of temples located just few hundred meters away from each other \u2014 [[Sambisari]], [[Kalasan]], [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Lumbung]], [[Prambanan]], [[Plaosan]], [[Sajiwan]], [[Banyunibo]], [[Ratuboko]], Barong and Ijo temples \u2014 was might be the location of the capital of Mataram. Other expert argued that the Prambanan area was indeed the religious centre of the kingdom, but was not the administrative centre, while suggesting other location in [[Muntilan]] as the possible political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\">{{cite book|last=Degroot|first=V\u00e9ronique|title=Candi, Space and Landscape: A Study on the Distribution, Orientation and Spatial Organization of Central Javanese Temple Remains |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2HzduME8OcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=85 |location=Leiden|publisher=Sidestone Press, Issue 38 of Mededelingen van het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde |isbn=978-9088900396}}</ref>\n\nMost of the time, the court of the Medang Kingdom was located in Mataram, possibly located somewhere in Muntilan or the [[Prambanan Plain]] near modern [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]. However, during the reign of Rakai Pikatan, the court was moved to Mamrati. Later, in the reign of Balitung, the court moved again, this time to Poh Pitu. Unlike Mataram, historians have been unable to pinpoint the possible locations of Mamrati and Poh Pitu, although most historians agree that both were located in the [[Kedu Plain]], somewhere around the modern [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] or [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung]] regencies. Later expert suggests that the area in Secang, on the upper Progo river valley in northern Magelang Regency \u2014 with relatively high temple density \u2014 was possibly the secondary political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\"/> In later Eastern Java period, other centres were mentioned; such as Tamwlang and Watugaluh (near Jombang), also Wwatan (near [[Madiun]]).\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Sailendra King and Queen, Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|The bas relief of 8th century [[Borobudur]] depict the scene in royal court.]]\nDuring this period the administration level of Javanese polity was only consists of two levels; the central government level centred in king's court, and the ''wanua'' or village level took form of settlements scattered around within kingdom's realm. The palace where the King resided was mentioned as ''kadatwan'' or ''karaton'', the court was the centre of kingdom's administration. The ''wanua'' or village is more likely took shape of an \"island\" filled with housings and orchards in the middle of vast [[rice paddies]], this village layout still can be found in modern Javanese ''desa''.\n\nThe King was regarded as the paramount ruler or ''[[chakravartin]]'', where the highest power and authority lies. He ruled the ''nagara'' or ''kadatwan'' which means the kingdom, from his ''puri'' (palace or walled compound). Under the king, there are state officials that serve to forward the king's laws and orders. They are using the title of ''Rakai'' or ''Samget''. The ''Rakais'' ruled an administrative unit called '' watak'' that formed from the collection of several villages or ''wanua''. ''Rakai'' can be considered as regional [[landlord]] or the [[landed gentry]], that rule a large collection of villages. The ''rakais'' transmit the king's order to the ''Rama'' or village leaders that rules their own domain called ''karaman'' or ''watak''. As the kingdom grew larger and complex, entering the 10th century during the reign of [[Balitung]], series of state officials are added to add hierarchy levels.<ref>{{cite book| author=Rahardjo, Supratikno |title= Peradaban Jawa, Dinamika Pranata Politik, Agama, dan Ekonomi Jawa Kuno | date=2002 | publisher=Komuntas Bambu, Jakarta | language=Indonesian |page=111 | isbn=979-96201-1-2}}</ref>\n\nMost of the inscriptions dated from Medang Mataram period are related to the establishment of ''sima'' lands. This signify the formation and expansion of Javanese agricultural villages in the region during this period. Either by opening a forest or converting a ''ladang'' (dry rice cultivation) to ''sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). A ''sima'' is an arable [[wet rice]] agricultural land with rice surpluses available for taxation, and officially recognised through royal edict. Most of these ''sima'' lands are ruled by regional ''rakai'' or ''samget'' (landed gentry) in their realm. By acquiring prestigious ''sima'' status from the king, a ''watak'' regional unit held a higher prestige compared to non-''sima'' settlements, yet this also means acknowledging the kingdom's overlordship over their land and swore their allegiance to the king. The Rakais that rule the land are granted a royal permission to collect tax, yet some parts of these tax should be regularly paid to the king's court (central government in the capital). In some instance, some of these ''sima'' inscription stated that this ''sima'' land has become a tax-free land, in exchange that the rice harvest surpluses collected from this land are used to construct or maintain a religious building. This means the ''rakai'' that traditionally ruled this lands no longer has the right to collect the tax, or at least reducing their tax earnings.\n\nOther than their administrative and military-defense function, the king and the royal family is also known as the patron of arts and also religious piousness. The king, the royal family and the kingdom's officials had the authority to launch public projects, such as irrigation works or temple construction. The royal art and religious patronage can be seen in sponsoring temples constructions. The kingdom left behind several temples and monuments. The most notable ones are Borobudur, Prambanan, [[Sewu]], and the [[Plaosan]] temple compound.\n\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebf op de Borobudur TMnr 10027564.jpg|thumb|left|The bas-relief in 8th century [[Borobudur]] depicting rice agriculture in ancient Java]]\nThe common people of Medang mostly made a living in agriculture, especially as [[rice]] farmers, however, some may have pursued other careers, such as hunter, trader, artisan, weaponsmith, sailor, soldier, dancer, musician, food or drink vendor, etc. Rich portrayals of daily life in 9th century Java can be seen in many temple bas-reliefs. Rice cultivation had become the base for the kingdom's economy where the villages throughout the realm relied on their annual rice yield to pay taxes to the court. Exploiting the fertile volcanic soil of Central Java and the intensive wet rice cultivation (''sawah'') enabled the population to grow significantly, which contributed to the availability of labour and workforce for the state's public projects. Certain villages and lands were given the status as ''sima'' lands awarded through royal edict written in inscriptions. The rice yields from ''sima'' lands usually were allocated for the maintenance of certain religious buildings.\n\n[[File:Javanese gold mas or tahil ingot.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Earliest evidence of a [[currency]] system in Java. Javanese [[gold]] ''mas'' or ''tahil'' ingots, circa the 9th century.]]\n\nThe economic activity was also not solely centred in a single marketplace in the capital city. It is most likely that the marketplace was rotated in daily basis within a week among participating villages, in a Javanese system called ''pasaran''. This system still can be found in rural Javanese villages, before most are turned into a permanent marketplace as it is commonly found today. The economic trading practice in these marketplace are most likely done in [[barter]] as well as using money, as during this period, Javanese economy has been partly monetised.\n\nThe bas-reliefs from temples of this period, especially from [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] describe occupations and careers other than agricultural pursuit; such as soldiers, government officials, court servants, massage therapists, travelling musicians and dancing troupe, food and drink sellers, logistics courier, sailors, merchants, even thugs and robbers are depicted in everyday life of 9th century Java. These occupations requires economic system that employs [[currency]]. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]], golden artefacts discovered in 1990, revealed gold coins in shape similar to corn seeds, which suggests that 9th century Javan economy is partly monetised. On the surface of the gold coins engraved with a script ''\"ta\"'', a short form of ''\"tail\"'' or ''\"tahil\"'' a unit of currency in ancient Java.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Society ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf Borobudur TMnr 60042617.jpg|thumb|upright|A nobleman accompanied by his entourage and servants, a bas-relief of Borobudur.]]\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Detail van reli\u00ebf O 105 op de verborgen voet van de Borobudur TMnr 10015664.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Buddhist]] hermit meditating in secluded forest, Borobudur bas-relief.]]\nA complex and stratified society of ancient Javanese people and their social order can be seen through studies on the rich portrayal in bas-reliefs from this period, as well as inscription studies. The kingdom had developed a complex society; which characterised by heterogeneity of their society, inequality of social stratification, and the formation of national administrative institution in their kingdom.<ref name=\"Peradaban35\"/> The ancient Javanese did recognise the Hindu ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|catur varna]]'' or [[caste]] social classes; [[Brahmana]] (priests), [[Kshatriya]] (kings, warlords and nobles), [[Vaishya]] (traders and artisans), and [[Shudra]] (servants and slaves). Nevertheless, the social stratification system in ancient Java slightly differ from those of India, as it less rigid.<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=49\u201350 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n\nPigeaud divides ancient Javanese society into four classes: the ruling class, religious authority, commoners, and slaves.<ref>Pigeaud, 1958: 195</ref> While de Casparis suggest; although the ancient Javanese society recognise caste differences, their rules and implementations was less rigid compared to those caste system in India.

They wore luxurious clothing of ''kain'' long clothes wrapped around their hips to the ankle, waistband, and [[sash]] either wore around their hips as ''sampur'', or wore around their body hanging from left shoulder to the hip. Adorned with intricate golden jewelries such as ''jamang'' (forehead ornaments), ''makuta'' (crown), earrings, ''kelat bahu'' ([[armlet]]), necklace, ''upavita'' (body ornament of golden chains wore across the chest), bracelets, rings, ankle bracelet. The gods and divinities also portrayed in similar fashion as nobles, although they are described as having ''prabhamandala'' (divine [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]) around their head.\n# '''The royal servants''' or '''lower-ranked nobles''', they are king's servants, entourages or royal attendants. They occupied positions as ''dayang-dayang'' (female royal attendants), guard or state officials. They wore long cloth around their hips to the ankle, and wore jewelries and ornaments too, such as earrings, necklace and bracelets, although not as complete and luxurious as those worn by the king and the nobles.\n# '''The priests''', the [[brahmin]]s, Buddhist monks, or those religious figures employed in temples or monasteries. They usually wore robes or cloaks called ''sinhel''. Buddhist monks were usually portrayed as bald men wore robe with open right shoulder, while brahmins were usually depicted as bearded men wearing [[turbans]]. \n# '''The commoners''', the majority of the people, mostly described as villagers. They wore simple clothing of around their hips, the lower end sometimes being tied upward to create a short [[loincloth]]. Usually they wore no jewelry or ornaments, but some wore a few simple ornaments, including necklaces or bracelets, or a rope worn as a waistband.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple]]\n\n[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are the two religions adhered by the rulers and people of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the commoners' religious practices were probably still mixed with native [[shamanism]] and indigenous pre-Dharmic beliefs. Since the beginning of its formation, the Medang Mataram kings seemed to favour [[Shivaist]] Hinduism, such as the construction of [[linga]] in Gunung Wukir Hindu temple as mentioned in Canggal inscription by king Sanjaya. However, during the reign of [[Panangkaran]], [[Mahayana]] Buddhism began to blossomed and gain court favour. The [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and the magnificent [[Borobudur]] temples testify the Buddhist renaissance in Central Java. The court patronage on Buddhism spanned from the reign of Panangkaran to [[Samaratungga]]. During the reign of Pikatan, Shivaist Hinduism began to regain court's favour, signified by the construction of grand Shivagrha (Prambanan).\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Mahadewa in de Lara Djonggrang hindoe-tempel te Prambanan TMnr 60033679.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shiva]] statue in main chamber of [[Prambanan]].]]\nThe kingdom recognised the religious authority of priest class, the [[brahmin]]s. Buddhism was also well represented through the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] Buddhist monastic community, consists of [[Buddhist monks]] living in [[vihara]]s such as Sari and Plaosan and gaining court patronage. These Hindu and Buddhist religious authorities conducted state's and regional religious rituals and ceremonies in the temples. The ruling class of [[kshatriya]] royal family also indulged in spiritualism. Some monarch seems to immerse themselves in spiritualism and religion. For example, King Panangkaran seems to be deeply influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and even strive to become a hermit during his later days. Numbers of other kings such as Samaragrawira and Samaratungga was also deeply influenced by Buddhism and strive to become a benevolent leaders. Rakai Pikatan also abdicated and renounced worldly affairs during his old days and become a [[rishi]] hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat.\n\nThe period between the reign of King Panangkaran to the reign of King Balitung (late 8th century to the early 10th century) saw a fervent temple construction in the kingdom. This was probably motivated either by religious zeal, kingdom's immense wealth and resources or social-political reasons. Some historians such as Munoz suggest, that this ardent temple construction projects was actually a religious-political tool to control the regional ''Rakai'' landlords, to prevent them from rebelling against the king.<ref>{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |doi= |pages= |isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}</ref> During this time, each of regional ''watak'' are ruled by ''Rakai'' landlords that nurturing their own dynasty. By appointing the Rakais' ''sima'' land to fund the construction and maintenance of a ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' religious building, the Maharaja depriving the Rakais' ability to collect large sum of tax, that can be potentially misused to fund some army that might rose to challenge the Maharaja's authority. The Rakais might be willingly or reluctantly compliant to the king's will, for refusing to construct religious building might harm their reputation, and cast them not only as the enemy of the king, but also as the enemy of gods or Buddha.\n\n=== Art and Architecture ===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Wonoboyo Hoard.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] displays the immense wealth and artistic achievement of the Medang kingdom.]]\nOther than examining bas-reliefs carved on the temple's walls, the study of ancient Javanese society is also conducted through archaeological relics. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] golden artefacts attest to the wealth, art, and culture as well as the aesthetic achievement of the Medang Kingdom. The artefacts show the intricate artwork and technical mastery of the ancient Javanese [[goldsmith]].

Almost 50 years later the oldest Buddhist temple was built in Prambanan region, the Buddhist [[Kalasan]] temple, linked to [[Kalasan inscription]] (778 CE) and King [[Panangkaran]]. From this time, the kingdom saw exuberant temple construction projects, such as [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Lumbung]], [[Ngawen]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and peaked in the construction of [[Borobudur]], the massive stone [[mandala]], that took shape of a mountain temple pinnacled with [[stupa]]s that completed c. 825 CE.\n\n[[File:Prambanan Shiva Temple.jpg|thumb|left|The magnificent 9th century Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]], [[Yogyakarta]], was a major Hindu monument in the kingdom of Medang.]]\n\nThe monumental Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]] in the vicinity of Yogyakarta&nbsp;\u2014 initially built during the reign of King Pikatan (838\u2014850), and expanded continuously through the reign of Lokapala (850\u2014890) to [[Balitung]] (899\u2013911)&nbsp;\u2014 is a fine example of ancient Medang Mataram art and architecture. The description of a grand temple compound dedicated for lord Shiva, and the public project to shift the course of the river near the temple (Opak river) to run straight along western wall of temple compound was also mentioned in [[Shivagrha inscription]]. The grand temple complex was dedicated to the ''[[Trimurti]]'', the three highest gods in the Hindu [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu). It was the largest Hindu temple ever built in [[Indonesia]], evidence of the immense wealth and cultural achievement of the kingdom.\n\nOther Hindu temples dated from Medang Mataram Kingdom era are: [[Sambisari]], [[Gebang Temple|Gebang]], Barong, Ijo, and Morangan. Although the Shivaist regain the favour, Buddhist remain under royal patronage. The Sewu temple dedicated for [[Manjusri]] according to [[Kelurak inscription]] was probably initially built by Panangkaran, but later expanded and completed during Rakai Pikatan's rule, whom married to a Buddhist princess [[Pramodhawardhani]], daughter of Samaratungga. Most of their subjects retained their old religion; Shivaists and Buddhists seemed to co-exist in harmony. The Buddhist temple of [[Plaosan]], [[Banyunibo]] and [[Sajiwan]] were built during the reign of King Pikatan and Queen Pramodhawardhani, probably in the spirit of religious reconciliation after the succession disputes between Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani against [[Balaputra]].\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016190.jpg|thumb|Bas relief in [[Prambanan]] depicting a scene taken from [[Ramayana]]. The translation of Indian epic into Javanese [[Kakawin Ramayana]] took place during Medang Mataram kingdom.]]\n\nFrom the 9th to mid 10th centuries, the Medang Kingdom witnessed the blossoming of art, culture and literature, mainly through the translation of Hindu-Buddhist sacred texts and the transmission and adaptation of Hindu-Buddhist ideas into Old Javanese text and visual bas-reliefs rendering. The bas-relief carved on each sides of [[Mendut]] temple stairs and also on the base of [[Sojiwan]] temple for example, narrating the popular [[Jataka]] Buddhist tales, the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The [[Borobudur]] bas-relief particularly, contains the most complete rendering of Buddhist sacred texts. Ranged from [[Karma]]vibhanga (the law of [[karma]]), [[Lalitavistara]] (the story of the Buddha), the tale of [[Manohara]], [[Jataka]] and Jatakamala, [[Avadana]] (collection of virtuous deeds) and [[Gandavyuha]] ([[Sudhana]]'s quest for the ultimate truth).\n\nThe bas-relief narration of the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' and also was carved on the wall of Prambanan temple's Shiva and Brahma temples, while the stories of [[Krishna]] taken from [[Bhagavata Purana]] was carved on Vishnu temple. During this period, the [[Kakawin Ramayana|Kakawin ''Ramayana'']], an old [[Javanese language|Javanese]] rendering was written. This Kakawin Ramayana, also called the ''Yogesvara Ramayana'', is attributed to the scribe Yogesvara c. the 9th century CE, who was employed in the court of the Medang in Central Java. It has 2774 [[stanza]]s in the ''manipravala'' style, a mixture of Sanskrit and [[Kawi language|archaic Javanese prose]]. The most influential version of the ''Ramayana'' is the ''Ravanavadham'' of [[Bhatti]], popularly known as ''Bhattikavya''. The Javanese ''Ramayana'' differs markedly from the original Hindu.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\nMedang kingdom had an exceptionally intense relations with the regional hegemon [[Srivijaya]] of Sumatra. In earlier period, the relations was close and intimate, as Sailendran kings of Java has formed an alliance with Maharaja of Srivijaya and the two royal houses seems to be merged. In later period however, the relations was deteriorated to warfare, as Dharmawangsa launched failed attempt to capture Palembang, and Srivijaya well-crafted retaliation ensued. In its eastern boundary, the Medang kingdom seems to subjugate the neighboring [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]], and pulled the island into its sphere of influence.\n{{multiple image|align=right|perrow=2|total_width=500|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=Borobudur-Nothwest-view.jpg|width1=131|image2=Bakong 01.jpg|width2=131|footer=Comparison between left: [[Borobudur]] of Java (825) and right: [[Bakong]] of Cambodia (881), both temples had similar basic design of [[stepped pyramid]] and similar corbelling method, which suggest there was a connection of influence between ancient Java and Cambodia.}}\n\nThe Khmer art and architecture during the formative early [[Angkor]] era also believed to being influenced by Javanese art and architecture; the striking similarity of the [[Bakong]] temple in [[Cambodia]] to Borobudur, strongly suggests that Bakong was inspired by Borobudur's design.

By incorporating Hindu-Buddhist frame of reference and elements into their culture, art and architecture, and by [[Sanskritization]] their language, Javanese has formulating their own Hindu-Buddhist Javanese style and developing an ingenious civilisation. This Javanese style of Sailendran art, either in sculpture and architecture, in return influenced regional arts, particularly the Srivijayan art in Sumatra and Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula.\n\nIt was also during this period that numbers of dharmic scriptures either Hindu or Buddhist, has made their way from [[India]] into [[Javanese culture]].

These tales and epics would further shaped the Javanese culture and performing arts, such as [[Javanese dance]]s and [[wayang]] art.\n\n==List of rulers==\nThe ruler of Medang Kingdom.<ref name=indianised/>{{rp|88\u201389,91,92,108,126\u2013130}}<ref name=\"Srivijaya243\">{{cite book | author=Muljana, Slamet | title=Sriwijaya | publisher=Yogyakarta: LKiS |year=2006 | pages=243\u2013244 | language=Indonesian | isbn=979-8451-62-7}}</ref>\n\n===Central Java period===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\n!width=\"70px\"|Period of reign\n!width=\"100px\"|Personal name\n!width=\"70px\"|Rakai (Javanese title)\n!width=\"120px\"|Abhiseka (stylised) name\n!width=\"100px\"|Mentioned in inscription\n!width=\"70px\"|Year\n|-\n|732\u2014760\n|[[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]]\n|Mataram\n| \u2013\n| [[Canggal inscription|Canggal]] <br />\n| 732 <br />\n|-\n|760\u2014780\n|[[Panangkaran|Pancapana]]\n|[[Panangkaran]]\n|Dharmatungga?\n|[[Kalasan inscription|Kalasan]]\n|778\n|-\n|780\u2014800\n|[[Dharanindra]]\n|Panunggalan\n|Sanggramadhananjaya <br />\n\u2013\n|[[Kelurak inscription|Kelurak]] <br />\nLigor B\n|782 <br />\nc 787\n|-\n|800\u2014819\n|[[Samaragrawira]]\n|[[Warak]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Nalanda inscription|Nalanda]]\n|c 860\n|-\n|819\u2014838\n|[[Samaratungga]]\n|Garung\n| \u2013\n|Pengging  <br />\n[[Karangtengah inscription|Karangtengah]]\n|819 <br />\n824\n|-\n|838\u2014850\n|Jatiningrat\n|[[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Shivagrha inscription|Shivagrha]]  <br />\nTulang air <br />\nArgapura <br />\n|856 <br />\n850 <br />\n863 <br />\n|-\n|850\u2014890\n|Lokapala\n|[[Kayuwangi]]  <br />  <br />  <br /> Gurun Wangi\n| Sajanotsawatungga <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />\n|[[Shivagrha inscription|Shivagrha]] <br />\nWuatan Tija <br />\nWanua Tengah <br />\n[[Munggu Antan inscription|Munggu Antan]] <br />\n|856 <br />\n880 <br />\n863 <br />\n887 <br />\n|-\n|890\u2014898\n|Dewendra\n|Limus <br />\n[[Watuhumalang]] <br />\n| \u2013\n|Poh Dulur <br />\nKewikuan Panunggalan <br />\n|890 <br />\n896 <br />\n|-\n|898\u2014910\n|[[Balitung]]\n|Watukura\n|Sri Iswara Kesawottawatungga\n|[[Mantyasih inscription|Mantyasih]]\n|907\n|-\n|910\u2014919\n|Daksa\n|Hino\n|Sri Maharaja Daksottama Bahubajra Pratipaksaksaya Uttunggawijaya\n|Taji Gunung\n|910\n|-\n|919\u2014924\n|[[Tulodong]]\n|Layang\n|Sajanasanata Nuraga Tunggadewa\n|Lintakan\n|919\n|-\n|924\u2014929\n|[[Wawa of Mataram|Wawa]]\n|Sumba <br />\nPangkaja\n|Sri Wijayaloka Namottungga\n|[[Minto Stone|Sanggurah]]\n|982\n|}\n\n===East Java period===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"60%\"\n!width=\"70px\"|Period of reign\n!width=\"100px\"|Personal name\n!width=\"70px\"|Rakai (Javanese title)\n!width=\"120px\"|Abhiseka (stylised) name\n!width=\"100px\"|Mentioned in inscription\n!width=\"70px\"|Year\n|-\n|929\u2014947\n|[[Mpu Sindok|Sindok]]\n|Hino\n|Sri Maharaja Isyana Wikramadharmottunggadewa\n|Turyan <br />\n[[Anjuk Ladang inscription|Anjukladang]]\n|929 <br />\n937\n|-\n|947\u2014985\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Isyana Tunggawijaya|Sri Isyana Tunggawijaya]] ([[queen regnant]])\n|Gedangan <br />\n[[Pucangan inscription|Pucangan]]\n|950 <br />\n1041\n|-\n|985\u2014990\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Makutawangsa Wardhana|Sri Makutawangsa Wardhana]]\n|[[Pucangan inscription|Pucangan]]\n|1041\n|-\n|990\u20141006\n|Wijayamreta Wardhana\n| \u2013\n|[[Dharmawangsa|Sri Maharaja Isyana Dharmawangsa Teguh Anantawikramottunggadewa]]\n|[[Pucangan inscription|Pucangan]]\n|1041\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Indonesia}}\n* [[List of monarchs of Java]]\n* [[Medang Kamulan]]\n\n==References==\n\n===General===\n* Soekmono, R, Drs., ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed.

Established by King [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the kingdom was ruled by the [[Sailendra]] dynasty.\n\nDuring most of its history the kingdom seems have relied heavily on agriculture, especially extensive [[rice farming]], and later also benefited from maritime trade.

Temples dotted the landscape of its heartland in [[Yogyakarta|Mataram]] ([[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]]).

Civil war followed.  The outcome was that the Medang empire was divided into two powerful kingdoms; the [[Sanjaya dynasty|Shivaist dynasty]] of Medang kingdom in [[Java]] led by [[Rakai Pikatan]] and the [[Shailendra dynasty|Buddhist dynasty]] of [[Srivijaya]] kingdom in [[Sumatra]] led by [[Balaputradewa]]. Hostility between them did not end until 1006 when the Sailendra clan based in Srivijaya incited a rebellion by Wurawari, a vassal of the Medang kingdom, and sacked the capital of Watugaluh in East Java. Srivijaya rose to become the undisputed hegemonic empire in the region.

The [[India]]ns collectively called them as ''Yawadvipa'', the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] refer to them as ''Chvea'', the [[China|Chinese]] called them as ''Shepo'', ''Chopo'' or ''Chao-wa'', the Arabs called them as ''Jawi'' or ''Jawah'', and Srivijayan refer to them as ''Bhumijava''. The native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] most often refer to their lands and country simply as ''Jawi'' (Java), while the name of their ''nagara'' (country) is often based on their capital. The only foreign source mentioning ''Mda\u03b7'' was found from the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription|Philippines inscription]], dated 822 saka (900).<ref>{{cite web | title=The Laguna Copper-Plate Inscription: Text and Commentary | first=Postma | last=Antoon | url=http://ojs.philippinestudies.net/index.php/ps/article/download/1033/1018 | publisher=Philippine Studies, Ateneo de Manila University | location=Loyola Heights, Quezon City, the Philippines | page=186 | accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Panoramic views of Borobudur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Borobudur]], the largest single Buddhist structure in the world, one of the monuments constructed by the [[Shailendra dynasty|Sailendran]] of the Medang Kingdom.|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nThere are no comprehensive written records that have survived in Java except numbers of ''prasasti'' (inscriptions) written on stones or copper plates. These inscriptions most often recorded the political and religious deeds of the rulers. The most common theme mentioned in inscriptions is the establishment of ''Sima'' (taxed rice cultivation land recognised through royal edict), and sometimes some portion or the whole of tax collected from this ''Sima'' land is appointed to fund the construction and maintenance of [[Candi of Indonesia|religious building]]. Nevertheless, some local legends and historical records, written on ''[[Palm-leaf manuscript|lontar]]''\u2014most often dated from later period\u2014might also provides data and source to reconstruct the historical event.\n\nNative [[Javanese mythology]] and beliefs composed in the [[Mataram Sultanate]] era (circa 17th century), but probably originating from an earlier period, mentioned a semi-mythological kingdom named [[Medang Kamulan]], which in Javanese translates to \"Medang the origin\" kingdom. The kingdom is mentioned in the myth of [[Dewi Sri]] and also [[Aji Saka]]. This is probably the remnant of vague native Javanese collective memory of the existence of an ancient kingdom called \"Medang\".\n\nCurrent knowledge of historical Javanese civilisation is thus primarily derived from:\n* ''Archaeological excavations'', reconstruction and investigation of ancient structures, especially ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' (temples), and also the discovery of ancient relics, such as the [[Wonoboyo hoard]].\n* ''Stone inscriptions'', most common are those which mention the foundation and funding of temples which report on the political and religious deeds of the kings, or stating their lineage; the most notable are the [[Canggal inscription|Canggal]], [[Kalasan inscription|Kalasan]], [[Shivagrha inscription|Shivagrha]] and [[Mantyasih inscription|Balitung charter]].\n* ''[[Bas relief]]s'' in a series of temple walls with depictions of life in the palace, village, temple, ship, marketplace and also the everyday lives of the population. The most notable are the bas reliefs found on Borobudur and Prambanan temple.\n* ''Native [[Palm-leaf manuscript|manuscripts]]'' mentioning stories of kings, their deeds and exploits, that somehow link across to accounts mentioned in stone inscriptions. The notable example is the [[Carita Parahyangan]].\n* ''Reports and chronicles'' of foreign diplomats, traders and travellers, mainly from Chinese, Indian, and Arab sources.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Prambanan]] temple compound originally consisted of hundreds of temples, built and expanded in the period between the reign of Pikatan and Balitung|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nInitially, the kingdom was identified only through its location '''Yawadvipa''' ([[Java]] island) as mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732). The inscription mentioned ''Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya'' (King Sanjaya, the Rakai (lord) of Mataram). The earlier historians such as [[Soekmono]], identify this kingdom as '''Mataram''', a historic geographical name to identify the plain south of [[Mount Merapi]] in central Java, roughly corresponds to modern [[Muntilan]] (where the Canggal temple on [[Gunung Wukir]] hill is located), [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Sleman Regency|Sleman]] and [[Bantul Regency]]. This is based on the locations where large numbers of [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] were discovered in and around [[Prambanan Plain]]. The etymology of the name \"Mataram\" derived from a Sanskrit term for \"mother\".<ref>{{cite web | title = Mataram | work = Sanskrit dictionary | url = http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&tinput=mataram&trans=Translate}}</ref>\n\nThe name '''Medang''' appear later in East Javanese inscriptions such as [[Anjukladang inscription]] (937) and [[Minto Stone]] (982), Paradah inscription and some inscriptions discovered in Surabaya. As the result, historians tends to identify the Eastern Java period (929\u20141006) of this kingdom as ''Medang'' to differ it with its earlier Central Java period of ''Mataram'' (732\u2014929). However, by examining the phrase in Anjukladang inscription mentioning: ''\"Kita prasiddha mangrakpa kadatwan rahyang ta i Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' suggests that the name ''Mda\u014b'' (read: Mdang or Medang) was already used earlier in Central Java period. The phrase ''\"Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' literally means \"Medang in the land of Mataram\", which means the kingdom name is Medang with its capital in Mataram.<ref>{{cite book|title=Menuju Puncak Kemegahan|author=Slamet Muljana\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XPLpH5LOZLsC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=Medang+Anjukladang#v=onepage&q=Medang%20Anjukladang&f=false|page=84|language=Indonesian|publisher=LKiS|accessdate=3 March 2014|isbn=9789798451355\n|year=2005\n}}</ref> The etymology of the name \"Medang\" might be derived from a local name of the hardwood \"medang\" tree which refer to trees of the genus ''[[Phoebe (plant)|Phoebe]]''.<ref>{{cite web | work = KBBI | title = Medang | url = http://kbbi.web.id/medang}}</ref> However, another etymological approach suggests that it might derived from old Javanese term \"medang\" which means \"gracefully appear\". It might be related to a Javanese term \"medal\" which means \"going out\", and Sundanese term \"midang\" which refer to dress up and appear gracefully in public.<ref>{{cite web | title = Midang | work = Kamus Daerah | url = http://www.kamusdaerah.com/?bhs=a&bhs2=m&q=1%20ngageulis%202%20midang.}}</ref>\n\nThe court moved several times after Mataram (reign of Sanjaya) to Mamrati or Amrati (reign of Rakai Pikatan), Poh Pitu (reign of Balitung), again to Bhumi Mataram (reign of Dyah Wawa), Tamwlang (reign of Sindok), Watugaluh (reign of Sindok), and last to Wwatan (reign of Dharmawangsa Teguh).\n\nThe name \"Mataram\" reappeared again later in the 14th century as one of [[Majapahit]]'s province. Later in the 16th century appeared the Islamic [[Mataram Sultanate]] located in the same area in Yogyakarta vicinity. As the result, earlier historian also named this kingdom as '''Hindu Mataram''' or '''Ancient Mataram''' to differ it with later Islamic Mataram Sultanate.\n\nThis historic Javanese Kingdom of Mataram should not be confused with the [[Mataram (city)|Mataram city]] located on [[Lombok]] island, currently the capital of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] province. The latter was actually the royal capital of the Cakranegara, a branch of [[Bali]]nese [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]] nobles that colonize Lombok in early 19th century. Indeed, Lombok's Mataram city was named after the historic region of Mataram in Java, as it is a common practice for [[Balinese people|Balinese]] to name their settlements after their Javanese Majapahit heritage.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and growth===\n[[File:Canggal inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Canggal inscription (732), created by King Sanjaya.]]\nThe earliest account of the Medang Mataram Kingdom is in the [[Canggal inscription]], dated 732, discovered within the compound of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple in Canggal village, southwest of the town of [[Magelang]]. This inscription, written in [[Sanskrit]] using the [[Pallava]] script, tells of the erection of a ''[[Lingam|lingga]]'' (a symbol of [[Shiva]]) on the hill in the Kunjarakunja area, located on a noble island called Yawadwipa (Java) which was blessed with abundance of rice and gold. The establishment of lingga was under the order of [[Sri Sanjaya|Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya]] (King Sanjaya Rakai (lord) of Mataram). This inscription tells that Yawadwipa was ruled by [[King Sanna]], whose long reign was marked by wisdom and virtue. After Sanna died, the kingdom fell into disunity. [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of [[Sannaha]] (Sanna's sister) ascended to the throne. He conquered the areas around his kingdom, and his wise reign blessed his land with peace and prosperity for all of his subjects.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Drs. R.

And yet it seems to be the continuation of earlier polity ruled by King Sanna, Sanjaya's uncle. This earlier polity is linked to the earlier [[Dieng temples|temple structures]] in [[Dieng Plateau]], in the northern part of Central Java, which is the oldest surviving structure found in Central Java. The earlier kingdom linked as the predecessor of Medang Mataram kingdom is [[Kalingga]], located somewhere in Central Java northern coast.\n\nThe story of Sanna and Sanjaya are also described in the ''[[Carita Parahyangan]]'', a book from a later period composed around late 16th-century, which mainly describes the history of Pasundan (the [[Sunda Kingdom]]). This book mentions that Sanna was defeated by [[Purbasora]], King of [[Galuh]], and retreated to [[Mount Merapi]]. Later, Sanjaya reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and ruled [[West Java]], Central Java, East Java, and [[Bali]]. He also battled the [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] and [[Keling]] (against their king, Sang Srivijaya). Although the manuscript seems to be romanticised, vague and not providing certain details on the period, nevertheless the almost exact name and theme of the story with historical Canggal inscription seems to confirm that the manuscript was based or inspired from the historical event.\n\n===Golden age===\n[[File:Javanese - The Buddhist Goddess Tara - Walters 572282.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 9th century Central Javanese gold and silver image of the Mahayana Buddhist goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]]]\nThe period between the reign of King [[Panangkaran]] to King [[Balitung]] (span between 760\u2014910) that roughly lasted for 150 years, marked the apogee of Javanese classic civilisation.

According to the [[Kalasan inscription]], dated 778 and written in the Pranagari script in Sanskrit, the [[Candi Kalasan|Kalasan]] temple was erected by the will of ''Guru Sang Raja Sailendravam\u00e7atilaka'' (the teacher of the ornament of Sailendra family), who persuaded [[Panangkaran]] (Sanjaya's successor) to construct a holy building for the goddess (''boddhisattvadevi'') [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and build a [[vihara]] ([[monastery]]) for Buddhist monks from the Sailendra realm.

He was mentioned in [[Kelurak inscription]] (dated 782) in his formal reign name Sri Sanggrama Dhananjaya. In this inscription he was hailed as ''Wairiwarawiramardana'' or \"the slayer of courageous enemies\". The similar title also found in [[Ligor inscription|Ligor B inscription]] discovered in Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula; ''Sarwwarimadawimathana'', which suggest it referred to the same person. Dharanindra seems to be a valiant and warlike character, as he embarked on military naval expedition overseas and has brought Sailendras' control on [[Ligor]] in Malay Peninsula.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|91\u201392}}\n\nKing Indra seems to continue the builder tradition of his predecessor. He continued the construction of Manjusrigrha temple ([[Sewu]] complex), and  according to the [[Karangtengah inscription]] (dated 824) responsible for the construction of Venuvana temple, connected to [[Mendut]] or probably [[Ngawen]] temple. He was also probably responsible for the conception and initiation of the construction of [[Borobudur]] and [[Pawon]] temple.\n\nDharanindra ascends as the Maharaja of [[Srivijaya]]. The nature of Sailendras' close relations with the neighbouring Srivijayan empire based on Sumatra is quite uncertain and complicated. It seems that in earlier times, Sailendra family belonged within Srivijayan [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala sphere of influence]]. And for later period of time Sailendras' monarch rose to become the head of Srivijayan mandala. The shift that rendered Sailendras in return to become the ruler of Srivijaya was unclear. Was it led by military campaign by Dharanindra against Srivijaya in Sumatra, or more likely formed by close alliance and kinship between the house of Sailendra and the Maharaja of Srivijaya.\n[[File:LCI.jpg|thumb|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (circa 900 CE) from the Laguna de Bay area in Luzon, the Philippines.

He appointed the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] prince [[Jayavarman II|Jayavarman]] as the governor of [[Indrapura (Khmer)|Indrapura]] in the Mekong delta under Sailendran rule. This decision was proven as a mistake, as Jayavarman later revolted, moved his capital further inland north from [[Tonle Sap]] to [[Mahendraparvata]], severed the link and proclaimed [[Khmer Empire|Cambodian]] independence from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married T\u0101r\u0101, daughter of [[Dharmasetu]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} He was mentioned as his other name Rakai Warak in [[Mantyasih inscription]].\n\nEarlier historians, such as [[N. J. Krom]], and Coedes, tend to equate Samaragrawira and [[Samaratungga]] as the same person.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|92}} However, later historians such as [[Slamet Muljana]] equate Samaratungga with Rakai Garung, mentioned in Mantyasih inscription as the fifth monarch of Mataram kingdom. Which means Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira.\n\n[[Samaratungga]] (r. 819\u2013838) was credited for the completion of massive stone [[mandala]], the grand monument of [[Borobudur]] (completed in 825). Samaratungga just like Samaragrawira, seems to be deeply influenced by peaceful Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and strive to become a pacifist and a benevolent ruler. His successor was Princess [[Pramodhawardhani]] that betrothed to Shivaite [[Rakai Pikatan]], son of the influential Rakai Patapan, a landlord in Central Java. The political move that seems as an effort to secure peace and Sailendran rule on Java by reconciling the Mahayana Buddhist with Shivaist Hindus.\n\nThe rule of Shivaist [[Rakai Pikatan]] (r. 838\u2013850) and his Buddhist queen consort Pramodhawardhani marked the return of the Medang Mataram court favour to Shivaist Hindu,<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} instead of Mahayana Buddhism favoured by previous king Samaratungga. This is evident in the construction of grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound in the Mataram capital, located only few hundred meters south from [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] temple compound. Nevertheless, the inter-religious relations during Pikatan's reign seems to promote tolerance in the spirit of reconciliation. Their reign is credited to the construction and expansion of at least two of perwara temple and [[stupa]] in [[Plaosan]] complex, located east from Sewu (Manjusrigrha) temple. Plaosan temple with twin main temples is probably built and dated from an earlier period, probably started by Panangkaran, Samaragrawira or Samaratungga, but completed during Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani's reign.\n\n====The divide====\n[[File:Ratuboko Gate.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ratu Boko]], a fortified hill, probably referred in [[Shivagrha inscription]] as the location of a battle.]]\n[[Balaputra]] however, opposed the rule of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani. The relations between Balaputra and Pramodhawardhani is interpreted differently by some historians. Older theory according to Bosch and De Casparis holds that Balaputra was the son of Samaratungga, which means he was the younger brother of Pramodhawardhani. Later historians such as Muljana on the other hand, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, which means he was the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.<ref name=\"Srivijaya21\">{{cite book | author=Muljana, Slamet | title=Sriwijaya | publisher=Yogyakarta: LKiS |year=2006 | page=21 | language=Indonesian | isbn=979-8451-62-7}}</ref>\n\nIt is not known whether Balaputra was expelled from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, or was he already ruled in [[Suvarnabhumi|Suvarnadvipa]] (Sumatra). Either ways, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in [[Srivijaya]]n capital of [[Palembang]]. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother\u2014Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in [[Nalanda inscription]] dated 860.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}}\n[[File:Shivagrha Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 778 Saka (856 CE), one of the historical source dated from the Medang Mataram Kingdom.]]\nThe [[Shivagrha inscription]] (dated 856) mentioned about a war challenging Pikatan's reign, the inscription however did not mention who was the enemy that challenged Pikatan's authority. The earlier historians suggests that it was Balaputradewa that rose against Pikatan, however later historians suggest it was another enemy, argued by that time Balaputra already ruled in Srivijaya. The Shivagrha inscription only mentioned that the battle happened in a fortress on a hill protected by bulk of stone walls, this fortress hill is identified with [[Ratu Boko]] archaeological site. The eldest children of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani was Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu. Eventually the revolt was successfully defeated by Pikatan's youngest son\u2014the valiant Dyah Lokapala also known as Rakai Kayuwangi. As the reward for his heroic deed and bravery, the people and many of Pikatan's state advisors urged that Lokapala should be named as crown prince instead of Gurunwangi. Gurunwangi's loss of favour in succession\u2014despite being the eldest sibling, has raised a question among scholars. It was previously thought that the name Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu refer to a female character (princess), although it is more likely that Gurunwangi was a prince.\n\nThis revolt seems to have succeeded in taking over the capital in Mataram for a certain period. After defeating the usurper, Pikatan found that this bloodshed has made the capital in Mataram inauspicious, thus he moved the karaton (court) to Mamrati or Amrati located somewhere in Kedu Plain (Progo river valley), northwest from Mataram.\n\nLater Pikatan decided to abdicate his throne in favour of his youngest son Dyah Lokapala (r. 850\u2014890). Rakai Pikatan retired, renounce worldly affairs and become a hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat. The event also marked with the consecrated ceremony of Shiva image in [[Prambanan]] main temple. Boechari suggests that the enemy that challenged Pikatan was Rakai Walaing pu Kumbhayoni, a powerful Shivaist landlord and also the branch of the ruling dynasty as he claimed as the descendant of a king that ruled Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\">{{cite book |author1=Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro |author2=Nugroho Notosusanto | title=Sejarah Nasional Indonesia: Zaman Kuno | date=2008 | publisher=Balai Pustaka | isbn=978-9794074084 | language=Indonesian |oclc=318053182 }}</ref>{{rp|159}}\n\n====The short peace====\n[[File:Sambirejo, Prambanan, Sleman Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ijo temple|Ijo]], a 10th century Hindu temple located on Ijo Hill Southeast from Prambanan.]]\nThe Medang Mataram kings after [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]]; from Lokapala, Watuhumalang (r. 890\u2014898) and [[Balitung]] are the patrons of Shivaist Hindu, \"after the decline of the power of the Buddhist Sailendras in central Java.\"<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|125\u2013127}} Their reign seems to enjoyed a relative peace. The grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound are continuously expanded and completed with hundreds of perwara (complementary) temples surrounding the main three prasada (tower) of [[Trimurti]] Hindu Gods. It is probably during their reign that some Hindu temples are constructed in the area, such as [[Sambisari]], [[Barong temple|Barong]], [[Ijo temple|Ijo]], [[Kedulan]], [[Kimpulan]], [[Kadisoka]], [[Gebang]] and [[Merak temple]]. Barong and Ijo temples in particular are interesting, for they are built on the hill and has different layout compared to earlier temples. Sewu and Prambanan temples are arranged in concentric mandala layout. Barong and Ijo temples however, are arranged in completely different way; the main temple is located in further back of the compound on the most higher ground, while the perwara complementary temples are built in front of the main temple on the lower ground, the layout corresponds to the uneven topography of the site. This style of temple layout is most likely the predecessor and will be continued in the later East Javanese temple architecture.\n\nKing Pikatan, Lokapala (Rakai Kayuwangi), and Watuhumalang ruled from their court in Mamrati or Amrati, they are known as \"Amrati Kings\". The exact location of Mamrati is unknown, suggested somewhere in [[Kedu Plain]] (modern day [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung regencies]]), located north from Mataram along [[Progo River]] valley. It was suggested that Amrati might be located near the location of Wanua Tengah III inscription, in Kedunglo hamlet, Kaloran village, within [[Temanggung Regency]].\n\nAfter absent for several generations, the name \"Mataram\" reappears in Javanese inscription during the reign of Balitung, which probably signify the transfer of capital. King Balitung moved his capital from Amrati to Poh Pitu, and renamed Poh Pitu as Yawapura. Again the exact location of this capital is unknown, probably also located within Kedu Plain. However, it is highly possible that Poh Pitu was located around the Poh inscription (905), in Dumpoh hamlet, Potrobangsan [[Villages of Indonesia|village]], North Magelang district within [[Magelang]] city. Balitung productively issued several inscriptions, among others are Telahap inscription (dated 11 September 899), Watukura inscription (27 July 902), Telang (11 January 904), Poh (17 July 905), Kubu-Kubu (17 October 905),  Mantyasih (11 April 907), and Rukam (907).\n\nOur current knowledge of the names of kings that reign the Medang Mataram kingdom is much owed to [[Mantyasih inscription]] (dated 907), issued by King [[Balitung]] (r. 898\u2014910)\u2014that contains genealogy and the reign order of Medang Mataram kings, and he seek ancestor as far as King Sanjaya. This inscription is also known as \"Balitung charter\". The motivation of Balitung's edict has sparked various assumptions from historians\u2014as if Balitung eagerly seeks legitimacy of his rule, by stating his ancestral lineage. It is highly possible that he related to the royal family and shared common ancestry. Thus, suggested that he married to the daughter of previous king, which made him the royal son in-law as well as heir.\n\nThe Watukura inscription (902) is the oldest inscription in Javanese statecraft that mentioned the position of Rakryan Kanuruhan (Prime Minister), while the position of Rakryan Mapatih\u2014which in Balitung's era is equivalent to [[crown prince]], was held by Mpu Daksa. The relation between Balitung and his successor Daksha is quite problematic, as historians suggested Daksha was the son of previous king (Watuhumalang), while the court was held by Balitung who is probably Dakhsa's brother in-law. The Telang inscription, dated 11 January 904, revealed the development of the port complex of Paparahuan which was led by Rakai Welar Mpu Sudarsana, located on the bank of [[Solo River|Bengawan Solo river]]. By building port and ferry crossing in navigable Bengawan Solo, might signify the growing interest in maritime trade, thus the court interest has shifted eastward.\n\nThe Kubu-Kubu inscription (17 October 905) revealed the village Kubu-kubu was awarded to Rakryan Hujung Dyah Mangarak and Rakryan Matuha Dyah Majawuntan in recognition of their valor on conquering Bantan. The toponym of Bantan is unclear, it might be corresponds to the 10th century site of [[Banten Girang]] in present-day [[Banten]] province of western Java, or might be other place. While other historians speculated that Bantan might be an alternative name to [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. In old Javanese, the term Bantan means \"sacrifice\" which often used interchangeably with Bali that means \"offering\".\n[[File:Sajiwan main.JPG|thumb|righ|[[Sajiwan]] Buddhist temple, linked to Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana or Sri Kahulunnan.]]\nThe Mantyasih inscription (11 April 907) revealed the gifts awarded to five junior ''patihs'' (officials) for their service on maintained peace during Balitung's wedding. Also in 907, in Rukam inscription, Balitung offers that the Sima taxes being collected from the village of Rukam to be allocated for the construction and maintenance of a temple dedicated to his grandmother, Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana. The temple mentioned here is [[Sajiwan]] Buddhist temple, located not far south from Prambanan, probably was built during the end of Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala) reign and completed in Balitung's reign. The temple is dedicated to Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana, linked to Sri Kahulunnan, another name of queen [[Pramodhawardhani]]. This temple probably was a mortuary temple dedicated as ''pedharmaan'' (dedication) for the deceased queen mother.\n\nThe rivalry between Balitung and Daksha was probably a result of the previous contest of succession between Rakai Gurunwangi and Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala)\u2014both are descendants of Rakai Pikatan. During the rule of his brother-in-law\u2014Balitung, Mpu Daksa held the position as Rakai Hino, according to Taji Gunung inscription (dated 21 December 910), that mentioned about the partition of Taji Gunung area between him and Rakai Gurunwangi. It seems that Rakai Gurunwangi allied himself with his nephew Daksha. Historian Boechari is certain that the reign of Balitung was ended as the result of Mpu Daksha's rebellion. According to Taji Gunung inscription (910) Daksha was still as Rakai Hino, while in the stele of Timbangan Wungkal (913) he already ascended to the throne as the king. Although the kingdom also enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, after King Balitung, it seems that the construction of grand temples are decreased in both quality and quantity.\n\nDaksha ruled over the centre and the east portions of Java.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|127}} King Daksha (r. 910\u2014919) and his successor King [[Tulodong]] (r. 919\u2014924) also ruled from Poh Pitu. The next monarch, King [[Wawa of Mataram|Wawa]] (r. 924\u2014929) returned the capital back from Poh Pitu to Mataram. The [[Minto Stone|Sanggurah inscription]] (dated 2 August 928)\u2014found in [[Malang]] area in East Java is particularly interesting, since it mentioned about the deed of Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa) that granted the Sima status to the land in and around the source of Brantas river in present-day Batu and Malang area. This means that during the reign of Wawa, the kingdom has expanded eastward by establishing settlements (Sima lands) along the river Bengawan Solo and [[Brantas River|Brantas]].\n\n===Moving eastward===\n[[File:Prambanan Java243.jpg|thumb|right|Towering [[Mount Merapi|Merapi volcano]] overlooking [[Prambanan]] prasad tower. It was suggested that Merapi volcanic eruption had devastated Mataram capital, forcing them to relocate in the east.]]\nAround the year 929, the centre of the kingdom was shifted from Central Java to East Java by [[Mpu Sindok]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|128}} who established the [[Isyana Dynasty]]. The exact cause of the move is still uncertain. Historians have proposed various possible causes; from natural disaster, epidemic outbreak, politics and power struggle, to religious or economic motives.\n\nAccording to van Bemmelen's theory, which was supported by Prof. Boechari a severe eruption of [[Mount Merapi]] volcano probably has caused the move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\">{{cite news |title = Merapi and the demise of the Mataram kingdom |date = 13 June 2006 |author = Handewi Soegiharto |newspaper = The Jakarta Post |url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/13/merapi-and-demise-mataram-kingdom.html |accessdate = 31 August 2015}}</ref> Historians suggest that, some time during the reign of King [[Wawa of Mataram]] (924\u2014929), Merapi volcano erupted and devastated the kingdom's capital in Mataram. The historic massive volcano eruption is popularly known as ''Pralaya Mataram'' (the debacle of Mataram). The evidence for this eruption can be seen in several temples that were virtually buried under Merapi's [[lahar]] and volcanic debris, such as the [[Sambisari]], Morangan, Kedulan, [[Kadisoka]] and [[Kimpulan]] temples.\n[[File:Sambisari 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sambisari]] temple buried five metres under volcanic debris of [[Mount Merapi]].]]\n\nArcheologist Agus Aris Munandar proposed a hypothesis, that the move was caused by a religious motives. He mentions that the incessant eruptions of Mount Merapi has caused the kingdom to move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> Pointing out that in ancient Javanese beliefs, Merapi was considered as the [[Mount Meru|Mahameru]] for the people in the ancient Mataram. According to Hindu teachings, the Mahameru peak symbolises the centre of the universe, the sacred realm where the gods live. Since their Mahameru in Central Java continued to erupt, they decided to move, but they still looked for another Mahameru. As East Java was still part of Mataram territory, it is possible that some of the people informed the Central Java kingdom that there was another Mahameru in the east. He suggests that the new sacred mountain was [[Mount Penanggungan]] in East Java, which resembles Mahameru.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis proposed by N.J. Krom says that the demise was caused by an epidemic break-out, forcing people to seek a new place to live.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> On the other hand, B. Schrieke says the move was caused by economic reasons; the vigorous temple construction boom during the era of Sailendran kings has put a tremendous economic burden upon the peasant. People were suffering as they were forced to build grand temples by the kings, instead of working their farms. Slowly they moved to the east to avoid the kings' orders.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nA power struggle is also proposed as the cause of the move. Coedes suggested that the move to East Java was probably in response to the Buddhist [[Sailendra]]s.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|79,90}} This theory is inline with the one proposed by J.G. de Casparis which suggests, that the shift of capital city eastward was to avoid a Srivijaya invasion from Sumatra.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nHowever, it was most likely motivated by economic reasons. De Casparis then expands his theory, saying that the location of the kingdom in Central Java was less accessible than East Java. The [[Brantas]] river valley was considered to be a strategic location, as the river provides easy access to reach ports on East Java's north coast and [[Java Sea]], strategic for the control of maritime trade routes to the eastern parts of archipelago, being especially vital for control of the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] spice trade. This is in contrast with Mataram's Kedu and Kewu Plain that relatively isolated from the north coast of Central Java. Despite its fertility, ideal for rice agricultural kingdom, the Mataram Plain is quite isolated, its northern borders are protected by natural barrier of Merapi, Merbabu, Sumbing, Sundoro, Dieng and Ungaran volcanoes. Ideal for inward-looking agricultural polity, but insufficient to develop a maritime trading kingdom.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nThe recent studies suggest, that the move eastward was not an abrupt event. During the Mataram period in Central Java, the kingdom most likely already expanded eastward and established settlements along Brantas river in East Java. It was more likely that the move was done in gradual manner over long period. The cause of the move was also motivated from multiple factors; either natural, economy or politics. The Sanggurah inscription or popularly known as the \"[[Minto Stone]]\", dated to 982 \u2014 found in [[Malang]], East Java in early 19th century \u2014 mentions the name of a Javanese king, Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa Wijayaloka<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Verhandelingen van Het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen|volume=60|year=1913| title=Oud-Javaansche Oorkonden.

This suggests that even during the reign of King Wawa, the Malang region in East Java already belongs within the realm of Medang Kingdom. The inscription contains elements about the shift of power that consequently took place to East Java.<ref>{{cite book|page=55|title=Handbook of Oriental Studies. Part 3|author=de Longh, R.C.|year=1977| publisher=Brill}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the true reasons behind the move of political centre from Central to East Java, this event marked the end of an era profoundly. Indeed, the temple-building activity has decreased since the era of King Balitung in scale, quality and quantity, and yet the Eastern Java period of Medang kingdom leave no tangible traces of any temple structure comparable to those of the previous Central Javanese Sailendra era. It seems that the kingdom no longer has the intention and the resource to embark on a grand scale construction project.\n\n====Establishing the eastern country====\n[[File:Anjuk Ladang Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Anjukladang inscription]] (937), issued by King Sindok during his power consolidation in East Java.]]\nAccording to [[Turyan inscription]] (dated 929), [[Mpu Sindok|Sindok]] moved the capital to Tamwlang and later moved it again to Watugaluh. Historian identify those names with the Tambelang and Megaluh area near modern [[Jombang Regency|Jombang]], East Java. Although Sindok establishes a new dynasty, the [[Isyana dynasty]] named after his daughter, Sindok seems to be closely related to the royal house of Medang Mataram, thus he can be viewed as the continuation of a long line of Javanese Kings lineage stretched from [[Sri Sanjaya|King Sanjaya]]. During his reign Sindok created quite a number of inscriptions, most are related to the establishment of ''Sima'' lands; these inscriptions are among others; Linggasutan (929), Gulung-Gulung (929), Cunggrang (929), Jru-Jru (930), Waharu (931), Sumbut (931), Wulig (935), and [[Anjuk Ladang inscription|Anjukladang]] (937). Most of these inscription mentioned about the establishment of ''Sima'' or ''Swatantra'' lands. This signify that Sindok seems to consolidated his authority over East Java as collections of villages are declared as ''Sima'' lands, which means the settlements have developed wet rice cultivation and can be taxed and swore allegiance as part of Sindok's kingdom.\n\nThe [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 in particular is interesting, because it stated the ''Sima'' status is awarded to Anjukladang village and a temple is erected in recognition of their service on repelling the invading forces from Malayu. The temple mentioned here is probably the Candi Lor made of bricks which is now in ruins, located in Candirejo village in [[Nganjuk Regency]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://museumanjukladang.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/prasasti-anjukladang/|title=Prasasti Anjukladang|date=2016-02-13|work=Museum Anjuk Ladang|access-date=2018-05-21|language=id-ID}}</ref> The mentioning of invading ''Malayu'' forces refer to the old name of Sumatran Malayu Kingdom, which probably means [[Srivijaya]] instead.

Dharmawangsa's sister, [[Mahendradatta]] later would be betrothed to a Balinese king [[Udayana Warmadewa]]. This report indicated that somehow [[Bali]] had been absorbed into the Medang Kingdom's mandala sphere of influence, probably as vassal. In literature development, King Dharmawangsa also ordered the translation of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' into [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]] in 996.\n\n===Collapse===\nIn the late 10th century, the rivalry between the Sumatran Srivijaya and Javanese Mataram became more hostile.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|130}} The animosity was probably caused by the Srivijayan effort to reclaim Sailendra lands in Java, as [[Balaputra]] and his offspring&nbsp;\u2014 a new dynasty of Srivijaya [[maharaja]]s&nbsp;\u2014 belonged to the Sailendra dynasty, or by Medang aspirations to challenge Srivijaya dominance as the regional power.

The news of Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese accounts from Song period. In 988, an envoy from ''San-fo-qi'' (Srivijaya) was sent to Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourned for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country has been attacked by ''She-po'' (Java) thus made him unable to return home. In 992 the envoy from ''She-po'' (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with Srivijaya. In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed Chinese Emperor for the protection of China against Javanese invaders.<ref name=\"Kulke\">{{cite book |title=Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions to Southeast Asia, Volume 1 of Nalanda-Sriwijaya series |editor=Hermann Kulke |editor2=K Kesavapany |editor3=Vijay Sakhuja |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2009 |isbn= 9789812309372 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2swhCXJVRzwC&dq=Dharmawangsa+Srivijaya+envoy+China}}</ref>{{rp|229}}\n\nDharmawangsa's invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]] to seek protection from China.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|141}} Srivijayan Maharaja, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa was an able and astute ruler, with shrewd diplomatic skills.

In 1003, a Song historical record reported that the envoy of ''San-fo-qi'' dispatched by the king Sri Cudamani Warmadewa, informed that a Buddhist temple had been erected in their country to pray for the long life of Chinese Emperor, thus asked the emperor to give the name and the bell for this temple which was built in his honor.

With the absence of Medang paramount ruler, warlords in regional provinces and settlements in central and east Java rebelled and break loose from the central Medang government and forming their own polities serving local dynasties. Raids and robbery were rampant ravaging the country. There was further unrest and violence several years after the kingdom's demise.\n\n[[Airlangga]], a son of King [[Udayana Warmadewa]] of [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]] and Queen [[Mahendradatta]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} also a nephew of slain King Dharmawangsa, managed to escape the destruction and went into exile in [[Wonogiri|Vanagiri]] forest in interior Central Java. He later rallied popular support, reunited the remnants of the Medang Kingdom and re-established the kingdom (including Bali) under the name of [[Kingdom of Kahuripan]] in 1019. The Kingdom of Kahuripan can be considered as the successor state of Medang, and from this point on, the kingdom was known as [[Kahuripan]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|144\u2013147}} with its capital located near Brantas river estuarine, somewhere around modern Surabaya, Sidoarjo or Pasuruan in East Java.\n\n==The Dynasty==\n\n=== The dual dynasties theory ===\n{{Main|Sanjaya Dynasty}}\nBosch  in his book ''\"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\"'' (1952) suggested that king Sanjaya was the progenitor of the [[Sanjaya Dynasty]], and there was two dynasties that ruled Central Java; the Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and the Shivaist Sanjaya dynasty.<ref>Dr. Bosch, \"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\", 1952.</ref> The inscription also states that Sanjaya was an ardent follower of [[Shaivism]]. From its founding in the early 8th century until 928, the kingdom was ruled by the Sanjaya dynasty. The first king was Sanjaya, who ruled in the Mataram region in the vicinity of modern Yogyakarta and Prambanan, and left the written records on the Canggal inscription. However, around the mid 8th century, the [[Sailendra]] dynasty emerged in Central Java and challenged Sanjaya domination in the region.\n\nThe prevailing historical interpretation holds that the Sailendra dynasty co-existed next to the Sanjaya dynasty in Central Java, and much of the period was characterised by peaceful co-operation. The Sailendra, with their strong connections to [[Srivijaya]], managed to gain control of Central Java and become overlords of the ''Rakai'' (local Javanese lords), including the Sanjayas, thus making the Sanjaya kings of Mataram their [[vassal]]s. Little is known about the kingdom due to the dominance of the Sailendra, who during this period constructed [[Borobudur]], a Buddhist monument. [[Samaratungga]], the monarch of the Sailendra, tried to secure the Sailendra position in Java, cementing an alliance with the Sanjayas by arranging the marriage of his daughter [[Pramodhawardhani]] with [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]].\n\nAround the middle of the 9th century, relations between the Sanjaya and the Sailendra deteriorated. In 852, the Sanjaya ruler, Pikatan, defeated [[Balaputra]], the offspring of the Sailendra monarch Samaratunga and the princess Tara. This ended the Sailendra presence in Java; Balaputra retreated to the Srivijayan capital in [[Sumatra]], where he became the paramount ruler.<ref>cf. De Casparis, 1956; Hall, 1985:111</ref> The victory of Pikatan was recorded in [[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 856, created by Rakai Kayuwangi, Pikatan's successor.\n\n=== The single dynasty theory ===\n[[File:Borobudur relief 1.jpg|thumb|right|The scene of the Javanese court depicted in Borobudur bas relief]]\n{{Main|Sailendra Dynasty}}\nHowever, this dual Sailendra\u2014Sanjaya dynasties theory proposed by Bosch and De Casparis was opposed by some Indonesian historians in later period. An alternate theory, proposed by [[Poerbatjaraka]], suggests there was only one kingdom and one dynasty, the kingdom called Medang, with the capital in the Mataram area (thus the name of the kingdom: ''\"Medang i Bhumi Mataram\"''), and the ruling dynasty being the [[Sailendra]].\n\nThis theory is supported with Boechari interpretation on [[Sojomerto inscription]] and Poerbatjaraka study on [[Carita Parahyangan]] manuscript, Poerbatjaraka holds that Sanjaya and all of his offspring belongs to the Sailendra family, which initially was [[Shivaist]] Hindu. However, according to [[Raja Sankhara inscription]] (now missing); Sanjaya's son, Panangkaran, converted to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. And because of that conversion, the later series of Sailendra kings who ruled Medang become Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists also and gave Buddhism royal patronage in Java until the end of Samaratungga's reign.<ref>Poerbatjaraka, 1958: 254\u2013264</ref> The Shivaist Hindus regained royal patronage with the reign of Pikatan, which lasted until the end of the Medang Kingdom. During the reign of Kings Pikatan and [[Balitung]], the royal Hindu [[Trimurti]] temple of [[Prambanan]] was built and expanded in the vicinity of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]].\n\n== Government and economy ==\nThe complex stratified ancient Javan society, with its refined aesthetic taste in art and culture, is evidenced through the various scenes in narrative [[bas-relief]]s carved on various temples dated from the Medang era.\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Hindu Temple in Java, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prambanan]] pr\u0101s\u0101da (towers) viewed from [[Ratu Boko]] hill, the area in [[Prambanan Plain]] was the location of the Mataram capital]] \nDuring this period the common concept of [[city]], as it known in Europe, Middle East or China, as the urban concentration centre of politics, administration, religious and economic activities, was not quite established yet in ancient Java. The proper urban development as a city took place later in 13th century [[Majapahit]]'s [[Trowulan]].\n\nThe capital itself is more likely refer to the [[palace]], a walled compound called ''pura'' in Sanskrit, or in local [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as ''karaton'' or ''kadatwan'', this is where the king and his family reside and rule his court. The palace itself is more of a collection of ''[[pendopo]]'' style pavilions surrounded by walls. These pavilions and halls are made from organic wooden and thatched materials, so they had decayed over centuries leaving only stone walls, gates, terraces and bases. The example of this type of secular buildings can be found in [[Ratu Boko]] compound. The Javanese urban centre in this period did not recognise walled-city as it found in Chinese or Indian counterparts, the only walled, well-guarded and protected compound was the king's palace and temple compound. The ''nagara'' or capital itself was more of a collection of densely populated villages surrounding the ''pura'' (king's palace).\n\nThe religious activity centres, which refer to the location of where the temples stood, did not necessarily signify the administrative or economic centre as well. As according to inscriptions, numbers of lands has been awarded a ''Sima'' status with portion or the whole of its rice tax revenue was allocated to funding the construction and maintaining the temple. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that the [[Prambanan Plain]] with high concentration of temples located just few hundred meters away from each other \u2014 [[Sambisari]], [[Kalasan]], [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Lumbung]], [[Prambanan]], [[Plaosan]], [[Sajiwan]], [[Banyunibo]], [[Ratuboko]], Barong and Ijo temples \u2014 was might be the location of the capital of Mataram. Other expert argued that the Prambanan area was indeed the religious centre of the kingdom, but was not the administrative centre, while suggesting other location in [[Muntilan]] as the possible political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\">{{cite book|last=Degroot|first=V\u00e9ronique|title=Candi, Space and Landscape: A Study on the Distribution, Orientation and Spatial Organization of Central Javanese Temple Remains |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2HzduME8OcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=85 |location=Leiden|publisher=Sidestone Press, Issue 38 of Mededelingen van het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde |isbn=978-9088900396}}</ref>\n\nMost of the time, the court of the Medang Kingdom was located in Mataram, possibly located somewhere in Muntilan or the [[Prambanan Plain]] near modern [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]. However, during the reign of Rakai Pikatan, the court was moved to Mamrati. Later, in the reign of Balitung, the court moved again, this time to Poh Pitu. Unlike Mataram, historians have been unable to pinpoint the possible locations of Mamrati and Poh Pitu, although most historians agree that both were located in the [[Kedu Plain]], somewhere around the modern [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] or [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung]] regencies. Later expert suggests that the area in Secang, on the upper Progo river valley in northern Magelang Regency \u2014 with relatively high temple density \u2014 was possibly the secondary political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\"/> In later Eastern Java period, other centres were mentioned; such as Tamwlang and Watugaluh (near Jombang), also Wwatan (near [[Madiun]]).\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Sailendra King and Queen, Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|The bas relief of 8th century [[Borobudur]] depict the scene in royal court.]]\nDuring this period the administration level of Javanese polity was only consists of two levels; the central government level centred in king's court, and the ''wanua'' or village level took form of settlements scattered around within kingdom's realm. The palace where the King resided was mentioned as ''kadatwan'' or ''karaton'', the court was the centre of kingdom's administration. The ''wanua'' or village is more likely took shape of an \"island\" filled with housings and orchards in the middle of vast [[rice paddies]], this village layout still can be found in modern Javanese ''desa''.\n\nThe King was regarded as the paramount ruler or ''[[chakravartin]]'', where the highest power and authority lies. He ruled the ''nagara'' or ''kadatwan'' which means the kingdom, from his ''puri'' (palace or walled compound). Under the king, there are state officials that serve to forward the king's laws and orders. They are using the title of ''Rakai'' or ''Samget''. The ''Rakais'' ruled an administrative unit called '' watak'' that formed from the collection of several villages or ''wanua''. ''Rakai'' can be considered as regional [[landlord]] or the [[landed gentry]], that rule a large collection of villages. The ''rakais'' transmit the king's order to the ''Rama'' or village leaders that rules their own domain called ''karaman'' or ''watak''. As the kingdom grew larger and complex, entering the 10th century during the reign of [[Balitung]], series of state officials are added to add hierarchy levels.<ref>{{cite book| author=Rahardjo, Supratikno |title= Peradaban Jawa, Dinamika Pranata Politik, Agama, dan Ekonomi Jawa Kuno | date=2002 | publisher=Komuntas Bambu, Jakarta | language=Indonesian |page=111 | isbn=979-96201-1-2}}</ref>\n\nMost of the inscriptions dated from Medang Mataram period are related to the establishment of ''sima'' lands. This signify the formation and expansion of Javanese agricultural villages in the region during this period. Either by opening a forest or converting a ''ladang'' (dry rice cultivation) to ''sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). A ''sima'' is an arable [[wet rice]] agricultural land with rice surpluses available for taxation, and officially recognised through royal edict. Most of these ''sima'' lands are ruled by regional ''rakai'' or ''samget'' (landed gentry) in their realm. By acquiring prestigious ''sima'' status from the king, a ''watak'' regional unit held a higher prestige compared to non-''sima'' settlements, yet this also means acknowledging the kingdom's overlordship over their land and swore their allegiance to the king. The Rakais that rule the land are granted a royal permission to collect tax, yet some parts of these tax should be regularly paid to the king's court (central government in the capital). In some instance, some of these ''sima'' inscription stated that this ''sima'' land has become a tax-free land, in exchange that the rice harvest surpluses collected from this land are used to construct or maintain a religious building. This means the ''rakai'' that traditionally ruled this lands no longer has the right to collect the tax, or at least reducing their tax earnings.\n\nOther than their administrative and military-defense function, the king and the royal family is also known as the patron of arts and also religious piousness. The king, the royal family and the kingdom's officials had the authority to launch public projects, such as irrigation works or temple construction. The royal art and religious patronage can be seen in sponsoring temples constructions. The kingdom left behind several temples and monuments. The most notable ones are Borobudur, Prambanan, [[Sewu]], and the [[Plaosan]] temple compound.\n\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebf op de Borobudur TMnr 10027564.jpg|thumb|left|The bas-relief in 8th century [[Borobudur]] depicting rice agriculture in ancient Java]]\nThe common people of Medang mostly made a living in agriculture, especially as [[rice]] farmers, however, some may have pursued other careers, such as hunter, trader, artisan, weaponsmith, sailor, soldier, dancer, musician, food or drink vendor, etc. Rich portrayals of daily life in 9th century Java can be seen in many temple bas-reliefs. Rice cultivation had become the base for the kingdom's economy where the villages throughout the realm relied on their annual rice yield to pay taxes to the court. Exploiting the fertile volcanic soil of Central Java and the intensive wet rice cultivation (''sawah'') enabled the population to grow significantly, which contributed to the availability of labour and workforce for the state's public projects. Certain villages and lands were given the status as ''sima'' lands awarded through royal edict written in inscriptions. The rice yields from ''sima'' lands usually were allocated for the maintenance of certain religious buildings.\n\n[[File:Javanese gold mas or tahil ingot.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Earliest evidence of a [[currency]] system in Java. Javanese [[gold]] ''mas'' or ''tahil'' ingots, circa the 9th century.]]\n\nThe economic activity was also not solely centred in a single marketplace in the capital city. It is most likely that the marketplace was rotated in daily basis within a week among participating villages, in a Javanese system called ''pasaran''. This system still can be found in rural Javanese villages, before most are turned into a permanent marketplace as it is commonly found today. The economic trading practice in these marketplace are most likely done in [[barter]] as well as using money, as during this period, Javanese economy has been partly monetised.\n\nThe bas-reliefs from temples of this period, especially from [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] describe occupations and careers other than agricultural pursuit; such as soldiers, government officials, court servants, massage therapists, travelling musicians and dancing troupe, food and drink sellers, logistics courier, sailors, merchants, even thugs and robbers are depicted in everyday life of 9th century Java. These occupations requires economic system that employs [[currency]]. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]], golden artefacts discovered in 1990, revealed gold coins in shape similar to corn seeds, which suggests that 9th century Javan economy is partly monetised. On the surface of the gold coins engraved with a script ''\"ta\"'', a short form of ''\"tail\"'' or ''\"tahil\"'' a unit of currency in ancient Java.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Society ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf Borobudur TMnr 60042617.jpg|thumb|upright|A nobleman accompanied by his entourage and servants, a bas-relief of Borobudur.]]\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Detail van reli\u00ebf O 105 op de verborgen voet van de Borobudur TMnr 10015664.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Buddhist]] hermit meditating in secluded forest, Borobudur bas-relief.]]\nA complex and stratified society of ancient Javanese people and their social order can be seen through studies on the rich portrayal in bas-reliefs from this period, as well as inscription studies. The kingdom had developed a complex society; which characterised by heterogeneity of their society, inequality of social stratification, and the formation of national administrative institution in their kingdom.<ref name=\"Peradaban35\"/> The ancient Javanese did recognise the Hindu ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|catur varna]]'' or [[caste]] social classes; [[Brahmana]] (priests), [[Kshatriya]] (kings, warlords and nobles), [[Vaishya]] (traders and artisans), and [[Shudra]] (servants and slaves). Nevertheless, the social stratification system in ancient Java slightly differ from those of India, as it less rigid.<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=49\u201350 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n\nPigeaud divides ancient Javanese society into four classes: the ruling class, religious authority, commoners, and slaves.<ref>Pigeaud, 1958: 195</ref> While de Casparis suggest; although the ancient Javanese society recognise caste differences, their rules and implementations was less rigid compared to those caste system in India. De Casparis divides them into three groups:\n# The commoners that formed the majority of kingdom's population.\n# The king with his royal family, including those nobles, landlords and the member of elite ruling class that depends on the king's court and his dynasty. Can be commonly called \"the palace/court people\".\n# The religious figures and religious authorities. The priests class; brahmins and monks, includes the lower rank servants employed in temple compounds and monasteries.<ref>de Casparis, 1954: 56</ref>\n\nBased on the study of the styles and types of clothing and jewelries worn by people depicted in bas-reliefs from the temple \u2014 especially Borobudur reliefs \u2014 the ancient Javanese society roughly can be divided into:<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=55\u201356 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n# '''The nobles''', the king and the royal families, landlords, nobles and those that related to ruling elites. They wore luxurious clothing of ''kain'' long clothes wrapped around their hips to the ankle, waistband, and [[sash]] either wore around their hips as ''sampur'', or wore around their body hanging from left shoulder to the hip. Adorned with intricate golden jewelries such as ''jamang'' (forehead ornaments), ''makuta'' (crown), earrings, ''kelat bahu'' ([[armlet]]), necklace, ''upavita'' (body ornament of golden chains wore across the chest), bracelets, rings, ankle bracelet. The gods and divinities also portrayed in similar fashion as nobles, although they are described as having ''prabhamandala'' (divine [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]) around their head.\n# '''The royal servants''' or '''lower-ranked nobles''', they are king's servants, entourages or royal attendants. They occupied positions as ''dayang-dayang'' (female royal attendants), guard or state officials. They wore long cloth around their hips to the ankle, and wore jewelries and ornaments too, such as earrings, necklace and bracelets, although not as complete and luxurious as those worn by the king and the nobles.\n# '''The priests''', the [[brahmin]]s, Buddhist monks, or those religious figures employed in temples or monasteries. They usually wore robes or cloaks called ''sinhel''. Buddhist monks were usually portrayed as bald men wore robe with open right shoulder, while brahmins were usually depicted as bearded men wearing [[turbans]]. \n# '''The commoners''', the majority of the people, mostly described as villagers. They wore simple clothing of around their hips, the lower end sometimes being tied upward to create a short [[loincloth]]. Usually they wore no jewelry or ornaments, but some wore a few simple ornaments, including necklaces or bracelets, or a rope worn as a waistband.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple]]\n\n[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are the two religions adhered by the rulers and people of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the commoners' religious practices were probably still mixed with native [[shamanism]] and indigenous pre-Dharmic beliefs. Since the beginning of its formation, the Medang Mataram kings seemed to favour [[Shivaist]] Hinduism, such as the construction of [[linga]] in Gunung Wukir Hindu temple as mentioned in Canggal inscription by king Sanjaya. However, during the reign of [[Panangkaran]], [[Mahayana]] Buddhism began to blossomed and gain court favour. The [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and the magnificent [[Borobudur]] temples testify the Buddhist renaissance in Central Java. The court patronage on Buddhism spanned from the reign of Panangkaran to [[Samaratungga]]. During the reign of Pikatan, Shivaist Hinduism began to regain court's favour, signified by the construction of grand Shivagrha (Prambanan).\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Mahadewa in de Lara Djonggrang hindoe-tempel te Prambanan TMnr 60033679.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shiva]] statue in main chamber of [[Prambanan]].]]\nThe kingdom recognised the religious authority of priest class, the [[brahmin]]s. Buddhism was also well represented through the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] Buddhist monastic community, consists of [[Buddhist monks]] living in [[vihara]]s such as Sari and Plaosan and gaining court patronage. These Hindu and Buddhist religious authorities conducted state's and regional religious rituals and ceremonies in the temples. The ruling class of [[kshatriya]] royal family also indulged in spiritualism. Some monarch seems to immerse themselves in spiritualism and religion. For example, King Panangkaran seems to be deeply influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and even strive to become a hermit during his later days. Numbers of other kings such as Samaragrawira and Samaratungga was also deeply influenced by Buddhism and strive to become a benevolent leaders. Rakai Pikatan also abdicated and renounced worldly affairs during his old days and become a [[rishi]] hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat.\n\nThe period between the reign of King Panangkaran to the reign of King Balitung (late 8th century to the early 10th century) saw a fervent temple construction in the kingdom. This was probably motivated either by religious zeal, kingdom's immense wealth and resources or social-political reasons. Some historians such as Munoz suggest, that this ardent temple construction projects was actually a religious-political tool to control the regional ''Rakai'' landlords, to prevent them from rebelling against the king.<ref>{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |doi= |pages= |isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}</ref> During this time, each of regional ''watak'' are ruled by ''Rakai'' landlords that nurturing their own dynasty. By appointing the Rakais' ''sima'' land to fund the construction and maintenance of a ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' religious building, the Maharaja depriving the Rakais' ability to collect large sum of tax, that can be potentially misused to fund some army that might rose to challenge the Maharaja's authority. The Rakais might be willingly or reluctantly compliant to the king's will, for refusing to construct religious building might harm their reputation, and cast them not only as the enemy of the king, but also as the enemy of gods or Buddha.\n\n=== Art and Architecture ===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Wonoboyo Hoard.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] displays the immense wealth and artistic achievement of the Medang kingdom.]]\nOther than examining bas-reliefs carved on the temple's walls, the study of ancient Javanese society is also conducted through archaeological relics.

From this time, the kingdom saw exuberant temple construction projects, such as [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Lumbung]], [[Ngawen]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and peaked in the construction of [[Borobudur]], the massive stone [[mandala]], that took shape of a mountain temple pinnacled with [[stupa]]s that completed c. 825 CE.\n\n[[File:Prambanan Shiva Temple.jpg|thumb|left|The magnificent 9th century Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]], [[Yogyakarta]], was a major Hindu monument in the kingdom of Medang.]]\n\nThe monumental Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]] in the vicinity of Yogyakarta&nbsp;\u2014 initially built during the reign of King Pikatan (838\u2014850), and expanded continuously through the reign of Lokapala (850\u2014890) to [[Balitung]] (899\u2013911)&nbsp;\u2014 is a fine example of ancient Medang Mataram art and architecture. The description of a grand temple compound dedicated for lord Shiva, and the public project to shift the course of the river near the temple (Opak river) to run straight along western wall of temple compound was also mentioned in [[Shivagrha inscription]]. The grand temple complex was dedicated to the ''[[Trimurti]]'', the three highest gods in the Hindu [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu). It was the largest Hindu temple ever built in [[Indonesia]], evidence of the immense wealth and cultural achievement of the kingdom.\n\nOther Hindu temples dated from Medang Mataram Kingdom era are: [[Sambisari]], [[Gebang Temple|Gebang]], Barong, Ijo, and Morangan. Although the Shivaist regain the favour, Buddhist remain under royal patronage. The Sewu temple dedicated for [[Manjusri]] according to [[Kelurak inscription]] was probably initially built by Panangkaran, but later expanded and completed during Rakai Pikatan's rule, whom married to a Buddhist princess [[Pramodhawardhani]], daughter of Samaratungga. Most of their subjects retained their old religion; Shivaists and Buddhists seemed to co-exist in harmony. The Buddhist temple of [[Plaosan]], [[Banyunibo]] and [[Sajiwan]] were built during the reign of King Pikatan and Queen Pramodhawardhani, probably in the spirit of religious reconciliation after the succession disputes between Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani against [[Balaputra]].\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016190.jpg|thumb|Bas relief in [[Prambanan]] depicting a scene taken from [[Ramayana]]. The translation of Indian epic into Javanese [[Kakawin Ramayana]] took place during Medang Mataram kingdom.]]\n\nFrom the 9th to mid 10th centuries, the Medang Kingdom witnessed the blossoming of art, culture and literature, mainly through the translation of Hindu-Buddhist sacred texts and the transmission and adaptation of Hindu-Buddhist ideas into Old Javanese text and visual bas-reliefs rendering. The bas-relief carved on each sides of [[Mendut]] temple stairs and also on the base of [[Sojiwan]] temple for example, narrating the popular [[Jataka]] Buddhist tales, the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The [[Borobudur]] bas-relief particularly, contains the most complete rendering of Buddhist sacred texts. Ranged from [[Karma]]vibhanga (the law of [[karma]]), [[Lalitavistara]] (the story of the Buddha), the tale of [[Manohara]], [[Jataka]] and Jatakamala, [[Avadana]] (collection of virtuous deeds) and [[Gandavyuha]] ([[Sudhana]]'s quest for the ultimate truth).\n\nThe bas-relief narration of the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' and also was carved on the wall of Prambanan temple's Shiva and Brahma temples, while the stories of [[Krishna]] taken from [[Bhagavata Purana]] was carved on Vishnu temple. During this period, the [[Kakawin Ramayana|Kakawin ''Ramayana'']], an old [[Javanese language|Javanese]] rendering was written. This Kakawin Ramayana, also called the ''Yogesvara Ramayana'', is attributed to the scribe Yogesvara c. the 9th century CE, who was employed in the court of the Medang in Central Java. It has 2774 [[stanza]]s in the ''manipravala'' style, a mixture of Sanskrit and [[Kawi language|archaic Javanese prose]]. The most influential version of the ''Ramayana'' is the ''Ravanavadham'' of [[Bhatti]], popularly known as ''Bhattikavya''. The Javanese ''Ramayana'' differs markedly from the original Hindu.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\nMedang kingdom had an exceptionally intense relations with the regional hegemon [[Srivijaya]] of Sumatra. In earlier period, the relations was close and intimate, as Sailendran kings of Java has formed an alliance with Maharaja of Srivijaya and the two royal houses seems to be merged. In later period however, the relations was deteriorated to warfare, as Dharmawangsa launched failed attempt to capture Palembang, and Srivijaya well-crafted retaliation ensued. In its eastern boundary, the Medang kingdom seems to subjugate the neighboring [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]], and pulled the island into its sphere of influence.\n{{multiple image|align=right|perrow=2|total_width=500|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=Borobudur-Nothwest-view.jpg|width1=131|image2=Bakong 01.jpg|width2=131|footer=Comparison between left: [[Borobudur]] of Java (825) and right: [[Bakong]] of Cambodia (881), both temples had similar basic design of [[stepped pyramid]] and similar corbelling method, which suggest there was a connection of influence between ancient Java and Cambodia.}}\n\nThe Khmer art and architecture during the formative early [[Angkor]] era also believed to being influenced by Javanese art and architecture; the striking similarity of the [[Bakong]] temple in [[Cambodia]] to Borobudur, strongly suggests that Bakong was inspired by Borobudur's design.

The Mataram Kingdom era has left a profound impact in [[Javanese culture]].]]\n\nThe Medang Mataram era is hailed as the classical period of Javanese civilisation; for during this period the Javanese culture, art and architecture was blossoming and developed further, consolidated and mixed their indigenous elements with dharmic influences. By incorporating Hindu-Buddhist frame of reference and elements into their culture, art and architecture, and by [[Sanskritization]] their language, Javanese has formulating their own Hindu-Buddhist Javanese style and developing an ingenious civilisation. This Javanese style of Sailendran art, either in sculpture and architecture, in return influenced regional arts, particularly the Srivijayan art in Sumatra and Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula.\n\nIt was also during this period that numbers of dharmic scriptures either Hindu or Buddhist, has made their way from [[India]] into [[Javanese culture]]. For example, the tales of Buddhist [[Jataka]]s and [[Lalitavistara]], also Hindu epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] were adopted into Javanese version.

It is used by about 66,000 passengers per day and 24,000,000 per year. The first temporary station was opened in 1854 at the end of the [[Turin\u2013Genoa railway|line from Turin]].  Lines were later opened to [[Genoa\u2013Milan railway|Milan]], [[Pisa\u2013La Spezia\u2013Genoa railway|Rome]] and [[Genoa\u2013Ventimiglia railway|the French border]] at [[Ventimiglia railway station|Ventimiglia]].\n\n==History==\nThe station derives its name from the adjacent Piazza del Principe (In [[Italian language|Italian]] literally \"plaza of the prince\"), located next to the Palazzo del Principe (literally \"palace of the prince\") adjacent to the street called Via Andrea Doria in the Fassolo neighbourhood. The small goods yard, which was the core of the original station, occupies the area between Piazza del Principe, Via Andrea Doria and Piazza Acquaverde, where the main entrance is situated.\n\nForeigners often call the station ''Genova Porta Principe'', perhaps confused by the names of stations in other cities, such as [[Milano Porta Garibaldi railway station|Milano Porta Garibaldi]] and [[Torino Porta Nuova railway station|Torino Porta Nuova]]. Note that there was once a gate in the medieval city walls called ''Porta San&nbsp;Tommaso'' (and sometimes called ''Porta Principe'') where the steps to the Piazza Principe Metro station are now located and where some remains of the walls can still be seen. It was demolished in the nineteenth century.\n\n[[File:Dinegro-inaugurazione ferrovia 1854.jpg|thumb|left|Opening of the Piazza Principe\u2013Sampierdarena section in 1854]]\nThe original station was designed by architect Alexander Mazzucchetti and construction began in 1853 and was completed and inaugurated in 1860.  The original building had a single-span steel and glass roof, covering ten platforms and buildings for arrivals, departures and transiting passengers. At the time of the official inauguration of the Turin-Genoa railway in February 1854 only a temporary station had been opened.<ref name=fs>{{cite web | title=Genova Piazza Principe | publisher=[[Ferrovie dello Stato]] | url=http://www.grandistazioni.it/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=6cc307c09d09a110VgnVCM1000003f16f90aRCRD | accessdate=2 September 2009 | language=Italian | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820075045/http://www.grandistazioni.it/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=6cc307c09d09a110VgnVCM1000003f16f90aRCRD | archive-date=20 August 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1872, with the opening of the tunnel directly connecting with Brignole station, through platforms were added on the north of the original station. Until the 1960s the terminal platforms were used for passenger trains, mainly for local services to and from the west and north. Since then all passenger trains have operated on the eleven through tracks, while the terminal tracks are now used for the storage of wagons and locomotives.\n\nIn 1900, an increase in rail traffic led to the building of an extension of the station to a design by the engineer Giacomo Radini Tedeschi.<ref name=fs/>\n\nOn 15 May 1916, the station was electrified at 3,300 V AC [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] at 15&nbsp;Hz. It was converted to the current standard of  to 3000&nbsp;volts [[direct current|DC]], first on the [[Pisa\u2013La Spezia\u2013Genoa railway|Genoa\u2013Rome line]] and later on the [[Genoa\u2013Milan railway|Genoa\u2013Milan line]]. The last to abandon the three-phase system was the [[Turin\u2013Genoa railway|Genoa\u2013Turin line]] between 1962 and 1964. During the [[Second World War]], in common with other Italian railway stations, the roof covering the tracks was dismantled to extract its metal.\n\nIn order to handle an increase in metropolitan traffic an underground connection was opened in 1993 between [[Genova Brignole railway station|Genoa Brignole]] and [[Genova Sampierdarena railway station|Genoa Sampierdarena]], including a new underground station under Genova Piazza Principe with two platforms called ''Genova Principe Sotterranea''. Access to the underground station can be reached either via the escalators in the main station building or from an area located near the ''Genoa Maritime Terminal'' (Italian: ''Stazione marittima di Genova'') between the streets of Piazza del&nbsp;Principe, Via Fanti d'Italia and Via Bersaglieri d'Italia, where there is an interchange between rail, bus and metro.<ref>Mario Bianchi: ''Il passante di Genova.''
