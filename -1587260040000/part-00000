He is an [[Android (robot)|android]] and a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] who first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' #57 (October 1968). He is loosely based on the [[Timely Comics]] [[Vision (Timely Comics)|character of the same name]].\n\n[[Paul Bettany]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018). Bettany will be reprising the role in the [[Disney+]] upcoming series ''[[WandaVision]]'' (2020).\n\n== Publication history ==\nEditor [[Stan Lee]] and writer [[Roy Thomas]] decided to add a new team member to the superhero-team series ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]''. Thomas wanted to bring back the Golden Age [[Vision (Aarkus)]] but Lee was set on introducing an android member. Thomas ultimately compromised by using a new, android Vision.<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= December 2010|title= Shattered Dreams: Vision and the Scarlet Witch|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 59\u201365| publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The second Vision [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''The Avengers'' #57 (Oct. 1968). Thomas wanted the character to be white as befitting his ghostly name, but printing limitations of the time would have rendered him colorless, with un-inked paper where his skin should be. He settled on red as he did not want Vision to be green like the [[Hulk]] or blue like the [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/age-ultron-creator-roy-thomas-791320|title=Marvel Legend Reveals What Stan Lee Initially \"Hated\" About 'Age of Ultron' Breakout|publisher=}}</ref> The character has been compared with [[Spock]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'', but Thomas said that he was barely aware of the TV series at the time.<ref name=\"oral\">{{cite web |url= https://www.yahoo.com/movies/the-secret-origins-of-vision-and-ultron-an-oral-118171812977.html|title= The Secret Origins of Vision and Ultron: An Oral History|author=Marcus Errico|date= May 6, 2015|publisher= Yahoo|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> He acknowledged being influenced by the [[Adam Link]] character by [[Otto Binder]], one of the first robots treated as a sympathetic character rather than as a mechanical tool.<ref name=\"oral\" />\n\nIn ''The Avengers'' #75 (April 1970), the [[Scarlet Witch]] is reintroduced to the team and soon becomes a love interest for Vision. Thomas recounted, \"I felt that a romance of some sort would help the character development in ''The Avengers'', and the Vision was a prime candidate because he appeared only in that mag... as did Wanda, for that matter. So they became a pair, for just such practical considerations. It would also, I felt, add to the development I was doing on the Vision's attempting to become \u2018human.\u2019\"<ref name=\"back45\" /> Thomas also came up with the idea of the Vision having been created from the body of the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], but only planted a vague clue to this (in ''The Avengers'' #93) before leaving the series. It was finally followed up in ''The Avengers'' #134\u2013135. Writer [[Steve Englehart]] explained, \"That plot was well known in-house for years, and since Roy [Thomas] and [[Neal Adams|Neal [Adams]]] hadn't had a chance to do it, I did it on my watch with Roy's blessing.\"<ref name=\"Back38\">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 38|page= 25|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Vision appeared with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #5, \"A Passion of the Mind\", in which a giant robot scout from [[the Kree-Skrull War]] is found to be interfering with Vision's brain waves.\n\nVision and Scarlet Witch were married in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975). The couple starred in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[The Vision and the Scarlet Witch]]'' #1\u20134 (Nov. 1982 \u2013 Feb. 1983), by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[penciller]] [[Rick Leonardi]]. This was followed by a second volume numbered #1\u201312 (Oct. 1985 \u2013 Sept. 1986), written by Steve Englehart and penciled by [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]], in which the Scarlet Witch gives birth to twin boys conceived with Vision through magical means.\n\nThe \"Vision Quest\" story in ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' #42\u201345 (March \u2013 June 1989) by writer/penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took the character away from his earlier depictions as a \"synthetic human\" and emphasized his android nature. The story had the Vision's memory and human brain patterns wiped out, severed his relationship with his wife, revealed their children to be essentially imaginary constructs, and included a two-page spread showing a dismantled Vision. Journalist Karen Walker later commented, \"This image alone has probably done more to shape how future writers (and readers) perceive the character than anything before or since. Once seen broken down into component parts, it's hard to truly move past that image and think of Vision as a synthetic man, not a machine.\"<ref name=\"back45\" />\n\nVision appeared in a solo limited series, ''Vision'', #1\u20134 (Nov. 1994 \u2013 Feb. 1995), by writer [[Bob Harras]] and penciller Manny Clark. Nearly a decade after that came a second four-issue volume (Oct. 2002 \u2013 Jan. 2003), written by [[Geoff Johns]] and penciled by [[Ivan Reis]].\n\nThe series ''[[Young Avengers]]'', which ran 12 issues from April 2005 to August 2006, introduced [[Vision (Jonas)|a new Vision]], who is a combination of the synthezoid Vision's program files and the armor and mental engrams of the hero [[Iron Lad]].\n\nVision appeared as a regular character in the 2010\u20132013 ''Avengers'' series, from issue #19 (January 2012) through its final issue #34 (January 2013).\n\nVision again appeared in a solo series, ''Vision'', with #1 that started in November 2015 and ended with #12 in October 2016.\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n[[File:Avengers57.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Debut of the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] Vision: ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #57 (Oct. 1968).

Ultron sends his new servant to lead the Avengers into a trap. Wasp is the first to encounter the synthezoid, and describes it as a \"vision\" while trying to escape.

This was part of his plan to nurture a relationship for the Scarlet Witch that would prevent her from having any children, as her power level meant that any offspring she might have could threaten the cosmic beings of the Marvel Universe.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #8 (July 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNot long after joining the team, Vision is temporarily controlled by Ultron, and rebuilds Ultron out of adamantium, battling the Avengers before regaining control of himself.<ref>''Avengers'' #66\u201368.

Marvel Comics.</ref> and even after regaining consciousness weeks later,<ref>''Avengers'' #238 (Nov. 1983). Marvel Comics.</ref> remains paralyzed and assumes a [[Holography|holographic]] form.

Marvel Comics.</ref> With the aid of the Avengers, Vision is restored to his normal self, but now closely monitored by a coalition of governments.<ref>''Avengers'' #253\u2013254 (March\u2013April 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the \"Vision Quest\" storyline, rogue agents of the [[United States]] government, manipulated by the [[time travel]]er [[Immortus]], abduct the Vision and dismantle him. The Avengers recover the parts, and Dr. Pym rebuilds Vision, but with a chalk-white complexion. However, the revived Simon Williams does not allow his brain patterns to be used again to provide a matrix for Vision's emotions, explaining that the original process, done without his consent, had \"ripped out his soul\". This, along with damage to Vision's synthetic skin when he was dismantled, results in the synthezoid's resurrection as a colorless and emotionless [[Android (robot)|artificial human]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #42\u201344 (March\u2013May 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] also returns from his own apparent demise, casting doubt on Vision's identity. Vision and the Scarlet Witch's children are then revealed to be fragments of the soul of the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who had been broken apart by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] shortly before the birth of the twins. The twins are absorbed back into Mephisto, which temporarily drives Wanda insane. Although she recovers, Wanda and Vision separate, each operating on a different Avengers team.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #51\u201352 (Nov.-Dec. 1989).

Marvel Comics.</ref> While recovering, Vision gives up his attempt to reconcile with his wife, although he is revealed to retain a fondness for her culture, such as visiting a restaurant that specifically caters to Wanda's childhood community simply because he enjoys the ambience. Remaining a member of the Avengers, he briefly becomes romantically involved with teammates [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]] (a.k.a. Warbird/Ms. Marvel) and [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] before attempting again to reconcile with the Scarlet Witch.\n\n=== Disassembled / Reassembled ===\nGrief over the loss of the twins, however, drives Wanda insane again, and she attempts to alter reality to recreate them. This causes a series of catastrophic events that includes Vision crashing an Avengers [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]] into [[Avengers Mansion]]. The Vision advises his teammates that he is no longer in control of his body, and then expels several spheres that form into five Ultrons. The Avengers destroy them, and an enraged [[She-Hulk]] tears apart the remains of the Vision, having been driven to a breaking point by the rapid slew of attacks against the Avengers. The Avengers later believed that [[Ultron]] may have put a command in the Vision that would have been activated by the Avengers' Code White alert during one of the many periods in which Vision was held prisoner by Ultron, though it was later revealed that Dr. Doom forced Scarlet Witch to send Vision against her teammates.<ref name=\"avengersdisassembled\">''The Avengers'' #500 (Sept. 2004).

In ''Mighty Avengers'' the original Vision and Iron Lad are briefly separated from this being by the power of the Cosmic Cube.<ref>'' The Mighty Avengers'' #33 (Jan. 2010).

Marvel Comics.</ref> After being informed about what happened after his destruction, the Vision sees She-Hulk, telling her he does not blame her for what happened. He then goes to Utopia to confront [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], threatening Magneto to tell him where Wanda is. Magneto uses his powers to subdue the Vision but spares him, saying he believes Wanda still cares for the Vision and that Magneto does not want to hurt her more. Captain America talks to the Vision afterward, telling him he needs to move forward.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #24.1 (May 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring a subsequent confrontation with the returned Wanda at the start of the \"[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]\" story line, Vision claims that her use of his body to attack his friends is something that he cannot forgive and, while he banishes her from the mansion, he also sheds tears after her departure.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0 (May 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' relaunch, Vision leaves the Avengers in order to find himself following a battle with [[Sunturion]].

'Doom' claims that he brought this team together to assist him in defeating Ultron's conquest of the world.<ref>''Avengers: Ultron Forever'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although Doom's true plan is revealed at the story's conclusion to be a desire to take Ultron's place, Vision eventually reveals that this Doom is actually the Doombot who worked with him in the Avengers A.I., convincing the Doombot to abandon his plan by noting that simply following Doom's example ignores the more positive aspects of Doom's history as the man who refused to let anyone else dictate his terms.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers: Ultron Forever'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAs part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]], Vision is a member of a new team of Avengers,<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> although his emotional data has been lost once again after a series of hallucinations forced him to delete the emotional data to restore himself to a functional state, having been overwhelmed with guilt when he was unable to save the sole survivor of a crashed bus.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, after he provides fake evidence to force new heroes Nova and Ms. Marvel to leave the team, it is revealed that he is working for [[Kang the Conqueror]] as Kang mounts his latest assault on the team,<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> having been contaminated when Kang interfered with his recent reprogramming. However, Vision is released from Kang's control when Iron Man manages to purge his software, allowing him to turn on Kang and help the Avengers defeat him, although in the aftermath he departs to consider how easily he fell under Kang's control.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Vision was given a solo series. In the series, he lives in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] with a newly-created synthezoid family: his wife Virginia, son Vin, and daughter [[Viv Vision]]. They attempt to live a normal [[suburb]]an life with Vision working as a consultant to the president, but they find socializing with neighbors difficult. The [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] attacks their house and nearly kills Viv.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Virginia claims that the Reaper escaped, but Vision eventually finds his remains buried in the backyard. He lies to the police and covers for Virginia when asked about her whereabouts during the murder of one of Viv's classmates, whose father tried to blackmail Virginia for the murder.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Instead of confronting her, he creates a synthezoid dog for the family in an attempt to return to normalcy. Unbeknownst to him, [[Agatha Harkness]] has a vision of the future and warns the Avengers that Vision and his family will cause a genocide.<ref>''The Vision'' Vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Avengers sent [[Victor Mancha]], Vision's \"brother\", to secretly investigate the family. When Vin discovers Victor reporting back to the Avengers, the latter attempts to use his electro-magnetic powers to contain Vin and prevent him from outing his operations, but a miscalculation caused him to damage Vin's nerve systems beyond repair.<ref>''Vision'' Vol 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vision sets out to Arlington Courthouse Jail to exact revenge on Victor. Virginia reveals to Viv that she had murdered her classmate. Viv's resulting emotional outburst prompts Virginia to let out her anger on Sparky, killing it. Among the dog's remains, Virginia notices a petal of the Wundagore Everbloom that it had consumed, a plant capable of giving a person a vision of the future under certain parameters. With Sparky's death having fulfilled the conditions for the Everbloom to work, Virginia eats the petal. Seeing that Vision would go down a dark path if he killed Victor Mancha, she flies to the jail and murders Victor herself.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Fearing the fate of Viv if both of her parents were to be prosecuted for their actions, Virginia calls the detective investigating their neighbours' disappearance and claims full responsibility for both her and her husband's crimes, stating she had tampered with Vision's operative system. Virginia proceeds to drink water with corrosive properties from a Zenn-Lavian water vase they have in their home, and asks Vision to sit with her until the water kills her.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]\" story line, Vision appears as a member of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s Avengers at the time Hydra took over the United States and when Captain America believed himself to be a Hydra sleeper agent.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultron/Hank Pym reveals during his \"dinner\" with members of the Underground, Captain America, and Hydra's Avengers that Vision has been affected by an A.I. virus.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #4</ref> While briefing Captain America about the status of Hydra's Avengers, [[Madame Hydra]] mentions the virus was created by [[Arnim Zola]], as well as stating that Vision is trying to fight its control.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the battle in Washington DC, Vision sees his freed daughter Viv. Seeing her enables him to free himself of the virus, which spreads to the Hydra Dreadnoughts and shuts them down.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nVision is described as being \"every inch a human being\u2014except that all of his bodily organs are constructed of synthetic materials.\"<ref>''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #57 (Oct. 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Solar Jewel on Vision's forehead absorbs ambient [[solar energy]] to provide the power needed for him to function, and he is also capable of discharging this energy as optic beams; with this, he can fire beams of [[Infrared radiation|infrared]] and [[microwave radiation]]. In extreme cases he can discharge this same power through the Solar Jewel itself which amplifies its destructive effects considerably, albeit at the cost of losing most of his resources. By interfacing with an unknown dimension to which he can shunt and from which he can accrue mass, thus becoming either intangible or extraordinarily massive, Vision can change his [[density]], which at its lowest allows flight and a ghostly, phasing intangibility, and at its heaviest, a density ten times greater than that of [[depleted uranium]],<ref>''Avengers'' #332. Marvel Comics.</ref> which gives him superhuman strength, immovability, and a diamond-hard near invulnerability. On one occasion, Vision uses this extreme density to render unconscious the villain [[Count Nefaria]];<ref>''Avengers'' #166 (Dec. 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> at other times, he thrusts an intangible hand into them and then partially re-materializes it, a process he describes as \"physical disruption.\" This effect typically causes great pain and results in incapacitation, as when used against the [[Earth-712]] version of the hero [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141 (Nov. 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> Being an artificial life-form/android of sorts, Vision has superhuman senses, superhuman stamina, reflexes, speed, agility, strength (even without being at high density), superhuman analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The Vision was trained in hand-to-hand combat by [[Captain America]], is an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers, and is a highly skilled tactician and strategist. The Vision is an expert on his own construction and repair.\n\nAfter the [[Age of Ultron]], Vision joins the [[Avengers A.I.]] team where his \"evolve\" protocols were activated and now his body is formed from millions of nanobots. He can now split himself into smaller parts and change shape.<ref name=\"Avengers A.I. #1\"/>\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n=== Anti-Vision ===\nDuring the story arc \"The Gatherers\" in the Avengers' books, the villain [[Proctor (comics)|Proctor]], who was from an alternate timeline, came to [[Earth-616]] with a version of Vision from yet another timeline. Proctor would wind up switching the bodies of both Visions and have his version infiltrate the Avengers as his mole.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1 #306</ref> The original Vision would eventually be freed and he would eventually take the Anti-Vision into custody when he came back to collect his original body.<ref name=\"Vision\">''Vision'' #1\u20134.

Main Frame is the chief operating system of an entire planet, and the guardian of the [[shield]] of hero [[Captain America]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #5 (Oct. 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> He soon joins the Guardians of the Galaxy spinoff, the [[Galactic Guardians]].<ref>''Galactic Guardians'' #1\u20134. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n=== Earth X ===\nA version of the modern Vision appeared in ''[[Earth X]]''. Vision and the Avengers were fighting the [[Absorbing Man]] who had absorbed the intelligence of [[Ultron]], giving him enhanced intelligence and better control over his powers. Vision watched as his teammates and wife the Scarlet Witch were slaughtered before his eyes. In response, Vision downloaded a computer virus into the Absorbing Man. When the Absorbing Man tried to purge the virus by shrinking and changing into stone, the Vision smashed him into pieces. In order to prevent the Absorbing Man from being reborn, the Vision had the parts of Creel distributed among various loners and reclusive super-heroes. When Tony Stark created a group of Iron Avengers, robots based on Stark technology and modeled after the deceased Avengers, Vision was tapped as the group's leader. He would lead the Iron Avengers and defend them from such threats as the parasitic [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]], [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim|Frost Giants]], and the [[Red Skull|Skull]]'s invading army.<ref>''Earth X'' #1\u20135. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n=== Exiles ===\nA bloodthirsty and arrogant version of Vision was a member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]' counterpart Weapon X.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 1 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> This Vision was very single minded in completing their murderous missions. He had a habit of pointing out to his teammates that he would survive many attacks that could kill them. He was able to single-handedly hold off the entire Exiles himself before being incapacitated and damaged by advanced Nimrod Sentinels on a parallel Earth dominated by the mutant hunting robots.{{issue|date=September 2012}} Despite the damage inflicted by the Sentinels he continued to serve on several more Weapon X missions. Ultimately Vision was blasted into pieces by [[Hyperion (comics)#alternate versions|King Hyperion]] when he refused to join Hyperion in his plan to conquer one of the many parallel earths.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 1 #38. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although briefly left alive in pieces Vision was finally killed when a huge asteroid, launched by that world's Magneto, struck the Earth and destroyed both the planet and Vision.{{issue|date=September 2012}}\n\n=== MC2 ===\nVision appears in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. The character is an adviser to the [[President of the United States]] and joins the young heroes in [[A-Next]], a future version of the Avengers.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #94 (Mar. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nSeveral versions of Vision are published under the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint.\n\nThe first version is a female who appears in the limited series ''[[Ultimate Nightmare]]''. The [[Ultimates]] and [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] discover a damaged, sentient robot who claims that its name's closest English translation is \"Vision\". The robot warns of the coming of the space invader [[Galactus|Gah Lak Tus]], Eater of Worlds.<ref>''Ultimate Nightmare'' #1 \u2013 5 (Oct. 2004 \u2013 Feb. 2005).

Thomas recounted, \"I felt that a romance of some sort would help the character development in ''The Avengers'', and the Vision was a prime candidate because he appeared only in that mag... as did Wanda, for that matter. So they became a pair, for just such practical considerations. It would also, I felt, add to the development I was doing on the Vision's attempting to become \u2018human.\u2019\"<ref name=\"back45\" /> Thomas also came up with the idea of the Vision having been created from the body of the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], but only planted a vague clue to this (in ''The Avengers'' #93) before leaving the series. It was finally followed up in ''The Avengers'' #134\u2013135. Writer [[Steve Englehart]] explained, \"That plot was well known in-house for years, and since Roy [Thomas] and [[Neal Adams|Neal [Adams]]] hadn't had a chance to do it, I did it on my watch with Roy\u2019s blessing.\"<ref name=\"Back38\">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 38|page= 25|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Vision appeared with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #5, \"A Passion of the Mind\", in which a giant robot scout from [[the Kree-Skrull War]] is found to be interfering with Vision's brain waves.\n\nVision and Scarlet Witch were married in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (June 1975).

This was followed by a second volume numbered #1\u201312 (Oct. 1985 \u2013 Sept. 1986), written by Steve Englehart and penciled by [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]], in which the Scarlet Witch gives birth to twin boys conceived with Vision through magical means.\n\nThe \"Vision Quest\" story in ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' #42\u201345 (March \u2013 June 1989) by writer/penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took the character away from his earlier depictions as a \"synthetic human\" and emphasized his android nature. The story had the Vision's memory and human brain patterns wiped out, severed his relationship with his wife, revealed their children to be essentially imaginary constructs, and included a two-page spread showing a dismantled Vision. Journalist Karen Walker later commented, \"This image alone has probably done more to shape how future writers (and readers) perceive the character than anything before or since.

Ultron sends his new servant to lead the Avengers into a trap. Wasp is the first to encounter the synthezoid, and describes it as a \"vision\" while trying to escape.

The Avengers recover the parts, and Dr. Pym rebuilds Vision, but with a chalk-white complexion. However, the revived Simon Williams does not allow his brain patterns to be used again to provide a matrix for Vision's emotions, explaining that the original process, done without his consent, had \"ripped out his soul\". This, along with damage to Vision's synthetic skin when he was dismantled, results in the synthezoid's resurrection as a colorless and emotionless [[Android (robot)|artificial human]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #42\u201344 (March\u2013May 1989).

Vision and the Scarlet Witch's children are then revealed to be fragments of the soul of the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who had been broken apart by [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] shortly before the birth of the twins.

Remaining a member of the Avengers, he briefly becomes romantically involved with teammates [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]] (a.k.a. Warbird/Ms. Marvel) and [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] before attempting again to reconcile with the Scarlet Witch.\n\n=== Disassembled / Reassembled ===\nGrief over the loss of the twins, however, drives Wanda insane again, and she attempts to alter reality to recreate them. This causes a series of catastrophic events that includes Vision crashing an Avengers [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]] into [[Avengers Mansion]]. The Vision advises his teammates that he is no longer in control of his body, and then expels several spheres that form into five Ultrons. The Avengers destroy them, and an enraged [[She-Hulk]] tears apart the remains of the Vision, having been driven to a breaking point by the rapid slew of attacks against the Avengers. The Avengers later believed that [[Ultron]] may have put a command in the Vision that would have been activated by the Avengers' Code White alert during one of the many periods in which Vision was held prisoner by Ultron, though it was later revealed that Dr. Doom forced Scarlet Witch to send Vision against her teammates.<ref name=\"avengersdisassembled\">''The Avengers'' #500 (Sept. 2004).

He then goes to Utopia to confront [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], threatening Magneto to tell him where Wanda is. Magneto uses his powers to subdue the Vision but spares him, saying he believes Wanda still cares for the Vision and that Magneto does not want to hurt her more. Captain America talks to the Vision afterward, telling him he needs to move forward.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #24.1 (May 2012). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring a subsequent confrontation with the returned Wanda at the start of the \"[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]\" story line, Vision claims that her use of his body to attack his friends is something that he cannot forgive and, while he banishes her from the mansion, he also sheds tears after her departure.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0 (May 2012).

'Doom' claims that he brought this team together to assist him in defeating Ultron's conquest of the world.<ref>''Avengers: Ultron Forever'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although Doom's true plan is revealed at the story's conclusion to be a desire to take Ultron's place, Vision eventually reveals that this Doom is actually the Doombot who worked with him in the Avengers A.I., convincing the Doombot to abandon his plan by noting that simply following Doom's example ignores the more positive aspects of Doom's history as the man who refused to let anyone else dictate his terms.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers: Ultron Forever'' #1.

Marvel Comics.</ref> However, after he provides fake evidence to force new heroes Nova and Ms. Marvel to leave the team, it is revealed that he is working for [[Kang the Conqueror]] as Kang mounts his latest assault on the team,<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> having been contaminated when Kang interfered with his recent reprogramming. However, Vision is released from Kang's control when Iron Man manages to purge his software, allowing him to turn on Kang and help the Avengers defeat him, although in the aftermath he departs to consider how easily he fell under Kang's control.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Vision was given a solo series. In the series, he lives in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] with a newly-created synthezoid family: his wife Virginia, son Vin, and daughter [[Viv Vision]]. They attempt to live a normal [[suburb]]an life with Vision working as a consultant to the president, but they find socializing with neighbors difficult. The [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] attacks their house and nearly kills Viv.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #1.

He lies to the police and covers for Virginia when asked about her whereabouts during the murder of one of Viv's classmates, whose father tried to blackmail Virginia for the murder.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #5.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Vision sets out to Arlington Courthouse Jail to exact revenge on Victor. Virginia reveals to Viv that she had murdered her classmate. Viv's resulting emotional outburst prompts Virginia to let out her anger on Sparky, killing it. Among the dog's remains, Virginia notices a petal of the Wundagore Everbloom that it had consumed, a plant capable of giving a person a vision of the future under certain parameters. With Sparky's death having fulfilled the conditions for the Everbloom to work, Virginia eats the petal. Seeing that Vision would go down a dark path if he killed Victor Mancha, she flies to the jail and murders Victor herself.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Fearing the fate of Viv if both of her parents were to be prosecuted for their actions, Virginia calls the detective investigating their neighbours' disappearance and claims full responsibility for both her and her husband's crimes, stating she had tampered with Vision's operative system. Virginia proceeds to drink water with corrosive properties from a Zenn-Lavian water vase they have in their home, and asks Vision to sit with her until the water kills her.<ref>''Vision'' Vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]\" story line, Vision appears as a member of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s Avengers at the time Hydra took over the United States and when Captain America believed himself to be a Hydra sleeper agent.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1.

Seeing her enables him to free himself of the virus, which spreads to the Hydra Dreadnoughts and shuts them down.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nVision is described as being \"every inch a human being\u2014except that all of his bodily organs are constructed of synthetic materials.\"<ref>''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #57 (Oct. 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref> The Solar Jewel on Vision's forehead absorbs ambient [[solar energy]] to provide the power needed for him to function, and he is also capable of discharging this energy as optic beams; with this, he can fire beams of [[Infrared radiation|infrared]] and [[microwave radiation]]. In extreme cases he can discharge this same power through the Solar Jewel itself which amplifies its destructive effects considerably, albeit at the cost of losing most of his resources. By interfacing with an unknown dimension to which he can shunt and from which he can accrue mass, thus becoming either intangible or extraordinarily massive, Vision can change his [[density]], which at its lowest allows flight and a ghostly, phasing intangibility, and at its heaviest, a density ten times greater than that of [[depleted uranium]],<ref>''Avengers'' #332. Marvel Comics.</ref> which gives him superhuman strength, immovability, and a diamond-hard near invulnerability. On one occasion, Vision uses this extreme density to render unconscious the villain [[Count Nefaria]];<ref>''Avengers'' #166 (Dec. 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> at other times, he thrusts an intangible hand into them and then partially re-materializes it, a process he describes as \"physical disruption.\" This effect typically causes great pain and results in incapacitation, as when used against the [[Earth-712]] version of the hero [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141 (Nov. 1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> Being an artificial life-form/android of sorts, Vision has superhuman senses, superhuman stamina, reflexes, speed, agility, strength (even without being at high density), superhuman analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The Vision was trained in hand-to-hand combat by [[Captain America]], is an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers, and is a highly skilled tactician and strategist. The Vision is an expert on his own construction and repair.\n\nAfter the [[Age of Ultron]], Vision joins the [[Avengers A.I.]] team where his \"evolve\" protocols were activated and now his body is formed from millions of nanobots. He can now split himself into smaller parts and change shape.<ref name=\"Avengers A.I. #1\"/>\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n=== Anti-Vision ===\nDuring the story arc \"The Gatherers\" in the Avengers' books, the villain [[Proctor (comics)|Proctor]], who was from an alternate timeline, came to [[Earth-616]] with a version of Vision from yet another timeline. Proctor would wind up switching the bodies of both Visions and have his version infiltrate the Avengers as his mole.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1 #306</ref> The original Vision would eventually be freed and he would eventually take the Anti-Vision into custody when he came back to collect his original body.<ref name=\"Vision\">''Vision'' #1\u20134.

Vision watched as his teammates and wife the Scarlet Witch were slaughtered before his eyes. In response, Vision downloaded a computer virus into the Absorbing Man. When the Absorbing Man tried to purge the virus by shrinking and changing into stone, the Vision smashed him into pieces. In order to prevent the Absorbing Man from being reborn, the Vision had the parts of Creel distributed among various loners and reclusive super-heroes. When Tony Stark created a group of Iron Avengers, robots based on Stark technology and modeled after the deceased Avengers, Vision was tapped as the group's leader. He would lead the Iron Avengers and defend them from such threats as the parasitic [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]], [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim|Frost Giants]], and the [[Red Skull|Skull]]'s invading army.<ref>''Earth X'' #1\u20135.

Vision states that he \"is on the side of life\" and sides with the Avengers against Ultron. He fights Ultron's drones during the final battle in Sokovia and seemingly destroys Ultron's last drone himself. Notably, Vision is the first non-Asgardian to be able to lift Thor's hammer Mjolnir; an earlier scene in the film establishes that the gesture signifies Vision is pure of heart and therefore \"worthy\" of lifting the hammer.\n** Vision appeared in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0|title=IMDb - Captain America: Civil War|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Theorizing that government oversight would assist the team (and noting the increase in supernatural and cataclysmic events since Tony Stark went public as Iron Man), he sides with Iron Man's group in the titular conflict.

As expected, Vision is unharmed and later participates in the battle to capture Captain America's allies.

Unfortunately, Thanos's forces attack Wakanda during the operation, and when Thanos's armies prove too much for even the Avengers and the Wakandan army, Vision convinces Scarlet Witch to destroy the Mind Stone at the cost of his life, confessing his love for her. However, Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse the Mind Stone's destruction, allowing Thanos to rip the Mind Stone out of Vision's head, killing the android a second time in the process.\n**Vision is briefly featured in the opening sequence of ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-easter-eggs-and-references-in-spider-man-fa/2900-2919/2/|title=Marvel Easter Eggs And References In Spider-Man: Far From Home}}</ref> He is one of the four Avengers (alongside Tony Stark, Steve Rogers and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]]) appearing in [[Midtown High School|Midtown High School']]<nowiki/>s video montage which pays homage to all those who died to save Earth.\n\n=== Video games ===\n* Vision is a playable character in the 1991 [[arcade game]] ''[[Captain America and the Avengers]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7275|title=Captain America And The Avengers|last=|first=|date=|website=The International Arcade Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n*Vision is a playable character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]].''{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n*Vision is a playable character in the ''[[Marvel Heroes 2015]]'' relaunch.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* Vision appears as an unlockable character in ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* Vision is a helper/assist character in ''[[Avengers in Galactic Storm]]''.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* Vision appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Roger Rose]].<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* Vision appears in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Dave Wittenberg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/22231-marvel-heroes-2015-announces-playable-kitty-pryde-blade-x-23-doctor-doom-and-more-for-pre-purchase.html|title=MARVEL HEROES 2015 Announces Playable KITTY PRYDE, BLADE, X-23, DOCTOR DOOM and More for Pre-Purchase|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Vision is a playable character in ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infinityinquirer.com/|title=Infinity Inquirer \u2013 Your Source For Disney Infinity News|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Vision's original version and [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|MCU]] iteration are playable characters in ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n* Vision is a playable character in ''[[Marvel: Future Fight]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* Vision is a playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel's Avengers]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/wikis/lego-marvel-avengers/Characters|title=IGN: Lego Marvel's Avengers|last=|first=|date=|website=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> voiced by [[Paul Bettany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079273/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0|title=IMDb: Paul Bettany|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* Vision appears in ''[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]'', voiced again by JP Karliak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2765391/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0|title=IMDb: JP Karliak|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* Vision appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order]]'', voiced again by David Kaye.<ref name=\"btva\"/> Vision is not one of the combat characters, instead providing valuable intel.

Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\".<ref name=\"SOTS\" /> It was influential in development of the federal government of the United States (see [[Connecticut Compromise]]).\n\nThe Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], first appearing in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. She is first portrayed as a [[supervillain]] along with her twin brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] as a founding member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. In most depictions, she is portrayed as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]], and, for much of the character's history, was considered the daughter of the mutant [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. The Scarlet Witch possesses abilities to alter reality in unspecified ways and is a powerful sorceress. The Scarlet Witch is later depicted as a regular member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero team. She also becomes the wife of fellow superhero and teammate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], with whom she has two sons, [[Speed (comics)|Thomas]] and [[Wiccan (comics)|William]].\n\nThe character's in-universe backstory and parentage has been changed more than once. Depicted in the 1970s as the children of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden age]] superhero [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] in the 1980s revealed the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver to be the unknown offspring of supervillain [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Born to Magneto's estranged wife in [[Transia]], Scarlet Witch and her brother are left in the care of their adoptive [[Romani people|Romani]] parents and she is raised as '''Wanda Maximoff''' (later referred to as '''Wanda Frank''' while the Whizzer was considered to be her father). In another retcon in the 2010s, it is revealed that Quicksilver and she are not mutants but were kidnapped and used as subjects of genetic experimentation by the [[High Evolutionary]], then misled to believe Magneto was their father.\n\nAlong with starring in two self-titled limited series of her own, the character appears in animated films, television series, arcade and video games as well as other Marvel-related merchandise. [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch]] is portrayed by [[Elizabeth Olsen]] in the films ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Elizabeth Olsen will reprise the role in the upcoming [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' (2020) and the film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'' (2021).\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:X-Men 4 March 1964.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first appearance of The Scarlet Witch (center right) was on the cover of ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964).]]\nThe Scarlet Witch debuted, together with her brother, Quicksilver, as a part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in ''X-Men'' #4 (March 1964).<ref name=\"DeFalco99\">{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 99|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Stan Lee and Jack Kirby decided to try their hands at a pair of reluctant super villains when they created Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver in ''The X-Men'' #4.}}</ref> They were depicted as reluctant villains, uninterested in Magneto's ideologies.

She had \"hex powers\", that could cause random and  unlikely events to take place. This gave creative freedom to the writers, as it actually meant that her powers could be used for any purpose required by the plot.<ref name=\"tragic\"/> Despite the character's name, she had those powers as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and not because of actual witchcraft. Later writers gave her an increased control over her power, so that she could cause specific events and not just random ones. Englehart also made the character explore witchcraft under the tutelage of [[Agatha Harkness]], a trait that was kept by later writers. The effects of her powers are varied but almost always detrimental to opponents, such as causing the artifact the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to work against the inter-dimensional warlord [[Dormammu]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve| penciller= [[Bob Brown (comics)|Brown, Bob]]| inker= [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]] and [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]|story= To the Death!| title= The Avengers|issue= 118 | date= December 1973 | publisher=| page= | panel= }}</ref> forcing the robot [[Ultron]] to short circuit,<ref name=\"Avengers_161\">{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]| penciller= [[George P\u00e9rez|P\u00e9rez, George]]| inker= [[Pablo Marcos|Marcos, Pablo]] | story= Beware the Ant-Man!| title= The Avengers|issue= 161 | date= July 1977}}</ref> or a gas main underneath the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] to explode.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]| penciller= [[Michael Golden (comics)|Golden, Michael]]| inker= [[Armando Gil|Gil, Armando]]| story= By Friends--Betrayed!|title= The Avengers Annual|issue= 10|date= 1981}}</ref> Scarlet Witch also has the potential to wield magic and later learned that she was destined to serve the role of Nexus Being, a living focal point for the Earth dimension's mystical energy.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' #1-4 (1994)</ref>\n\nWriter [[Kurt Busiek]] redefined Scarlet Witch's powers and maintained that it was, in fact, an ability to manipulate [[chaos magic]], activated due to the demon Chthon changing her mutation at birth into an ability to wield and control magical energy. This was offered as an explanation for her various feats that seemed to go beyond probability alteration, as well as why her hexes almost always have an effect that is favorable to her goals.<ref name=\"AvengersVol3#10\" /> During Busiek's run as well as the subsequent run by [[Geoff Johns]], she was shown to be capable of large-scale spells given enough concentration and time to shape the chaos magic to a specific goal, including the resurrection of [[Wonder Man]].<ref name=\"AvengersVol3#10\"/>\n\nHer powers were retconned in ''Avengers Disassembled'', removing chaos magic and turning them into reality warping. In ''House of M'', this new power was enough to change the whole universe.<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (2005)</ref> Her powers were retconned back to their previous ones in ''The Children's Crusade'', and the previous events attributed to an outside force that had temporarily increased them.<ref name=\"Avengers: The Children's Crusade\"/>\n\nThis was again seemingly changed during AvX when she displays being powerful enough to exhibit a degree of resistance to the Phoenix Force and can cause pain to its hosts, such as Cyclops when he tried to stop Hope from going with her.<ref>''A vs X'' #6</ref> This becomes less effective as the Phoenix Force portions are divided among those who have not yet been defeated.{{issue|date=September 2012}} Scarlet Witch is so powerful, in fact, that she is the described as the only thing the Phoenix Five are still afraid of. ''A vs X'' #12 confirmed that her powers involve chaos magic, and stated that she has \"Mutant Magic\", and the \"primal source of her chaos\" magic is cosmic.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn the new ''Scarlet Witch'' comic series, it is confirmed that Wanda was born with the ability to utilize witchcraft and that this has been seen in other women within her family.<ref name=\"SW08\" /> Wanda also believes that The High Evolutionary genetically altered her, making her more receptive to magical energy.<ref name=\"SW08\" />\n\n==Reception==\nThough later incarnations took on feminist overtones, the character of Scarlet Witch was not conceived with ideas of female empowerment in mind. At her debut in the 1960s, the readership for superhero comics was assumed to be exclusively male, and the genre was male-dominated in terms of both artist-creators and the characters they invented. The Scarlet Witch was thus envisioned as a token female character with a passive power, and was used mainly for interpersonal relation plots, perhaps to draw female readers who were believed to prefer [[romance comics]].<ref>Zimmerman, pp. 69-71</ref> ''Avengers'' writer Roy Thomas even created a group of female superheroes, the [[Lady Liberators]], in order to mock [[Second-wave feminism]].<ref>Wright, p. 250</ref> In the 1980s, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]] produced a limited Scarlet Witch series that offered a stronger, more independent character with enhanced powers and a family. He lamented that those changes did not stick, and the kids were killed shortly after he ceased writing the character.<ref name=\"Steve Englehart\"/>\n\n[[Don Markstein]]'s Toonpedia asserted: \"The Scarlet Witch is unique among superheroes, and not just because she's the only one who wears a wimple.

Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused in the characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the Avengers. The main core of this franchise were the Avengers, both in standalone films and the successful ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were disputed by both studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of Magneto, the villain of most of their films, and Marvel would claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men.

The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], first appearing in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. She is first portrayed as a [[supervillain]] along with her twin brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] as a founding member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. In most depictions, she is portrayed as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]], and, for much of the character's history, was considered the daughter of the mutant [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. The Scarlet Witch possesses abilities to alter reality in unspecified ways and is a powerful sorceress. The Scarlet Witch is later depicted as a regular member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero team. She also becomes the wife of fellow superhero and teammate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], with whom she has two sons, [[Speed (comics)|Thomas]] and [[Wiccan (comics)|William]].\n\nThe character's in-universe backstory and parentage has been changed more than once. Depicted in the 1970s as the children of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden age]] superhero [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] in the 1980s revealed the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver to be the unknown offspring of supervillain [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Born to Magneto's estranged wife in [[Transia]], Scarlet Witch and her brother are left in the care of their adoptive [[Romani people|Romani]] parents and she is raised as '''Wanda Maximoff''' (later referred to as '''Wanda Frank''' while the Whizzer was considered to be her father).

Later writers gave her an increased control over her power, so that she could cause specific events and not just random ones. Englehart also made the character explore witchcraft under the tutelage of [[Agatha Harkness]], a trait that was kept by later writers.

In ''House of M'', this new power was enough to change the whole universe.<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (2005)</ref> Her powers were retconned back to their previous ones in ''The Children's Crusade'', and the previous events attributed to an outside force that had temporarily increased them.<ref name=\"Avengers: The Children's Crusade\"/>\n\nThis was again seemingly changed during AvX when she displays being powerful enough to exhibit a degree of resistance to the Phoenix Force and can cause pain to its hosts, such as Cyclops when he tried to stop Hope from going with her.<ref>''A vs X'' #6</ref> This becomes less effective as the Phoenix Force portions are divided among those who have not yet been defeated.{{issue|date=September 2012}} Scarlet Witch is so powerful, in fact, that she is the described as the only thing the Phoenix Five are still afraid of. ''A vs X'' #12 confirmed that her powers involve chaos magic, and stated that she has \"Mutant Magic\", and the \"primal source of her chaos\" magic is cosmic.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn the new ''Scarlet Witch'' comic series, it is confirmed that Wanda was born with the ability to utilize witchcraft and that this has been seen in other women within her family.<ref name= \"SW08\">''Scarlet Witch (2016) Issue 08''</ref> Wanda also believes that The High Evolutionary genetically altered her, making her more receptive to magical energy.<ref name= \"SW08\">''Scarlet Witch (2016) Issue 08''</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThough later incarnations took on feminist overtones, the character of Scarlet Witch was not conceived with ideas of female empowerment in mind. At her debut in the 1960s, the readership for superhero comics was assumed to be exclusively male, and the genre was male-dominated in terms of both artist-creators and the characters they invented. The Scarlet Witch was thus envisioned as a token female character with a passive power, and was used mainly for interpersonal relation plots, perhaps to draw female readers who were believed to prefer [[romance comics]].<ref>Zimmerman, pp. 69-71</ref> ''Avengers'' writer Roy Thomas even created a group of female superheroes, the [[Lady Liberators]], in order to mock [[Second-wave feminism]].<ref>Wright, p. 250</ref> In the 1980s, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]] produced a limited Scarlet Witch series that offered a stronger, more independent character with enhanced powers and a family. He lamented that those changes did not stick, and the kids were killed shortly after he ceased writing the character.<ref name=\"Steve Englehart\"/>\n\n[[Don Markstein]]'s Toonpedia asserted: \"The Scarlet Witch is unique among superheroes, and not just because she's the only one who wears a wimple.

Fox created a [[X-Men (film series)|film series]] based on the franchise. Years later, Marvel started their own film franchise, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], focused in the characters that they had not licensed to other studios, such as the Avengers. The main core of this franchise were the Avengers, both in standalone films and the successful ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were disputed by both studios. Fox would claim the rights over them because they were both mutants and children of Magneto, the villain of most of their films, and Marvel would claim those rights because the editorial history of the characters in comic books is more associated with the Avengers rather than the X-Men. The studios made an agreement so that both of them would use the characters. It was made on the condition that the plots do not make reference to the other studio's properties: the Fox films cannot mention them as members of the Avengers, and the Marvel films cannot mention them as mutants or children of Magneto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|title=Why these two characters are allowed to appear in both the ''X-Men'' and ''Avengers'' movies|first= Kirsten|last= Acuna|website=[[Business Insider]]|date= April 30, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817134937/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-quicksilver-is-in-x-men-and-avengers-2015-4|archivedate= August 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', however, did not feature Scarlet Witch.

It was first competed for in 1915, before a lapse prior to being revived in 1966. The winners qualify to represent their county in the [[Ulster Intermediate Club Football Championship]] and in turn, go on to the [[All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship]]. The current champions are [[Laragh United GFC|Laragh United]] who won in 2019.\n\n==Format==\n14 teams will contest the Hotel Kilmore Intermediate Football Championship.\n\nThe I.F.C. shall be run on a league basis up to the Quarter-Final stage and Knock-out thereafter. Each team will play 4 rounds in the league phase against different opponents with the fixtures decided by a random draw at the conclusion of each round. Placings in the league stage shall be decided in accordance with rule 6.21 of the GAA Official Guide 2016 as amended below:\n\n6.21 (4) If a Championship is partly organised on a League basis, the following Regulations shall apply: (a) League Results shall be credited as follows: 2 points for a win, and one for a draw. (b) If a Team is Disqualified or Retires during the course of a League Stage, its played games shall stand and its un-played games shall be awarded to the opposing teams. (c) As provided for in this Competition Regulation, when teams finish with equal points for Qualification for the Concluding Stages, or for Promotion or Relegation, the tie shall be decided by the following means and in the order specified: (i) Play-Off.\n\nThe top 8 teams in the league progress to the Quarter-Finals while the bottom 4 placed teams in the league enter a Relegation Playoff with 1 team to be relegated to the [[Cavan Junior Football Championship]].

It was first competed for in 1915, before a lapse prior to being revived in 1966. The winners qualify to represent their county in the [[Ulster Intermediate Club Football Championship]] and in turn, go on to the [[All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship]]. The current champions are [[Laragh United GFC|Laragh United]] who won in 2019.\n\n==Format==\n14 teams will contest the Hotel Kilmore Intermediate Football Championship.\n\nThe I.F.C. shall be run on a league basis up to the Quarter-Final stage and Knock-out thereafter. Each team will play 4 rounds in the league phase against different opponents with the fixtures decided by a random draw at the conclusion of each round. Placings in the league stage shall be decided in accordance with rule 6.21 of the GAA Official Guide 2016 as amended below:\n\n6.21 (4) If a Championship is partly organised on a League basis, the following Regulations shall apply: (a) League Results shall be credited as follows: 2 points for a win, and one for a draw. (b) If a Team is Disqualified or Retires during the course of a League Stage, its played games shall stand and its un-played games shall be awarded to the opposing teams. (c) As provided for in this Competition Regulation, when teams finish with equal points for Qualification for the Concluding Stages, or for Promotion or Relegation, the tie shall be decided by the following means and in the order specified: (i) Play-Off.\n\nThe top 8 teams in the league progress to the Quarter-Finals while the bottom 4 placed teams in the league enter a Relegation Playoff with 1 team to be relegated to the [[Cavan Junior Football Championship]]. The winner is promoted to the [[Cavan Senior Football Championship]]\n\n==Top winners==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:blue; color:white; border:1px solid gold;\" |\n! style=\"background:blue; color:white; border:1px solid gold;\" | Team\n!

After evaluating existing OCR designs, it was decided to develop two new fonts: A stylized design with just digits, called \u201cClass A\u201d; and a more conventional type design with broader character coverage, called \u201cClass\u00a0B\u201d. In February 1965, ECMA proposed a design for the \u201cClass B\u201d font to [[ISO]], who adopted it as international standard ISO\u00a01073-2 in October 1965.<ref name=\"ecma11-v3-history\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-WITHDRAWN/ECMA-11,%203rd%20Edition,%20March%201976.pdf|title=Standard ECMA-11 for the Alphanumeric Character Set OCR-B for Optical Recognition|language=English|publisher=European Computer Manufacturers Association|date=March 1976|at=Section \u201cBrief History\u201d}}</ref> The first revision contained three font sizes: I, II and III.

To make OCR-B more widely accepted, the shapes of some characters were slightly modified.

However, several alternatives have been used, including ''The Miserables'', ''The Wretched'', ''The Miserable Ones'', ''The Poor Ones'', ''The Wretched Poor'', ''The Victims'' and ''The Dispossessed''.<ref>Novelist Susanne Alleyn has argued that \"the phrase \u201cles mis\u00e9rables\u201d, which has a whole range of subtly shaded meanings in French, is much better translated into English as \u201cthe dispossessed\u201d or even as \u201cthe outsiders\u201d, which can describe every major character in the novel in one way or another, than simply as \u201cthe miserable ones\u201d / \u201cthe wretched ones.\u201d [http://hfebooks.com/no-its-not-actually-the-french-revolution-les-miserables-and-history-by-susanne-alleyn/ No, It\u2019s Not Actually the French Revolution: Les Mis\u00e9rables and History.]</ref> Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 [[June Rebellion]] in [[Paris]], the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict [[Jean Valjean]] and his experience of redemption.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11437196|title=BBC News \u2013 Bon anniversaire! 25 facts about Les Mis|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=1 October 2010|date=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nExamining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the [[history of France]], the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, [[moral philosophy]], [[antimonarchism]], justice, religion, and the types and nature of [[romantic love|romantic]] and familial love. ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' has been popularized through numerous [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables|adaptations]] for film, television and the stage, including a musical.\n\n== Novel form ==\n[[Upton Sinclair]] described the novel as \"one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world\", and remarked that Hugo set forth the purpose of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in the ''Preface'':<ref>{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Upton|title=The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest|year=1915|publisher=charlesrivereditors.com Charles Rivers Editors|isbn=978-1-247-96345-7|url=http://www.bartleby.com/71/0405.html}}</ref> {{Quote|text=So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom, a social condemnation, which, in the face of civilization, artificially creates hells on earth, and complicates a destiny that is divine with human fatality; so long as the three problems of the age\u2014the degradation of man by poverty, the ruin of women by starvation, and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night\u2014are not solved; so long as, in certain regions, social asphyxia shall be possible; in other words, and from a yet more extended point of view, so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, books like this cannot be useless.}}\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Hugo explains the work's overarching structure:<ref>Alexander Welsh, \"Opening and Closing ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Victor Hugo: Modern Critical Views'' (NY: Chelsea House, 1988), 155; Vol. 5, Book 1, Chapter 20</ref>\n{{quote|The book which the reader has before him at this moment is, from one end to the other, in its entirety and details&nbsp;... a progress from evil to good, from injustice to justice, from falsehood to truth, from night to day, from appetite to conscience, from corruption to life; from bestiality to duty, from hell to heaven, from nothingness to God. The starting point: matter, destination: the soul. The [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]] at the beginning, the angel at the end.}}\n\nThe novel contains various subplots, but the main thread is the story of ex-convict [[Jean Valjean]], who becomes a force for good in the world but cannot escape his criminal past. The novel is divided into five volumes, each volume divided into several books, and subdivided into chapters, for a total of 48 books and 365 chapters. Each chapter is relatively short, commonly no longer than a few pages.\n\nThe novel as a whole is one of the [[List of longest novels|longest ever written]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/22F3SA74XBA5Y |title=Read the Ten Longest Novels Ever Written |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> with 655,478 words in the original French. Hugo explained his ambitions for the novel to his Italian publisher:<ref>Behr, ''Complete Book'', 39\u201342</ref>\n{{quote|I don't know whether it will be read by everyone, but it is meant for everyone. It addresses England as well as Spain, Italy as well as France, Germany as well as Ireland, the republics that harbour slaves as well as empires that have serfs. Social problems go beyond frontiers. Humankind's wounds, those huge sores that litter the world, do not stop at the blue and red lines drawn on maps. Wherever men go in ignorance or despair, wherever women sell themselves for bread, wherever children lack a book to learn from or a warm hearth, ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' knocks at the door and says: \"open up, I am here for you\".}}\n\n=== Digressions ===\nMore than a quarter of the novel\u2014by one count 955 of 2,783 pages\u2014is devoted to essays that argue a moral point or display Hugo's encyclopedic knowledge but do not advance the plot, nor even a subplot, a method Hugo used in such other works as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and ''[[Toilers of the Sea]]''. One biographer noted that \"the digressions of genius are easily pardoned\".<ref>A. F. Davidson, ''Victor Hugo: His Life And Work'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1929), Kindle Location 4026, 4189</ref> The topics Hugo addresses include cloistered [[religious order]]s, the construction of the [[Paris sewers]], [[argot]], and the [[street urchin]]s of Paris. The one about convents he titles \"Parenthesis\" to alert the reader to its irrelevance to the story line.<ref>Victor Brombert, \"''Les Mis\u00e9rables'': Salvation from Below\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Modern Critical Views: Victor Hugo'' (Chelsea House, 1988), 195</ref>\n\nHugo devotes another 19 chapters (Volume II, Book I) to an account of\u2014and a meditation on the place in history of\u2014the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the battlefield which Hugo visited in 1861 and where he finished writing the novel. It opens volume 2 with such a change of subject as to seem the beginning of an entirely different work. The fact that this 'digression' occupies such a large part of the text demands that it be read in the context of the 'overarching structure' discussed above. Hugo draws his own personal conclusions, taking Waterloo to be a pivot-point in history, but definitely not a victory for the forces of reaction.\n\n{{quote|Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones by the sword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction. The slashers have finished; it was the turn of the thinkers. The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march. That sinister victory was vanquished by liberty.}}\n\nOne critic has called this \"the spiritual gateway\" to the novel, as its chance encounter of Th\u00e9nardier and Colonel Pontmercy foreshadows so many of the novel's encounters \"blending chance and necessity\", a \"confrontation of heroism and villainy\".<ref>Brombert, \"Salvation from Below,\" 195\u201397</ref>\n\nEven when not turning to other subjects outside his narrative, Hugo sometimes interrupts the straightforward recitation of events, his voice and control of the story line unconstrained by time and sequence. The novel opens with a statement about the bishop of Digne in 1815 and immediately shifts: \"Although these details in no way essentially concern that which we have to tell...\" Only after 14 chapters does Hugo pick up the opening thread again, \"In the early days of the month of October, 1815...\", to introduce Jean Valjean.<ref>Alexander Welsh, \"Opening and Closing ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'',\" in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Modern Critical Views: Victor Hugo'' (Chelsea House, 1988), 151\u201352</ref>\n\n==Hugo's sources==\n[[File:Achille Dev\u00e9ria - Vidocq.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eug\u00e8ne Vidocq]], whose career provided a model for the character of Jean Valjean]]\nAn incident Hugo witnessed in 1829 involved three strangers and a police officer. One of the strangers was a man who had stolen a loaf of bread, similar to [[Jean Valjean]]. The officer was taking him to the coach.

He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.\n\nDigne's benevolent [[Bishop Myriel]] gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his life has been spared for God, and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.\n\nValjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-[[Sou (coin)|sous]] coin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and searches the city in panic for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him, because if apprehended he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.\n\nSix years pass and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor of [[Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, Inspector [[Javert]], who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.\n\nYears earlier in Paris, a [[Grisette (person)|grisette]] named [[Fantine]] was very much in love with F\u00e9lix Tholomy\u00e8s. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Z\u00e9phine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomy\u00e8s' daughter, [[Cosette]]. When Fantine arrives at [[Montfermeil]], she leaves Cosette in the care of the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.\n\nFantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn, and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory, because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Th\u00e9nardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth, and she resorts to prostitution to pay the Th\u00e9nardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.\n\nA [[dandy]] named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.\n\nJavert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong, because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn, but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.\n\nAfter Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet, and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public [[Graveyard|grave]].\n\n===Volume II: Cosette===\n[[File:Ebcosette.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of \"[[Cosette]]\" by [[Emile Bayard]], from the original edition of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (1862)]]\nValjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned in the [[Bagne of Toulon]], Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his own death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.\n\nValjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Th\u00e9nardiers abuse her, while pampering their own daughters [[\u00c9ponine]] and Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to make Cosette a present of an expensive new doll which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. \u00c9ponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Th\u00e9nardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behaviour, caring only that he pay for his food and lodging.\n\nThe next morning, Valjean informs the Th\u00e9nardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Th\u00e9nardier immediately accepts, while Th\u00e9nardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Th\u00e9nardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Th\u00e9nardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Th\u00e9nardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Th\u00e9nardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Th\u00e9nardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back toward home.\n\nValjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man whom Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.\n\n===Volume III: Marius===\nEight years later, the [[Friends of the ABC]], led by [[Enjolras]], are preparing an act of anti-[[Orl\u00e9anist]] civil unrest (i.e. the [[June Rebellion|Paris uprising on 5\u20136 June 1832]], following the death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only French leader who had sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells). The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of the ''[[Cour des miracles]]'', including the Th\u00e9nardiers' eldest son [[Gavroche]], who is a [[street urchin]].\n\nOne of the students, [[Marius Pontmercy]], has become alienated from his family (especially his [[Royalism|royalist]] grandfather M. Gillenormand) because of his [[Bonapartism]] views. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Th\u00e9nardier who saved his life at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]\u2014in reality Th\u00e9nardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] to avoid exposing himself as a robber.\n\nAt the [[Luxembourg Garden]], Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Th\u00e9nardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname \"Jondrette\" at Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Th\u00e9nardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Th\u00e9nardiers.\n\n\u00c9ponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing \"The Cops Are Here\" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After \u00c9ponine leaves, Marius observes the \"Jondrettes\" in their apartment through a crack in the wall. \u00c9ponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Th\u00e9nardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Th\u00e9nardier had hoped).\n\nThe philanthropist and his daughter enter\u2014actually Valjean and Cosette. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises them he will return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks \u00c9ponine to retrieve her address for him. \u00c9ponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees to do so. The Th\u00e9nardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Th\u00e9nardier enlists the aid of the [[Patron-Minette]], a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.\n\nMarius overhears Th\u00e9nardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Th\u00e9nardier sends \u00c9ponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Th\u00e9nardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him and he reveals his real identity to Valjean. Marius recognizes Th\u00e9nardier as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.\n\nHe tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Th\u00e9nardier. Valjean denies knowing Th\u00e9nardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Th\u00e9nardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, and they would keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Th\u00e9nardier of his address, Th\u00e9nardier sends out Mme. Th\u00e9nardier to get Cosette. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier comes back alone, and announces the address is a fake.\n\nIt is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Th\u00e9nardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that \u00c9ponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Th\u00e9nardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Th\u00e9nardier reads it and thinks \u00c9ponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Th\u00e9nardier and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.\n\nHe arrests all the Th\u00e9nardiers and Patron-Minette (except [[Patron-Minette|Claquesous]], who escapes during his transportation to prison, and [[Patron-Minette|Montparnasse]], who stops to run off with \u00c9ponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.\n\n===Volume IV: The Idyll in the Rue Plumet and the Epic in the Rue St. Denis===\n[[File:Eponine and Patron-Minette.jpg|thumb|\u00c9ponine prevents the robbery at Valjean's house]]\nAfter \u00c9ponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at \"The Field of the Lark\" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Th\u00e9nardier, Patron-Minette and [[Champmathieu|Brujon]] manage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean's and Cosette's house. However, \u00c9ponine, who has been sitting by the gates of the house, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week's time, which greatly troubles the pair.\n\nThe next day, Valjean is sitting in the [[Champ de Mars]]. He is feeling troubled about seeing Th\u00e9nardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap, which says \"Move Out.\" He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes back to his house, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l'Homme Arme, and reconfirms to her that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry, but has been longing for Marius's return. When tempers flare, he refuses his assent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.\n\nThe following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that Javert is a spy. When Enjolras confronts him about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him up to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius goes back to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, but finds the house no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.\n\nWhen Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot Marius. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally wounding the man, while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.\n\nMarius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for Marius earlier calls Marius by his name. Marius discovers this man is \u00c9ponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.\n\nThe author also states to the reader that \u00c9ponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. \u00c9ponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to have obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him, but decides to do so in fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, \u00c9ponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was \"a little bit in love\" with him, and dies.\n\nMarius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is written by Cosette. He learns Cosette's whereabouts and he writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.\n\n===Volume V: Jean Valjean===\n[[File:Lesmiserables 1900 valjean rescues Marius.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Valjean in the sewers with the wounded Marius (US edition, 1900)]]\nValjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still not certain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.\n\nValjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight, and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol, and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Th\u00e9nardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Th\u00e9nardier, but Th\u00e9nardier does not recognize Valjean. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Th\u00e9nardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can later find out his identity. Th\u00e9nardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's emergence from the sewer will distract the police who have been pursuing him.\n\nUpon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks to be allowed a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but also cannot ignore his duty to the law. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]].\n\nMarius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris during [[Mardi Gras]] festivities, Valjean is spotted by Th\u00e9nardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius' judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.\n\nTh\u00e9nardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Th\u00e9nardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean and reveals all of the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is actually a murderer, and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Th\u00e9nardier's face. He then confronts Th\u00e9nardier with his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Th\u00e9nardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America where he becomes a slave trader.\n\nAs they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Les Mis\u00e9rables characters}}\n\n===Major===\n* '''[[Jean Valjean]]''' (also known as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre) \u2013 The protagonist of the novel. Convicted for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's seven starving children and sent to prison for five years, he is paroled from prison nineteen years later (after four unsuccessful escape attempts added twelve years and fighting back during the second escape attempt added two extra years). Rejected by society for being a former convict, he encounters Bishop Myriel, who turns his life around by showing him mercy and encouraging him to become a new man. While sitting and pondering what Bishop Myriel had said, he puts his shoe on a forty-sou piece dropped by a young wanderer. Valjean threatens the boy with his stick when the boy attempts to rouse Valjean from his reverie and recover his money. He tells a passing priest his name, and the name of the boy, and this allows the police to charge him with armed robbery \u2013 a sentence that, if he were caught again, would return him to prison for life. He assumes a new identity (Monsieur Madeleine) in order to pursue an honest life. He introduces new manufacturing techniques and eventually builds two factories and becomes one of the richest men in the area. By popular acclaim, he is made mayor. He confronts Javert over Fantine's punishment, turns himself in to the police to save another man from prison for life, and rescues Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers. Discovered by Javert in Paris because of his generosity to the poor, he evades capture for the next several years in a convent. He saves Marius from imprisonment and probable death at the barricade, reveals his true identity to Marius and Cosette after their wedding, and is reunited with them just before his death, having kept his promise to the bishop and to Fantine, the image of whom is the last thing he sees before dying.\n* '''[[Javert]]''' \u2013 A fanatic police inspector in pursuit to recapture Valjean. Born in the prisons to a convict father and a fortune teller mother, he renounces both of them and starts working as a guard in the prison, including one stint as the overseer for the chain gang of which Valjean is part (and here witnesses firsthand Valjean's enormous strength and just what he looks like). Eventually he joins the police force in Montreuil-sur-Mer. He arrests Fantine and comes into conflict with Valjean/Madeleine, who orders him to release Fantine. Valjean dismisses Javert in front of his squad and Javert, seeking revenge, reports to the Police Inspector that he has discovered Jean Valjean. He is told that he must be incorrect, as a man mistakenly believed to be Jean Valjean was just arrested. He requests of M. Madeline that he be dismissed in disgrace, for he cannot be less harsh on himself than on others. When the real Jean Valjean turns himself in, Javert is promoted to the Paris police force where he arrests Valjean and sends him back to prison. After Valjean escapes again, Javert attempts one more arrest in vain. He then almost recaptures Valjean at Gorbeau house when he arrests the Th\u00e9nardiers and [[Patron-Minette]]. Later, while working undercover behind the barricade, his identity is discovered. Valjean pretends to execute Javert, but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the sewers, he allows him to make a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral. After composing a letter to the prefect of police outlining the squalid conditions that occur in prisons and the abuses that prisoners are subjected to, he takes his own life by jumping into the [[River Seine|Seine]].\n* '''[[Fantine]]''' \u2013 A beautiful Parisian [[Grisette (French)|grisette]] abandoned with a small child by her lover F\u00e9lix Tholomy\u00e8s. Fantine leaves her daughter Cosette in the care of the Th\u00e9nardiers, innkeepers in the village of [[Montfermeil]]. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier spoils her own daughters and abuses Cosette. Fantine finds work at Monsieur Madeleine's factory. Illiterate, she has others write letters to the Th\u00e9nardiers on her behalf. A female supervisor discovers that she is an unwed mother and dismisses her. To meet the Th\u00e9nardiers' repeated demands for money, she sells her hair and two front teeth, and turns to prostitution. She becomes ill. Valjean learns of her plight when Javert arrests her for attacking a man who called her insulting names and threw snow down her back, and sends her to a hospital. As Javert confronts Valjean in her hospital room, because her illness has made her so weak, she dies of shock after Javert reveals that Valjean is a convict and hasn't brought her daughter Cosette to her (after the doctor encouraged that incorrect belief that Jean Valjean's recent absence was because he was bringing her daughter to her).\n* '''[[Cosette]]''' (formally Euphrasie, also known as \"the Lark\", Mademoiselle Lanoire, Ursula) \u2013 The [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] daughter of Fantine and Tholomy\u00e8s. From approximately the age of three to the age of eight, she is beaten and forced to work as a drudge for the Th\u00e9nardiers. After her mother Fantine dies, Valjean ransoms Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers and cares for her as if she were his daughter. Nuns in a Paris convent educate her. She grows up to become very beautiful. She falls in love with Marius Pontmercy and marries him near the novel's conclusion.\n* '''[[Marius Pontmercy]]''' \u2013 A young law student loosely associated with the Friends of the ABC. He shares the political principles of his father and has a tempestuous relationship with his royalist grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand.

As a child, she is pampered and spoiled by her parents, but ends up a street urchin when she reaches adolescence. She participates in her father's crimes and begging schemes to obtain money. She is blindly in love with Marius. At Marius' request, she finds Valjean and Cosette's house for him and sadly leads him there. She also prevents her father, Patron-Minette, and [[Champmathieu|Brujon]] from robbing the house during one of Marius' visits there to see Cosette. After disguising herself as a boy, she manipulates Marius into going to the barricades, hoping that she and Marius will die there together. Wanting to die before Marius, she reaches out her hand to stop a soldier from shooting at him; she is mortally wounded as the bullet goes through her hand and her back. As she is dying, she confesses all this to Marius, and gives him a letter from Cosette. Her final request to Marius is that once she has passed, he will kiss her on the forehead. He fulfills her request not because of romantic feelings on his part, but out of pity for her hard life.\n* '''[[Th\u00e9nardiers|Monsieur Th\u00e9nardier and Madame Th\u00e9nardier]]''' (also known as the Jondrettes, M.

They become bankrupt and relocate under the name Jondrette to a house in Paris called the Gorbeau house, living in the room next to Marius. The husband associates with a criminal group called \"the [[Patron-Minette]]\", and conspires to rob Valjean until he is thwarted by Marius. Javert arrests the couple. The wife dies in prison.

The narrator occasionally injects himself into the narrative or reports facts outside the time of the narrative to emphasize that he is recounting historical events, not entirely fiction. He introduces his recounting of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] with several paragraphs describing the narrator's recent approach to the battlefield: \"Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles&nbsp;...\"<ref>Victor Brombert, \"''Les Mis\u00e9rables'': Salvation from Below\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Victor Hugo: Modern Critical Views'' (NY: Chelsea House, 1988), 198\u201399; Vol. 2, Book 1, Chapter 1</ref> The narrator describes how \"[a]n observer, a dreamer, the author of this book\" during the 1832 street fighting was caught in crossfire: \"All that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour.\" At one point he apologizes for intruding\u2014\"The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself\"\u2014to ask the reader's understanding when he describes \"the Paris of his youth&nbsp;... as though it still existed.\" This introduces a meditation on memories of past places that his contemporary readers would recognize as a self-portrait written from exile: \"you have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.\" He describes another occasion when a bullet shot \"pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended&nbsp;... over a hairdresser's shop.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' announced its forthcoming publication as early as April 1860.<ref>{{cite news|title=Personalities.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/10/news/personalities.html|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 April 1860}}</ref> Hugo forbade his publishers from summarizing his story and refused to authorize the publication of excerpts in advance of publication. He instructed them to build on his earlier success and suggested this approach: \"What Victor H. did for the Gothic world in ''Notre-Dame of Paris'' [''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''], he accomplishes for the modern world in ''Les Miserables''\".<ref>Behr, ''Compete Book'', 38</ref> A massive advertising campaign<ref>La r\u00e9ception des Mis\u00e9rables en 1862 \u2013 Max Bach \u2013 PMLA, Vol. 77, No. 5 (December 1962)</ref> preceded the release of the first two volumes of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in Brussels on 30 or 31 March and in Paris on 3 April 1862.<ref>{{cite web|title=les miserables, victor hugo, First Edition, 1862|url=http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/les-miserables/author/victor-hugo/first-edition/price-min/2100/pub-min/1862/pub-max/1862/sortby/1/page-1/|publisher=ABE Books|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref> The remaining volumes appeared on 15 May 1862.\n\nCritical reactions were wide-ranging and often negative. Some critics found the subject matter immoral, others complained of its excessive sentimentality, and others were disquieted by its apparent sympathy with the revolutionaries. L.

However, several alternatives have been used, including ''The Miserables'', ''The Wretched'', ''The Miserable Ones'', ''The Poor Ones'', ''The Wretched Poor'', ''The Victims'' and ''The Dispossessed''.<ref>Novelist Susanne Alleyn has argued that \"the phrase \u201cles mis\u00e9rables\u201d, which has a whole range of subtly shaded meanings in French, is much better translated into English as \u201cthe dispossessed\u201d or even as \u201cthe outsiders\u201d, which can describe every major character in the novel in one way or another, than simply as \u201cthe miserable ones\u201d / \u201cthe wretched ones.\u201d [http://hfebooks.com/no-its-not-actually-the-french-revolution-les-miserables-and-history-by-susanne-alleyn/ No, It\u2019s Not Actually the French Revolution: Les Mis\u00e9rables and History.]</ref> Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 [[June Rebellion]] in [[Paris]], the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict [[Jean Valjean]] and his experience of redemption.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11437196|title=BBC News \u2013 Bon anniversaire! 25 facts about Les Mis|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=1 October 2010|date=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nExamining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the [[history of France]], the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, [[moral philosophy]], [[antimonarchism]], justice, religion, and the types and nature of [[romantic love|romantic]] and familial love. ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' has been popularized through numerous [[Adaptations of Les Mis\u00e9rables|adaptations]] for film, television and the stage, including a musical.\n\n== Novel form ==\n[[Upton Sinclair]] described the novel as \"one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world\", and remarked that Hugo set forth the purpose of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in the ''Preface'':<ref>{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Upton|title=The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest|year=1915|publisher=charlesrivereditors.com Charles Rivers Editors|isbn=978-1-247-96345-7|url=http://www.bartleby.com/71/0405.html}}</ref> {{Quote|text=So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom, a social condemnation, which, in the face of civilization, artificially creates hells on earth, and complicates a destiny that is divine with human fatality; so long as the three problems of the age\u2014the degradation of man by poverty, the ruin of women by starvation, and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night\u2014are not solved; so long as, in certain regions, social asphyxia shall be possible; in other words, and from a yet more extended point of view, so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth, books like this cannot be useless.}}\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Hugo explains the work's overarching structure:<ref>Alexander Welsh, \"Opening and Closing ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Victor Hugo: Modern Critical Views'' (NY: Chelsea House, 1988), 155; Vol. 5, Book 1, Chapter 20</ref>\n{{quote|The book which the reader has before him at this moment is, from one end to the other, in its entirety and details&nbsp;... a progress from evil to good, from injustice to justice, from falsehood to truth, from night to day, from appetite to conscience, from corruption to life; from bestiality to duty, from hell to heaven, from nothingness to God. The starting point: matter, destination: the soul. The [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]] at the beginning, the angel at the end.}}\n\nThe novel contains various subplots, but the main thread is the story of ex-convict [[Jean Valjean]], who becomes a force for good in the world but cannot escape his criminal past. The novel is divided into five volumes, each volume divided into several books, and subdivided into chapters, for a total of 48 books and 365 chapters. Each chapter is relatively short, commonly no longer than a few pages.\n\nThe novel as a whole is one of the [[List of longest novels|longest ever written]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/22F3SA74XBA5Y |title=Read the Ten Longest Novels Ever Written |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> with 655,478 words in the original French. Hugo explained his ambitions for the novel to his Italian publisher:<ref>Behr, ''Complete Book'', 39\u201342</ref>\n{{quote|I don't know whether it will be read by everyone, but it is meant for everyone. It addresses England as well as Spain, Italy as well as France, Germany as well as Ireland, the republics that harbour slaves as well as empires that have serfs. Social problems go beyond frontiers. Humankind's wounds, those huge sores that litter the world, do not stop at the blue and red lines drawn on maps. Wherever men go in ignorance or despair, wherever women sell themselves for bread, wherever children lack a book to learn from or a warm hearth, ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' knocks at the door and says: \"open up, I am here for you\".}}\n\n=== Digressions ===\nMore than a quarter of the novel\u2014by one count 955 of 2,783 pages\u2014is devoted to essays that argue a moral point or display Hugo's encyclopedic knowledge but do not advance the plot, nor even a subplot, a method Hugo used in such other works as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and ''[[Toilers of the Sea]]''. One biographer noted that \"the digressions of genius are easily pardoned\".<ref>A. F. Davidson, ''Victor Hugo: His Life And Work'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1929), Kindle Location 4026, 4189</ref> The topics Hugo addresses include cloistered [[religious order]]s, the construction of the [[Paris sewers]], [[argot]], and the [[street urchin]]s of Paris. The one about convents he titles \"Parenthesis\" to alert the reader to its irrelevance to the story line.<ref>Victor Brombert, \"''Les Mis\u00e9rables'': Salvation from Below\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Modern Critical Views: Victor Hugo'' (Chelsea House, 1988), 195</ref>\n\nHugo devotes another 19 chapters (Volume II, Book I) to an account of\u2014and a meditation on the place in history of\u2014the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the battlefield which Hugo visited in 1861 and where he finished writing the novel. It opens volume 2 with such a change of subject as to seem the beginning of an entirely different work. The fact that this 'digression' occupies such a large part of the text demands that it be read in the context of the 'overarching structure' discussed above. Hugo draws his own personal conclusions, taking Waterloo to be a pivot-point in history, but definitely not a victory for the forces of reaction.\n\n{{quote|Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones by the sword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction. The slashers have finished; it was the turn of the thinkers. The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march. That sinister victory was vanquished by liberty.}}\n\nOne critic has called this \"the spiritual gateway\" to the novel, as its chance encounter of Th\u00e9nardier and Colonel Pontmercy foreshadows so many of the novel's encounters \"blending chance and necessity\", a \"confrontation of heroism and villainy\".<ref>Brombert, \"Salvation from Below,\" 195\u201397</ref>\n\nEven when not turning to other subjects outside his narrative, Hugo sometimes interrupts the straightforward recitation of events, his voice and control of the story line unconstrained by time and sequence. The novel opens with a statement about the bishop of Digne in 1815 and immediately shifts: \"Although these details in no way essentially concern that which we have to tell...\" Only after 14 chapters does Hugo pick up the opening thread again, \"In the early days of the month of October, 1815...\", to introduce Jean Valjean.<ref>Alexander Welsh, \"Opening and Closing ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'',\" in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Modern Critical Views: Victor Hugo'' (Chelsea House, 1988), 151\u201352</ref>\n\n==Hugo's sources==\n[[File:Achille Dev\u00e9ria - Vidocq.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eug\u00e8ne Vidocq]], whose career provided a model for the character of Jean Valjean]]\nAn incident Hugo witnessed in 1829 involved three strangers and a police officer. One of the strangers was a man who had stolen a loaf of bread, similar to [[Jean Valjean]]. The officer was taking him to the coach. The thief also saw the mother and daughter playing with each other which would be an inspiration for [[Fantine]] and [[Cosette]]. Hugo imagined the life of the man in jail and the mother and daughter taken away from each other.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Day|first1=Anonymous |title=About the Novel|url=https://www.lesmis.com/media/files/pdf/les-mis-study-guide-pt1.pdf|website=The Official Les Miserables Website Times|date=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nValjean's character is loosely based on the life of the ex-convict [[Eug\u00e8ne Fran\u00e7ois Vidocq]].

He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.\n\nDigne's benevolent [[Bishop Myriel]] gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his life has been spared for God, and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.\n\nValjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-[[Sou (coin)|sous]] coin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and searches the city in panic for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him, because if apprehended he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.\n\nSix years pass and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor of [[Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, Inspector [[Javert]], who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.\n\nYears earlier in Paris, a [[Grisette (person)|grisette]] named [[Fantine]] was very much in love with F\u00e9lix Tholomy\u00e8s. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Z\u00e9phine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomy\u00e8s' daughter, [[Cosette]]. When Fantine arrives at [[Montfermeil]], she leaves Cosette in the care of the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.\n\nFantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn, and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory, because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Th\u00e9nardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth, and she resorts to prostitution to pay the Th\u00e9nardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.\n\nA [[dandy]] named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.\n\nJavert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong, because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn, but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.\n\nAfter Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet, and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public [[Graveyard|grave]].\n\n===Volume II: Cosette===\n[[File:Ebcosette.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of \"[[Cosette]]\" by [[Emile Bayard]], from the original edition of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (1862)]]\nValjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned in the [[Bagne of Toulon]], Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his own death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.\n\nValjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Th\u00e9nardiers abuse her, while pampering their own daughters [[\u00c9ponine]] and Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to make Cosette a present of an expensive new doll which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. \u00c9ponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Th\u00e9nardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behaviour, caring only that he pay for his food and lodging.\n\nThe next morning, Valjean informs the Th\u00e9nardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Th\u00e9nardier immediately accepts, while Th\u00e9nardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Th\u00e9nardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Th\u00e9nardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Th\u00e9nardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Th\u00e9nardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Th\u00e9nardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back toward home.\n\nValjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man whom Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.\n\n===Volume III: Marius===\nEight years later, the [[Friends of the ABC]], led by [[Enjolras]], are preparing an act of anti-[[Orl\u00e9anist]] civil unrest (i.e. the [[June Rebellion|Paris uprising on 5\u20136 June 1832]], following the death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only French leader who had sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells). The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of the ''[[Cour des miracles]]'', including the Th\u00e9nardiers' eldest son [[Gavroche]], who is a [[street urchin]].\n\nOne of the students, [[Marius Pontmercy]], has become alienated from his family (especially his [[Royalism|royalist]] grandfather M. Gillenormand) because of his [[Bonapartism]] views. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Th\u00e9nardier who saved his life at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]\u2014in reality Th\u00e9nardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] to avoid exposing himself as a robber.\n\nAt the [[Luxembourg Garden]], Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Th\u00e9nardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname \"Jondrette\" at Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Th\u00e9nardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Th\u00e9nardiers.\n\n\u00c9ponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing \"The Cops Are Here\" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After \u00c9ponine leaves, Marius observes the \"Jondrettes\" in their apartment through a crack in the wall. \u00c9ponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Th\u00e9nardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Th\u00e9nardier had hoped).\n\nThe philanthropist and his daughter enter\u2014actually Valjean and Cosette. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises them he will return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks \u00c9ponine to retrieve her address for him. \u00c9ponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees to do so. The Th\u00e9nardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Th\u00e9nardier enlists the aid of the [[Patron-Minette]], a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.\n\nMarius overhears Th\u00e9nardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Th\u00e9nardier sends \u00c9ponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Th\u00e9nardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him and he reveals his real identity to Valjean. Marius recognizes Th\u00e9nardier as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.\n\nHe tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Th\u00e9nardier. Valjean denies knowing Th\u00e9nardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Th\u00e9nardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, and they would keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Th\u00e9nardier of his address, Th\u00e9nardier sends out Mme. Th\u00e9nardier to get Cosette. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier comes back alone, and announces the address is a fake.\n\nIt is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Th\u00e9nardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that \u00c9ponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Th\u00e9nardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Th\u00e9nardier reads it and thinks \u00c9ponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Th\u00e9nardier and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.\n\nHe arrests all the Th\u00e9nardiers and Patron-Minette (except [[Patron-Minette|Claquesous]], who escapes during his transportation to prison, and [[Patron-Minette|Montparnasse]], who stops to run off with \u00c9ponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.\n\n===Volume IV: The Idyll in the Rue Plumet and the Epic in the Rue St. Denis===\n[[File:Eponine and Patron-Minette.jpg|thumb|\u00c9ponine prevents the robbery at Valjean's house]]\nAfter \u00c9ponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at \"The Field of the Lark\" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Th\u00e9nardier, Patron-Minette and [[Champmathieu|Brujon]] manage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean's and Cosette's house. However, \u00c9ponine, who has been sitting by the gates of the house, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week's time, which greatly troubles the pair.\n\nThe next day, Valjean is sitting in the [[Champ de Mars]]. He is feeling troubled about seeing Th\u00e9nardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap, which says \"Move Out.\" He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes back to his house, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l'Homme Arme, and reconfirms to her that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry, but has been longing for Marius's return. When tempers flare, he refuses his assent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.\n\nThe following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that Javert is a spy. When Enjolras confronts him about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him up to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius goes back to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, but finds the house no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.\n\nWhen Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot Marius. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally wounding the man, while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.\n\nMarius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for Marius earlier calls Marius by his name. Marius discovers this man is \u00c9ponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.\n\nThe author also states to the reader that \u00c9ponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. \u00c9ponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to have obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him, but decides to do so in fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, \u00c9ponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was \"a little bit in love\" with him, and dies.\n\nMarius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is written by Cosette. He learns Cosette's whereabouts and he writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.\n\n===Volume V: Jean Valjean===\n[[File:Lesmiserables 1900 valjean rescues Marius.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Valjean in the sewers with the wounded Marius (US edition, 1900)]]\nValjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still not certain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.\n\nValjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight, and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol, and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Th\u00e9nardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Th\u00e9nardier, but Th\u00e9nardier does not recognize Valjean. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Th\u00e9nardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can later find out his identity. Th\u00e9nardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's emergence from the sewer will distract the police who have been pursuing him.\n\nUpon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks to be allowed a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but also cannot ignore his duty to the law. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]].\n\nMarius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris during [[Mardi Gras]] festivities, Valjean is spotted by Th\u00e9nardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius' judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.\n\nTh\u00e9nardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Th\u00e9nardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean and reveals all of the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is actually a murderer, and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Th\u00e9nardier's face. He then confronts Th\u00e9nardier with his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Th\u00e9nardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America where he becomes a slave trader.\n\nAs they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Les Mis\u00e9rables characters}}\n\n===Major===\n* '''[[Jean Valjean]]''' (also known as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre) \u2013 The protagonist of the novel. Convicted for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's seven starving children and sent to prison for five years, he is paroled from prison nineteen years later (after four unsuccessful escape attempts added twelve years and fighting back during the second escape attempt added two extra years). Rejected by society for being a former convict, he encounters Bishop Myriel, who turns his life around by showing him mercy and encouraging him to become a new man. While sitting and pondering what Bishop Myriel had said, he puts his shoe on a forty-sou piece dropped by a young wanderer. Valjean threatens the boy with his stick when the boy attempts to rouse Valjean from his reverie and recover his money. He tells a passing priest his name, and the name of the boy, and this allows the police to charge him with armed robbery \u2013 a sentence that, if he were caught again, would return him to prison for life. He assumes a new identity (Monsieur Madeleine) in order to pursue an honest life. He introduces new manufacturing techniques and eventually builds two factories and becomes one of the richest men in the area. By popular acclaim, he is made mayor. He confronts Javert over Fantine's punishment, turns himself in to the police to save another man from prison for life, and rescues Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers. Discovered by Javert in Paris because of his generosity to the poor, he evades capture for the next several years in a convent. He saves Marius from imprisonment and probable death at the barricade, reveals his true identity to Marius and Cosette after their wedding, and is reunited with them just before his death, having kept his promise to the bishop and to Fantine, the image of whom is the last thing he sees before dying.\n* '''[[Javert]]''' \u2013 A fanatic police inspector in pursuit to recapture Valjean. Born in the prisons to a convict father and a fortune teller mother, he renounces both of them and starts working as a guard in the prison, including one stint as the overseer for the chain gang of which Valjean is part (and here witnesses firsthand Valjean's enormous strength and just what he looks like). Eventually he joins the police force in Montreuil-sur-Mer. He arrests Fantine and comes into conflict with Valjean/Madeleine, who orders him to release Fantine. Valjean dismisses Javert in front of his squad and Javert, seeking revenge, reports to the Police Inspector that he has discovered Jean Valjean. He is told that he must be incorrect, as a man mistakenly believed to be Jean Valjean was just arrested. He requests of M. Madeline that he be dismissed in disgrace, for he cannot be less harsh on himself than on others. When the real Jean Valjean turns himself in, Javert is promoted to the Paris police force where he arrests Valjean and sends him back to prison. After Valjean escapes again, Javert attempts one more arrest in vain. He then almost recaptures Valjean at Gorbeau house when he arrests the Th\u00e9nardiers and [[Patron-Minette]]. Later, while working undercover behind the barricade, his identity is discovered. Valjean pretends to execute Javert, but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the sewers, he allows him to make a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral. After composing a letter to the prefect of police outlining the squalid conditions that occur in prisons and the abuses that prisoners are subjected to, he takes his own life by jumping into the [[River Seine|Seine]].\n* '''[[Fantine]]''' \u2013 A beautiful Parisian [[Grisette (French)|grisette]] abandoned with a small child by her lover F\u00e9lix Tholomy\u00e8s. Fantine leaves her daughter Cosette in the care of the Th\u00e9nardiers, innkeepers in the village of [[Montfermeil]]. Mme. Th\u00e9nardier spoils her own daughters and abuses Cosette. Fantine finds work at Monsieur Madeleine's factory. Illiterate, she has others write letters to the Th\u00e9nardiers on her behalf. A female supervisor discovers that she is an unwed mother and dismisses her. To meet the Th\u00e9nardiers' repeated demands for money, she sells her hair and two front teeth, and turns to prostitution. She becomes ill. Valjean learns of her plight when Javert arrests her for attacking a man who called her insulting names and threw snow down her back, and sends her to a hospital. As Javert confronts Valjean in her hospital room, because her illness has made her so weak, she dies of shock after Javert reveals that Valjean is a convict and hasn't brought her daughter Cosette to her (after the doctor encouraged that incorrect belief that Jean Valjean's recent absence was because he was bringing her daughter to her).\n* '''[[Cosette]]''' (formally Euphrasie, also known as \"the Lark\", Mademoiselle Lanoire, Ursula) \u2013 The [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] daughter of Fantine and Tholomy\u00e8s. From approximately the age of three to the age of eight, she is beaten and forced to work as a drudge for the Th\u00e9nardiers. After her mother Fantine dies, Valjean ransoms Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers and cares for her as if she were his daughter. Nuns in a Paris convent educate her. She grows up to become very beautiful. She falls in love with Marius Pontmercy and marries him near the novel's conclusion.\n* '''[[Marius Pontmercy]]''' \u2013 A young law student loosely associated with the Friends of the ABC. He shares the political principles of his father and has a tempestuous relationship with his royalist grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand.

After he and Cosette marry, he recognizes Th\u00e9nardier as a swindler and pays him to leave France.\n* '''[[\u00c9ponine]]''' (the Jondrette girl) \u2013 The Th\u00e9nardiers' elder daughter. As a child, she is pampered and spoiled by her parents, but ends up a street urchin when she reaches adolescence. She participates in her father's crimes and begging schemes to obtain money. She is blindly in love with Marius. At Marius' request, she finds Valjean and Cosette's house for him and sadly leads him there. She also prevents her father, Patron-Minette, and [[Champmathieu|Brujon]] from robbing the house during one of Marius' visits there to see Cosette. After disguising herself as a boy, she manipulates Marius into going to the barricades, hoping that she and Marius will die there together. Wanting to die before Marius, she reaches out her hand to stop a soldier from shooting at him; she is mortally wounded as the bullet goes through her hand and her back. As she is dying, she confesses all this to Marius, and gives him a letter from Cosette. Her final request to Marius is that once she has passed, he will kiss her on the forehead. He fulfills her request not because of romantic feelings on his part, but out of pity for her hard life.\n* '''[[Th\u00e9nardiers|Monsieur Th\u00e9nardier and Madame Th\u00e9nardier]]''' (also known as the Jondrettes, M.

As innkeepers, they abuse Cosette as a child and extort payment from Fantine for her support, until Valjean takes Cosette away. They become bankrupt and relocate under the name Jondrette to a house in Paris called the Gorbeau house, living in the room next to Marius. The husband associates with a criminal group called \"the [[Patron-Minette]]\", and conspires to rob Valjean until he is thwarted by Marius. Javert arrests the couple. The wife dies in prison.

Grantaire is often drunk and is unconscious for the majority of the [[June Rebellion]]. He and Enjolras are executed by the National Guards after the barricade falls.\n\n===Friends of the ABC===\nA revolutionary student club.

The narrator occasionally injects himself into the narrative or reports facts outside the time of the narrative to emphasize that he is recounting historical events, not entirely fiction. He introduces his recounting of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] with several paragraphs describing the narrator's recent approach to the battlefield: \"Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles&nbsp;...\"<ref>Victor Brombert, \"''Les Mis\u00e9rables'': Salvation from Below\", in Harold Bloom, ed., ''Victor Hugo: Modern Critical Views'' (NY: Chelsea House, 1988), 198\u201399; Vol. 2, Book 1, Chapter 1</ref> The narrator describes how \"[a]n observer, a dreamer, the author of this book\" during the 1832 street fighting was caught in crossfire: \"All that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour.\" At one point he apologizes for intruding\u2014\"The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself\"\u2014to ask the reader's understanding when he describes \"the Paris of his youth&nbsp;... as though it still existed.\" This introduces a meditation on memories of past places that his contemporary readers would recognize as a self-portrait written from exile: \"you have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.\" He describes another occasion when a bullet shot \"pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended&nbsp;... over a hairdresser's shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the pillars of the market.\" As evidence of police double agents at the barricades, he writes: \"The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.\"\n\n==Contemporary reception==\nThe appearance of the novel was a highly anticipated event as Victor Hugo was considered one of France's foremost poets in the middle of the nineteenth century. The ''[[New York Times]]'' announced its forthcoming publication as early as April 1860.<ref>{{cite news|title=Personalities.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/10/news/personalities.html|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 April 1860}}</ref> Hugo forbade his publishers from summarizing his story and refused to authorize the publication of excerpts in advance of publication. He instructed them to build on his earlier success and suggested this approach: \"What Victor H. did for the Gothic world in ''Notre-Dame of Paris'' [''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''], he accomplishes for the modern world in ''Les Miserables''\".<ref>Behr, ''Compete Book'', 38</ref> A massive advertising campaign<ref>La r\u00e9ception des Mis\u00e9rables en 1862 \u2013 Max Bach \u2013 PMLA, Vol. 77, No. 5 (December 1962)</ref> preceded the release of the first two volumes of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' in Brussels on 30 or 31 March and in Paris on 3 April 1862.<ref>{{cite web|title=les miserables, victor hugo, First Edition, 1862|url=http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/les-miserables/author/victor-hugo/first-edition/price-min/2100/pub-min/1862/pub-max/1862/sortby/1/page-1/|publisher=ABE Books|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref> The remaining volumes appeared on 15 May 1862.\n\nCritical reactions were wide-ranging and often negative. Some critics found the subject matter immoral, others complained of its excessive sentimentality, and others were disquieted by its apparent sympathy with the revolutionaries. L. Gauthier wrote in ''Le Monde'' of 17 August 1862: \"One cannot read without an unconquerable disgust all the details Monsieur Hugo gives regarding the successful planning of riots.\"<ref>[http://groupugo.div.jussieu.fr/groupugo/doc/97-03-22Bouchet.pdf PDF]</ref> The [[Goncourt brothers]] judged the novel artificial and disappointing.<ref>Goncourt, Edmond et Jules, Journal, Vol. I, Laffont, 1989, {{ISBN|2-221-05527-6}}, April 1862, pp. 808\u201309</ref> [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] found \"neither truth nor greatness\" in it. He complained that the characters were crude stereotypes who all \"speak very well \u2013 but all in the same way\". He deemed it an \"infantile\" effort and brought an end to Hugo's career like \"the fall of a god\".<ref>[http://www.univ-rouen.fr/flaubert/03corres/conard/lettres/62b.html Letter of G.

Larson is notable for winning $110,237 ({{Inflation|US|110237|1984|r=-3|fmt=eq}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} in cash and prizes, at the time the largest one-day total ever won on a game show. He was able to win by memorizing the patterns used on the ''Press Your Luck'' game board.\n\nOriginally from southwestern [[Ohio]], Larson used his cash winnings for taxes and real estate investments. However, he also had problems with the law and was involved in illegal schemes.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> As a result, Larson lost all of his winnings within two years of the show's taping and moved to [[Florida]], where he later died of [[throat cancer]] at the age of 49. Since his death in 1999, Larson's game has re-aired on TV at various times and inspired two [[Game Show Network]] documentaries: ''Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal'' in 2003 and ''[[Cover Story (TV series)|Cover Story]]: The Press Your Luck Scandal'' in 2018.\n\n==Preparations==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PYL Larson.svg\n| width1 = 300\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Part of one game board pattern that Larson memorized to win over $110,000.

While watching, he noticed that the randomizer that moved the light indicator around the 18-square \"Big Board\" had only five patterns. Larson began memorizing these patterns, increasingly confident he could predict when and where the randomizer would land. As he locked in the patterns, Larson began playing along with the \"Big Board\" rounds to test his hypothesis, pausing his [[VHS]] tape at various intervals with the remote control.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nMoreover, Larson discovered that the fourth and eighth squares (from #1 in the top left corner then clockwise around the board) always contained cash and never a \"Whammy\", a [[bandit]]-like cartoon character that, when landed on, would result in the resetting of the player's score to zero, accompanied by an on-screen animation that showed the Whammy taking the player's earnings. Larson also learned that square #4 always contained the top dollar values and that, in the second round, contestants were awarded an additional spin if landing on those spots ($3,000, $4,000, or $5,000 in square #4, and $500, $750, or $1,000 in square #8). This proved crucial to Larson's theory, as he could retain control of the board in the second round as long as he wished if he kept following the patterns.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nIn May 1984, Larson used most of his savings to fly to [[Los Angeles]] to audition for ''Press Your Luck''. Contestant supervisor Bobby Edwards was suspicious of Larson's motives when he interviewed Larson on May 19, and was unwilling to allow him on the show, but executive producer [[Bill Carruthers]] overruled him, a move he said he later regretted.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson was added as a contestant on the fourth episode of the taping session, intended to air Friday, June 8, 1984.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nWhile waiting in the [[green room]], Larson met Ed Long, a [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister from [[California]] booked for the third episode of the session. They struck up a conversation. Long recalled that Larson asked how many times he had seen the show. When Long replied he had seen it only once, Larson responded by looking at him as though he \"were from another planet.\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson told Long, \"I really hope we don't have to play each other,\" before leaving the green room, but they would in fact face off as Long won his match and a total of $11,516 in cash and prizes.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> The two men competed against Janie Litras, a dental assistant, in the next episode of the session.\n\n==The game==\n\n===First round===\nAs customary, the game began with the first of two rounds in which contestants answered questions to earn spins for the \"Big Board\"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him here, and he struggled early. On the second question, host [[Peter Tomarken]] asked, \"You've probably got President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in your pocket or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side...\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, \"[[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50 bill]]\" (which has a portrait of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]), after which Tomarken finished the question \"...of what American '''coin'''?\" with the answer being \"a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]]\", the other choice being \"a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]]\".<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 twice for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\n===Second round===\nLarson earned a total of seven spins in the second question round.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Since he was in third place, he got to play first at the \"Big Board\" and went to his pattern play, aiming for squares #4 and #8.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson quickly bumped his total to over $10,000. Early on, his pattern play was irregular, as he stopped four times on squares that did not follow his pattern: a trip to [[Kauai]] worth $1,636 in square #7, $700 and one spin in square #17, \"Pick a Corner\" in square #6 (where he was given the choice of $2,250 in square #1, $2,000 in square #10, or $1,500 and one spin in square #15; he chose $2,250), and a [[sailboat]] worth $1,015 in square #7.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nAfter the sailboat, Larson's pattern play became more accurate, as he hit his target squares each time he spun. Tomarken was increasingly astounded that Larson was still spinning despite not having seen a Whammy for so long.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson continued to press on, passing more and more milestone markers without losing any of his four remaining spins. As he passed the $40,000, $50,000, and $60,000 marks, Tomarken virtually begged Larson to stop more than once, fearing he would hit a Whammy.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson finally decided to stop once he reached $102,851. He had by this time made 40 spins on the board without hitting a Whammy, in which 37 were for cash. Of those 37 cash spins he hit square #4 twenty times, including six in a row. He also managed to land on square #8 fifteen times, hitting it consecutively three in a row twice. After he announced he was passing his remaining four spins, Larson raised his arms in triumph and received a [[standing ovation]] from the audience.\n\nBy rule, Larson's spins went to Litras as she had the next highest money total. However, since she was the leader after the first round, she had to wait to play until Long, who earned two spins in the second round of questions, completed his turn. On the first of his two spins, a bewildered Long hit a Whammy and lost the money he earned in the first round, leading Tomarken to wonder aloud if Larson \"knew that the Whammy was coming.\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Long hit $5,000 and a spin on his next spin and did it again on the spin after that, but hit a second Whammy with his final spin.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nLitras then took her turn, starting with the first of the four spins Larson had passed that she was required to take by rule. On that spin, she hit a Whammy and lost her first round total. However, since she had Whammied, the remaining passed spins were moved into the earned column and added to the three spins Litras earned in the second question round, giving her a total of six spins. Litras picked up $9,385 in cash and prizes in five total spins, but because she managed to hit spaces with extra spins, she used only three.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Litras then passed those spins to Larson, who was visibly upset and said, \"I didn't want 'em,\" as he received the three spins.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nNonetheless, Larson picked up where he had left off, following his patterns, and hit his marks with his first two spins. He hit square #17 on his last spin, which was a space that had a Whammy in it, but he stopped the board before the Whammy could shuffle into the square and won a trip to [[The Bahamas]] valued at $2,636, causing Tomarken to joke, \"With that money, you could ''buy'' The Bahamas, Michael!\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> This brought Larson's total to $110,237, and he had two earned spins to work with. Larson passed them to Litras, who failed to earn any additional spins with them, ending the game. Larson's final total included $104,950 in cash.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nAt the end of the episode, Tomarken asked Larson why he decided not to pass his remaining spins before he did, considering the lead he rapidly gained over Litras and Long. Side-stepping revealing how he had won the game, Larson responded with, \"Two things: one, it felt right, and second, I still had seven spins and if I passed them, somebody could've done what I did.\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\n===Episode length===\nEach episode of ''Press Your Luck'' was thirty minutes in length, and prior to Larson's appearance, the series had never needed to straddle games or stop during play as a match would always be completed within the allotted time frame.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> However, Larson's streak of hitting his marks every time stretched the length of the episode well past the usual thirty minutes and the producers were unsure how to proceed. While the entire episode was recorded in one shot, the production staff decided that it would need to be split up for airing.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nOnce Larson passed $36,000, the producers cut to a freeze frame of the contestant area and Tomarken (in a [[chroma key]] shot) then tossed to a commercial. Once back from the commercial, Tomarken informed the viewers that because of the extraordinary circumstances, the match could not be completed on the June 8 episode and would instead be finished on the next scheduled airing on Monday, June 11. He then signed off with the words \"To be continued...\" superimposed on the screen.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nWhen ''Press Your Luck'' returned after the weekend break, the episode started with the same freeze frame image. Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought the viewers up to speed on what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then introducing Larson and explaining what he had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead into and out of the first two commercial breaks when Larson eclipsed the $50,000 and $100,000 marks, with voiceovers by Tomarken leading into and out of them.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\n==Accusations of cheating==\nWhile Larson was running up the score, the show's producers contacted Michael Brockman, then head of CBS's daytime programming department.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> In a 1994 ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview commemorating the Larson sweep, conducted at the time the movie ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' was released, he recalled, \"Something was very wrong. Here was this guy from nowhere, and he was hitting the bonus box every time. It was bedlam, I can tell you, and we couldn't stop this guy. He kept going around the board and hitting that box.\"<ref name=TVGuide>{{cite web | url=http://www.xanfan.com/pressyourluck/larson.htm | title=The Day the Game Show Got Whammied | work=TV Guide | date=November 1994 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020110005632/http://www.xanfan.com/pressyourluck/larson.htm | archivedate=January 10, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe program's producers and Brockman met to review the videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the fraction of a second it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he knew he was going to get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern \u2013 he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nAt first, CBS refused to pay Larson, considering him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers could not find a clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with these patterns from the beginning of the series), and the network complied.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.<ref name=\"Damn Interesting\"/>\n\nThe five original light patterns on the \"Big Board\" were replaced with five new ones for about a month, and those were replaced with a different set of five new patterns for another month. A further reprogramming of the board with 32 patterns was completed in August 1984, effectively ensuring that no one could duplicate Larson's trick; all subsequent versions employ this method.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> The show ended its run in September 1986.\n\n==Episode broadcasts==\nAfter the broadcast of Larson's two episodes, CBS suppressed the episodes for nineteen years,<ref name=Supress/> as both the network and ''Press Your Luck'' producer/creator Bill Carruthers at that time considered the incident to be one of their biggest embarrassments.<ref name=\"Supress\">{{cite news | url=http://business.highbeam.com/3972/article-1G1-98803104/gameshow-flick-uncovers-press-mess | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914000535/http://business.highbeam.com/3972/article-1G1-98803104/gameshow-flick-uncovers-press-mess | url-status=dead | archive-date=September 14, 2014 | title=Television review; Game-show flick uncovers ''Press'' mess | publisher=Herald Media | work=[[Boston Herald]] | date=March 15, 2003 | last=Ruch | first=John | page=28}}</ref> When [[USA Network]] (and later, [[Game Show Network]]) bought the rights to rerun ''Press Your Luck'', CBS and Carruthers insisted that the Larson episodes must not be aired.\n\nOn March 16, 2003, GSN was allowed to air the episodes as part of a two-hour documentary called ''Big Bucks: The ''Press Your Luck'' Scandal'', hosted and narrated by Tomarken. The documentary was produced by and aired on GSN (in association with [[Lionsgate]] and [[RTL Group]], the latter of which now owns the ''Press Your Luck'' franchise), and broke all previous viewership records for the network.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/big-bucks-the-press-your-luck-scandal-delivers-record-ratings-for-game-show-network-74711397.html | title=''Big Bucks: The ''Press Your Luck'' Scandal'' Delivers Record Ratings for Game Show Network | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=March 18, 2003 | accessdate=July 14, 2014}}</ref> The ''Big Bucks'' documentary included additional footage, directly from the original [[master tape]]s, that had been edited out of the episodes for their initial broadcast.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> The original telecast was dedicated to the memory of Carruthers, who had died two weeks before the airing.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nAs part of the commemoration, Larson's opponents from 1984 were invited back to be contestants on ''[[Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck]]'', playing against Larson's brother, James, with Tomarken returning to host the question round. Despite the fact that the board was now fully random (host [[Todd Newton]] called it \"Larson-proof\"),<ref name=\"Whammy!\">{{cite episode | series=Whammy!

Over several days, he withdrew his remaining winnings in $1&nbsp;bills, examined each dollar, and (upon discovering that he did not have the winning number) re-deposited roughly half of the money.

Larson is notable for winning $110,237 ({{Inflation|US|110237|1984|r=-3|fmt=eq}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} in cash and prizes, at the time the largest one-day total ever won on a game show. He was able to win by memorizing the patterns used on the ''Press Your Luck'' game board.\n\nOriginally from southwestern [[Ohio]], Larson used his cash winnings for taxes and real estate investments. However, he also had problems with the law and was involved in illegal schemes.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> As a result, Larson lost all of his winnings within two years of the show's taping and moved to [[Florida]], where he later died of [[throat cancer]] at the age of 49. Since his death in 1999, Larson's game has re-aired on TV at various times and inspired two [[Game Show Network]] documentaries: ''Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal'' in 2003 and ''[[Cover Story (TV series)|Cover Story]]: The Press Your Luck Scandal'' in 2018.\n\n==Preparations==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PYL Larson.svg\n| width1 = 300\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Part of one game board pattern that Larson memorized to win over $110,000.

While watching, he noticed that the randomizer that moved the light indicator around the 18-square \"Big Board\" had only five patterns. Larson began memorizing these patterns, increasingly confident he could predict when and where the randomizer would land. As he locked in the patterns, Larson began playing along with the \"Big Board\" rounds to test his hypothesis, pausing his [[VHS]] tape at various intervals with the remote control.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nMoreover, Larson discovered that the fourth and eighth squares (from #1 in the top left corner then clockwise around the board) always contained cash and never a \"Whammy,\" a [[bandit]]-like cartoon character that, when landed on, would result in the resetting of the player's score to zero, accompanied by an on-screen animation that showed the Whammy taking the player's earnings. Larson also learned that square #4 always contained the top dollar values and that, in the second round, contestants were awarded an additional spin if landing on those spots ($3,000, $4,000, or $5,000 in square #4, and $500, $750, or $1,000 in square #8). This proved crucial to Larson's theory, as he could retain control of the board in the second round as long as he wished if he kept following the patterns.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nIn May 1984, Larson used most of his savings to fly to [[Los Angeles]] to audition for ''Press Your Luck''. Contestant supervisor Bobby Edwards was suspicious of Larson's motives when he interviewed Larson on May 19, and was unwilling to allow him on the show, but executive producer [[Bill Carruthers]] overruled him, a move he said he later regretted.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson was added as a contestant on the fourth episode of the taping session, intended to air Friday, June 8, 1984.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nWhile waiting in the [[green room]], Larson met Ed Long, a [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister from [[California]] booked for the third episode of the session. They struck up a conversation. Long recalled that Larson asked how many times he had seen the show. When Long replied he had seen it only once, Larson responded by looking at him as though he \"were from another planet.\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson told Long, \"I really hope we don't have to play each other,\" before leaving the green room, but they would in fact face off as Long won his match and a total of $11,516 in cash and prizes.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> The two men competed against Janie Litras, a dental assistant, in the next episode of the session.\n\n==The game==\n\n===First round===\nAs customary, the game began with the first of two rounds in which contestants answered questions to earn spins for the \"Big Board\"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him here, and he struggled early. On the second question, host [[Peter Tomarken]] asked, \"You've probably got President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in your pocket or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side...\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, \"[[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50 bill]]\" (which has a portrait of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]), after which Tomarken finished the question \"...of what American '''coin'''?\" with the answer being \"a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]]\", the other choice being \"a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]]\".<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 twice for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\n===Second round===\nLarson earned a total of seven spins in the second question round.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Since he was in third place, he got to play first at the \"Big Board\" and went to his pattern play, aiming for squares #4 and #8.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson quickly bumped his total to over $10,000. Early on, his pattern play was irregular, as he stopped four times on squares that did not follow his pattern: a trip to [[Kauai]] worth $1,636 in square #7, $700 and one spin in square #17, \"Pick a Corner\" in square #6 (where he was given the choice of $2,250 in square #1, $2,000 in square #10, or $1,500 and one spin in square #15; he chose $2,250), and a [[sailboat]] worth $1,015 in square #7.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nAfter the sailboat, Larson's pattern play became more accurate, as he hit his target squares each time he spun. Tomarken was increasingly astounded that Larson was still spinning despite not having seen a Whammy for so long.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson continued to press on, passing more and more milestone markers without losing any of his four remaining spins. As he passed the $40,000, $50,000, and $60,000 marks, Tomarken virtually begged Larson to stop more than once, fearing he would hit a Whammy.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Larson finally decided to stop once he reached $102,851. He had by this time made 40 spins on the board without hitting a Whammy, in which 37 were for cash. Of those 37 cash spins he hit square #4 twenty times, including six in a row. He also managed to land on square #8 fifteen times, hitting it consecutively three in a row twice. After he announced he was passing his remaining four spins, Larson raised his arms in triumph and received a [[standing ovation]] from the audience.\n\nBy rule, Larson's spins went to Litras as she had the next highest money total. However, since she was the leader after the first round, she had to wait to play until Long, who earned two spins in the second round of questions, completed his turn. On the first of his two spins, a bewildered Long hit a Whammy and lost the money he earned in the first round, leading Tomarken to wonder aloud if Larson \"knew that the Whammy was coming.\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Long hit $5,000 and a spin on his next spin and did it again on the spin after that, but hit a second Whammy with his final spin.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nLitras then took her turn, starting with the first of the four spins Larson had passed that she was required to take by rule. On that spin, she hit a Whammy and lost her first round total. However, since she had Whammied, the remaining passed spins were moved into the earned column and added to the three spins Litras earned in the second question round, giving her a total of six spins. Litras picked up $9,385 in cash and prizes in five total spins, but because she managed to hit spaces with extra spins, she used only three.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Litras then passed those spins to Larson, who was visibly upset and said, \"I didn't want 'em,\" as he received the three spins.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nNonetheless, Larson picked up where he had left off, following his patterns, and hit his marks with his first two spins. He hit square #17 on his last spin, which was a space that had a Whammy in it, but he stopped the board before the Whammy could shuffle into the square and won a trip to [[The Bahamas]] valued at $2,636, causing Tomarken to joke, \"With that money, you could ''buy'' The Bahamas, Michael!\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> This brought Larson's total to $110,237, and he had two earned spins to work with. Larson passed them to Litras, who failed to earn any additional spins with them, ending the game. Larson's final total included $104,950 in cash.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nAt the end of the episode, Tomarken asked Larson why he decided not to pass his remaining spins before he did, considering the lead he rapidly gained over Litras and Long. Side-stepping revealing how he had won the game, Larson responded with, \"Two things: one, it felt right, and second, I still had seven spins and if I passed them, somebody could've done what I did.\"<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\n===Episode length===\nEach episode of ''Press Your Luck'' was thirty minutes in length, and prior to Larson's appearance, the series had never needed to straddle games or stop during play as a match would always be completed within the allotted time frame.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> However, Larson's streak of hitting his marks every time stretched the length of the episode well past the usual thirty minutes and the producers were unsure how to proceed. While the entire episode was recorded in one shot, the production staff decided that it would need to be split up for airing.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nOnce Larson passed $36,000, the producers cut to a freeze frame of the contestant area and Tomarken (in a [[chroma key]] shot) then tossed to a commercial. Once back from the commercial, Tomarken informed the viewers that because of the extraordinary circumstances, the match could not be completed on the June 8 episode and would instead be finished on the next scheduled airing on Monday, June 11. He then signed off with the words \"To be continued...\" superimposed on the screen.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nWhen ''Press Your Luck'' returned after the weekend break, the episode started with the same freeze frame image. Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought the viewers up to speed on what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then introducing Larson and explaining what he had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead into and out of the first two commercial breaks when Larson eclipsed the $50,000 and $100,000 marks, with voiceovers by Tomarken leading into and out of them.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\n==Accusations of cheating==\nWhile Larson was running up the score, the show's producers contacted Michael Brockman, then head of CBS's daytime programming department.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> In a 1994 ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview commemorating the Larson sweep, conducted at the time the movie ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' was released, he recalled, \"Something was very wrong. Here was this guy from nowhere, and he was hitting the bonus box every time. It was bedlam, I can tell you, and we couldn't stop this guy. He kept going around the board and hitting that box.\"<ref name=TVGuide>{{cite web | url=http://www.xanfan.com/pressyourluck/larson.htm | title=The Day the Game Show Got Whammied | work=TV Guide | date=November 1994 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020110005632/http://www.xanfan.com/pressyourluck/larson.htm | archivedate=January 10, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe program's producers and Brockman met to review the videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the fraction of a second it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he knew he was going to get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern \u2013 he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/>\n\nAt first, CBS refused to pay Larson, considering him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers could not find a clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with these patterns from the beginning of the series), and the network complied.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.<ref name=\"Damn Interesting\"/>\n\nThe five original light patterns on the \"Big Board\" were replaced with five new ones for about a month, and those were replaced with a different set of five new patterns for another month. A further reprogramming of the board with 32 patterns was completed in August 1984, effectively ensuring that no one could duplicate Larson's trick; all subsequent versions employ this method.<ref name=\"bigbucks\"/> The show ended its run in September 1986.\n\n==Episode broadcasts==\nAfter the broadcast of Larson's two episodes, CBS suppressed the episodes for nineteen years,<ref name=Supress/> as both the network and ''Press Your Luck'' producer/creator Bill Carruthers at that time considered the incident to be one of their biggest embarrassments.<ref name=\"Supress\">{{cite news | url=http://business.highbeam.com/3972/article-1G1-98803104/gameshow-flick-uncovers-press-mess | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914000535/http://business.highbeam.com/3972/article-1G1-98803104/gameshow-flick-uncovers-press-mess | url-status=dead | archive-date=September 14, 2014 | title=Television review; Game-show flick uncovers ''Press'' mess | publisher=Herald Media | work=[[Boston Herald]] | date=March 15, 2003 | last=Ruch | first=John | page=28}}</ref> When [[USA Network]] (and later, [[Game Show Network]]) bought the rights to rerun ''Press Your Luck'', CBS and Carruthers insisted that the Larson episodes must not be aired.\n\nOn March 16, 2003, GSN was allowed to air the episodes as part of a two-hour documentary called ''Big Bucks: The ''Press Your Luck'' Scandal'', hosted and narrated by Tomarken.

Over several days, he withdrew his remaining winnings in $1&nbsp;bills, examined each dollar, and (upon discovering that he did not have the winning number) re-deposited roughly half of the money.
