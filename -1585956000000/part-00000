This was Sir Roger Moore's final film appearance and the film was dedicated to his memory; Moore portrayed Templar in a [[The Saint (TV series)|1960s TV series of the same title]]. Filmed in 2013 as a [[television pilot]] for a proposed TV series, the film was not originally intended for release when the series was not picked up. It eventually saw release direct-to-video in 2017 when it was released in tribute to Moore following his death. [[Ian Ogilvy]], who portrayed Templar in a 1970s TV series titled ''[[Return of the Saint]]'', also appears.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[Simon Templar]] intervenes when terrorists attempt to trade gold to the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] for bombs. After subduing both parties, he takes most of the gold and escapes, leaving his calling card as \"The Saint\". Agent Cooper of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has been monitoring the meeting.\n\n[[President of Nigeria|Nigerian President]] Ezekiel Ibaka secures $2.5 billion in private aid for his country, but a mysterious man ([[Ian Ogilvy]]) instructs associate Arnie Valecross, a private banker with criminal ties, to steal the funds. He gives Valecross a ring, claiming that it is an heirloom he took from \"someone pathetic\". \n\nTemplar takes the gold from the Moscow heist to an old friend in [[Bucharest]]. He gives instructions to distribute the funds among various [[humanitarian aid]] organizations. \n\nIn [[Los Angeles]], Valecross diverts the funds to one of his own accounts and requests protection from the FBI. His mysterious employer sends his henchman, Rayt Marius, to kidnap Valecross' daughter Zooey, giving Arnie only 48 hours to return the money. \n\nIn [[Paris, France]], Templar hears of the Nigerian theft and agrees to help recover the funds. Simon's friend [[Patricia Holm]] and the FBI each use their own methods to quickly identify the thief as Valecross and track him to the Grand Del Mar Resort in [[San Diego]].\n\nSpecial Agent John Henry Fernack, who has been pursuing The Saint for years, gets to Valecross' suite first and unsuccessfully attempts to question him. Templar uses the adjoining room to break into Valecross' suite, but he is discovered. Valecross asks Templar to rescue his daughter. Marius uses a helicopter to fire on Templar through the window. Templar shoots down the helicopter, but Valecross is fatally wounded. As he dies, Valecross tells Templar, \"The account numbers are in your ring, the key is in the nomad.\"\n\nSimon and Patricia engage Doyle Cosentino to develop a new plan now that Valecross is dead. It is revealed that Simon met Patricia in Iraq while escaping from the Russian deal. The trio search for the \"nomad\" in Valecross' home. Mrs Valecross immediately recognizes Templar. They decide to call Marius, who has a history with Patricia.\n\nFernack obtains help from the Los Angeles Police Department in the form of Detective Garces ([[Greg Grunberg]]). The two men nearly catch Simon when he, Patricia and Doyle leave the Valecross home. The trio notice the men tailing them and escape. Fernack catches up to Templar on a [[funicular]] railway car in a busy retail area. Simon overpowers and handcuffs him, escaping by jumping onto a car moving in the opposite direction. Simon, Patricia and Doyle visit former counterfeiter Sonali Alves in her hidden [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighting studio and gambling den. They ask for help breaking into Valecross' data storage facility. She forces Simon to battle a fighter in the ring while handcuffed in exchange for the heist gear he needs. During the fight, Simon's handcuffs are broken and he easily defeats his opponent.\n\nEntering the storage facility, Patricia knocks out the guards. She guides Simon as he penetrates the security on two heavy duty doors and disables the pressure-sensitive floor. He uses a glove that mimics fingerprints of a building employee to access the computer server room, and begins searching for the account data. Fernack arrives too late and Simon escapes with the data, locking Fernack in the server room. Outside, Templar finds that Garces has been shot and that Marius has captured Patricia.\n\nFernack agrees to work with Simon to rescue Patricia and Zooey. Overpowering the armed guards on the boat, they attempt to trade the stolen funds for Marius' hostages. Marius reveals that Patricia is his ex-wife and that he is working for the man who killed Simon's parents. Fernack tries to rescue Zooey but is restrained by her stepmother, who is working with Marius. Templar shoots Marius when tries to use Zooey as a shield and Patricia knocks him to the floor. Marius refuses to identify his employer. \n\nZooey returns the money to President Ibaka. Templar evades Fernack. \n\nThe mysterious man calls for help from an associate ([[Roger Moore]]) who refuses him, knowing their superiors will make an example of him for his failure. Simon tails the mystery man, recognizing him as his parents' killer by a unique tattoo on his arm. Templar identifies him as Xander, hired by Simon's father to train Simon to fight as a youth. Resisting the urge to kill the man, Templar allows Xander to be arrested by Agent Cooper on terrorism charges. Simon disappears from sight.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Adam Rayner]] as [[Simon Templar]]\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as [[Patricia Holm]]\n* Sir [[Roger Moore]] as Jasper\n* [[James Remar]] as Arnold Valecross\n* [[Ian Ogilvy]] as The Fixer/older Xander\n* [[Adam Woodward]] as Xander\n* [[Enrique Murciano]] as Inspector John Henry Fernack \n* [[Sammi Hanratty]] as Zooey Valecross\n* [[Greg Grunberg]] as Detective Garces\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Rayt Marius\n* [[Yani Gellman]] as Doyle Cosentino\n* Kristy Mitchell as Mrs. Templar\n* [[Beatrice Rosen]] as Katherine Valecross\n* [[Melissa Bolona]] as Guest Star\n* [[Jason Brooks (actor)|Jason Brooks]] as Captain Miller\n* [[Christopher Villiers]] as Arthur Templar\n* [[Louis Hynes]] as Young Simon Templar\n* [[Femi Elufowoju Jr.]] as Ezekiel Ibaka\n* [[Alec Secareanu]] as Bashir\n* [[Richard Ashton]] as Vadim / Gerry\n* [[Andrew Pleavin]] as Andrei\n* Sonalii Castillo as Sonali Alves\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n\nIn December 2012, it was announced that [[Roger Moore]] would produce a new series, which would star [[Adam Rayner]] as Simon Templar and [[Eliza Dushku]] as his assistant Patricia Holm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/Lifestyle-and-leisure/Movies/The-Saint-is-back-Dr-who-miranda-adam-rayner-eliza-dushku-buffy-dollhouse-roger-moore.htm |title=The Saint Is Back |work= Bedfordshire-news.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/eliza-dushku-to-co-star-in-the-saint-backdoor-pilot-roger-moore-to-co-produce/ |title=Eliza Dushku To Co-Star In \u2018The Saint\u2019 Backdoor Pilot, Roger Moore To Co-Produce |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref> In a promotion that was later released, it was also shown that Moore would star in the new series, as would his successor in ''Return of the Saint'', [[Ian Ogilvy]].

Permanent settlements at [[Mehrgarh]], currently in [[Balochistan]], to the west expanded into Sindh. This culture blossomed over several millennia and gave rise to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] around 3000 BC. The Indus Valley Civilization rivalled the contemporary civilizations of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] in size and scope, numbering nearly half a million inhabitants at its height with well-planned grid cities and sewer systems.\n\nThe primitive village communities in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] were still struggling against a difficult highland environment, a highly cultured people were trying to assert themselves at [[Kot Diji]]. This was one of the most developed urban civilizations of the ancient world. It flourished between the 25th and 15th centuries BC in the Indus valley sites of [[Mohenjo Daro]] and [[Harappa]]. The people had a high standard of art and craftsmanship and a well-developed system of quasi-pictographic writing which remains un-deciphered. The ruins of the well planned towns, the brick buildings of the common people, roads, public baths and the covered drainage system suggest a highly organized community.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/138 |title=Archaeological Ruins at Moanjodaro|author= |date= |website= The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) website |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some accounts, there is no evidence of large palaces or burial grounds for the elite.

Sindh was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BC. In the late 4th century BC, Sindh was conquered by a mixed army led by [[Macedon|Macedonian Greeks]] under [[Alexander the Great]]. The region remained under control of Greek satraps for only a few decades. After Alexander's death, there was a brief period of [[Seleucid]] rule, before Sindh was traded to the [[Mauryan Empire]] led by [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] in 305 BC. During the rule of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist religion]] spread to Sindh.\n\nMauryan rule ended in 185 BC with the overthrow of the last king by the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] Dynasty. In the disorder that followed, Greek rule returned when [[Demetrius I of Bactria]] led a [[Greco-Bactrian]] invasion of India and annexed most of the northwestern lands, including Sindh. Demetrius was later defeated and killed by a usurper, but his descendants continued to rule Sindh and other lands as the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. Under the reign of [[Menander I]], many Indo-Greeks followed his example and converted to Buddhism.\n\nIn the late 2nd century BC, [[Scythians|Scythian]] tribes shattered the Greco-Bactrian empire and invaded the Indo-Greek lands. Unable to take the [[Punjab region]], they invaded South Asia through Sindh, where they became known as [[Indo-Scythians]] (later [[Western Satraps]]). By the 1st century AD, the [[Kushan Empire]] annexed Sindh.

These rulers were defeated by the [[Kidarites]] in the late 4th century.\n\nIt then came under the [[Gupta Empire]] after dealing with the Kidarites. By the late 5th century, attacks by [[Hephthalite]] tribes known as the Indo-Hephthalites or ''Hunas'' ([[Huns]]) broke through the Gupta Empire's northwestern borders and overran much of northwestern India. Concurrently, [[Ror dynasty]] ruled parts of the region for several centuries.\n\nAfterwards, Sindh came under the rule of Emperor [[Harshavardhan]], then the [[Rai Dynasty]] around 478.

Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi viewed the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] to be the caliphs thus he removed the remaining influence of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the region and Sindh fell to Abbasid control following the defeat of the Habbaris. The Abbasid Caliphate then appointed [[Khafif|Al Khafif]] from [[Samarra]]; 'Soomro' means 'of Samarra' in Sindhi. The new governor of Sindh was to create a better, stronger and stable government. Once he became the governor, he allotted several key positions to his family and friends; thus Al-Khafif or Sardar Khafif Soomro formed the [[Rajput]] [[Soomro Dynasty]] in Sindh;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uok.edu.pk/faculties/sindhi/docs/soomroEng.pdf |title=Data |website=www.uok.edu.pk }}</ref> and became its first ruler. Until the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] the Soomro dynasty was the Abbasid Caliphate's functionary in Sindh, but after that it became independent.\n\nWhen the [[Soomro dynasty]] lost ties with the Abbasid Caliphate after the Siege of Baghdad (1258,) the Soomra ruler Dodo-I established their rule from the shores of the [[Arabian Sea]] to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the north and in the east to [[Rajasthan]] and in the west to Pakistani [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]]. The [[Soomro]]s were one of the first indigenous Muslim dynasties in Sindh of [[Parmar]] [[Rajput]] origin.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.uok.edu.pk/faculties/sindhi/docs/soomroEng.pdf |title=The Soomras of Sindh: their origin, main characteristics and rule \u2013 an overview (general survey) (1025 \u2013 1351 AD) |first=Habibullah |last=Siddiqui |journal=Literary Conference on Soomra Period in Sindh}}</ref> They were the first Muslims to translate the [[Quran]] into the [[Sindhi language]]. The Soomros created a chivalrous culture in Sindh, which eventually facilitated their rule centred at [[Mansura, Sindh|Mansura]]. It was later abandoned due to changes in the course of the Puran River; they ruled for the next 95 years until 1351. During this period, Kutch was ruled by the [[Samma Dynasty]], who enjoyed good relations with the Soomras in Sindh. Since the [[Soomro Dynasty]] lost its support from the Abbasid Caliphate, the Sultans of [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]] wanted a piece of Sindh. The Soomros successfully defended their kingdom for about 36 years, but their dynasties soon fell to the might of the [[Sultanate of Delhi]]'s massive armies such as the [[Tughluk]]s and the [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]].\n\n=== Samma Dynasty period ===\n{{Main|Samma dynasty}}\n[[File:View of Makli by Usman Ghani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Makli Hill]] is one of the largest necropolises in the world.]]\nIn 1339 [[Jam Unar]] founded a Sindhi [[Muslim Rajput]] [[Samma Dynasty]] and challenged the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultans of Delhi]]. He used the title of the ''Sultan of Sindh''. The [[Samma tribe]] reached its peak during the reign of [[Jam Nizamuddin II]] (also known by the nickname J\u00e1m Nind\u00f3). During his reign from 1461 to 1509, Nind\u00f3 greatly expanded the new capital of [[Thatta]] and its [[Makli]] hills, which replaced [[Debal]]. He patronized Sindhi art, architecture and culture. The Samma had left behind a popular legacy especially in architecture, music and art. Important court figures included the poet Kazi Kadal, [[Sardar Darya Khan]], Moltus Khan, Makhdoom Bilawal and the [[theologian]] Kazi Kaadan. However, Thatta was a port city; unlike garrison towns, it could not mobilize large armies against the [[Arghun]] and Tarkhan [[Mongol]] invaders, who killed many regional Sindhi [[Mirs]] and [[Amir]]s loyal to the Samma. Some parts of Sindh still remained under the Sultans of Delhi and the ruthless Arghuns and the [[Tarkhan]]s sacked Thatta during the rule of [[Jam Feroz]]udin.\n\n=== Migration of Baloch ===\n{{Main|Sindhi Baloch}}\nAccording to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, [[Professor]] at [[University of Karachi]], and Nadeem Wagan, [[General Manager]] at [[HANDS]], the [[Baloch people|Balochi]] migrated from [[Balochistan region|Balochistan]] during the [[Little Ice Age]] and settled in Sindh and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

Geographically it is the third largest province of Pakistan, stretching about {{convert|579|km}} from north to south and {{convert|442|km}} (extreme) or {{convert|281|km}} (average) from east to west, with an area of {{convert|140915|km2|sqmi}} of Pakistani territory. Sindh is bounded by the [[Thar Desert]] to the east, the [[Kirthar Mountains]] to the west and the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south. In the centre is a fertile plain along the [[Indus River]].\n[[File:Sindhri Mango.JPG|alt=Sindhri mangoes is among top 10 mango varieties in the world|left|thumb|[[Sindhri]] is among top 10 [[mango varieties]] in the [[world]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dubai/queen-of-mangoes-sindhri-from-pakistan-in-uae|title=Queen of Mangoes: Sindhri from Pakistan now in UAE|last=Menon|first=Sunita|website=Khaleej Times|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>]]\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Blackbuck1-Kirthar National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Sindh ibex]] in [[Kirthar National Park]]]]\nThe province is mostly arid with scant vegetation except for the irrigated Indus Valley. The dwarf palm, ''Acacia Rupestris'' (kher), and ''[[Tecomella undulata]]'' ([[Rohida|lohirro]]) trees are typical of the western hill region. In the Indus valley, the ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' (babul) (babbur) is the most dominant and occurs in thick forests along the Indus banks. The ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'' (neem) (nim), ''Zizyphys vulgaris'' (bir) (ber), ''Tamarix orientalis'' (jujuba lai) and ''[[Capparis aphylla]]'' (kirir) are among the more common trees.\n\nMango, date palms and the more recently introduced banana, guava, orange and [[chiku]] are the typical fruit-bearing trees. The coastal strip and the creeks abound in semi-aquatic and aquatic plants and the inshore Indus delta islands have forests of ''Avicennia tomentosa'' (timmer) and ''[[Ceriops tagal|Ceriops candolleana]]'' (chaunir) trees. Water lilies grow in abundance in the numerous lake and ponds, particularly in the lower Sindh region.\n\n=== Fauna ===\n{{Main|Fauna of Sindh}}\n[[Image:Schnabeldelphin-drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Indus river dolphin]]\nAmong the wild animals, the [[Sindh ibex]] (sareh), [[blackbuck]], wild sheep ([[Urial]] or gadh) and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] are found in the western rocky range. The [[leopard]] is now rare and the [[Asiatic cheetah]] extinct. The [[Fishing cat|Pirrang]] (large tiger cat or fishing cat) of the eastern desert region is also disappearing. [[Chinkara|Deer]] occur in the lower rocky plains and in the eastern region, as do the striped [[hyena]] (charakh), [[jackal]], [[fox]], [[porcupine]], [[mongoose|common gray mongoose]] and [[hedgehog]]. The Sindhi phekari, red lynx or Caracal cat, is found in some areas. Phartho (hog deer) and wild bear occur, particularly in the central inundation belt. There are bats, lizards and reptiles, including the cobra, lundi (viper) and the mysterious Sindh [[krait]] of the Thar region, which is supposed to suck the victim's breath in his sleep.\nSome unusual sightings of Asian cheetah occurred in 2003 near the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] border in [[Kirthar Mountains]]. The rare [[houbara bustard]] find Sindh's warm climate suitable to rest and mate. Unfortunately, it is hunted by locals and foreigners.\n\nCrocodiles are rare and inhabit only the backwaters of the Indus, eastern Nara channel and Karachi backwater. Besides a large variety of marine fish, the plumbeous dolphin, the beaked dolphin, rorqual or blue whale and skates frequent the seas along the Sindh coast. The Pallo (Sable fish), a marine fish, ascends the Indus annually from February to April to spawn. The [[Indus river dolphin]] is among the most endangered species in Pakistan and is found in the part of the Indus river in northern Sindh. [[Indian hog deer|Hog deer]] and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] occur, particularly in the central inundation belt.\n\nAlthough Sindh has a [[semi arid]] climate, through its coastal and riverine forests, its huge fresh water lakes and mountains and deserts, Sindh supports a large amount of varied wildlife. Due to the semi-arid [[climate of Sindh]] the left out forests support an average population of jackals and snakes. The [[national parks]] established by the Government of Pakistan in collaboration with many organizations such as [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Sindh Wildlife Department]] support a huge variety of animals and birds. The [[Kirthar National Park]] in the Kirthar range spreads over more than 3000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of desert, stunted tree forests and a lake. The KNP supports [[Sindh ibex]], [[wild sheep]] (urial) and [[Asian black bear|black bear]] along with the rare leopard. There are also occasional sightings of The Sindhi phekari, ped lynx or Caracal cat. There is a project to introduce [[tiger]]s and [[Asian elephant]]s too in KNP near the huge Hub Dam Lake. Between July and November when the [[monsoon]] winds blow onshore from the ocean, giant [[olive ridley]] turtles lay their eggs along the seaward side. The turtles are protected species. After the mothers lay and leave them buried under the sands the SWD and WWF officials take the eggs and protect them until they are hatched to keep them from predators.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Sindh}}\n[[File:Ayub.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lansdowne Railway Bridge]]\nSindh lies in a [[tropical]] to [[subtropical]] region; it is hot in the summer and mild to warm in winter. Temperatures frequently rise above {{convert|46|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on|lk=on}} between May and August, and the minimum average temperature of {{convert|2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} occurs during December and January in the northern and higher elevated regions. The annual rainfall averages about seven inches, falling mainly during July and August. The southwest monsoon wind begins in mid-February and continues until the end of September, whereas the cool northerly wind blows during the winter months from October to January.\n\nSindh lies between the two [[monsoon]]s\u2014the southwest monsoon from the Indian Ocean and the northeast or retreating monsoon, deflected towards it by the [[Himalayas|Himalayan mountains]]\u2014and escapes the influence of both. The region's scarcity of rainfall is compensated by the inundation of the Indus twice a year, caused by the spring and summer melting of Himalayan snow and by rainfall in the monsoon season.\n\nSindh is divided into three climatic regions: Siro (the upper region, centred on [[Jacobabad]]), Wicholo (the middle region, centred on [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]), and Lar (the lower region, centred on [[Karachi]]). The [[thermal equator]] passes through upper Sindh, where the air is generally very dry. Central Sindh's temperatures are generally lower than those of upper Sindh but higher than those of lower Sindh. Dry hot days and cool nights are typical during the summer. Central Sindh's maximum temperature typically reaches {{convert|43|-|44|C|F}}. Lower Sindh has a damper and humid maritime climate affected by the southwestern winds in summer and northeastern winds in winter, with lower [[rainfall]] than Central Sindh. Lower Sindh's maximum temperature reaches about {{convert|35|-|38|C|F}}. In the Kirthar range at {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} and higher at [[Gorakh Hill]] and other peaks in [[Dadu District]], temperatures near freezing have been recorded and brief snowfall is received in the winters.\n\n== Major cities ==\n{{Main|List of most populous cities in Pakistan|List of cities in Sindh|List of cities in Sindh by population}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 70%; font-size: 85%; border: #999 solid 1px; text-align: lcenter; margin-bottom: 0; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| '''List of major cities in Sindh'''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| Rank\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| City\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| District(s)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| Population\n\n! rowspan=11 width:150|\n<br/>[[File:Tomb Jinnah.jpg|border|80px]]<br/>[[Karachi]]<br/>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| 1 ||align=left | '''[[Karachi]]''' ||align=left | [[Karachi East District|Karachi East]]<br/>[[Karachi West District|Karachi West]]<br/>[[Karachi South District|Karachi South]]<br/>[[Karachi Central District|Karachi Central]]<br/>[[Malir District|Malir]]<br/>[[Korangi District|Korangi]] || 14,910,352\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| 2 ||align=left | '''[[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]''' ||align=left | [[Hyderabad District, Pakistan|Hyderabad]] || 1,732,693\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| 3 ||align=left | '''[[Sukkur]]''' ||align=left | [[Sukkur District|Sukkur]] || 1,400,000\n|-\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#f5f5f5;\"| '''Source: Pakistan Census 2017<ref name=census>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbscensus.gov.pk |title=Pakistan Bureau of Statistics \u2013 6th Population and Housing Census |website=www.pbscensus.gov.pk}}</ref>'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#f5f5f5;\"| '''This is a list of each city's urban populations and does not indicate total district populations'''\n|}\n\n== Government ==\n=== Sindh province ===\n{| class=\"infobox borderless\"\n|+ Provincial symbols of Sindh<ref name=\"Faiza Ilyas\">{{cite news|last1=Ilyas|first1=Faiza|title=Provincial mammal, bird notified|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/733088|accessdate=3 November 2016|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=10 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/978487/govt-declares-neem-provincial-tree|title=Govt declares Neem 'provincial tree'|author= |date=April 15, 2010 |website= Dawn|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/12/14/city/karachi/%E2%80%98our-sindhi-symbols-%E2%80%93-ibex-black-partridge%E2%80%99/|title=Our Sindhi symbols \u2013 ibex, black partridge|author=Amar Guriro |date=December 14, 2011 |website= Pakistan Today|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Historically, Sindh's contribution to Pakistan's GDP has been between 30% to 32.7%. Its share in the service sector has ranged from 21% to 27.8% and in the agriculture sector from 21.4% to 27.7%. Performance wise, its best sector is the manufacturing sector, where its share has ranged from 36.7% to 46.5%.\n\nEndowed with coastal access, Sindh is a major centre of economic activity in Pakistan and has a highly diversified economy ranging from heavy industry and finance centred in Karachi to a substantial agricultural base along the [[Indus River|Indus]].

Perhaps the most professed exposition of Sindhi culture is in the handicrafts of [[Haala|Hala]], a town some 30 kilometres from [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]. Hala's artisans manufacture high-quality and impressively priced wooden handicrafts, textiles, paintings, handmade paper products, and blue pottery. Lacquered wood works known as Jandi, painting on wood, tiles, and pottery known as Kashi, hand weaved textiles including ''[[khadi]]'', ''susi'', and ''[[ajrak]]s'' are synonymous with Sindhi culture preserved in Hala's handicraft.\n\nThe work of Sindhi artisans was sold in ancient markets of Damascus, Baghdad, Basra, Istanbul, Cairo and Samarkand. Referring to the lacquer work on wood locally known as Jandi, T. Posten (an English traveller who visited Sindh in the early 19th century) asserted that the articles of Hala could be compared with exquisite specimens of China. Technological improvements such as the spinning wheel ([[Charkha (spinning wheel)|charkha]]) and treadle (pai-chah) in the weaver's loom were gradually introduced and the processes of designing, dyeing and printing by block were refined. The refined, lightweight, colourful, washable fabrics from Hala became a luxury for people used to the woollens and linens of the age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wishwebdesign.com/dgaewm/otherinfo/Cultural-Heritage/542/533|title=Cultural Heritage|author= |date=|website=wishwebdesign.com = |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as the World Wildlife Fund, Pakistan, play an important role to promote the culture of Sindh. They provide training to women artisans in the interior of Sindh so they get a source of income. They promote their products under the name of \"Crafts Forever\". Many women in rural Sindh are skilled in the production of caps. Sindhi caps are manufactured commercially on a small scale at New Saeedabad and Hala New. These are in demand with visitors from Karachi and other places; however, these manufacturing units have a limited production capacity.

Permanent settlements at [[Mehrgarh]], currently in [[Balochistan]], to the west expanded into Sindh. This culture blossomed over several millennia and gave rise to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] around 3000 BC. The Indus Valley Civilization rivalled the contemporary civilizations of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] in size and scope, numbering nearly half a million inhabitants at its height with well-planned grid cities and sewer systems.\n\nThe primitive village communities in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] were still struggling against a difficult highland environment, a highly cultured people were trying to assert themselves at [[Kot Diji]]. This was one of the most developed urban civilizations of the ancient world. It flourished between the 25th and 15th centuries BC in the Indus valley sites of [[Mohenjo Daro]] and [[Harappa]]. The people had a high standard of art and craftsmanship and a well-developed system of quasi-pictographic writing which remains un-deciphered. The ruins of the well planned towns, the brick buildings of the common people, roads, public baths and the covered drainage system suggest a highly organized community.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/138 |title=Archaeological Ruins at Moanjodaro|author= |date= |website= The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) website |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some accounts, there is no evidence of large palaces or burial grounds for the elite.

Sindh was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BC. In the late 4th century BC, Sindh was conquered by a mixed army led by [[Macedon|Macedonian Greeks]] under [[Alexander the Great]]. The region remained under control of Greek satraps for only a few decades. After Alexander's death, there was a brief period of [[Seleucid]] rule, before Sindh was traded to the [[Mauryan Empire]] led by [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] in 305 BC. During the rule of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist religion]] spread to Sindh.\n\nMauryan rule ended in 185 BC with the overthrow of the last king by the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] Dynasty. In the disorder that followed, Greek rule returned when [[Demetrius I of Bactria]] led a [[Greco-Bactrian]] invasion of India and annexed most of the northwestern lands, including Sindh. Demetrius was later defeated and killed by a usurper, but his descendants continued to rule Sindh and other lands as the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. Under the reign of [[Menander I]], many Indo-Greeks followed his example and converted to Buddhism.\n\nIn the late 2nd century BC, [[Scythians|Scythian]] tribes shattered the Greco-Bactrian empire and invaded the Indo-Greek lands. Unable to take the [[Punjab region]], they invaded South Asia through Sindh, where they became known as [[Indo-Scythians]] (later [[Western Satraps]]). By the 1st century AD, the [[Kushan Empire]] annexed Sindh. [[Kushan]]s under [[Kanishka]] were great patrons of Buddhism and sponsored many building projects for local beliefs.<ref>which began about AD 127. \"Falk 2001, pp. 121\u2013136\", Falk (2001), pp. 121\u2013136, Falk, Harry (2004), pp. 167\u2013176 and Hill (2009), pp. 29, 33, 368\u2013371.</ref> [[Ahirs]] were also found in large numbers in Sindh.<ref name=\"Beames1970\">{{cite book|author=John Beames|title=A comparative grammar of the modern Aryan languages of India: to wit, Hindi, Panjabi, Sindhi, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya and Bengali |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIddAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 March 2011|year=1970|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal}}</ref> [[Abiria]] country of [[Abhira tribe]] was in southern Sindh.<ref>Foreign influence on ancient India By Krishna Chandra Sagar</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&pg=PA122&dq=abiria+were+greeks#v=onepage&q=abiria%20&f=false |title=Foreign Influence on Ancient India \u2013 Krishna Chandra Sagar \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=2012-08-03|isbn=9788172110284 |last1=Sagar |first1=Krishna Chandra |year=1992 }}</ref>\n\nThe Kushan Empire was defeated in the mid 3rd century AD by the [[Sassanid Empire]] of Persia, who installed vassals known as the [[Indo-Sassanian|Kushanshahs]] in these far eastern territories. These rulers were defeated by the [[Kidarites]] in the late 4th century.\n\nIt then came under the [[Gupta Empire]] after dealing with the Kidarites. By the late 5th century, attacks by [[Hephthalite]] tribes known as the Indo-Hephthalites or ''Hunas'' ([[Huns]]) broke through the Gupta Empire's northwestern borders and overran much of northwestern India. Concurrently, [[Ror dynasty]] ruled parts of the region for several centuries.\n\nAfterwards, Sindh came under the rule of Emperor [[Harshavardhan]], then the [[Rai Dynasty]] around 478. The Rais were overthrown by Chachar of [[Aror|Alor]] around 632.

The Umayyads appointed [[Habbari dynasty|Aziz al Habbari]] as the governor of Sindh. Habbaris ruled Sindh until [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]] defeated the Habbaris in 1024. Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi viewed the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] to be the caliphs thus he removed the remaining influence of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the region and Sindh fell to Abbasid control following the defeat of the Habbaris. The Abbasid Caliphate then appointed [[Khafif|Al Khafif]] from [[Samarra]]; 'Soomro' means 'of Samarra' in Sindhi. The new governor of Sindh was to create a better, stronger and stable government. Once he became the governor, he allotted several key positions to his family and friends; thus Al-Khafif or Sardar Khafif Soomro formed the [[Rajput]] [[Soomro Dynasty]] in Sindh;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uok.edu.pk/faculties/sindhi/docs/soomroEng.pdf |title=Data |website=www.uok.edu.pk }}</ref> and became its first ruler. Until the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] the Soomro dynasty was the Abbasid Caliphate's functionary in Sindh, but after that it became independent.\n\nWhen the [[Soomro dynasty]] lost ties with the Abbasid Caliphate after the Siege of Baghdad (1258,) the Soomra ruler Dodo-I established their rule from the shores of the [[Arabian Sea]] to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the north and in the east to [[Rajasthan]] and in the west to Pakistani [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]]. The [[Soomro]]s were one of the first indigenous Muslim dynasties in Sindh of [[Parmar]] [[Rajput]] origin.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.uok.edu.pk/faculties/sindhi/docs/soomroEng.pdf |title=The Soomras of Sindh: their origin, main characteristics and rule \u2013 an overview (general survey) (1025 \u2013 1351 AD) |first=Habibullah |last=Siddiqui |journal=Literary Conference on Soomra Period in Sindh}}</ref> They were the first Muslims to translate the [[Quran]] into the [[Sindhi language]]. The Soomros created a chivalrous culture in Sindh, which eventually facilitated their rule centred at [[Mansura, Sindh|Mansura]]. It was later abandoned due to changes in the course of the Puran River; they ruled for the next 95 years until 1351. During this period, Kutch was ruled by the [[Samma Dynasty]], who enjoyed good relations with the Soomras in Sindh. Since the [[Soomro Dynasty]] lost its support from the Abbasid Caliphate, the Sultans of [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]] wanted a piece of Sindh. The Soomros successfully defended their kingdom for about 36 years, but their dynasties soon fell to the might of the [[Sultanate of Delhi]]'s massive armies such as the [[Tughluk]]s and the [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]].\n\n=== Samma Dynasty period ===\n{{Main|Samma dynasty}}\n[[File:View of Makli by Usman Ghani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Makli Hill]] is one of the largest necropolises in the world.]]\nIn 1339 [[Jam Unar]] founded a Sindhi [[Muslim Rajput]] [[Samma Dynasty]] and challenged the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultans of Delhi]]. He used the title of the ''Sultan of Sindh''. The [[Samma tribe]] reached its peak during the reign of [[Jam Nizamuddin II]] (also known by the nickname J\u00e1m Nind\u00f3). During his reign from 1461 to 1509, Nind\u00f3 greatly expanded the new capital of [[Thatta]] and its [[Makli]] hills, which replaced [[Debal]]. He patronized Sindhi art, architecture and culture. The Samma had left behind a popular legacy especially in architecture, music and art. Important court figures included the poet Kazi Kadal, [[Sardar Darya Khan]], Moltus Khan, Makhdoom Bilawal and the [[theologian]] Kazi Kaadan. However, Thatta was a port city; unlike garrison towns, it could not mobilize large armies against the [[Arghun]] and Tarkhan [[Mongol]] invaders, who killed many regional Sindhi [[Mirs]] and [[Amir]]s loyal to the Samma. Some parts of Sindh still remained under the Sultans of Delhi and the ruthless Arghuns and the [[Tarkhan]]s sacked Thatta during the rule of [[Jam Feroz]]udin.\n\n=== Migration of Baloch ===\n{{Main|Sindhi Baloch}}\nAccording to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, [[Professor]] at [[University of Karachi]], and Nadeem Wagan, [[General Manager]] at [[HANDS]], the [[Baloch people|Balochi]] migrated from [[Balochistan region|Balochistan]] during the [[Little Ice Age]] and settled in Sindh and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

Geographically it is the third largest province of Pakistan, stretching about {{convert|579|km}} from north to south and {{convert|442|km}} (extreme) or {{convert|281|km}} (average) from east to west, with an area of {{convert|140915|km2|sqmi}} of Pakistani territory. Sindh is bounded by the [[Thar Desert]] to the east, the [[Kirthar Mountains]] to the west and the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south. In the centre is a fertile plain along the [[Indus River]].\n[[File:Sindhri Mango.JPG|alt=Sindhri mangoes is among top 10 mango varieties in the world|left|thumb|[[Sindhri]] is among top 10 [[mango varieties]] in the [[world]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dubai/queen-of-mangoes-sindhri-from-pakistan-in-uae|title=Queen of Mangoes: Sindhri from Pakistan now in UAE|last=Menon|first=Sunita|website=Khaleej Times|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>]]\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Blackbuck1-Kirthar National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Sindh ibex]] in [[Kirthar National Park]]]]\nThe province is mostly arid with scant vegetation except for the irrigated Indus Valley. The dwarf palm, ''Acacia Rupestris'' (kher), and ''[[Tecomella undulata]]'' ([[Rohida|lohirro]]) trees are typical of the western hill region. In the Indus valley, the ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' (babul) (babbur) is the most dominant and occurs in thick forests along the Indus banks. The ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'' (neem) (nim), ''Zizyphys vulgaris'' (bir) (ber), ''Tamarix orientalis'' (jujuba lai) and ''[[Capparis aphylla]]'' (kirir) are among the more common trees.\n\nMango, date palms and the more recently introduced banana, guava, orange and [[chiku]] are the typical fruit-bearing trees. The coastal strip and the creeks abound in semi-aquatic and aquatic plants and the inshore Indus delta islands have forests of ''Avicennia tomentosa'' (timmer) and ''[[Ceriops tagal|Ceriops candolleana]]'' (chaunir) trees. Water lilies grow in abundance in the numerous lake and ponds, particularly in the lower Sindh region.\n\n=== Fauna ===\n{{Main|Fauna of Sindh}}\n[[Image:Schnabeldelphin-drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Indus river dolphin]]\nAmong the wild animals, the [[Sindh ibex]] (sareh), [[blackbuck]], wild sheep ([[Urial]] or gadh) and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] are found in the western rocky range. The [[leopard]] is now rare and the [[Asiatic cheetah]] extinct. The [[Fishing cat|Pirrang]] (large tiger cat or fishing cat) of the eastern desert region is also disappearing. [[Chinkara|Deer]] occur in the lower rocky plains and in the eastern region, as do the striped [[hyena]] (charakh), [[jackal]], [[fox]], [[porcupine]], [[mongoose|common gray mongoose]] and [[hedgehog]]. The Sindhi phekari, red lynx or Caracal cat, is found in some areas. Phartho (hog deer) and wild bear occur, particularly in the central inundation belt. There are bats, lizards and reptiles, including the cobra, lundi (viper) and the mysterious Sindh [[krait]] of the Thar region, which is supposed to suck the victim's breath in his sleep.\nSome unusual sightings of Asian cheetah occurred in 2003 near the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] border in [[Kirthar Mountains]]. The rare [[houbara bustard]] find Sindh's warm climate suitable to rest and mate. Unfortunately, it is hunted by locals and foreigners.\n\nCrocodiles are rare and inhabit only the backwaters of the Indus, eastern Nara channel and Karachi backwater. Besides a large variety of marine fish, the plumbeous dolphin, the beaked dolphin, rorqual or blue whale and skates frequent the seas along the Sindh coast. The Pallo (Sable fish), a marine fish, ascends the Indus annually from February to April to spawn. The [[Indus river dolphin]] is among the most endangered species in Pakistan and is found in the part of the Indus river in northern Sindh. [[Indian hog deer|Hog deer]] and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] occur, particularly in the central inundation belt.\n\nAlthough Sindh has a [[semi arid]] climate, through its coastal and riverine forests, its huge fresh water lakes and mountains and deserts, Sindh supports a large amount of varied wildlife. Due to the semi-arid [[climate of Sindh]] the left out forests support an average population of jackals and snakes. The [[national parks]] established by the Government of Pakistan in collaboration with many organizations such as [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Sindh Wildlife Department]] support a huge variety of animals and birds. The [[Kirthar National Park]] in the Kirthar range spreads over more than 3000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of desert, stunted tree forests and a lake. The KNP supports [[Sindh ibex]], [[wild sheep]] (urial) and [[Asian black bear|black bear]] along with the rare leopard. There are also occasional sightings of The Sindhi phekari, ped lynx or Caracal cat. There is a project to introduce [[tiger]]s and [[Asian elephant]]s too in KNP near the huge Hub Dam Lake. Between July and November when the [[monsoon]] winds blow onshore from the ocean, giant [[olive ridley]] turtles lay their eggs along the seaward side. The turtles are protected species. After the mothers lay and leave them buried under the sands the SWD and WWF officials take the eggs and protect them until they are hatched to keep them from predators.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Sindh}}\n[[File:Ayub.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lansdowne Railway Bridge]]\nSindh lies in a [[tropical]] to [[subtropical]] region; it is hot in the summer and mild to warm in winter. Temperatures frequently rise above {{convert|46|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on|lk=on}} between May and August, and the minimum average temperature of {{convert|2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} occurs during December and January in the northern and higher elevated regions. The annual rainfall averages about seven inches, falling mainly during July and August. The southwest monsoon wind begins in mid-February and continues until the end of September, whereas the cool northerly wind blows during the winter months from October to January.\n\nSindh lies between the two [[monsoon]]s\u2014the southwest monsoon from the Indian Ocean and the northeast or retreating monsoon, deflected towards it by the [[Himalayas|Himalayan mountains]]\u2014and escapes the influence of both. The region's scarcity of rainfall is compensated by the inundation of the Indus twice a year, caused by the spring and summer melting of Himalayan snow and by rainfall in the monsoon season.\n\nSindh is divided into three climatic regions: Siro (the upper region, centred on [[Jacobabad]]), Wicholo (the middle region, centred on [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]), and Lar (the lower region, centred on [[Karachi]]). The [[thermal equator]] passes through upper Sindh, where the air is generally very dry. Central Sindh's temperatures are generally lower than those of upper Sindh but higher than those of lower Sindh. Dry hot days and cool nights are typical during the summer. Central Sindh's maximum temperature typically reaches {{convert|43|-|44|C|F}}. Lower Sindh has a damper and humid maritime climate affected by the southwestern winds in summer and northeastern winds in winter, with lower [[rainfall]] than Central Sindh. Lower Sindh's maximum temperature reaches about {{convert|35|-|38|C|F}}. In the Kirthar range at {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} and higher at [[Gorakh Hill]] and other peaks in [[Dadu District]], temperatures near freezing have been recorded and brief snowfall is received in the winters.\n\n== Major cities ==\n{{Main|List of most populous cities in Pakistan|List of cities in Sindh|List of cities in Sindh by population}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 70%; font-size: 85%; border: #999 solid 1px; text-align: lcenter; margin-bottom: 0; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| '''List of major cities in Sindh'''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| Rank\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| City\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| District(s)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| Population\n\n! rowspan=11 width:150|\n<br/>[[File:Tomb Jinnah.jpg|border|80px]]<br/>[[Karachi]]<br/>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| 1 ||align=left | '''[[Karachi]]''' ||align=left | [[Karachi East District|Karachi East]]<br/>[[Karachi West District|Karachi West]]<br/>[[Karachi South District|Karachi South]]<br/>[[Karachi Central District|Karachi Central]]<br/>[[Malir District|Malir]]<br/>[[Korangi District|Korangi]] || 14,910,352\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| 2 ||align=left | '''[[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]''' ||align=left | [[Hyderabad District, Pakistan|Hyderabad]] || 1,732,693\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:YellowGreen;\"| 3 ||align=left | '''[[Sukkur]]''' ||align=left | [[Sukkur District|Sukkur]] || 1,400,000\n|-\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#f5f5f5;\"| '''Source: Pakistan Census 2017<ref name=census>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbscensus.gov.pk |title=Pakistan Bureau of Statistics \u2013 6th Population and Housing Census |website=www.pbscensus.gov.pk}}</ref>'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#f5f5f5;\"| '''This is a list of each city's urban populations and does not indicate total district populations'''\n|}\n\n== Government ==\n=== Sindh province ===\n{| class=\"infobox borderless\"\n|+ Provincial symbols of Sindh<ref name=\"Faiza Ilyas\">{{cite news|last1=Ilyas|first1=Faiza|title=Provincial mammal, bird notified|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/733088|accessdate=3 November 2016|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=10 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/978487/govt-declares-neem-provincial-tree|title=Govt declares Neem 'provincial tree'|author= |date=April 15, 2010 |website= Dawn|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/12/14/city/karachi/%E2%80%98our-sindhi-symbols-%E2%80%93-ibex-black-partridge%E2%80%99/|title=Our Sindhi symbols \u2013 ibex, black partridge|author=Amar Guriro |date=December 14, 2011 |website= Pakistan Today|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Perhaps the most professed exposition of Sindhi culture is in the handicrafts of [[Haala|Hala]], a town some 30 kilometres from [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]. Hala's artisans manufacture high-quality and impressively priced wooden handicrafts, textiles, paintings, handmade paper products, and blue pottery. Lacquered wood works known as Jandi, painting on wood, tiles, and pottery known as Kashi, hand weaved textiles including ''[[khadi]]'', ''susi'', and ''[[ajrak]]s'' are synonymous with Sindhi culture preserved in Hala's handicraft.\n\nThe work of Sindhi artisans was sold in ancient markets of Damascus, Baghdad, Basra, Istanbul, Cairo and Samarkand. Referring to the lacquer work on wood locally known as Jandi, T. Posten (an English traveller who visited Sindh in the early 19th century) asserted that the articles of Hala could be compared with exquisite specimens of China. Technological improvements such as the spinning wheel ([[Charkha (spinning wheel)|charkha]]) and treadle (pai-chah) in the weaver's loom were gradually introduced and the processes of designing, dyeing and printing by block were refined. The refined, lightweight, colourful, washable fabrics from Hala became a luxury for people used to the woollens and linens of the age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wishwebdesign.com/dgaewm/otherinfo/Cultural-Heritage/542/533|title=Cultural Heritage|author= |date=|website=wishwebdesign.com = |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as the World Wildlife Fund, Pakistan, play an important role to promote the culture of Sindh. They provide training to women artisans in the interior of Sindh so they get a source of income. They promote their products under the name of \"Crafts Forever\". Many women in rural Sindh are skilled in the production of caps. Sindhi caps are manufactured commercially on a small scale at New Saeedabad and Hala New.

A [[Slave and free states|slave state]] before the [[American Civil War]], Texas declared its secession from the U.S. in early 1861, and officially joined the [[Confederate States of America]] on March{{nbsp}}2 of the same year.

In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major [[petroleum]] deposits ([[Spindletop]] in particular) that initiated an [[Texas oil boom|economic boom]] which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified [[Economy of Texas|economy]] and [[high tech]] industry in the mid-20th century.

The [[continental crust]] forms a stable [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[craton]] which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true [[oceanic crust]] of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old.\n\nThese [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s underlie most of the state, and are exposed in three places: [[Llano, Texas|Llano]] uplift, [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn]], and the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]], near El Paso. [[Sedimentary rocks]] overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or [[passive margin]] that developed during [[Cambrian]] time.\n\nThis margin existed until [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] collided in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod to form [[Pangea]].

They were not particularly kind to their native populations\u2014even less so with the Caddoans, who were not trusted as their culture was split between the Spanish and the French. When the Spanish briefly managed to conquer the Louisiana colony, they decided to switch tactics and attempt being exceedingly friendly to the Indians, which they continued even after the French took back the colony. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States inherited this odd circumstance. The Caddoans preferred the company of Americans{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} and almost the entire population of them migrated into the states of Louisiana and Arkansas. The Spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time and effort and began trying to lure the Caddo back, even promising them more land. Seemingly without actually knowing how they came by it,{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} the United States (who had begun convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by selling everything and moving west ever since they gained the Louisiana Purchase) faced an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas. They included the [[Muscogee]], [[Houma people|Houma Choctaw]], [[Lenape]] and [[Mingo | Mingo Seneca]], among others, who all came to view the Caddoans as saviors, making those peoples highly influential.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Glover, William B. \"A History of the Caddo Indians\".

Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations. At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans started to spread. The Caddoans were always clueless{{speculation inline|date=March 2019}} when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region could never find hard evidence linking them to it and often it was so far-flung from Caddoan lands, it barely made any sense. It seems most likely that these were false-flag attacks meant to start a cascading effect to force the natives under Caddoan influence into armed conflict without breaking any treaties\u2014preferably on the side of the Spanish. While no proof was found as to who the culprit was, those in charge of Texas at the time attempted multiple times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check. Furthermore, the Caddoans never turned to violence because of it, excepting cases of self-defense.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the 1830s, the U.S. had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears.

Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of [[Texas Longhorn|Longhorn cattle]] that roamed the state. Hardy by nature, but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous. While in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides, soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the U.S. and the Caribbean (within a few decades, beef had become a staple of the American diet).\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|Proposed boundaries, 1850]]\n\nAfter Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States.

It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major [[petroleum]] deposits ([[Spindletop]] in particular) that initiated an [[Texas oil boom|economic boom]] which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified [[Economy of Texas|economy]] and [[high tech]] industry in the mid-20th century.

The [[continental crust]] forms a stable [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[craton]] which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true [[oceanic crust]] of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old.\n\nThese [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s underlie most of the state, and are exposed in three places: [[Llano, Texas|Llano]] uplift, [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn]], and the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]], near El Paso. [[Sedimentary rocks]] overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or [[passive margin]] that developed during [[Cambrian]] time.\n\nThis margin existed until [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] collided in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod to form [[Pangea]]. This is the buried crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]\u2013[[Ouachita Mountains]] zone of Pennsylvanian [[continental collision]]. This [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest is today buried beneath the Dallas\u2013[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]\u2014Austin\u2013San Antonio trend.\n\nThe late [[Paleozoic]] mountains collapsed as [[rifting]] in the [[Jurassic]] period began to open the Gulf of Mexico. Pangea began to break up in the [[Triassic]], but [[seafloor spreading]] to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid- and [[late Jurassic]]. The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico's passive margin began to form. Today {{convert|9|to|12|mi|km|0|}} of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US [[oil reserves]] are here. At the start of its formation, the incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick [[evaporite]] deposits of Jurassic age.

[[Archaeologists]] have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. These were:<ref name=\"Richardson\">Richardson (2005), p. 9.</ref>\n* the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Pueblo]] from the upper [[Rio Grande]] region, centered west of Texas;\n* the [[Mississippian culture]], also known as [[Mound Builders]], which extended along the [[Mississippi River Valley]] east of Texas; and\n* the civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], centered south of Texas. Influence of [[Teotihuacan]] in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries.\n\nWhen Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Native peoples divided into many smaller tribes. They were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan, and Uto-Aztecan. The Uto-Aztecan Puebloan peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mostly centered along the Gulf Coast. At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the [[Aranama]], lived in southern Texas. This entire culture group, primarily centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct. It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern region of the state originally. By the time the region came to be explored, it belonged to the fairly well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztecan people who had transitioned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century. It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siouans.\n\nNo culture was dominant in the present-day Texas region, and many peoples inhabited the area.<ref name=\"Richardson\" /> Native American tribes who lived inside the boundaries of present-day Texas include the [[Alabama people|Alabama]], [[Apache]], [[Atakapa]]n, [[Bidai]], [[Caddo]], Aranama, [[Comanche]], [[Choctaw]], [[Coushatta]], [[Hasinai]], [[Jumano people|Jumano]], [[Karankawa people|Karankawa]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Kiowa]], [[Tonkawa]], and [[Wichita people|Wichita]].<ref>Richardson (2005), pp 10\u201316</ref><ref name=\"HoT bzi04\">{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|title=Indians|first=George |last=Klos|date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> The name '''''Texas''''' derives from ''t\u00e1ysha\u0294'', a word in the [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan language]] of the ''Hasinai'', which means \"friends\" or \"allies\".<ref name=\"facts\">{{cite book |title=Facts |edition=2010\u20132011 |work=[[Texas Almanac]] |url=http://texasalmanac.com/topics/facts-profile |first=Robert |last=Plocheck |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228054833/http://www.texasalmanac.com/topics/facts-profile |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |date=November 20, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"TribesofTexas\">{{cite Handbook of Texas |last=Fry |first=Phillip L. |title=Texas, Origin of Name |id=pft04 |orig-year=July 15, 2010 |date=March 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>Richardson, p 1</ref><ref name=\"etymology\">{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Texas |title=Texas |accessdate=February 25, 2007 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper}}</ref><ref name=\"WChafe\">Wallace Chafe, p.c.</ref>\n\nThe region was primarily controlled by the Spanish for the first couple centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution. They were not particularly kind to their native populations\u2014even less so with the Caddoans, who were not trusted as their culture was split between the Spanish and the French. When the Spanish briefly managed to conquer the Louisiana colony, they decided to switch tactics and attempt being exceedingly friendly to the Indians, which they continued even after the French took back the colony. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States inherited this odd circumstance. The Caddoans preferred the company of Americans{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} and almost the entire population of them migrated into the states of Louisiana and Arkansas. The Spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time and effort and began trying to lure the Caddo back, even promising them more land. Seemingly without actually knowing how they came by it,{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} the United States (who had begun convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by selling everything and moving west ever since they gained the Louisiana Purchase) faced an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas. They included the [[Muscogee]], [[Houma people|Houma Choctaw]], [[Lenape]] and [[Mingo | Mingo Seneca]], among others, who all came to view the Caddoans as saviors, making those peoples highly influential.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Glover, William B. \"A History of the Caddo Indians\".

Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations. At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans started to spread. The Caddoans were always clueless{{speculation inline|date=March 2019}} when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region could never find hard evidence linking them to it and often it was so far-flung from Caddoan lands, it barely made any sense. It seems most likely that these were false-flag attacks meant to start a cascading effect to force the natives under Caddoan influence into armed conflict without breaking any treaties\u2014preferably on the side of the Spanish. While no proof was found as to who the culprit was, those in charge of Texas at the time attempted multiple times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check. Furthermore, the Caddoans never turned to violence because of it, excepting cases of self-defense.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the 1830s, the U.S. had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears. Fearing retribution of other native peoples, Indian Agents all over the eastern U.S. began desperately trying to convince all their native peoples to uproot and move west. This included the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas. Following the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their Native peoples but did not honor former land claims or agreements.

Statehood brought many new settlers. Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of [[Texas Longhorn|Longhorn cattle]] that roamed the state. Hardy by nature, but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous. While in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides, soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the U.S. and the Caribbean (within a few decades, beef had become a staple of the American diet).\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|Proposed boundaries, 1850]]\n\nAfter Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States.

However, since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South, it was able to recover more quickly.

The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt, criminal prosecution, or other problems. Indeed, \"Gone to Texas\" was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states.

Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin make up 11.5 percent of the population; blacks of non-Hispanic origin form 11.3 percent of the populace. African Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin number at roughly 2.7 million individuals.\n\nNative Americans are a smaller minority in the state. Native Americans make up 0.5 percent of Texas's population and number over 118,000 individuals. Native Americans of non-Hispanic origin make up 0.3 percent of the population and number over 75,000 individuals. [[Cherokee]] made up 0.1 percent of the population, and numbered over 19,400. In contrast, only 583 identified as [[Chippewa]].\n[[File:Emory-El Paso.jpg|thumb|[[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] was founded by Spanish settlers in 1659.]]\n\nAsian Americans are a sizable minority group in Texas. Americans of Asian descent form 3.8 percent of the population, with those of non-Hispanic descent making up 3.7 percent of the populace. They total more than 808,000 individuals. Non-Hispanic Asians number over 795,000. Just over 200,000 [[Indian American]]s make Texas their home. Texas is also home to more than 187,000 [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]] and 136,000 [[Chinese American|Chinese]]. In addition to 92,000 [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] and 62,000 [[Korean American|Koreans]], there are 18,000 [[Japanese American]]s living in the state.

According to the survey, only 18,000 Texans are Pacific Islanders; 16,400 are of non-Hispanic descent. There are roughly 5,400 [[Native Hawaiians]], 5,300 Guamanians, and 6,400 people from other groups. [[Samoan American]]s were scant; only 2,920 people were from this group. The city of [[Euless]], a suburb of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], contains a sizable population of [[Tongan American]]s, at nearly 900 people, over one percent of the city's population. [[Killeen, Texas|Killeen]] has a sufficient population of Samoans and Guamanian, and people of Pacific Islander descent surpass one percent of the city's population.\n\nMultiracial individuals are also a visible minority in Texas. People identifying as multiracial form 1.9 percent of the population, and number over 448,000 people. Almost 80,000 Texans claim African and European heritage and makeup 0.3 percent of the population. People of European and American Indian ancestry number over 108,800 (close to the number of Native Americans), and makeup 0.5 percent of the population.

The calculation is Net Private Grants / ODA.</ref> In addition, remittances received from migrants working or living in diaspora form a significant amount of international transfer.\n\nSome governments also include military assistance in the notion \"foreign aid\", although many [[NGO]]s tend to disapprove of this.\n\nOfficial development assistance is a measure of government-contributed aid, compiled by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) since 1969. The DAC consists of 34 of the largest aid-donating countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe concept of development aid goes back to the [[colonial era]] at the turn of the twentieth century, in particular to the British policy of colonial development that emerged during that period. The traditional government policy had tended to favor [[laissez-faire]] style economics, with the free market for capital and goods dictating the economic role that colonies played in the [[British Empire]].\n\n[[Image:British Political Personalities 1936-1945 CH4432.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] presided over a Development Committee for the colonies. He is pictured entertaining [[Jamaica]]n recruits for the [[RAF]].]]\nChanges in attitudes towards the moral purpose of the Empire, and the role that government could play in the promotion of welfare slowly led to a more proactive policy of economic and developmental assistance towards poor colonies. The first challenge to Britain was the economic crisis that occurred after World War I. Prior to the passage of the 1929 Colonial Development Act, the doctrine that governed Britain (and other European colonizers) with their territories was that of financial self-sufficiency. What this simply meant was that the colonies were responsible for themselves.<ref>Joseph Hodge, Gerald Hodl, & Martin Kopf (edi) Developing Africa: Concepts and Practices in Twentieth-Century Colonialism, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014, p.12.</ref>\n\nBritain was not going to use the money that belongs to the metropole to pay for things in the colonies. The colonies did not only have to pay for infrastructural development but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generate significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends.<ref>Bekeh Utietiang, Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and the Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967 (Ph.D Thesis), West Virginia University, Morgantown, 2014, p. 38.</ref> As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having a significant impact on the colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. Parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies.<ref>[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Stephen Constantine]], ''The Making of British Colonial Development Policy, 1914-1940'', London: Frank Cass, 1984, p.183.</ref> This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], then [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]]. Its initial annual budget of \u00a31 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the [[infrastructure]] of [[transport]], [[electrical power]] and [[water supply]] in colonies and [[dominion]]s abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade.<ref name=\"Kanbur\">{{Citation | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | contribution = The economics of international aid | editor-last1 = Kolm | editor-first1 = Serge-Christophe | editor-last2 = Ythier | editor-first2 = Jean Mercier | editor-link1 = Serge-Christophe Kolm | title = Handbook of the economics of giving, altruism and reciprocity: foundations, volume 1 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam London | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780444506979  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now use metropolitan funds to develop the colonies.\n\nBy the late 1930s, especially after the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939]], it was clear that this initial scheme was far too limited in scope. A [[Royal Commission]] under [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] was sent to investigate the living conditions in the [[British West Indies]] and it published its [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Report]] in 1940 which exposed the horrendous living conditions there.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Cary|title=The Twilight of Colonial Rule in the British West Indies: Nationalist Assertion vs. Imperial Hubris in the 1930s|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1996|volume=30|issue=1/2|page=2|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=10&hid=107&sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&AN=45526514}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Basdeo|first=Sahadeo|title=Walter Citrine and the British Caribbean Worker's Movement during the Commission Hearing|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1983|volume=18|issue=2|page=46|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&vid=11&hid=28&bquery=(AU+(basdeo))+AND+(citrine)&bdata=JmRiPWFobCZkYj1oaWEmdHlwZT0xJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAmidst increasing criticism of Britain's colonial policies from abroad and at home,<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|page=229}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Kelvin|title=Race and Class Struggles in a Colonial State|year=1994|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary|page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWAYAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9781895176438}}</ref> the commission was a performance to showcase Britain's \"benevolent\" attitude towards its colonial subjects.<ref name=Thomas267>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Roy Darrow, ed.|title=The Trinidad Labour Riots of 1937|year=1987|publisher=University of West Indies Press|location=St. Augustine|page=267|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Re3TAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The Commission's recommendations urged health and education initiatives along with increased sugar subsidies to stave off a complete and total economic meltdown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|page=23}}</ref> The [[Colonial Office]], eager to prevent instability while the country was at [[World War II|war]], began funneling large sums of cash into the region.<ref name=Thomas283>{{cite book|last=Thomas|pages=283}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonial Development and Welfare Act was passed in 1940 to organize and allocate a sum of \u00a35 million per year to the British West Indies for the purpose of long-term development.

Launched as a large-scale aid program by the United States in 1948, the European Recovery Program, or [[Marshall Plan]], was concerned with strengthening the ties to the [[West Europe]]an states to contain the influence of the [[USSR]].

Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and skill to relieve the suffering of these people.\"<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres53.html Transcript of the speech]</ref>\n\nIn 1951, the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) was established within the Department of State to run the Point Four program. Development aid was aimed at offering technical solutions to social problems without altering basic [[social structure]]s. The United States was often fiercely opposed to even moderate changes in social structures, for example the [[land reform]] in [[Guatemala]] in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1953 at the end of the [[Korean War]], the incoming [[Eisenhower Administration]] established the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) as an independent government agency outside the Department of State to consolidate economic and technical assistance. In 1955, foreign aid was brought back under the administrative control of the Department of State and FOA was renamed the International Cooperation Administration (ICA).\n\nIn 1956, the Senate conducted a study of foreign aid with the help of a number of independent experts.  The result, stated in a 1959 amendment to the Mutual Security Act, declared that development in low-income regions was a U.S. objective along with and additional to other foreign-policy interests, attempting thus to clarify development assistance's relationship with the effort to contain Communism. In 1961, the Congress approved the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961 with President [[J.F. Kennedy]]'s support, which retained the 1959 policy of international development as an independent U.S. objective and set up a new Agency for International Development, [[USAID]].\n\nThe volume of international aid to [[Developing country|developing countries]] (called \"[[Third World]]\" at the time) grew dramatically from the 1960s. This aid came mainly from the US and [[Western Europe]]an countries, but there were also significant contributions from the [[Soviet Union]] in exchange for overseas political influence in the context of the heightened global tensions of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe practice of extending aid to politically aligned parties in recipient nations continues today; Faye and Niehaus (2012) are able to establish a causal relationship between politics and aid in recipient nations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Faye|first=Michael|last2=Niehaus|first2=Paul|date=2012-12-01|title=Political Aid Cycles|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3516\u20133530|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|issn=0002-8282|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/120bb48b574483be2faedcae4e7830ad810e13d5}}</ref> In their analysis of the competitive 2006 Palestinian elections, they note that USAID provided funding for development programs in Palestine to support the Palestinian Authority, the US backed entity running for reelection.

A 1961 resolution decreed that:\n\n{{Quotation|The Committee will continue to consult on the methods for making national resources available for assisting countries and areas in the process of economic development and for expanding and improving the flow of long-term funds and other development assistance to them.|Development Assistance Committee|Mandate (1961)}}\n\n=== Critiques of development aid ===\n[[File:Cartoon, Warren Buffett wants African children to have more Coke - and healthier teeth.gif|thumb|Warren Buffett is considered one of the world's leading philanthropists, yet he is also the biggest investor in Coca-Cola, which aggressively seeks to expand into poorer countries. This cartoon, from an organization critical of the true motives of international aid, calls attention to what it perceives as a contradiction.]]Development aid is often provided by means of supporting local development aid projects. In these projects, it sometimes occurs that no strict code of conduct is in force. In some projects, the development aid workers do not respect the local [[code of conduct]]. For example, the local [[dress code]] as well as [[Human communication|social interaction]]. In developing countries, these matters are regarded highly important and not respecting it may cause severe offense, and thus significant problems and delay of the projects.\n\nThere is also much debate about evaluating the quality of development aid, rather than simply the quantity.  For instance, [[tied aid]] is often criticized as the aid given must be spent in the donor country or in a group of selected countries. Tied aid can increase development aid project costs by up to 20 or 30 percent.<ref name=\":18\">[http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_2649_33959_29412506_119699_1_1_1,00.html OECD The Typing of Aid]</ref>\n\nThere is also criticism because donors may give with one hand, through large amounts of development aid, yet take away with the other, through strict trade or migration policies, or by getting a foothold for foreign corporations.

Hirschman]]\u2019s [[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty|exit-voice-loyalty]] (EVL) model can be used to understand how certain policy changes affect the growth of a nation and the change of bargaining power inside it. Clark et al.\u2019s formalization of the model to politics shows the effect that developmental aid can have on the receiving country's development and highlights that the aid can potentially harm that country.\n\nHirschman\u2019s EVL model is based on the foundation that \u201cunder any economic, social, or political system, individuals, business firms, and organizations, in general, are subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous, or otherwise functional behavior\u201d. The customer who is affected by the lapse in the system (a fall in the quality of a product they are consuming) has two ways to answer to this- \u201cexit\u201d or \u201cvoice\u201d. If the individual chooses the former, they simply stop buying the product and inflict a revenue drop that forces the firm to either correct their mistake or cease to exist. If the individual chooses the \u201cvoice\u201d option, then they will express their dissatisfaction to either the firm or something that has authority over it. This will force the firm to fix their lapse, but it will not suffer a decline in revenue. Lastly, Hirschman introduces the \u201cloyalty\u201d option, which occurs when the consumer cannot \u201cexit\u201d and the firm does not care about the effect that \u201cvoice\u201d will have on their revenue, and the consumers who chose it continues to consume the lapsed good.\n\nClark et al.\u2019s paper takes Hirschman's EVL model and applies it to political developments inside a nation.<ref>[https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf]</ref> When a government changes a policy that now has a negative effect on the welfare of some citizens, or is already being unresponsive to a deleterious situation, the citizens have the same 3 choices of response as before. Here, \u201cexit\u201d can take the form of citizens leaving the country [[The Art of Not Being Governed]] and hence depriving the state of their taxes or simply rearranging their capital and goods so they are not taxed by the government, as seen with British merchants threatening to move capital to the Netherlands if not given representation after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. \u201cVoice\u201d takes the form of non-violent civil disobedience, as seen with Gandhi's [[Salt March]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] protests in Ferguson, a violent demonstration, as seen with [[Luddite]] breaking weaving machinery to protest the lack of protectionist policies by the English government, or even \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d [http://abahlali.org/files/Scotts-Weapons.pdf] where small, non-cooperation and false create high costs for the state. \u201cLoyalty\u201d entails that the citizens simply accept the situation and continue their lives before.\n\nHow foreign aid enters this equation in weak states is by changing the citizens\u2019 power of \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d and weakening the state's dependence on their citizens and hence becoming less responsive to their needs. If the state receives international aid, it is less dependent on the tax revenue that it collects from its constituents. A higher level of fiscal independence on the part of the state decreases the bargaining power of the citizens. The government is threatened less by the citizens\u2019 \u201cexit\u201d option, and less hurt if it is implemented, hence this takes away a credible threat to use at the negotiation table in order for the citizens to request improvement to their current condition. At the same time, the lack of dependence for revenue decreases the \u201cvoice\u201d action of the citizen by weakening the effect a violent demonstration or everyday resistance has on impacting the state's decision-making.\n\nAs long as the government of a nation receiving international aid knows that it will keep receiving it, and there will be no repercussion on the side of the donors for failing to address its constituents\u2019 issues, it stays optimal for that government to keep ignoring the weakened demands of its citizens. With weakened bargaining power and a less responsive state, there can be no bargaining between citizen and state that will, in the long, run lead to economic and/or development within the nation. Although international has done far-reaching things with respect to increasing access to improved medical care, improving education, and decreasing poverty and hunger,  only in 1997 did the [[World Bank]] began to rethink its aid policy structure and begin using parts of it specifically for building up the state capability of the aid-receiving nations [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980]. Even more recently, the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]], a US-based aid agency, started working with developing nation to provide them with strictly development aid as they set and implement goals for national development.\n\n=== Effects of foreign aid in Africa. ===\nWhile most economists like [[Jeffery Sachs]] hold the view of aid as the driver for economic growth and development, others argue that aid has rather led to increasing poverty and decreasing economic growth of poor countries.<ref name=\":42\">Moyo, D.

Foreign aid is especially multifaceted in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa due to geographic barriers. Most macro foreign aid efforts fail to recognize these issues and, as Sachs argues, cause insufficient international aid and policy improvement. Sachs argues that unless foreign aid provides mechanisms that overcome geographic barriers, pandemics such as HIV and AIDS that cause traumatic casualties within regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to care millions of fatalities. \n\nFor aid to be effective and beneficial to economic development, there must be some support systems or \u2018[[wiktionary:traction|traction]]\u2019 that, will enable foreign aid to spur economic growth.<ref name=\":52\">Rahnama, M. & Fawaz, F. & Gittings, K.

A view pro aid, supported by Jeffrey Sachs and the United Nations, which argues that foreign aid will give the big push to break the low-income [[poverty trap]] poorer countries are trapped in. From this perspective, aid serves to finance  \u201cthe core inputs to development \u2013 teachers, health centers, roads, wells, medicine, to name a few...\u201d (United Nations 2004).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Making Progress on Foreign Aid|journal = Annual Review of Economics|volume = 7|pages = 277\u2013308|last=Qian|first=Nancy|date=2015-08-03|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553}}</ref> And a view that is skeptic about the impacts of aid, supported by William Easterly, that points out that aid has not proven to work after 40 years of large investments in Africa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmerican political scientist and professor [[Nicolas van de Walle]] has also argued that despite more than two decades of donor-supported reform in Africa, the continent continues to be plagued by economic crises due to the combination of state generated factors and to the counter productivity of international development aid to Africa. Van de Walle first attributes the failure to implement economic policy reform to factors within the African state:\n\n# Neopatrimonial tendencies of state elites that serve to preserve and centralize power, maintain limited access orders, and create political obstacles to reform.\n# Ideological obstacles that have been biased by two decades of failed economic policy reform and in turn, create a hostile environment for reform.\n# Low state capacity that reinforces and that in turn, is reinforced by the neopatrimonial tendencies of the state.\n\nVan de Walle later argues that these state generated factors that have obstructed the effective implementation of economic policy reform are further exacerbated by foreign aid. Aid, therefore, makes policy reform less likely, rather than more likely. Van de Walle posits that international aid has sustained economic stagnation in Africa by:\n\n# Pacifying Africa's neopatrimonial tendencies, thereby lessening the incentives for state elites to undertake reform and preserving the status quo.\n# Sustaining poorly managed bureaucratic structures and policies that would be otherwise rectified by market forces.\n# Allowing state capacities to deteriorate through externalizing many state functions and responsibilities.\n\nIn order for aid to be productive and for economic policy reform to be successfully implemented in Africa, the relationship between donors and governments must change. Van de Walle argues that aid must be made more conditional and selective to incentivize states to take on reform and to generate the much needed accountability and capacity in African governments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democratic Reform in Africa: The Quality of Progress|last=Van de Walle|first=Nicolas|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1588262464|editor-last=Gyimah-Boadi|editor-first=Emmanuel|location=1800 30th Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301|pages=29\u201363|chapter=Economic Reform: Patterns and Constraints}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, information asymmetries often hinder the appropriate allocation of aid; Blum et al. (2016) note that both South Sudan and Liberia struggle tremendously with paying employees and controlling the flow of money - South Sudan had a significant number of ghosts on its payroll, while Liberia's Civil Service Agency could not adequately pay civil servants because there was minimal communication from the Ministries of Health and Education regarding their respective payrolls.<ref>Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. \u201cPublic Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.\u201d World Bank: Fragile and Conflict State Impact Evaluation Research Program paper.\n</ref>\n\nMany [[econometric]] studies in recent years have supported the view that development aid has no effect on the speed with which countries develop. Negative side effects of aid can include an unbalanced [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]] of the recipient's currency (known as [[Dutch Disease]]), increasing corruption, and adverse political effects such as postponements of necessary economic and democratic reforms.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\">[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx Aid Effectiveness and Governance: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009071531/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx |date=2009-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been argued{{By whom|date=September 2010}} that much government-to-government aid was ineffective because it was merely a way to support strategically important leaders (Alesino and Dollar, 2000). A good example of this is the former dictator of [[Zaire]], [[Mobuto Sese Seko]], who lost support from the West after the Cold War had ended. Mobuto, at the time of his death, had a sufficient personal fortune (particularly in Swiss banks) to pay off the entire external debt of Zaire.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\" />\n\nBesides some instances that only the president (and/or his close entourage) receives the money resulting from development aid, the money obtained is often badly spent as well. For example, in Chad, the [http://www.esso.com/Chad-English/PA/Files/suppvol1ch1.pdf Chad Export Project], an oil production project supported by the World Bank, was set up. The earnings of this project (6.5 million dollars per year and rising) were used to obtain arms. The government defended this purchase by stating that \"development was not possible without safety\". However, the [[Military of Chad]] is notorious for severe misconduct against the population (abuse, rape, claiming of supplies and cars) and did not even defend the population in distress (e.g. in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]]). In 2008, the World Bank retreated from the project that thus increased environmental pollution and human suffering.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\">Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen</ref>\n\nAnother criticism has been that Western countries often project their own needs and solutions onto other societies and cultures. In response, western help in some cases has become more 'endogenous', which means that needs as well as solutions are being devised in accordance with local cultures.<ref>[http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html The Future of The Anti-Corruption Movement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409153824/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html |date=2009-04-09 }}, Nathaniel Heller, Global Integrity</ref> For example, sometimes projects are set up which wish to make several [[ethnic group]]s cooperate. While this is a noble goal, most of these projects fail because of this intent.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\" />Additionally, although the goal in utility to provide a larger social benefit may be justified as worthy, a more ethically sourced incentive would be projects not looking for an opportunity to impose a social hierarchy through cooperation, but more-so for the sake of truly assisting recipients. The intent of cooperation is not necessarily a reason for failure, but the very nature of different aspirations towards defining virtues which exist in direct context with respective societies. In this way a disconnect may be perceived among those imposing their virtues onto ethnic groups interpreting them.\n\nThe [https://www.cgdev.org/ Center for Global Development] have published a review<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss, Petterson and van de Walle|date=January 2006|title=An Aid-Institutions Paradox? A Review Essay on Aid Dependency and State Building in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://www.cgdev.org|journal=Center for Global Development|volume=Working Paper Number 74|pages=}}</ref> essay of the existing literature studying the relationship between Aid and public institutions. In this review,  they concluded that a large and sustained Aid can have a negative effect in the development of good public institutions in low income countries. They also mention some of the arguments exhibited in this article as possible mechanism for this negative effect, for instance, they considered the [[Dutch Disease]], the discourage of revenue collections and the effect on the state capacity among others.\n\nFurthermore, the effect of Aid on conflict intensity and onset have been proved to have different impacts in different countries and situations. For instance, for the case of Colombia Dube and Naidu (2015)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dube and Naidu|date=January 6, 2015|title=Bases, Bullets, and Ballots: The Effect of US Military Aid on Political Conflict in Colombia|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume= 77| issue = 1|pages=249\u2013267|doi=10.1086/679021|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1423498}}</ref> showed that Aid from the US seems to have been diverted to paramilitary groups, increasing political violence. Moreover, Nunn and Qian (2014)<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nunn and Qian|date=June 2014|title=US Food Aid and Civil Conflict|jstor=42920861|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1630-1666|issue=6|pages=1630\u20131666}}</ref> have found that an increase in U.S. food aid increases conflict intensity; they claim that the main mechanism driving this result is predation of the aid by the rebel groups. In fact, they note that aid can have the unintentional consequence of actually improving rebel groups' ability to continue conflict, as vehicles and communications equipment usually accompany the aid that is stolen.<ref name=\":2\" /> These tools improve the ability of rebel groups to organize and give them assets to trade for arms, possibly increasing the length of the fighting. Finally, Crost, Felter and Johnston (2014)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crost, Felter and Johnston|date=June 2014|title=Aid Under Fire: Development Projects and Civil Conflict|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1833\u20131856|issue=6|pages=1833\u20131856|doi=10.1257/aer.104.6.1833}}</ref> have showed that a development program in the Philippines have had the unintended effect of increasing conflict because of an strategic retaliation from the rebel group, on where they tried to prevent that the development program increases support to the government.\n\nIt has also been argued that help based on direct donation creates dependency and corruption, and has an adverse effect on local production. As a result, a shift has taken place towards aid based on activation of local assets and stimulation measures such as [[microcredit]].\n\nAid has also been ineffective in young recipient countries in which ethnic tensions are strong: sometimes ethnic conflicts have prevented efficient delivery of aid.\n\nIn some cases, western surpluses that resulted from faulty agriculture- or other policies have been dumped in poor countries, thus wiping out local production and increasing dependency.\n\nIn several instances, loans that were considered irretrievable (for instance because funds had been embezzled by a dictator who has already died or disappeared), have been written off by donor countries, who subsequently booked this as development aid.\n\nIn many cases, Western governments placed orders with Western companies as a form of subsidizing them, and later shipped these goods to poor countries who often had no use for them. These projects are sometimes called '[[white elephant]]s'.\n\nAccording to [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], these issues might be caused by deficient diagnostics of the development agencies. In his book [[The Anti-Politics Machine]], Ferguson uses the example of the [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] project in [[Lesotho]] to illustrate how a bad diagnostic on the economic activity of the population and the desire to stay away from local politics, caused a livestock project to fail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|date=1994|title=The anti-politics machine: 'development' and bureaucratic power in Lesotho|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|journal=The Ecologist|volume=24|issue=5|pages=|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129094236/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Martijn Nitzsche, another problem is the way on how development projects are sometimes constructed and how they are maintained by the local population. Often, projects are made with technology that is hard to understand and too difficult to repair, resulting in unavoidable failure over time. Also, in some cases the local population is not very interested in seeing the project to succeed and may revert to disassembling it to retain valuable source materials. Finally, villagers do not always maintain a project as they believe the original development workers or others in the surroundings will repair it when it fails (which is not always so).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\">[http://www.momentum-media.nl/files/_articles/31/Gestrand_Ontwikkelingswerk.pdf Kijk magazine; oktober 2008, Gestrand Ontwikkelingswerk]</ref>\n\nA common criticism in recent years is that rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness. In the example of [[tied aid]], donor countries often require the recipient to purchase goods and services from the donor, even if these are cheaper elsewhere. Other conditions include opening up the country to foreign investment, even if it might not be ready to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp|title=US and Foreign Aid Assistance|publisher=Global Issues|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Development Aid in Congo Wasted.jpeg|thumb|250px|In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], an abandoned ferry as a relic of a development project is rusting next to the boats people use today.]]\nAll of these problems have made that a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly. According to Gerbert van der Aa, for the Netherlands, only 33% of the development aid is successful, another 33% fails and of the remaining 33% the effect is unclear. This means that for example for the Netherlands, 1.33 to 2.66 billion is lost as it spends 4 billion in total of development aid (or 0,8% of the gross national product).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\" />\n\nFor the Italian development aid for instance, we find that one of their successful projects (the Keita project) was constructed at the cost of 2/3 of 1 F-22 fighter jet (100 million $), and was able to reforest {{convert|1876|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of broken, barren earth, hereby increasing the socio-economic wellbeing of the area.<ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf Keita project increasing socio-economic wellbeing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311112921/http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf |date=2012-03-11 }}</ref> However -like the Dutch development aid- again we find that, the Italian development aid too is still not performing up to standards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |title=Italian aid not up to standard overall |access-date=2009-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102713/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |archive-date=2008-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This makes clear that there are great differences between the success of the projects and that budgetary follow-up may not be so strictly checked by independent third parties.\n\nAn excerpt from [[Thomas Dichter]]'s recently published book ''[[Despite Good Intentions]]: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed'' reads: \"This industry has become one in which the benefits of what is spent are increasingly in inverse proportion to the amount spent - a case of more gets you less. As donors are attracted on the basis of appeals emphasizing \"product\", results, and accountability...the tendency to engage in project-based, direct-action development becomes inevitable. Because funding for development is increasingly finite, this situation is very much a zero-sum game. What gets lost in the shuffle is the far more challenging long-term process of development.\"\n\nEffectiveness of development aid can be argued to be uncoordinated and unsustainable.  Development aid tends to be put towards specific diseases with high death rates and simple treatments, rather than funding health basics and infrastructure.  Though a lot of NGO's and funding have come forth, little sustainable outcomes have been made.  This is due to the fact that the money doesn't go towards developing a sustainable medical basis.  Money is given to specific diseases to show short-term results, reflecting the donor's best interests rather than the citizens' necessities.  It is evident that many development aid projects are not helping with basic and sustainable health care due to the generally high numbers of deaths due to preventable diseases.  Development aid could do more justice if used to generate general public health with infrastructure and trained personnel rather than pin-pointing specific diseases and reaching for quick fixes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14\u201338}}</ref>\n\nResearch has shown that developed nations are more likely to give aid to nations who have the worst economic situations and policies (Burnside, C., Dollar, D., 2000). They give money to these nations so that they can become developed and begin to turn these policies around. It has also been found that aid relates to the population of a nation as well, and that the smaller a nation is, the more likely it is to receive funds from donor agencies. The harsh reality of this is that it is very unlikely that a developing nation with a lack of resources, policies, and good governance will be able to utilize incoming aid money in order to get on their feet and begin to turn the damaged economy around. It is more likely that a nation with good economic policies and good governance will be able to utilize aid money to help the country establish itself with an existing foundation and be able to rise from there with the help of the international community. But research shows that it is the low-income nations that will receive aid more so, and the better off a nation is, the less aid money it will be granted. On the other hand, Alesina and Dollar (2000) note that private foreign investment often responds positively to more substantive economic policy and better protections under the law.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is increased private foreign investment in developing nations with these attributes, especially in the higher income ones, perhaps due to being larger and possibly more profitable markets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== MIT based study ===\n[[File:DBP 1981 1103 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.jpg|thumb|250px|Development aid, German stamp (1981).]]\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Abhijit Banerjee and Ruimin He have undertaken a rigorous study of the relatively few independent evaluations of aid program successes and failures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410233354/http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10|title=Making aid work|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> They suggest the following interventions are usually highly effective forms of aid in normal circumstances:\n\n* subsidies given directly to families to be spent on children's education and health\n* education vouchers for school uniforms and textbooks\n* teaching selected illiterate adults to read and write\n* deworming drugs and vitamin/nutritional supplements\n* vaccination and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs\n* indoor sprays against [[malaria]], anti-[[mosquito]] bed netting\n* suitable fertilizers\n* clean [[water supply|water supplies]]\n\n=== UK Parliamentary study ===\n\nAn inquiry into aid effectiveness by the UK All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Debt, Aid and Trade featured evidence from Rosalind Eyben, a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]].

It suggests Development organisations need to change the way they work to manage better the multiple partnerships that the Accra Agenda for Action recognises is at the core of the aid business. In relation to this specific inquiry, Dr Eyben outlined the following points:<ref>[http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/putting-relationships-first-for-aid-effectiveness 'Putting Relationships First for Aid Effectiveness'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103939/http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/putting-relationships-first-for-aid-effectiveness |date=2011-06-04 }} Evidence Submission to the APPG Inquiry on Aid Effectiveness, Institute of Development Studies (IDS)</ref>\n\n* Achieving impact requires investing in relationships, development organisations need to support their staff to do this. At the moment, the opposite is happening.\n* In multiple sets of relationships there will be different ideas about what is success and how to achieve it and this should be reflected in methodologies for defining and assessing the impact of aid.\n* Helpful procedural harmonisation should not mean assuming there is only a single diagnosis and solution to any complex problem.\n* In addition to measuring results, donors need to assess the quality of relations at project/programme, country and international levels against indicators agreed with partners.\n* Decisions on aid need to be made on a case by case basis on the advice of well-informed country offices.\n* Accountable states depend on empowered citizens\n* Development organisations also need to be more accountable to UK citizens through encouraging conversations as to the real challenges and limitations of aid. (Point made in relation to UK as evidence for UK parliamentary inquiry)\n\nThe views above are of Eyben. There were many other submissions to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade's inquiry into Aid Effectiveness.

The calculation is Net Private Grants / ODA.</ref> In addition, remittances received from migrants working or living in diaspora form a significant amount of international transfer.\n\nSome governments also include military assistance in the notion \"foreign aid\", although many [[NGO]]s tend to disapprove of this.\n\nOfficial development assistance is a measure of government-contributed aid, compiled by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) since 1969. The DAC consists of 34 of the largest aid-donating countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe concept of development aid goes back to the [[colonial era]] at the turn of the twentieth century, in particular to the British policy of colonial development that emerged during that period. The traditional government policy had tended to favor [[laissez-faire]] style economics, with the free market for capital and goods dictating the economic role that colonies played in the [[British Empire]].\n\n[[Image:British Political Personalities 1936-1945 CH4432.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] presided over a Development Committee for the colonies. He is pictured entertaining [[Jamaica]]n recruits for the [[RAF]].]]\nChanges in attitudes towards the moral purpose of the Empire, and the role that government could play in the promotion of welfare slowly led to a more proactive policy of economic and developmental assistance towards poor colonies. The first challenge to Britain was the economic crisis that occurred after World War I. Prior to the passage of the 1929 Colonial Development Act, the doctrine that governed Britain (and other European colonizers) with their territories was that of financial self-sufficiency. What this simply meant was that the colonies were responsible for themselves.<ref>Joseph Hodge, Gerald Hodl, & Martin Kopf (edi) Developing Africa: Concepts and Practices in Twentieth-Century Colonialism, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014, p.12.</ref>\n\nBritain was not going to use the money that belongs to the metropole to pay for things in the colonies. The colonies did not only have to pay for infrastructural development but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generate significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends.<ref>Bekeh Utietiang, Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and the Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967 (Ph.D Thesis), West Virginia University, Morgantown, 2014, p. 38.</ref> As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having a significant impact on the colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. Parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies.<ref>[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Stephen Constantine]], ''The Making of British Colonial Development Policy, 1914-1940'', London: Frank Cass, 1984, p.183.</ref> This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], then [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]]. Its initial annual budget of \u00a31 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the [[infrastructure]] of [[transport]], [[electrical power]] and [[water supply]] in colonies and [[dominion]]s abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade.<ref name=\"Kanbur\">{{Citation | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | contribution = The economics of international aid | editor-last1 = Kolm | editor-first1 = Serge-Christophe | editor-last2 = Ythier | editor-first2 = Jean Mercier | editor-link1 = Serge-Christophe Kolm | title = Handbook of the economics of giving, altruism and reciprocity: foundations, volume 1 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam London | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780444506979  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now use metropolitan funds to develop the colonies.\n\nBy the late 1930s, especially after the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939]], it was clear that this initial scheme was far too limited in scope. A [[Royal Commission]] under [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] was sent to investigate the living conditions in the [[British West Indies]] and it published its [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Report]] in 1940 which exposed the horrendous living conditions there.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Cary|title=The Twilight of Colonial Rule in the British West Indies: Nationalist Assertion vs. Imperial Hubris in the 1930s|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1996|volume=30|issue=1/2|page=2|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=10&hid=107&sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&AN=45526514}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Basdeo|first=Sahadeo|title=Walter Citrine and the British Caribbean Worker's Movement during the Commission Hearing|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1983|volume=18|issue=2|page=46|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&vid=11&hid=28&bquery=(AU+(basdeo))+AND+(citrine)&bdata=JmRiPWFobCZkYj1oaWEmdHlwZT0xJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAmidst increasing criticism of Britain's colonial policies from abroad and at home,<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|page=229}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Kelvin|title=Race and Class Struggles in a Colonial State|year=1994|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary|page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWAYAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9781895176438}}</ref> the commission was a performance to showcase Britain's \"benevolent\" attitude towards its colonial subjects.<ref name=Thomas267>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Roy Darrow, ed.|title=The Trinidad Labour Riots of 1937|year=1987|publisher=University of West Indies Press|location=St. Augustine|page=267|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Re3TAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The Commission's recommendations urged health and education initiatives along with increased sugar subsidies to stave off a complete and total economic meltdown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|page=23}}</ref> The [[Colonial Office]], eager to prevent instability while the country was at [[World War II|war]], began funneling large sums of cash into the region.<ref name=Thomas283>{{cite book|last=Thomas|pages=283}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonial Development and Welfare Act was passed in 1940 to organize and allocate a sum of \u00a35 million per year to the British West Indies for the purpose of long-term development.

Development aid was aimed at offering technical solutions to social problems without altering basic [[social structure]]s. The United States was often fiercely opposed to even moderate changes in social structures, for example the [[land reform]] in [[Guatemala]] in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1953 at the end of the [[Korean War]], the incoming [[Eisenhower Administration]] established the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) as an independent government agency outside the Department of State to consolidate economic and technical assistance. In 1955, foreign aid was brought back under the administrative control of the Department of State and FOA was renamed the International Cooperation Administration (ICA).\n\nIn 1956, the Senate conducted a study of foreign aid with the help of a number of independent experts.  The result, stated in a 1959 amendment to the Mutual Security Act, declared that development in low-income regions was a U.S. objective along with and additional to other foreign-policy interests, attempting thus to clarify development assistance's relationship with the effort to contain Communism. In 1961, the Congress approved the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961 with President [[J.F. Kennedy]]'s support, which retained the 1959 policy of international development as an independent U.S. objective and set up a new Agency for International Development, [[USAID]].\n\nThe volume of international aid to [[Developing country|developing countries]] (called \"[[Third World]]\" at the time) grew dramatically from the 1960s. This aid came mainly from the US and [[Western Europe]]an countries, but there were also significant contributions from the [[Soviet Union]] in exchange for overseas political influence in the context of the heightened global tensions of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe practice of extending aid to politically aligned parties in recipient nations continues today; Faye and Niehaus (2012) are able to establish a causal relationship between politics and aid in recipient nations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Faye|first=Michael|last2=Niehaus|first2=Paul|date=2012-12-01|title=Political Aid Cycles|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3516\u20133530|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|issn=0002-8282|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/120bb48b574483be2faedcae4e7830ad810e13d5}}</ref> In their analysis of the competitive 2006 Palestinian elections, they note that USAID provided funding for development programs in Palestine to support the Palestinian Authority, the US backed entity running for reelection.

A 1961 resolution decreed that:\n\n{{Quotation|The Committee will continue to consult on the methods for making national resources available for assisting countries and areas in the process of economic development and for expanding and improving the flow of long-term funds and other development assistance to them.|Development Assistance Committee|Mandate (1961)}}\n\n=== Critiques of development aid ===\n[[File:Cartoon, Warren Buffett wants African children to have more Coke - and healthier teeth.gif|thumb|Warren Buffett is considered one of the world's leading philanthropists, yet he is also the biggest investor in Coca-Cola, which aggressively seeks to expand into poorer countries. This cartoon, from an organization critical of the true motives of international aid, calls attention to what it perceives as a contradiction.]]Development aid is often provided by means of supporting local development aid projects. In these projects, it sometimes occurs that no strict code of conduct is in force. In some projects, the development aid workers do not respect the local [[code of conduct]]. For example, the local [[dress code]] as well as [[Human communication|social interaction]]. In developing countries, these matters are regarded highly important and not respecting it may cause severe offense, and thus significant problems and delay of the projects.\n\nThere is also much debate about evaluating the quality of development aid, rather than simply the quantity.  For instance, [[tied aid]] is often criticized as the aid given must be spent in the donor country or in a group of selected countries. Tied aid can increase development aid project costs by up to 20 or 30 percent.<ref name=\":18\">[http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_2649_33959_29412506_119699_1_1_1,00.html OECD The Typing of Aid]</ref>\n\nThere is also criticism because donors may give with one hand, through large amounts of development aid, yet take away with the other, through strict trade or migration policies, or by getting a foothold for foreign corporations.  The [[Commitment to Development Index]] measures the overall policies of donors and evaluates the quality of their development aid, instead of just comparing the quantity of [[official development assistance]] given.\n\n== Extent of aid ==\n{{Development economics sidebar}}\nMost [[official development assistance]] (ODA) comes from the 28 members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC), or about $135&nbsp;billion in 2013.

Hirschman]]\u2019s [[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty|exit-voice-loyalty]] (EVL) model can be used to understand how certain policy changes affect the growth of a nation and the change of bargaining power inside it. Clark et al.\u2019s formalization of the model to politics shows the effect that developmental aid can have on the receiving country's development and highlights that the aid can potentially harm that country.\n\nHirschman\u2019s EVL model is based on the foundation that \u201cunder any economic, social, or political system, individuals, business firms, and organizations, in general, are subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous, or otherwise functional behavior\u201d. The customer who is affected by the lapse in the system (a fall in the quality of a product they are consuming) has two ways to answer to this- \u201cexit\u201d or \u201cvoice\u201d. If the individual chooses the former, they simply stop buying the product and inflict a revenue drop that forces the firm to either correct their mistake or cease to exist. If the individual chooses the \u201cvoice\u201d option, then they will express their dissatisfaction to either the firm or something that has authority over it. This will force the firm to fix their lapse, but it will not suffer a decline in revenue. Lastly, Hirschman introduces the \u201cloyalty\u201d option, which occurs when the consumer cannot \u201cexit\u201d and the firm does not care about the effect that \u201cvoice\u201d will have on their revenue, and the consumers who chose it continues to consume the lapsed good.\n\nClark et al.\u2019s paper takes Hirschman's EVL model and applies it to political developments inside a nation.<ref>[https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf]</ref> When a government changes a policy that now has a negative effect on the welfare of some citizens, or is already being unresponsive to a deleterious situation, the citizens have the same 3 choices of response as before. Here, \u201cexit\u201d can take the form of citizens leaving the country [[The Art of Not Being Governed]] and hence depriving the state of their taxes or simply rearranging their capital and goods so they are not taxed by the government, as seen with British merchants threatening to move capital to the Netherlands if not given representation after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. \u201cVoice\u201d takes the form of non-violent civil disobedience, as seen with Gandhi's [[Salt March]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] protests in Ferguson, a violent demonstration, as seen with [[Luddite]] breaking weaving machinery to protest the lack of protectionist policies by the English government, or even \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d [http://abahlali.org/files/Scotts-Weapons.pdf] where small, non-cooperation and false create high costs for the state. \u201cLoyalty\u201d entails that the citizens simply accept the situation and continue their lives before.\n\nHow foreign aid enters this equation in weak states is by changing the citizens\u2019 power of \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d and weakening the state's dependence on their citizens and hence becoming less responsive to their needs. If the state receives international aid, it is less dependent on the tax revenue that it collects from its constituents. A higher level of fiscal independence on the part of the state decreases the bargaining power of the citizens. The government is threatened less by the citizens\u2019 \u201cexit\u201d option, and less hurt if it is implemented, hence this takes away a credible threat to use at the negotiation table in order for the citizens to request improvement to their current condition. At the same time, the lack of dependence for revenue decreases the \u201cvoice\u201d action of the citizen by weakening the effect a violent demonstration or everyday resistance has on impacting the state's decision-making.\n\nAs long as the government of a nation receiving international aid knows that it will keep receiving it, and there will be no repercussion on the side of the donors for failing to address its constituents\u2019 issues, it stays optimal for that government to keep ignoring the weakened demands of its citizens. With weakened bargaining power and a less responsive state, there can be no bargaining between citizen and state that will, in the long, run lead to economic and/or development within the nation. Although international has done far-reaching things with respect to increasing access to improved medical care, improving education, and decreasing poverty and hunger,  only in 1997 did the [[World Bank]] began to rethink its aid policy structure and begin using parts of it specifically for building up the state capability of the aid-receiving nations [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980]. Even more recently, the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]], a US-based aid agency, started working with developing nation to provide them with strictly development aid as they set and implement goals for national development.\n\n=== Effects of foreign aid in Africa. ===\nWhile most economists like [[Jeffery Sachs]] hold the view of aid as the driver for economic growth and development, others argue that aid has rather led to increasing poverty and decreasing economic growth of poor countries.<ref name=\":42\">Moyo, D.

Foreign aid is especially multifaceted in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa due to geographic barriers. Most macro foreign aid efforts fail to recognize these issues and, as Sachs argues, cause insufficient international aid and policy improvement. Sachs argues that unless foreign aid provides mechanisms that overcome geographic barriers, pandemics such as HIV and AIDS that cause traumatic casualties within regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to care millions of fatalities. \n\nFor aid to be effective and beneficial to economic development, there must be some support systems or \u2018[[wiktionary:traction|traction]]\u2019 that, will enable foreign aid to spur economic growth.<ref name=\":52\">Rahnama, M. & Fawaz, F. & Gittings, K.

Dissident economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Milton Friedman]] argued in the 1960s that aid is ineffective:<ref>{{Cite web| title = The sad loss of Lord Bauer| url =http://www.la-articles.org.uk/bauer.htm| accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote | ... an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries. | Peter Bauer}}\n\nIn economics, there are two competing positions on aid. A view pro aid, supported by Jeffrey Sachs and the United Nations, which argues that foreign aid will give the big push to break the low-income [[poverty trap]] poorer countries are trapped in. From this perspective, aid serves to finance  \u201cthe core inputs to development \u2013 teachers, health centers, roads, wells, medicine, to name a few...\u201d (United Nations 2004).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Making Progress on Foreign Aid|journal = Annual Review of Economics|volume = 7|pages = 277\u2013308|last=Qian|first=Nancy|date=2015-08-03|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553}}</ref> And a view that is skeptic about the impacts of aid, supported by William Easterly, that points out that aid has not proven to work after 40 years of large investments in Africa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmerican political scientist and professor [[Nicolas van de Walle]] has also argued that despite more than two decades of donor-supported reform in Africa, the continent continues to be plagued by economic crises due to the combination of state generated factors and to the counter productivity of international development aid to Africa. Van de Walle first attributes the failure to implement economic policy reform to factors within the African state:\n\n# Neopatrimonial tendencies of state elites that serve to preserve and centralize power, maintain limited access orders, and create political obstacles to reform.\n# Ideological obstacles that have been biased by two decades of failed economic policy reform and in turn, create a hostile environment for reform.\n# Low state capacity that reinforces and that in turn, is reinforced by the neopatrimonial tendencies of the state.\n\nVan de Walle later argues that these state generated factors that have obstructed the effective implementation of economic policy reform are further exacerbated by foreign aid. Aid, therefore, makes policy reform less likely, rather than more likely. Van de Walle posits that international aid has sustained economic stagnation in Africa by:\n\n# Pacifying Africa's neopatrimonial tendencies, thereby lessening the incentives for state elites to undertake reform and preserving the status quo.\n# Sustaining poorly managed bureaucratic structures and policies that would be otherwise rectified by market forces.\n# Allowing state capacities to deteriorate through externalizing many state functions and responsibilities.\n\nIn order for aid to be productive and for economic policy reform to be successfully implemented in Africa, the relationship between donors and governments must change. Van de Walle argues that aid must be made more conditional and selective to incentivize states to take on reform and to generate the much needed accountability and capacity in African governments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democratic Reform in Africa: The Quality of Progress|last=Van de Walle|first=Nicolas|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1588262464|editor-last=Gyimah-Boadi|editor-first=Emmanuel|location=1800 30th Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301|pages=29\u201363|chapter=Economic Reform: Patterns and Constraints}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, information asymmetries often hinder the appropriate allocation of aid; Blum et al. (2016) note that both South Sudan and Liberia struggle tremendously with paying employees and controlling the flow of money - South Sudan had a significant number of ghosts on its payroll, while Liberia's Civil Service Agency could not adequately pay civil servants because there was minimal communication from the Ministries of Health and Education regarding their respective payrolls.<ref>Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. \u201cPublic Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.\u201d World Bank: Fragile and Conflict State Impact Evaluation Research Program paper.\n</ref>\n\nMany [[econometric]] studies in recent years have supported the view that development aid has no effect on the speed with which countries develop. Negative side effects of aid can include an unbalanced [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]] of the recipient's currency (known as [[Dutch Disease]]), increasing corruption, and adverse political effects such as postponements of necessary economic and democratic reforms.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\">[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx Aid Effectiveness and Governance: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009071531/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx |date=2009-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been argued{{By whom|date=September 2010}} that much government-to-government aid was ineffective because it was merely a way to support strategically important leaders (Alesino and Dollar, 2000). A good example of this is the former dictator of [[Zaire]], [[Mobuto Sese Seko]], who lost support from the West after the Cold War had ended. Mobuto, at the time of his death, had a sufficient personal fortune (particularly in Swiss banks) to pay off the entire external debt of Zaire.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\" />\n\nBesides some instances that only the president (and/or his close entourage) receives the money resulting from development aid, the money obtained is often badly spent as well. For example, in Chad, the [http://www.esso.com/Chad-English/PA/Files/suppvol1ch1.pdf Chad Export Project], an oil production project supported by the World Bank, was set up. The earnings of this project (6.5 million dollars per year and rising) were used to obtain arms. The government defended this purchase by stating that \"development was not possible without safety\". However, the [[Military of Chad]] is notorious for severe misconduct against the population (abuse, rape, claiming of supplies and cars) and did not even defend the population in distress (e.g. in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]]). In 2008, the World Bank retreated from the project that thus increased environmental pollution and human suffering.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\">Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen</ref>\n\nAnother criticism has been that Western countries often project their own needs and solutions onto other societies and cultures. In response, western help in some cases has become more 'endogenous', which means that needs as well as solutions are being devised in accordance with local cultures.<ref>[http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html The Future of The Anti-Corruption Movement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409153824/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html |date=2009-04-09 }}, Nathaniel Heller, Global Integrity</ref> For example, sometimes projects are set up which wish to make several [[ethnic group]]s cooperate. While this is a noble goal, most of these projects fail because of this intent.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\" />Additionally, although the goal in utility to provide a larger social benefit may be justified as worthy, a more ethically sourced incentive would be projects not looking for an opportunity to impose a social hierarchy through cooperation, but more-so for the sake of truly assisting recipients. The intent of cooperation is not necessarily a reason for failure, but the very nature of different aspirations towards defining virtues which exist in direct context with respective societies. In this way a disconnect may be perceived among those imposing their virtues onto ethnic groups interpreting them.\n\nThe [https://www.cgdev.org/ Center for Global Development] have published a review<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss, Petterson and van de Walle|date=January 2006|title=An Aid-Institutions Paradox? A Review Essay on Aid Dependency and State Building in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://www.cgdev.org|journal=Center for Global Development|volume=Working Paper Number 74|pages=}}</ref> essay of the existing literature studying the relationship between Aid and public institutions. In this review,  they concluded that a large and sustained Aid can have a negative effect in the development of good public institutions in low income countries. They also mention some of the arguments exhibited in this article as possible mechanism for this negative effect, for instance, they considered the [[Dutch Disease]], the discourage of revenue collections and the effect on the state capacity among others.\n\nFurthermore, the effect of Aid on conflict intensity and onset have been proved to have different impacts in different countries and situations. For instance, for the case of Colombia Dube and Naidu (2015)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dube and Naidu|date=January 6, 2015|title=Bases, Bullets, and Ballots: The Effect of US Military Aid on Political Conflict in Colombia|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume= 77| issue = 1|pages=249\u2013267|doi=10.1086/679021|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1423498}}</ref> showed that Aid from the US seems to have been diverted to paramilitary groups, increasing political violence. Moreover, Nunn and Qian (2014)<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nunn and Qian|date=June 2014|title=US Food Aid and Civil Conflict|jstor=42920861|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1630-1666|issue=6|pages=1630\u20131666}}</ref> have found that an increase in U.S. food aid increases conflict intensity; they claim that the main mechanism driving this result is predation of the aid by the rebel groups. In fact, they note that aid can have the unintentional consequence of actually improving rebel groups' ability to continue conflict, as vehicles and communications equipment usually accompany the aid that is stolen.<ref name=\":2\" /> These tools improve the ability of rebel groups to organize and give them assets to trade for arms, possibly increasing the length of the fighting. Finally, Crost, Felter and Johnston (2014)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crost, Felter and Johnston|date=June 2014|title=Aid Under Fire: Development Projects and Civil Conflict|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1833\u20131856|issue=6|pages=1833\u20131856|doi=10.1257/aer.104.6.1833}}</ref> have showed that a development program in the Philippines have had the unintended effect of increasing conflict because of an strategic retaliation from the rebel group, on where they tried to prevent that the development program increases support to the government.\n\nIt has also been argued that help based on direct donation creates dependency and corruption, and has an adverse effect on local production. As a result, a shift has taken place towards aid based on activation of local assets and stimulation measures such as [[microcredit]].\n\nAid has also been ineffective in young recipient countries in which ethnic tensions are strong: sometimes ethnic conflicts have prevented efficient delivery of aid.\n\nIn some cases, western surpluses that resulted from faulty agriculture- or other policies have been dumped in poor countries, thus wiping out local production and increasing dependency.\n\nIn several instances, loans that were considered irretrievable (for instance because funds had been embezzled by a dictator who has already died or disappeared), have been written off by donor countries, who subsequently booked this as development aid.\n\nIn many cases, Western governments placed orders with Western companies as a form of subsidizing them, and later shipped these goods to poor countries who often had no use for them. These projects are sometimes called '[[white elephant]]s'.\n\nAccording to [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], these issues might be caused by deficient diagnostics of the development agencies. In his book [[The Anti-Politics Machine]], Ferguson uses the example of the [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] project in [[Lesotho]] to illustrate how a bad diagnostic on the economic activity of the population and the desire to stay away from local politics, caused a livestock project to fail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|date=1994|title=The anti-politics machine: 'development' and bureaucratic power in Lesotho|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|journal=The Ecologist|volume=24|issue=5|pages=|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129094236/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Martijn Nitzsche, another problem is the way on how development projects are sometimes constructed and how they are maintained by the local population. Often, projects are made with technology that is hard to understand and too difficult to repair, resulting in unavoidable failure over time. Also, in some cases the local population is not very interested in seeing the project to succeed and may revert to disassembling it to retain valuable source materials. Finally, villagers do not always maintain a project as they believe the original development workers or others in the surroundings will repair it when it fails (which is not always so).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\">[http://www.momentum-media.nl/files/_articles/31/Gestrand_Ontwikkelingswerk.pdf Kijk magazine; oktober 2008, Gestrand Ontwikkelingswerk]</ref>\n\nA common criticism in recent years is that rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness. In the example of [[tied aid]], donor countries often require the recipient to purchase goods and services from the donor, even if these are cheaper elsewhere. Other conditions include opening up the country to foreign investment, even if it might not be ready to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp|title=US and Foreign Aid Assistance|publisher=Global Issues|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Development Aid in Congo Wasted.jpeg|thumb|250px|In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], an abandoned ferry as a relic of a development project is rusting next to the boats people use today.]]\nAll of these problems have made that a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly. According to Gerbert van der Aa, for the Netherlands, only 33% of the development aid is successful, another 33% fails and of the remaining 33% the effect is unclear. This means that for example for the Netherlands, 1.33 to 2.66 billion is lost as it spends 4 billion in total of development aid (or 0,8% of the gross national product).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\" />\n\nFor the Italian development aid for instance, we find that one of their successful projects (the Keita project) was constructed at the cost of 2/3 of 1 F-22 fighter jet (100 million $), and was able to reforest {{convert|1876|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of broken, barren earth, hereby increasing the socio-economic wellbeing of the area.<ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf Keita project increasing socio-economic wellbeing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311112921/http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf |date=2012-03-11 }}</ref> However -like the Dutch development aid- again we find that, the Italian development aid too is still not performing up to standards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |title=Italian aid not up to standard overall |access-date=2009-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102713/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |archive-date=2008-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This makes clear that there are great differences between the success of the projects and that budgetary follow-up may not be so strictly checked by independent third parties.\n\nAn excerpt from [[Thomas Dichter]]'s recently published book ''[[Despite Good Intentions]]: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed'' reads: \"This industry has become one in which the benefits of what is spent are increasingly in inverse proportion to the amount spent - a case of more gets you less. As donors are attracted on the basis of appeals emphasizing \"product\", results, and accountability...the tendency to engage in project-based, direct-action development becomes inevitable. Because funding for development is increasingly finite, this situation is very much a zero-sum game. What gets lost in the shuffle is the far more challenging long-term process of development.\"\n\nEffectiveness of development aid can be argued to be uncoordinated and unsustainable.  Development aid tends to be put towards specific diseases with high death rates and simple treatments, rather than funding health basics and infrastructure.  Though a lot of NGO's and funding have come forth, little sustainable outcomes have been made.  This is due to the fact that the money doesn't go towards developing a sustainable medical basis.  Money is given to specific diseases to show short-term results, reflecting the donor's best interests rather than the citizens' necessities.  It is evident that many development aid projects are not helping with basic and sustainable health care due to the generally high numbers of deaths due to preventable diseases.  Development aid could do more justice if used to generate general public health with infrastructure and trained personnel rather than pin-pointing specific diseases and reaching for quick fixes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14\u201338}}</ref>\n\nResearch has shown that developed nations are more likely to give aid to nations who have the worst economic situations and policies (Burnside, C., Dollar, D., 2000). They give money to these nations so that they can become developed and begin to turn these policies around. It has also been found that aid relates to the population of a nation as well, and that the smaller a nation is, the more likely it is to receive funds from donor agencies. The harsh reality of this is that it is very unlikely that a developing nation with a lack of resources, policies, and good governance will be able to utilize incoming aid money in order to get on their feet and begin to turn the damaged economy around. It is more likely that a nation with good economic policies and good governance will be able to utilize aid money to help the country establish itself with an existing foundation and be able to rise from there with the help of the international community. But research shows that it is the low-income nations that will receive aid more so, and the better off a nation is, the less aid money it will be granted. On the other hand, Alesina and Dollar (2000) note that private foreign investment often responds positively to more substantive economic policy and better protections under the law.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is increased private foreign investment in developing nations with these attributes, especially in the higher income ones, perhaps due to being larger and possibly more profitable markets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== MIT based study ===\n[[File:DBP 1981 1103 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.jpg|thumb|250px|Development aid, German stamp (1981).]]\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Abhijit Banerjee and Ruimin He have undertaken a rigorous study of the relatively few independent evaluations of aid program successes and failures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410233354/http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10|title=Making aid work|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> They suggest the following interventions are usually highly effective forms of aid in normal circumstances:\n\n* subsidies given directly to families to be spent on children's education and health\n* education vouchers for school uniforms and textbooks\n* teaching selected illiterate adults to read and write\n* deworming drugs and vitamin/nutritional supplements\n* vaccination and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs\n* indoor sprays against [[malaria]], anti-[[mosquito]] bed netting\n* suitable fertilizers\n* clean [[water supply|water supplies]]\n\n=== UK Parliamentary study ===\n\nAn inquiry into aid effectiveness by the UK All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Debt, Aid and Trade featured evidence from Rosalind Eyben, a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]].

At the moment, the opposite is happening.\n* In multiple sets of relationships there will be different ideas about what is success and how to achieve it and this should be reflected in methodologies for defining and assessing the impact of aid.\n* Helpful procedural harmonisation should not mean assuming there is only a single diagnosis and solution to any complex problem.\n* In addition to measuring results, donors need to assess the quality of relations at project/programme, country and international levels against indicators agreed with partners.\n* Decisions on aid need to be made on a case by case basis on the advice of well-informed country offices.\n* Accountable states depend on empowered citizens\n* Development organisations also need to be more accountable to UK citizens through encouraging conversations as to the real challenges and limitations of aid.

The Gender Development Index uses the Human Development Index and corrects its results in life expectancy, income, and education for gender imbalances.<ref name=\":10\" /> Due to criticisms of these two indexes the United Nations Development Program in its 2010 Human Development Report introduced the [[Gender Inequality Index]]. The Gender Inequality Index uses more metrics and attempts to show the losses from gender inequality.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nEven with these indexes, Ranjula Swain of the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] and Supriya Garikipati of the [[University of Liverpool]] found that, compared to the effectiveness of health, economic, and education targeted aid, foreign aid for gender equality remains understudied.<ref name=\":10\" /> Swain and Garikipati found in an analysis of Gender Equality Aid that on a country and region-wide level gender equality aid was not significant in its effect.

Sam refused, and the two were constantly fighting, even after Jason was assigned as Sam's bodyguard to protect her from Sonny's enemies. When Sam found out that she was pregnant with Sonny's child, Jason asks Sam to say he's the baby's father, and let Sonny and Carly stay together for the sake of their sons, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] (then [[Dylan Cash]]) and [[Morgan Corinthos|Morgan]]. Sam agrees to Jason's request and they almost marry, but Sam backs out because they are not in love and she still has feelings for Sonny.\n\nJason and Sam began to bond and care for each other during her pregnancy, and became friends. Jason protected Sam from her abusive ex-boyfriend and took care of her mentally handicapped brother, [[List of General Hospital characters (2000s)#Danny McCall|Danny McCall]] ([[David Greenman]]). When Jason's grandmother died, Sam decided to name her daughter Lila Morgan in honor of Jason's late grandmother [[List of General Hospital characters (1970s)#Lila Quartermaine|Lila Morgan Quartermaine]] ([[Anna Lee]]). Tragically, Sam's daughter was stillborn. Jason and Sam grieve together, eventually falling in love. Though Jason turns down pursuing a relationship and Sam moves out, the two get back together when they realize they do not want to be without each other. Sam and Jason get engaged in January 2005. They plan to adopt baby Hope, until the mother decides to take her baby back. Jason convinces Sam to give Hope up to avoid a court battle.\n\nSam is hurt and angry at this decision and leaves Jason briefly, but they reunite after Sam is accused of kidnapping. Jason is the only one to believe Sam's innocence, and was able to prove it. When things cooled down, Jason and Sam went on a romantic vacation, but they were kidnapped by Allegra Montenegro ([[Meg Bennett]]), who needed Sam to impersonate her daughter Alicia, and marry Andrew Olsen. Sam reluctantly agreed to save Jason and herself. When Andrew was killed, Sam was arrested for Andrew's murder. Allegra helped Jason break Sam out of jail, get the real Alicia arrested, and they returned to Port Charles.\n\nAfter returning, Jason began to suffer from life-threatening headaches, seizures and amnesia. Sam is there for Jason when he eventually loses his memory as a result of his illness. Sam convinces Jason to undergo treatment with the help Dr. [[Robin Scorpio]] ([[Kimberly McCullough]]). He and Sam fall in love all over again and he proposes to her a second time before he begins his treatment. After the treatment, Jason gets his memory back and remembers his life with Sam, but the procedure causes a [[intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]]. Jason initially refuses to have surgery to repair the damage, and he and Sam move to Hawaii to live out his last days peacefully. However, Jason realizes that he wants to live to be with Sam, and returns to Port Charles to have the surgery, which ended up saving his life.\n\n===2006\u201308===\nIn 2006, during the encephalitis plague, Sam became deathly sick. Jason and Carly found the antidote, and brought it to General Hospital. Unfortunately, they were not in time to save Danny. Sam found out afterwards she was adopted, and that her birth mother was [[Alexis Davis]] ([[Nancy Lee Grahn]]). When Sam is shot by one of Jason's enemies, he tells Alexis that Sam is her daughter. Alexis pressures Jason into breaking up with Sam for her own good. Though Jason walks away, Sam continually tries to win him back, but all her efforts fail. Infuriated and hurt, Sam gets drunk and sleeps with [[Ric Lansing]] ([[Rick Hearst]]), Alexis' husband. Unfortunately, Alexis and Jason, having both returned in an attempt to apologize and patch things up with Sam, witness this.\n\nHeartbroken and angry, Jason gets drunk and sleeps with [[Elizabeth Webber|Elizabeth Spencer]] ([[Rebecca Herbst]]). Elizabeth becomes pregnant, and the baby was initially believed to be the child of her husband, [[Lucky Spencer|Lucky]] (then [[Greg Vaughan]]). Sam and Jason are able to reconcile and work through their issues. When Sam is framed by Ric, she and Jason go on the run and clear Sam's name, with the help of [[Damian Spinelli]] ([[Bradford Anderson]]). Jason learns that he is the father of Elizabeth's son, [[Children of General Hospital#Jake Webber|Jake Spencer]], but they decide not to tell Sam or Lucky, who still thinks the baby is his. But Sam learns about Jake's paternity and becomes hurt, angry and jealous. Sam witnesses Jake being kidnapped and does not intervene; Jason later rescues Jake from his kidnapper, who tells him that Sam saw what happened. Sam visits Jason in prison and breaks up with him, citing his lies and emotional unfaithfulness as her reasons, when began a 2-year breakup, and have her packed all of her things and moves into her new penthouse. When Jason starts a relationship with Elizabeth, Sam, devastated and angry, hires actors to scare Elizabeth and her sons at gunpoint to remind her that Jason's enemies are everywhere.  However, Jason traces the goons back to Sam; confronting her in her own home, Jason openly threatens to kill Sam if she tries anything against Elizabeth's family again. Despite the severity of Sam's actions, the break up was received with mixed reviews. Monaco explains to ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' in a 2008 interview, \"I feel Sam and Jason was so abruptly ended without any explanation, really, as to the coldness that was so one-sided [on Jason's part]. Of course, Jake came into play, but I felt like Jason and Sam were always strong enough to overcome. Who knows [what will happen] down the line?\"<ref name=\"SOD 2008\" />\n\nIn Fall 2008, former [[ABC Daytime]] president, [[Brian Frons]] began hinting that more Sam and Jason interaction would occur in the future, because the audience wanted to see more of that.<ref name=\"Soaps In Depth 09/04/08\">{{cite news|title=General Hospital Fall Preview|work=[[Soaps In Depth]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group|Bauer Publications]]|date=September 4, 2008}}</ref> In late 2008, months after ended his 1-year romantic relationship with Elizabeth, Jason and Sam began to soften to one another again when a man named Joe walked into General Hospital with a bomb strapped to his chest and demanded that his pregnant wife get treatment after previously being turned away. During the lockdown, Elizabeth ran into the hospital with Jake after being in a house fire. Joe initially refused to let any of the doctors help Elizabeth and Jake, but Sam managed to convince Joe to allow Jake treatment. Soon after, Jason arrived at GH, and he and Sam fell back into their old pattern and worked together to stop Joe. Jason and Sam then went their separate ways for a few months, but they both maintained a mutual friend in Spinelli and this sometimes caused them to cross paths.\n\n===2009\u201313===\nIn early 2009, Sam and Jason are inside General Hospital when it is locked down again due to an outbreak of a bio toxin. The two teamed up to rescue Spinelli when the hospital starts to burn down. Later in the year, Sam helps Jason and Spinelli after they are entrapped by the [[FBI]]. Jason, in turn, helps Sam and Spinelli set up a private investigation firm. When Kristina and Michael run away to Mexico, Sam and Jason go after them. Sam is kidnapped by [[Jerry Jacks]] ([[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]]), who is trying to lure Jason into a trap. Jason ends up shot by Jerry, who leaves him to die. Sam escapes and rescues Jason. Jason starts hallucinating that he is in Hawaii with Sam. They grow closer as Sam nurses him back to health and end up making love, but decide not to talk about it. They find the teens and return to Port Charles. After they return, Jason and Sam remain drawn to each other and soon start dating again.\n\nWhile covering up Michael killing [[Claudia Zacchara]] ([[Sarah Joy Brown]]), Sam and Jason grow closer, admitting their love for each other. When Jason is stalked by crazed artist [[Franco (General Hospital)|Franco]] ([[James Franco]]), Sam is targeted. Jason rescues Sam, saying he'd always choose to save her when she's in trouble. Sonny was accused and put on trial for the Claudia's murder, but Michael confessed was sentenced to prison. Jason made a deal and sent himself to prison to protect Michael. While upset, Sam supported his decision. Before Jason turned himself in, they go away together and spend a few days at a cabin. Sam remained supportive and visited him regularly in prison. Jason and Michael are later permanently released from prison, and Jason reunites with Sam as lovers and renewed their romance, for the first time in 2 years. When Sonny's old flame [[Brenda Barrett]] ([[Vanessa Marcil|Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo]]) was targeted by the Balkan, Jason acted as her bodyguard and she moved in with him. Sam was initially jealous of Brenda, but Jason assured her that he loved her. Determined to get Brenda out of the penthouse quickly, Sam and Jason began searching for the Balkan.\n\nOn Sonny and Brenda's wedding day, Sam got caught in an explosion meant for Brenda. Jason stayed by Sam's side when she was dealing with temporary hearing loss, even communicating in sign language to express his love. Jason decides to propose to Sam soon afterwards during a romantic dinner on the roof, and Sam accepts. Overwhelmed by the wedding planning, the two of them decide to drive off on Jason's motorcycle. They end up at a Chinese restaurant, where the owner happens to be an ordained minister. Jason and Sam get married in the restaurant's garden. They leave for their honeymoon to Hawaii, where Franco drugs them both, locks Jason in a room, and makes him watch while he takes Sam to the bedroom and places her in bed, before turning off the camera. When Jason comes back to Sam, both of them come to believe Franco raped Sam.\n\nThe two return to Port Charles. Soon after, Sam finds out she's pregnant. She and Jason have a paternity test done, which establishes Jason as the father. However, Sam finds out that Franco is Jason's twin brother. Sam has another paternity test run, and is devastated when it says that Franco is the father of her baby. She tells Jason, and the two of them start to drift apart trying to deal this news. While they're separated, Sam gives birth to a baby boy during a rainstorm. Her son is switched at birth with [[Victor Lord III]], who was stillborn, by [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]] ([[Robin Mattson]]) and [[Todd Manning]] ([[Roger Howarth]]). Jason finds them, and the two mourn when they believe that the baby died. It's revealed that Jason is the father of Sam's son because Heather switched the paternity test. Their son is given to [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] ([[Florencia Lozano]]), Victor's mother, who believes he's her son. Though Jason wants to make things right with Sam, she blames him for the death of her son. The two separate, and file for divorce. During the poisoning of the Port Charles water supply, Sam and Jason are admitted to the hospital in what seems to be the last hours of their life. Sam shares with Jason a dream she had where her son was still alive. Afterwards, Jason gets information that starts to make him suspect the baby that died wasn't Sam's.\n\nJason eventually figures out that Sam's son was switched with T\u00e9a's son. By the time they find out, though, Heather has kidnapped the baby for herself. Jason and Sam team up, and are able to rescue the baby from Heather. They're reunited with their son, whom they name [[Children of General Hospital#Danny Morgan|Daniel Edward Morgan]]. The two reconcile, finally getting the chance to raise the family they always wanted. Sadly, the night they come home, Jason is shot by [[Cesar Faison]] ([[Anders Hove (actor)|Anders Hove]]), and presumed dead when his body isn't found. Sam later found out that Jason is Danny's biological father. Though Sam was initially in denial about Jason's death, she later accepted that Jason was never coming home.\n\n===2014\u201316===\nJason is alive, and held captive by [[Victor Cassadine]] ([[Thaao Penghlis]]). Victor forces Robin to revive Jason, but the two escape Victor's clutches and come back to Port Charles. Jason is hit by a car, though, and has to undergo a complete facial reconstruction. Jason's vitals spike while Sam is holding his hand, even though he is under heavy sedation. Jason ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) awakens with amnesia, and starts going by \"Jake\". He bonds with both Sam and Danny, who feel drawn to him while he's unconscious. Though he wakes up with no memory, he's under [[Helena Cassadine]]'s ([[Constance Towers]]) mind control, and holds Sam hostage while freeing a prisoner. Sam suspects Jake, but he denies the accusation. Helena orders him to kill Sam, but \"Jake's\" unable to fulfill this order. When \"Jake\" is eventually arrested, Sam helps him break Helena's mind control, and remember what he had done. \"Jake\" asks Sam for help to figure out who he is. \"Jake\" has obscure dreams about his past, specifically of Sam and Danny. He starts a relationship with Elizabeth, while Sam dates [[Patrick Drake]] ([[Jason Thompson (actor)|Jason Thompson]]). When [[Hayden Barnes]] ([[Rebecca Budig]]), who knew his true identity, is shot, Sam and Jake stop their investigation. On their wedding anniversary, Sam and \"Jake\" unknowingly renew their vows.\n\n[[File:Miller MonacoGH-JasonSam.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Jason and Sam (Miller and Monaco, pictured) in 2016.]]\nWith Spinelli and Carly's help, \"Jake's\" true identity is uncovered the day he is supposed to marry Elizabeth.

When Jason gets into a fight with [[Nikolas Cassadine]] ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]), Sam helps prove Jason's innocence by proving Nikolas started the fight. Jason recovers more memories of his life hanging out with Sam, though she puts no pressure on him to remember.

Despite not recovering his memories, Jason realizes how much Sam means to him, and the two tentatively start a relationship. They divorce so they can start fresh without the pressure of the past.\n\nAfter discovering that Hayden was shot on Nikolas' orders, Sam and Jason confront Nikolas.

Sam refuses because she does not want to be separated from Jason.\n\n=== 2017\u2013 ===\nJason and Curtis figure out that [[Olivia St. John]] ([[Tonja Walker]]), Julian's sister, is responsible for Morgan's death. Meanwhile, Olivia kidnaps Sam to threaten Julian, but Sam tries to escape. Unfortunately, in the ensuing struggle, Sam gets pushed off a bridge by Olivia into a ravine. Jason tries to track down Sam after realizing she's missing, but is unable to see her in the dark. Just as Jason gives up, a beam of moonlight helps him find Sam after the moon comes out.

The theme of the stars first appeared on November 19, 2004 after Sam's daughter was stillborn. Jason and Sam were grieving for her and started talking about heaven. Jason said that when he is near the ocean, he feels like he is a part of something \"bigger than himself.\" Sam replied that for her it was the stars. \n{{quote|'''''Sam''': For me it's the stars.

When Sam found out that she was pregnant with Sonny's child, Jason asks Sam to say he's the baby's father, and let Sonny and Carly stay together for the sake of their sons, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] (then [[Dylan Cash]]) and [[Morgan Corinthos|Morgan]]. Sam agrees to Jason's request and they almost marry, but Sam backs out because they are not in love and she still has feelings for Sonny.\n\nJason and Sam began to bond and care for each other during her pregnancy, and became friends. Jason protected Sam from her abusive ex-boyfriend and took care of her mentally handicapped brother, [[List of General Hospital characters (2000s)#Danny McCall|Danny McCall]] ([[David Greenman]]). When Jason's grandmother died, Sam decided to name her daughter Lila Morgan in honor of Jason's late grandmother [[List of General Hospital characters (1970s)#Lila Quartermaine|Lila Morgan Quartermaine]] ([[Anna Lee]]). Tragically, Sam's daughter was stillborn. Jason and Sam grieve together, eventually falling in love. Though Jason turns down pursuing a relationship and Sam moves out, the two get back together when they realize they do not want to be without each other. Sam and Jason get engaged in January 2005. They plan to adopt baby Hope, until the mother decides to take her baby back. Jason convinces Sam to give Hope up to avoid a court battle.\n\nSam is hurt and angry at this decision and leaves Jason briefly, but they reunite after Sam is accused of kidnapping. Jason is the only one to believe Sam's innocence, and was able to prove it. When things cooled down, Jason and Sam went on a romantic vacation, but they were kidnapped by Allegra Montenegro ([[Meg Bennett]]), who needed Sam to impersonate her daughter Alicia, and marry Andrew Olsen. Sam reluctantly agreed to save Jason and herself. When Andrew was killed, Sam was arrested for Andrew's murder. Allegra helped Jason break Sam out of jail, get the real Alicia arrested, and they returned to Port Charles.\n\nAfter returning, Jason began to suffer from life-threatening headaches, seizures and amnesia. Sam is there for Jason when he eventually loses his memory as a result of his illness. Sam convinces Jason to undergo treatment with the help Dr. [[Robin Scorpio]] ([[Kimberly McCullough]]). He and Sam fall in love all over again and he proposes to her a second time before he begins his treatment. After the treatment, Jason gets his memory back and remembers his life with Sam, but the procedure causes a [[intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]]. Jason initially refuses to have surgery to repair the damage, and he and Sam move to Hawaii to live out his last days peacefully. However, Jason realizes that he wants to live to be with Sam, and returns to Port Charles to have the surgery, which ended up saving his life.\n\n===2006\u201308===\nIn 2006, during the encephalitis plague, Sam became deathly sick. Jason and Carly found the antidote, and brought it to General Hospital. Unfortunately, they were not in time to save Danny. Sam found out afterwards she was adopted, and that her birth mother was [[Alexis Davis]] ([[Nancy Lee Grahn]]). When Sam is shot by one of Jason's enemies, he tells Alexis that Sam is her daughter. Alexis pressures Jason into breaking up with Sam for her own good. Though Jason walks away, Sam continually tries to win him back, but all her efforts fail. Infuriated and hurt, Sam gets drunk and sleeps with [[Ric Lansing]] ([[Rick Hearst]]), Alexis' husband. Unfortunately, Alexis and Jason, having both returned in an attempt to apologize and patch things up with Sam, witness this.\n\nHeartbroken and angry, Jason gets drunk and sleeps with [[Elizabeth Webber|Elizabeth Spencer]] ([[Rebecca Herbst]]). Elizabeth becomes pregnant, and the baby was initially believed to be the child of her husband, [[Lucky Spencer|Lucky]] (then [[Greg Vaughan]]). Sam and Jason are able to reconcile and work through their issues. When Sam is framed by Ric, she and Jason go on the run and clear Sam's name, with the help of [[Damian Spinelli]] ([[Bradford Anderson]]). Jason learns that he is the father of Elizabeth's son, [[Children of General Hospital#Jake Webber|Jake Spencer]], but they decide not to tell Sam or Lucky, who still thinks the baby is his. But Sam learns about Jake's paternity and becomes hurt, angry and jealous. Sam witnesses Jake being kidnapped and does not intervene; Jason later rescues Jake from his kidnapper, who tells him that Sam saw what happened. Sam visits Jason in prison and breaks up with him, citing his lies and emotional unfaithfulness as her reasons, when began a 2-year breakup, and have her packed all of her things and moves into her new penthouse. When Jason starts a relationship with Elizabeth, Sam, devastated and angry, hires actors to scare Elizabeth and her sons at gunpoint to remind her that Jason's enemies are everywhere.  However, Jason traces the goons back to Sam; confronting her in her own home, Jason openly threatens to kill Sam if she tries anything against Elizabeth's family again. Despite the severity of Sam's actions, the break up was received with mixed reviews. Monaco explains to ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' in a 2008 interview, \"I feel Sam and Jason was so abruptly ended without any explanation, really, as to the coldness that was so one-sided [on Jason's part]. Of course, Jake came into play, but I felt like Jason and Sam were always strong enough to overcome. Who knows [what will happen] down the line?\"<ref name=\"SOD 2008\" />\n\nIn Fall 2008, former [[ABC Daytime]] president, [[Brian Frons]] began hinting that more Sam and Jason interaction would occur in the future, because the audience wanted to see more of that.<ref name=\"Soaps In Depth 09/04/08\">{{cite news|title=General Hospital Fall Preview|work=[[Soaps In Depth]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group|Bauer Publications]]|date=September 4, 2008}}</ref> In late 2008, months after ended his 1-year romantic relationship with Elizabeth, Jason and Sam began to soften to one another again when a man named Joe walked into General Hospital with a bomb strapped to his chest and demanded that his pregnant wife get treatment after previously being turned away. During the lockdown, Elizabeth ran into the hospital with Jake after being in a house fire. Joe initially refused to let any of the doctors help Elizabeth and Jake, but Sam managed to convince Joe to allow Jake treatment. Soon after, Jason arrived at GH, and he and Sam fell back into their old pattern and worked together to stop Joe. Jason and Sam then went their separate ways for a few months, but they both maintained a mutual friend in Spinelli and this sometimes caused them to cross paths.\n\n===2009\u201313===\nIn early 2009, Sam and Jason are inside General Hospital when it is locked down again due to an outbreak of a bio toxin. The two teamed up to rescue Spinelli when the hospital starts to burn down. Later in the year, Sam helps Jason and Spinelli after they are entrapped by the [[FBI]]. Jason, in turn, helps Sam and Spinelli set up a private investigation firm. When Kristina and Michael run away to Mexico, Sam and Jason go after them. Sam is kidnapped by [[Jerry Jacks]] ([[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]]), who is trying to lure Jason into a trap. Jason ends up shot by Jerry, who leaves him to die. Sam escapes and rescues Jason. Jason starts hallucinating that he is in Hawaii with Sam. They grow closer as Sam nurses him back to health and end up making love, but decide not to talk about it. They find the teens and return to Port Charles. After they return, Jason and Sam remain drawn to each other and soon start dating again.\n\nWhile covering up Michael killing [[Claudia Zacchara]] ([[Sarah Joy Brown]]), Sam and Jason grow closer, admitting their love for each other. When Jason is stalked by crazed artist [[Franco (General Hospital)|Franco]] ([[James Franco]]), Sam is targeted. Jason rescues Sam, saying he'd always choose to save her when she's in trouble. Sonny was accused and put on trial for the Claudia's murder, but Michael confessed was sentenced to prison. Jason made a deal and sent himself to prison to protect Michael. While upset, Sam supported his decision. Before Jason turned himself in, they go away together and spend a few days at a cabin. Sam remained supportive and visited him regularly in prison. Jason and Michael are later permanently released from prison, and Jason reunites with Sam as lovers and renewed their romance, for the first time in 2 years. When Sonny's old flame [[Brenda Barrett]] ([[Vanessa Marcil|Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo]]) was targeted by the Balkan, Jason acted as her bodyguard and she moved in with him. Sam was initially jealous of Brenda, but Jason assured her that he loved her. Determined to get Brenda out of the penthouse quickly, Sam and Jason began searching for the Balkan.\n\nOn Sonny and Brenda's wedding day, Sam got caught in an explosion meant for Brenda. Jason stayed by Sam's side when she was dealing with temporary hearing loss, even communicating in sign language to express his love. Jason decides to propose to Sam soon afterwards during a romantic dinner on the roof, and Sam accepts. Overwhelmed by the wedding planning, the two of them decide to drive off on Jason's motorcycle. They end up at a Chinese restaurant, where the owner happens to be an ordained minister. Jason and Sam get married in the restaurant's garden. They leave for their honeymoon to Hawaii, where Franco drugs them both, locks Jason in a room, and makes him watch while he takes Sam to the bedroom and places her in bed, before turning off the camera. When Jason comes back to Sam, both of them come to believe Franco raped Sam.\n\nThe two return to Port Charles. Soon after, Sam finds out she's pregnant. She and Jason have a paternity test done, which establishes Jason as the father. However, Sam finds out that Franco is Jason's twin brother. Sam has another paternity test run, and is devastated when it says that Franco is the father of her baby. She tells Jason, and the two of them start to drift apart trying to deal this news. While they're separated, Sam gives birth to a baby boy during a rainstorm. Her son is switched at birth with [[Victor Lord III]], who was stillborn, by [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]] ([[Robin Mattson]]) and [[Todd Manning]] ([[Roger Howarth]]). Jason finds them, and the two mourn when they believe that the baby died. It's revealed that Jason is the father of Sam's son because Heather switched the paternity test. Their son is given to [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] ([[Florencia Lozano]]), Victor's mother, who believes he's her son. Though Jason wants to make things right with Sam, she blames him for the death of her son. The two separate, and file for divorce. During the poisoning of the Port Charles water supply, Sam and Jason are admitted to the hospital in what seems to be the last hours of their life. Sam shares with Jason a dream she had where her son was still alive. Afterwards, Jason gets information that starts to make him suspect the baby that died wasn't Sam's.\n\nJason eventually figures out that Sam's son was switched with T\u00e9a's son. By the time they find out, though, Heather has kidnapped the baby for herself. Jason and Sam team up, and are able to rescue the baby from Heather. They're reunited with their son, whom they name [[Children of General Hospital#Danny Morgan|Daniel Edward Morgan]]. The two reconcile, finally getting the chance to raise the family they always wanted. Sadly, the night they come home, Jason is shot by [[Cesar Faison]] ([[Anders Hove (actor)|Anders Hove]]), and presumed dead when his body isn't found. Sam later found out that Jason is Danny's biological father. Though Sam was initially in denial about Jason's death, she later accepted that Jason was never coming home.\n\n===2014\u201316===\nJason is alive, and held captive by [[Victor Cassadine]] ([[Thaao Penghlis]]). Victor forces Robin to revive Jason, but the two escape Victor's clutches and come back to Port Charles. Jason is hit by a car, though, and has to undergo a complete facial reconstruction. Jason's vitals spike while Sam is holding his hand, even though he is under heavy sedation. Jason ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) awakens with amnesia, and starts going by \"Jake\". He bonds with both Sam and Danny, who feel drawn to him while he's unconscious. Though he wakes up with no memory, he's under [[Helena Cassadine]]'s ([[Constance Towers]]) mind control, and holds Sam hostage while freeing a prisoner. Sam suspects Jake, but he denies the accusation. Helena orders him to kill Sam, but \"Jake's\" unable to fulfill this order. When \"Jake\" is eventually arrested, Sam helps him break Helena's mind control, and remember what he had done. \"Jake\" asks Sam for help to figure out who he is. \"Jake\" has obscure dreams about his past, specifically of Sam and Danny. He starts a relationship with Elizabeth, while Sam dates [[Patrick Drake]] ([[Jason Thompson (actor)|Jason Thompson]]). When [[Hayden Barnes]] ([[Rebecca Budig]]), who knew his true identity, is shot, Sam and Jake stop their investigation. On their wedding anniversary, Sam and \"Jake\" unknowingly renew their vows.\n\n[[File:Miller MonacoGH-JasonSam.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Jason and Sam (Miller and Monaco, pictured) in 2016.]]\nWith Spinelli and Carly's help, \"Jake's\" true identity is uncovered the day he is supposed to marry Elizabeth.

When Jason gets into a fight with [[Nikolas Cassadine]] ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]), Sam helps prove Jason's innocence by proving Nikolas started the fight. Jason recovers more memories of his life hanging out with Sam, though she puts no pressure on him to remember.

Despite not recovering his memories, Jason realizes how much Sam means to him, and the two tentatively start a relationship. They divorce so they can start fresh without the pressure of the past.\n\nAfter discovering that Hayden was shot on Nikolas' orders, Sam and Jason confront Nikolas.

Sam refuses because she does not want to be separated from Jason.\n\n=== 2017\u2013 ===\nJason and Curtis figure out that [[Olivia St. John]] ([[Tonja Walker]]), Julian's sister, is responsible for Morgan's death. Meanwhile, Olivia kidnaps Sam to threaten Julian, but Sam tries to escape. Unfortunately, in the ensuing struggle, Sam gets pushed off a bridge by Olivia into a ravine. Jason tries to track down Sam after realizing she's missing, but is unable to see her in the dark. Just as Jason gives up, a beam of moonlight helps him find Sam after the moon comes out.

The theme of the stars first appeared on November 19, 2004 after Sam's daughter was stillborn. Jason and Sam were grieving for her and started talking about heaven. Jason said that when he is near the ocean, he feels like he is a part of something \"bigger than himself.\" Sam replied that for her it was the stars. \n{{quote|'''''Sam''': For me it's the stars.

Explanations: A \u2013 [[fold (geology)|folded]] rock strata cut by a [[thrust fault]]; B \u2013 large [[intrusion]] (cutting through A); C \u2013 [[erosion]]al [[angular unconformity]] (cutting off A & B) on which rock strata were deposited; D \u2013 [[dike (geology)|volcanic dike]] (cutting through A, B & C); E \u2013 even younger rock strata (overlying C & D); F \u2013 [[normal fault]] (cutting through A, B, C & possibly E).]]\n\n'''Cross-cutting relationships''' is a principle of PPs that states that the geologic feature which cuts another is the younger of the two features. It is a [[relative dating]] technique in geology. It was first developed by Danish geological pioneer [[Nicholas Steno]] in ''Dissertationis prodromus'' (1669) and later formulated by [[James Hutton]] in ''[[Theory of the Earth]]'' (1795) and embellished upon by [[Charles Lyell]] in ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' (1830).\n\n== Types ==\nThere are several basic types of cross cutting relationships:\n\n*Structural relationships may be [[Fault (geology)|faults]] or [[Fracture (geology)|fractures]] cutting through an older rock.\n*Intrusional relationships occur when an [[igneous]] [[pluton]] or [[Dike (geology)|dike]] is intruded into pre-existing rocks.\n*Stratigraphic relationships may be an [[erosion surface|erosional surface]] (or [[unconformity]]) cuts across older rock layers, geological structures, or other geological features.\n*Sedimentological relationships occur where currents have eroded or scoured older sediment in a local area to produce, for example, a channel filled with sand.\n*Paleontological relationships occur where animal activity or plant growth produces truncation.  This happens, for example, where animal burrows penetrate into pre-existing sedimentary deposits.\n*Geomorphological relationships may occur where a surficial feature, such as a [[river]], flows through a gap in a ridge of rock. In a similar example, an [[impact crater]] excavates into a subsurface layer of rock.\n\nCross-cutting relationships may be compound in nature. For example, if a fault were truncated by an unconformity, and that unconformity cut by a dike. Based upon such compound cross-cutting relationships it can be seen that the fault is older than the unconformity which in turn is older than the dike.

It is a [[relative dating]] technique in geology. It was first developed by Danish geological pioneer [[Nicholas Steno]] in ''Dissertationis prodromus'' (1669) and later formulated by [[James Hutton]] in ''[[Theory of the Earth]]'' (1795) and embellished upon by [[Charles Lyell]] in ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' (1830).\n\n== Types ==\nThere are several basic types of cross cutting relationships:\n\n*Structural relationships may be [[Fault (geology)|faults]] or [[Fracture (geology)|fractures]] cutting through an older rock.\n*Intrusional relationships occur when an [[igneous]] [[pluton]] or [[Dike (geology)|dike]] is intruded into pre-existing rocks.\n*Stratigraphic relationships may be an [[erosion surface|erosional surface]] (or [[unconformity]]) cuts across older rock layers, geological structures, or other geological features.\n*Sedimentological relationships occur where currents have eroded or scoured older sediment in a local area to produce, for example, a channel filled with sand.\n*Paleontological relationships occur where animal activity or plant growth produces truncation.  This happens, for example, where animal burrows penetrate into pre-existing sedimentary deposits.\n*Geomorphological relationships may occur where a surficial feature, such as a [[river]], flows through a gap in a ridge of rock. In a similar example, an [[impact crater]] excavates into a subsurface layer of rock.\n\nCross-cutting relationships may be compound in nature. For example, if a fault were truncated by an unconformity, and that unconformity cut by a dike. Based upon such compound cross-cutting relationships it can be seen that the fault is older than the unconformity which in turn is older than the dike. Using such rationale, the sequence of geological events can be better understood.\n\n== Scale ==\n[[File:Andesitic dyke Morro Solar.jpg|thumb|Cross-cutting relationships involving an [[andesite|andesitic]] [[Dike (geology)|dike]] in [[Peru]] that cuts across the lower sedimentary strata.
