She is the wife of [[Joel Osteen]] and the daughter-in-law of [[John Osteen]].\n\n== History ==\nVictoria Osteen was born '''Victoria Iloff''' in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. She lived near [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] where her father, Donald Iloff \u2013 a mathematician with [[General Electric]] \u2013 was a member of GE\u2019s [[Saturn rocket]] project team led by German rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]]. In 1963, at the age of two, Osteen moved with her family to Houston, Texas when her father took a position with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]). She grew up in a southern suburb of Houston, near the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] (now known as the Johnson Space Center).\n\nGrowing up, Osteen attended the [[Church of Christ]], a relatively conservative church, where her mother, Georgine Iloff, taught [[Sunday school]] and her father served as a [[deacon]]. Osteen attended (though did not graduate from) the [[University of Houston]] where she studied [[psychology]] while working in her mother\u2019s jewelry business. It was while working in the jewelry store that she met Joel Osteen in 1985 when he came in to buy a new watch battery.\n\n== Current activities ==\nOsteen founded the Lakewood Church Women\u2019s Ministry in 2003, where she currently serves as co-pastor. Her part of the service can be seen on a one-hour program broadcast on the [[Daystar Television Network]] and through a live internet feed.\n\nShe can be seen every Sunday morning screeching loudly into the microphone. Critics have said that she acts like the age of electronics has not yet dawned... she screams so everyone in America can hear her...with or without the internet. Victoria has been quoted as saying she is just excited and passionate about the message. \n\nHer other activities include a regular feature on Houston radio station 89.3 [[KSBJ]].

A second season was released on June 29, 2018. A holiday season, dubbed ''Nailed It! Holiday!'', was released on December 7, 2018. The third season was released on May 17, 2019.

Competitors take part in two challenges over the course of the 35-minute episodes.\n\nThe first challenge is called \"Baker's Choice\", where the contestants pick one of three existing confectionery treats and try to recreate it. The winner of this challenge gets a special prize and is allowed to wear a golden chef's hat.\n\nIn the second challenge, \"Nail It or Fail It\", contestants have two hours to recreate a complicated cake from scratch. They each receive a \"Panic Button\" which allows them to get three minutes of assistance from one of the judges. The worst-performing baker from the first challenge gets a second button to distract the other bakers - the specific function varies depending on the episode, but normally involves Nicole annoying the bakers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Worboys|first=Audrey|title=LMFAO, There's A New Netflix Show Exclusively For Cake Fails|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/audreyworboys/netflix-cake-fail-show-nailed-it|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=10 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref> The three judges decide on the winning cake based upon presentation and taste.

Competitors take part in two challenges over the course of the 35-minute episodes.\n\nThe first challenge is called \"Baker's Choice\", where the contestants pick one of three existing confectionery treats and try to recreate it. The winner of this challenge gets a special prize and is allowed to wear a golden chef's hat.\n\nIn the second challenge, \"Nail It or Fail It\", contestants have two hours to recreate a complicated cake from scratch. They each receive a \"Panic Button\" which allows them to get three minutes of assistance from one of the judges. The worst-performing baker from the first challenge gets a second button to distract the other bakers - the specific function varies depending on the episode, but normally involves Nicole annoying the bakers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Worboys|first=Audrey|title=LMFAO, There's A New Netflix Show Exclusively For Cake Fails|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/audreyworboys/netflix-cake-fail-show-nailed-it|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=10 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref> The three judges decide on the winning cake based upon presentation and taste.

{"title_page": "Pekarangan", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{short description|A type of home garden developed in Indonesia}}\n[[File:West Sumatra pekarangan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.33|A rural pekarangan in [[Agam Regency|Agam]], [[West Sumatra]]]]\n\n'''Pekarangan''' ({{IPA-id|p\u0259'kara\u014ban}}) is a type of tropical [[Forest gardening|home garden]] developed in [[Indonesia]], mainly in [[Java]]. Pekarangans typically contain plants, while some possess animals (including farmed [[fish]], [[ruminant]]s, [[poultry]], and [[Wildlife|wild animals]]) and structures such as pens and bird cages. Yields of the gardens offer various uses, ranging from food stock which may supply a household's subsistence and income, to plants for ornamental uses. Along with their subsistence and commercial uses, they are used for social interactions and yield sharing and provides materials for cultural ceremonies and religious practices. Some pekarangans are made, maintained, and spatially arranged according to local values. Home gardens of this kind may have existed for several thousand years, but their first mention is found in a Javanese chronicle that was written in 860 AD. In 2010, around {{convert|103,000|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us}} of Indonesian land were used for gardens of this sort.\n\nThe sustainability and social roles of pekarangans have been threatened by fragmentation due to inheritance, urbanization, and the commercialization that began in the late 20th century. Smaller land dwellings, due to fragmentation and urbanization, cause their size and plant diversity to decrease. Deliberate reduction of plant diversity was also implemented to optimize yields. Problems such as pest outbreaks and a rise in household debts have appeared due to the degraded sustainability of the gardens.\n\n[[History of Indonesia|Throughout the history of Java]], pekarangans have been of little interest to the governments that have ruled the island due to their minimal susceptibility to yield extraction. In the 2010s, they have gained the attention of the Indonesian government implemented through P2KP (''Percepatan Penganekaragaman Konsumsi Pangan''), a program focused on urban and peri-urban areas that aims to optimize production with a sustainable approach.\n\n== Definition ==\nIn the [[Indonesian language]], ''pekarangan'' can be translated as \"land that surrounds a house\", \"a house's yard\", or \"plotted land for house construction\".{{sfn | KBBI}} However, the term itself is widely used in scientific literature, specifically in agroforestry and environmental topics, in the context of \"home gardens\".{{sfn | Kaswanto | Nakagoshi | 2014 | p=290}}The word ''pekarangan'' may be derived from ''karang'', which, according to G.J.A. Terra, means \"perennial crops\".{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini | 2016 | p=15}} \n\nScholars offer various definitions of the term \"pekarangan\". According to Sajogyo, it is a plot adjacent to a house, used part-time. Totok Mardikanto and Sri Sutami defined it as a plot surrounding a house; most of its kind are fenced, and usually planted with dense plants with various annual and perennial plants for daily and commercial use. Meanwhile, Hartono ''et al.'' defined it as a plot of land with clear boundaries, with a house built above it; various functional relations, consisted of economical, biophysical, social, and cultural relations, between it and its owner are made. Euis Novitasari considered \"pekarangan\" to be a form of land use: a system of small-scale additional food production by members and a family, that is also an [[ecosystem]] with plants of various height. Further, she described it as having a clear boundary and has various elements including the owner's house, a kitchen, a pen, and fences. Simatupang and Suryana argued that it is hard to define \"pekarangan\" clearly, due to its role both as extended use of farmlands and as a homestead.{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini | 2016 | p=15}}\n\n== Elements ==\n=== Plants ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| width = 150\n| image1 = Annona muricata 1.jpg\n| alt1 = Soursop\n| image2 = Leucaena leucocephala.jpg\n| alt2 = White leadtree\n| footer = [[Soursop]] and [[white leadtree]], some of the plants that are specifically planted in rural pekarangans{{sfn|Arifin|Sakamoto|Chiba|1998|p=99}}\n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n[[File:West Sumatran brick house and home garden with orange.jpg|thumb|Orange trees (front) and banana plants (back) in a pekarangan]]\nA pekarangan generally consists of [[Annual plant|annual]] and [[perennial plant]]s combined; they can be harvested daily or seasonally.{{sfn|Abdoellah|Parikesit|Gunawan|Hadikusumah|2001|p=140}} Some perennials such as ''melinjo'' (''[[Gnetum gnemon]]'') produce leaves consistently. Some other perennials such as [[coconut]], [[jackfruit]], [[banana]], and [[salak]] produce fruit all year round. Other perennials' fruiting periods are limited. As examples, the semarang [[guava]] (''[[Syzygium aqueum]]'') fruits during April\u2013June, mangoes fruit during July\u2013August, and [[Durian|durians]] (''[[Durio zibethinus]]'') during June\u2013September.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Soemarwato|Karyono|Soekartadiredja|1985|p=3}} According to Christanty, perennials in such home gardens are more dominant in regions where [[Paddy field|rice fields]] use more than 40 percent of the region's area, while annual plants dominate in other areas.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=143}} Perennials also dominate in gardens where labor is inadequate.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=143}} Such home gardens are also identifiable by trees, one of their most common components; their abundance contributes to the image of Indonesian countrysides&nbsp;\u2013&#32;instead of houses, they are identified by their \"dense, forest mimics\".{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=101}}\n\nIn [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] pekarangans, ornamental plants, and crops such as [[Clove|cloves]], [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], and [[Mango|mangoes]] are frequently planted in the front patch, as these are valuable plants that homeowners want to keep an eye on. Starchy crops, medicinal plants, and [[Cash crop|cash crops]] are more frequent in the front and back plots, and less in the side plots. Coffee might be used as a [[hedge]] in the side and back yards; ornamental plants might have a similar function in front yards. Vegetables are habitually grown in front and side areas to be exposed to light, as tall trees are rare in those areas. Trees with large canopies might be planted in front yards, providing shade for children. The back plots of the Sundanese gardens might be planted with coconuts, fruit trees, and tall trees whose woods are used for construction. Those are planted in back gardens to avoid damage to the house when any of them falls due to a storm. Most plants propagate without intentional human intervention\u2014this natural process is called ''janteun ku anjeun'' in Sundanese\u2014due to seed scattering by birds, mammals, or humans after they eat. Because of this, no clear spatial arrangement is found in Sundanese back gardens.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}}\n\nPlants in Javanese and Sundanese pekarangans, among them annual plants cultivated in the dry season (e.g. [[eggplant]]s), are habitually grown near water sources such as fish ponds, open sewage ditches, and wells.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=3}}{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}} Plants that need high levels of nutrients, such as banana, mango, jackfruit, and other fruit plants, are planted close to garbage dumps, called ''jarian'' in Sundanese.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}} Meanwhile, crops frequently harvested for cooking, such as [[Chili pepper|chili peppers]], [[langua]], [[lemongrass]], and [[tomato]]es, are planted near the kitchen.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}}{{sfn|Torquebiau|1992|p=193}}\n\n=== Animals ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Geitenhok ingericht voor de mestverzameling voor de groententuin Sindanglaja TMnr 10013517.jpg|thumb|left|A household's goat pen in the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]]|alt=]]\n\nSome owners of pekarangans keep livestock and poultry (traditionally chickens, goats, and [[sheep]]), usually in a household pen. These are usually allowed to roam around the gardens, village areas, and traditional markets to find food on their own. They are penned at night and are usually given additional feed. Other common domestic animals kept in pekarangans are fishes in ponds and [[songbird]]s (e.g. [[zebra dove]], ''Geopelia striata''), which are kept in cages on bamboo poles. The economic status of pekarangan owners plays a role in livestock ownership; lower-class owners tend to own several chickens whereas middle-class owners might have a goat or a sheep, and high-class owners may own several cows or [[water buffalo]]es. Livestock manure acts as an organic fertilizer for the gardens via [[compost]]ing, and sometimes a nutritional source for pond fishes.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=105}}{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=2}}\n[[File:Domestic goat in Agam, West Sumatra.jpg|thumb|Some Indonesians keep farm animals, such as goats, in their pekarangans.]]\nProductive fish ponds are common in Sundanese traditional pekarangans.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=105}} The fishes are fed with [[Food waste|kitchen waste]] supplemented by animal and human waste.

According to Widyastuti, the soil fauna diversity in the gardens is suggested to be higher than that of [[teak]] forests.{{sfn|Widyastuti|2011|p=1}} The diversity might be caused by the vegetation, which protects soil fauna from direct sunshine, especially in the dry season.{{sfn|Widyastuti|2011|p=5}} [[Otto Soemarwoto]] and [[Gordon Conway]] accounted that the gardens are also believed to be \"a good habitat\" for [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=102}}\n\nThere are different findings in relation to wild birds. A high diversity of birds, including legally protected species, within the gardens were recorded in a West Java research while another study in [[Jambi]] suggests individual pekarangans are not effective as a means to conserve bird communities. This is because of the [[edge effects]] of their irregular shapes, their frequent disturbance, and their proximity to roads and houses. The pekarangans used for the Jambi study had unusually low levels of plant diversity, which may account for the results. Despite this, the gardens apparently still attract birds due to their food resources.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=102}}{{sfn|Prabowo|Darras|Clough|Toledo-Hernandez|2016|p=13}} A similar finding was repeated in a separate West Java study, indicating children shoot birds in the gardens and take their eggs while adults kill or chase them due to the perception of them as pests.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=154}}\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Kebun belakang rumah - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Canopy structure of a rural pekarangan|alt=]]\n\nPlant diversity in pekarangans arises from complex interactions between several factors that are not fully understood.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=300}} These include environmental stability, the [[tropical climate]] that is favorable to plant growth, and their close proximity to the owners' domestic activities.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=103}} Other natural factors are size, temperature decrease due to elevation, [[precipitation]], and climatic events like [[El Ni\u00f1o]].{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007 |pp=300\u2013302}} Anthropological factors include individual preferences and market proximity.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|pp=300, 303}}\n\nThe diversity of plants aids individual plants to adapt to a changing environment, helping them survive in the long term. {{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=299}} The biodiversity in the multi-layered system also helps to optimize solar energy and carbon harvesting, cool the domestic climate, protect the soil from erosion, and accommodate habitats for wild plants and animals.{{sfn|Arifin|2013|p=18}}{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=299}} The [[Genetics|genetic]] diversity also gives protection from the effects of pests and diseases.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=108}} As an example, the abundance of [[insectivorous]] birds in the gardens helps control pests,{{sfn|Torquebiau|1992|p=195}} helping the garden remain productive.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=299}}\n\nWhile on per individual basis pekarangans store only small amounts of carbon due to their size, on per area basis they hold an amount of carbon that is similar to primary or secondary forests, and greatly surpassing ''[[Imperata]]'' grasslands and [[fallow land]]s.{{sfn|Roshetko|Delaney|Hairiah|Purnomosidhi|2002|p=146}}\n\n=== Natural factors ===\nPlant diversity in pekarangans tends to increase as their size increases.{{sfn|Arifin|Sakamoto|Chiba|1996|pp=492\u2013493}} Diversity of crop species, however, might reach a plateau in very large gardens.

Plant species brought by internal migrants need to adapt well to the local environment.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=304}}\n\nCommercialization, fragmentation, and urbanization are major hazards to pekarangans' plant diversity. These change the organic cycles within the gardens, threatening their ecological sustainability.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=313}} Commercialization requires a systemic change of crop planting.

Past this point, garden use starts to increase.{{sfn|Stoler|1978|p=95}}\n\n=== Other uses ===\nThe ''buruan'' (Sundanese for \"front yard\"), part of a Sundanese pekarangan, is used as a children's playground and adults' gathering place.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=107}} Integrated with local customs and philosophies such as ''rukun'' and ''tri-hita-karana'', the gardens aid other social interactions such as yield-sharing, ceremonies, and religious activities.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=109}}{{sfn|Arifin|2013|pp=15\u201316}} Especially in urban areas, pekarangans also function as aesthetic ornaments of a house, mainly the front yard.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=107}}\n\n== Sociology and economy ==\nPekarangans are mainly developed by women. Forms of such gardens in matriarchal tribes and societies, e.g. [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Acehnese people|Aceh]], and communities in the 1960s Central Java, are more developed than in tribes that tend to be patriarchal, e.g. [[Batak]]. For the same reason, matriarchal culture around the gardens started to develop, such as the requirement for the permission of a landowner's wife before selling a plot of land they own&nbsp;\u2013&#32;this happens in cities like [[Tegal (city)|Tegal]].{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | pp=100\u2013101}} A female-led household would orient their use of the gardens toward household needs.{{sfn | Wiersum | 2006 | p=19}} In Madura, however, home gardens are described as the domain of men.{{sfn | Febrianto | Wulandari | Santosa | 2017 | p=60}} Nevertheless, a pekarangan in general, regardless of the culture, is considered a responsibility of the entire family, including their offspring and the offspring's families.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | pp=109\u2013110}} The men prepare the land prior to home garden use, plant tree crops, and sell the garden's crops, while women plant annual crops.{{sfn | Mitchell | Hanstad | 2004 | p=11}}\n\nIn a 2004 report, Javanese pekarangans are suggested to have higher net income-per-area than rice fields. The same report argued that the cost of the Javanese gardens' production is lower than that of rice fields.{{sfn|Mitchell|Hanstad|2004|p=29}} People who focus on the gardens' production instead of rice fields may gain better yields than their counterparts.{{sfn|Torquebiau|1992|p=197}} Poor villagers, however, tend not to concentrate efforts toward the gardens; maintenance of the gardens as a sole income source would require the use of high-risk, high-reward crops, more intensive care, and income would be vulnerable to market fluctuations. Maintenance of diverse cash crops is more intense than that of rice fields and the intensity would make the villagers' gardening schedule less adaptable to rice farming activities.{{sfn|Stoler|1978|p=99}}\n\nIn some cases, people are allowed to build houses in the pekarangans of others in exchange for doing work for their owners. The gardens, however, tend to have a low demand for labor, offering minimal labor opportunities.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=110}}\n\n== Culture ==\n[[file:Proses Pembuatan Gunungan di Keraton Yogyakarta.jpg|thumb|A ''[[gunungan]]'' made of food for [[Sekaten]], a Javanese celebration for ''Mawlid''|alt=|left]]\n\nThe philosophy of living harmoniously, referred to as ''rukun'', is followed by the Javanese and Sundanese; offering yields from pekarangans to others is believed to be the medium of such culture. This can be done by offering its products to their neighbors, for example during events such as births, deaths, weddings, and cultural events like the [[Javanese calendar|Javanese new year]] and the [[Mawlid]] (observance of the birthday of [[Muhammad]]). Some offer their products to cure diseases or to protect owners from dangers. Their products are also given during daily life, especially in rural areas. A rural pekarangan owner usually allows others to enter it for any practical reason: taking dead wood for fuel, pulling water from a well for their own use, or even taking its crops. Such permission towards others might be restricted or denied if the owner has only a limited yield for his or her own consumption. In general, rural pekarangan owners never deny others' requests to take products from the gardens for religious or medicinal purposes. Some people believe asking permission to take medicinal plants in a pekarangan is a taboo, thus allowing their theft.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=109}}\n\nJavanese culture interpreted the gardens as ''pepek ing karang''&nbsp;\u2013&#32;\"a complete design\".{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=103}} It can also be interpreted as ''pepek teng karangan'', which, according to the anthropologist Oekan Abdoellah is a way of thinking, indicating agricultural practices within the gardens are a consequence of thinking about the ways to use their produce and satisfy their needs from them.{{sfn | Christanty | Abdoellah | Marten | Iskandar | 1986 | p=138}} Javanese culture, however, takes offense at the gardens' comparison with forests due to the low social value of forest in the culture. ''[[Wayang]]'' puppet plays depict forests as \"places where wild animals and evil spirits reign\" and its clearing, which is done only by men who are believed to have spiritual powers, is viewed as a respectable deed.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=101}} The backyard of a Sundanese homestead is described as ''supados sungkur'' (to be unseen by others).{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}}\n\n[[Plant community|Associations of plants]] in Javanese pekarangans tend to be more complex than those in Sundanese pekarangans.

The front yard is called ''buruan'', a space for a garden shed, ornamental plants, fruit trees, a children's playground, benches, and crop-drying. The side yard (''pipir'') is used for wood trees, crops, medicinal herbs, a fish pond, well, and a bathroom. The side yard is also a space for cloth-dying.

The ''parahyangan'' area of a Balinese pekarangan faces [[Mount Agung]], which is regarded as a sacred place (''prajan'') to pray (''sanggah''). Plants with flowers and leaves that are regularly picked and used for [[Balinese Hinduism]] liturgical purposes are planted in the ''parahyangan'' area. The ''pawongan'' area is planted with regular flowers, fruits, and leaves. The ''palemahan'' area is planted with fruits, stems, leaves, and tubers.{{sfn|Arifin|2013|pp=15\u201316}} Balinese back yards, which are known in [[Tabanan Regency|Tabanan]] and [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]] as ''teba'', are used as a place to cultivate crops and keep livestock for subsistence, commercial, and religious use as offerings.{{sfn|Arifin|2013|p=17}} The Balinese further developed beliefs about what plants should and should not be planted in various parts of their pekarangans, following the teachings from the ''[[Taru Premana]]'' manuscript. As an example, [[nerium]] and [[bougainvillea]] are believed to emit positive [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] while planted in the ''parahyangan/sanggah'' area of a pekarangan while negative auras are believed to appear if they are planted in front of the ''[[bale daja]]'', a building specifically placed in the north part of a dwelling.{{sfn|''Bali Express''|2018}}{{sfn|Saraswati|2009|p=35}}\n\n''Taneyan'', a [[Madura|Madurese]] kind of pekarangan, is used to dry crops and for traditional rituals and family ceremonies.{{sfn|Maningtyas|Gunawan|2017|p=3}}{{sfn|Febrianto|Wulandari|Santosa|2017|p=59}} ''Taneyan'' is a part of the traditional dwelling system of ''[[taneyan lanjhang]] \u2013'' a multiple-family household'','' whose spatial composition is laid out according to the ''[[bappa, babbhu, guru, rato]]'' (father, mother, teacher, leader) philosophy that shows the order of respected figures in the Madurese culture.{{sfn|Maningtyas|Gunawan|2017|p=3}}\n\n== History and development ==\n{{Quote frame|In the first establishment or formation of a village or new ground, the intended settlers take care to provide themselves with sufficient garden ground round their huts for stock and to supply the ordinary wants of their families.

He labours to plant and rear in it those vegetables that may be most useful to his family and those shrubs and trees which may at once yield him their fruit and their shade; nor does he waste his efforts on a thankless soil. The cottages, or the assemblage of huts, that compose the village, become thus completely screened from the rays of a scorching sun, and are so buried amid the foliage of a luxuriant vegetation, that at a small distance no appearance of a human dwelling can be discovered, and the residence of a numerous society appears only a verdant grove or a clump of evergreens. Nothing can exceed the beauty or the interest, which such detached mass of verdure, scattered over the face of the country, and indicating each the abode of a collection of happy peasantry, add to scenery otherwise rich, whether viewed on the sides of the mountains, in the narrow vales, or in the extensive plains.|[[Stamford Raffles]]|[[The History of Java]]|1817.{{sfn | Raffles | 1817 | pp=81\u201382}} <br>{{resize|85%|Parts of the quote were also quoted by [[Ann Stoler]] in ''Garden Use and Household Economy in Rural Java'', 1978{{sfn|Stoler|1978|p=85}}}}}}\n\n{| style=\"float: right; margin:0.5em 0.5em\"; class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"5\" |Distribution of pekarangan areas in Java\n|-\n!Province\n!<100m<sup>2</sup>\n!100m<sup>2</sup>-200m<sup>2</sup>\n!200m<sup>2</sup>-300m<sup>2</sup>\n!>300m<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n|[[West Java]]-[[Banten]]\n|52.29%\n|25.00%\n|8.77%\n|8.95%\n|-\n|[[Central Java]]\n|27.50%\n|27.57%\n|13.20%\n|31.73%\n|-\n|[[East Java]]\n|34.52%\n|25.83%\n|13.33%\n|31.73%\n|-\n|[[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Special Region<br />of Yogyakarta]]\n|33.51%\n|17.48%\n|14.61%\n|34.40%\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |Source: Arifin, Kaswanto & Nakagoshi 2014{{sfn|Arifin|Kaswanto|p=131|Nakagoshi|2014}}\n|}\nBy 1902, pekarangans occupied {{Convert|378,000|ha|sqmi}} of land in Java, and the area increased to {{Convert|1,417,000|ha|sqmi}} in 1937 and {{Convert|1,612,568|ha|sqmi}} in 1986.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=101}} In 2000, they occupied  about {{Convert|1,736,000|ha|sqmi}}.{{sfn|Arifin|Kaswanto|p=130|Nakagoshi|2014}} Indonesia as a whole had {{Convert|5,132,000|ha|sqmi}} of such gardens.{{sfn|Arifin|Kaswanto|p=130|Nakagoshi|2014}} The number peaked at about {{Convert|10,300,000|ha|sqmi}} in 2010.{{sfn|Arifin|2013|p=2}}\n\nCentral Java is considered the pekarangans' center of origin, according to Oekan Abdoellah et al.; the gardens later spread to East Java in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Abdoellah|Parikesit|Gunawan|Hadikusumah|2001|p=140}}{{sfn|Arifin|Sakamoto|Chiba|1998|p=94}} Soemarwoto and Conway proposed that early forms of pekarangan date back to several thousand years ago but the first-known record of them is a Javanese charter from 860.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=100}} During the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial era]], pekarangans were referred to as ''erfcultuur''.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=44}} In the eighteenth century, Javanese pekarangans had already so influenced West Java that they had partly replaced ''talun'' (a local form of mixed gardens) there.{{sfn|Wiersum|2006|p=17}} Since pekarangans contain many species, which mature at different times throughout the year, it has been difficult for governments throughout [[History of Indonesia|Javanese history]] to tax them systematically. In 1990, this difficulty caused the Indonesian government to forbid the reduction of rice fields in favor of pekarangans. Such difficulty might have helped the gardens to become more complex over time. Despite that, past governments still tried to tax the gardens.{{sfn | Dove | 1990 | pp=159\u2013160}}\n\n=== Effects of economic and population growth in the late 20th century ===\nSince the 1970s, Indonesia had observed economic growth rooted in the Indonesian government's five-year development plans ([[Five-Years Development Program (Indonesian program)|Repelita]]), which were launched in 1969. The economic growth helped increase the numbers of middle-class and upper-class families, resulting in better life and higher demand for quality products, including fruits and vegetables. Pekarangans in urban, suburban, and main fruit production areas adapted its efforts to increase their products' quality but this resulted in a reduction of biological diversity in the gardens, leading to an increased vulnerability to pests and plant diseases. Some disease outbreaks in commercial pekarangans occurred in the 1980s and the 1990s, such as the [[citrus greening disease]] that damaged many mandarin orange trees and the spread of the pathogenic fungi ''[[Phyllosticta]]'', which affected almost 20% of clove trees in West Java. This vulnerability also affected their owners' economic and social conditions; owners became more susceptible to debt, the sharing culture in traditional commercial pekarangans vanished, and the poor enjoyed fewer rights from them.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n=== Government programs ===\n[[file:Sby-pacitan-2-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], the sixth president of Indonesia, speaking in front of Kayen Village Seed Garden, a part of KRPL prototypes in Pacitan]]\n\nThe Indonesian government launched a campaign in October 1951, namely ''Karang Kitri'', which aimed to persuade communities to plant trees in their home gardens and other types of land. There was no incentive given in the campaign. The campaign ended in 1960.{{sfn | Nawir | Murniati | Rumboko | 2007 | p=87}} Use of pekarangans was included in a program by the Indonesian government in 1991 under a program called Diversifikasi Pangan dan Gizi (\"Food and Nutrition Diversification\").{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini |2016| p=16}} Despite that, as of 2001, \"the government [had not] paid attention\" to recommendations to include them in national strategies.{{sfn|IPGRI|2001|p=162}}\n\nSince the early 2010s, the government, through the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Agriculture]], runs a pekarangan development program named ''Percepatan Penganekaragaman Konsumsi Pangan'' (P2KP, \"Acceleration on Food Diversification\") that is focused in urban and semi-urban areas. The program applies its agenda to a concept named ''Kawasan Rumah Pangan Lestari'' (KRPL; \"Sustainable Food Houses Region\"{{sfn | Saptana | Sunarsih | Friyatno |2013| p=67}}).{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini |2016| p=17}} P2KP was begun under the Indonesian Presidential Regulation No. 22 Year 2009. There is also an urban women-focused program named ''[[Women Movement for Pekarangan Optimization|Gerakan Perempuan untuk Optimalisasi Pekarangan]]'' (GPOP; \"Women's Movement for Pekarangan Optimization\").{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini |2016| p=17}}\n\nIn addition to the national programs, some regions of Indonesia have implemented their own pekarangan use programs. The government of East Java launched a program called ''Rumah Hijau'' (\"Green House\") in 2010. The provincial government later collaborated with the Ministry of Agriculture to improve upon the ''Rumah Hijau'' program based on KRPL prototypes in [[Pacitan]], making a new program named ''Rumah Hijau Plus-Plus''.{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini |2016| p=17}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== Works cited ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n<div style=\"text-indent: -2em;

Pekarangans typically contain plants, while some possess animals (including farmed [[fish]], [[ruminant]]s, [[poultry]], and [[Wildlife|wild animals]]) and structures such as pens and bird cages. Yields of the gardens offer various uses, ranging from food stock which may supply a household's subsistence and income, to plants for ornamental uses. Along with their subsistence and commercial uses, they are used for social interactions and yield sharing and provides materials for cultural ceremonies and religious practices. Some pekarangans are made, maintained, and spatially arranged according to local values. Home gardens of this kind may have existed for several thousand years, but their first mention is found in a Javanese chronicle that was written in 860 AD. In 2010, around {{convert|103,000|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us}} of Indonesian land were used for gardens of this sort.\n\nThe sustainability and social roles of pekarangans have been threatened by fragmentation due to inheritance, urbanization, and the commercialization that began in the late 20th century. Smaller land dwellings, due to fragmentation and urbanization, cause their size and plant diversity to decrease. Deliberate reduction of plant diversity was also implemented to optimize yields. Problems such as pest outbreaks and a rise in household debts have appeared due to the degraded sustainability of the gardens.\n\n[[History of Indonesia|Throughout the history of Java]], pekarangans have been of little interest to the governments that have ruled the island due to their minimal susceptibility to yield extraction. In the 2010s, they have gained the attention of the Indonesian government implemented through P2KP (''Percepatan Penganekaragaman Konsumsi Pangan''), a program focused on urban and peri-urban areas that aims to optimize production with a sustainable approach.\n\n== Definition ==\nIn the [[Indonesian language]], ''pekarangan'' can be translated as \"land that surrounds a house\", \"a house's yard\", or \"plotted land for house construction\".{{sfn | KBBI}} However, the term itself is widely used in scientific literature, specifically in agroforestry and environmental topics, in the context of \"home gardens\".{{sfn | Kaswanto | Nakagoshi | 2014 | p=290}}The word ''pekarangan'' may be derived from ''karang'', which, according to G.J.A. Terra, means \"perennial crops\".{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini | 2016 | p=15}} \n\nScholars offer various definitions of the term \"pekarangan\". According to Sajogyo, it is a plot adjacent to a house, used part-time. Totok Mardikanto and Sri Sutami defined it as a plot surrounding a house; most of its kind are fenced, and usually planted with dense plants with various annual and perennial plants for daily and commercial use. Meanwhile, Hartono ''et al.'' defined it as a plot of land with clear boundaries, with a house built above it; various functional relations, consisted of economical, biophysical, social, and cultural relations, between it and its owner are made. Euis Novitasari considered \"pekarangan\" to be a form of land use: a system of small-scale additional food production by members and a family, that is also an [[ecosystem]] with plants of various height. Further, she described it as having a clear boundary and has various elements including the owner's house, a kitchen, a pen, and fences. Simatupang and Suryana argued that it is hard to define \"pekarangan\" clearly, due to its role both as extended use of farmlands and as a homestead.{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini | 2016 | p=15}}\n\n== Elements ==\n=== Plants ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| width = 150\n| image1 = Annona muricata 1.jpg\n| alt1 = Soursop\n| image2 = Leucaena leucocephala.jpg\n| alt2 = White leadtree\n| footer = [[Soursop]] and [[white leadtree]], some of the plants that are specifically planted in rural pekarangans{{sfn|Arifin|Sakamoto|Chiba|1998|p=99}}\n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n[[File:West Sumatran brick house and home garden with orange.jpg|thumb|Orange trees (front) and banana plants (back) in a pekarangan]]\nA pekarangan generally consists of [[Annual plant|annual]] and [[perennial plant]]s combined; they can be harvested daily or seasonally.{{sfn|Abdoellah|Parikesit|Gunawan|Hadikusumah|2001|p=140}} Some perennials such as ''melinjo'' (''[[Gnetum gnemon]]'') produce leaves consistently. Some other perennials such as [[coconut]], [[jackfruit]], [[banana]], and [[salak]] produce fruit all year round. Other perennials' fruiting periods are limited. As examples, the semarang [[guava]] (''[[Syzygium aqueum]]'') fruits during April\u2013June, mangoes fruit during July\u2013August, and [[Durian|durians]] (''[[Durio zibethinus]]'') during June\u2013September.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Soemarwato|Karyono|Soekartadiredja|1985|p=3}} According to Christanty, perennials in such home gardens are more dominant in regions where [[Paddy field|rice fields]] use more than 40 percent of the region's area, while annual plants dominate in other areas.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=143}} Perennials also dominate in gardens where labor is inadequate.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=143}} Such home gardens are also identifiable by trees, one of their most common components; their abundance contributes to the image of Indonesian countrysides&nbsp;\u2013&#32;instead of houses, they are identified by their \"dense, forest mimics\".{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=101}}\n\nIn [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] pekarangans, ornamental plants, and crops such as [[Clove|cloves]], [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], and [[Mango|mangoes]] are frequently planted in the front patch, as these are valuable plants that homeowners want to keep an eye on. Starchy crops, medicinal plants, and [[Cash crop|cash crops]] are more frequent in the front and back plots, and less in the side plots. Coffee might be used as a [[hedge]] in the side and back yards; ornamental plants might have a similar function in front yards. Vegetables are habitually grown in front and side areas to be exposed to light, as tall trees are rare in those areas. Trees with large canopies might be planted in front yards, providing shade for children. The back plots of the Sundanese gardens might be planted with coconuts, fruit trees, and tall trees whose woods are used for construction. Those are planted in back gardens to avoid damage to the house when any of them falls due to a storm. Most plants propagate without intentional human intervention\u2014this natural process is called ''janteun ku anjeun'' in Sundanese\u2014due to seed scattering by birds, mammals, or humans after they eat. Because of this, no clear spatial arrangement is found in Sundanese back gardens.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}}\n\nPlants in Javanese and Sundanese pekarangans, among them annual plants cultivated in the dry season (e.g. [[eggplant]]s), are habitually grown near water sources such as fish ponds, open sewage ditches, and wells.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=3}}{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}} Plants that need high levels of nutrients, such as banana, mango, jackfruit, and other fruit plants, are planted close to garbage dumps, called ''jarian'' in Sundanese.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}} Meanwhile, crops frequently harvested for cooking, such as [[Chili pepper|chili peppers]], [[langua]], [[lemongrass]], and [[tomato]]es, are planted near the kitchen.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}}{{sfn|Torquebiau|1992|p=193}}\n\n=== Animals ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Geitenhok ingericht voor de mestverzameling voor de groententuin Sindanglaja TMnr 10013517.jpg|thumb|left|A household's goat pen in the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]]|alt=]]\n\nSome owners of pekarangans keep livestock and poultry (traditionally chickens, goats, and [[sheep]]), usually in a household pen. These are usually allowed to roam around the gardens, village areas, and traditional markets to find food on their own. They are penned at night and are usually given additional feed. Other common domestic animals kept in pekarangans are fishes in ponds and [[songbird]]s (e.g. [[zebra dove]], ''Geopelia striata''), which are kept in cages on bamboo poles. The economic status of pekarangan owners plays a role in livestock ownership; lower-class owners tend to own several chickens whereas middle-class owners might have a goat or a sheep, and high-class owners may own several cows or [[water buffalo]]es. Livestock manure acts as an organic fertilizer for the gardens via [[compost]]ing, and sometimes a nutritional source for pond fishes.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=105}}{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=2}}\n[[File:Domestic goat in Agam, West Sumatra.jpg|thumb|Some Indonesians keep farm animals, such as goats, in their pekarangans.]]\nProductive fish ponds are common in Sundanese traditional pekarangans.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=105}} The fishes are fed with [[Food waste|kitchen waste]] supplemented by animal and human waste. Villagers avoid the domestic use of fish pond water and instead use water from higher-ground water pipes.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=2}}\n\nThe gardens may have a high diversity of [[soil fauna]]. According to Widyastuti, the soil fauna diversity in the gardens is suggested to be higher than that of [[teak]] forests.{{sfn|Widyastuti|2011|p=1}} The diversity might be caused by the vegetation, which protects soil fauna from direct sunshine, especially in the dry season.{{sfn|Widyastuti|2011|p=5}} [[Otto Soemarwoto]] and [[Gordon Conway]] accounted that the gardens are also believed to be \"a good habitat\" for [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=102}}\n\nThere are different findings in relation to wild birds. A high diversity of birds, including legally protected species, within the gardens were recorded in a West Java research while another study in [[Jambi]] suggests individual pekarangans are not effective as a means to conserve bird communities. This is because of the [[edge effects]] of their irregular shapes, their frequent disturbance, and their proximity to roads and houses. The pekarangans used for the Jambi study had unusually low levels of plant diversity, which may account for the results. Despite this, the gardens apparently still attract birds due to their food resources.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=102}}{{sfn|Prabowo|Darras|Clough|Toledo-Hernandez|2016|p=13}} A similar finding was repeated in a separate West Java study, indicating children shoot birds in the gardens and take their eggs while adults kill or chase them due to the perception of them as pests.{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=154}}\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Kebun belakang rumah - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Canopy structure of a rural pekarangan|alt=]]\n\nPlant diversity in pekarangans arises from complex interactions between several factors that are not fully understood.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=300}} These include environmental stability, the [[tropical climate]] that is favorable to plant growth, and their close proximity to the owners' domestic activities.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=103}} Other natural factors are size, temperature decrease due to elevation, [[precipitation]], and climatic events like [[El Ni\u00f1o]].{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007 |pp=300\u2013302}} Anthropological factors include individual preferences and market proximity.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|pp=300, 303}}\n\nThe diversity of plants aids individual plants to adapt to a changing environment, helping them survive in the long term. {{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=299}} The biodiversity in the multi-layered system also helps to optimize solar energy and carbon harvesting, cool the domestic climate, protect the soil from erosion, and accommodate habitats for wild plants and animals.{{sfn|Arifin|2013|p=18}}{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=299}} The [[Genetics|genetic]] diversity also gives protection from the effects of pests and diseases.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=108}} As an example, the abundance of [[insectivorous]] birds in the gardens helps control pests,{{sfn|Torquebiau|1992|p=195}} helping the garden remain productive.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=299}}\n\nWhile on per individual basis pekarangans store only small amounts of carbon due to their size, on per area basis they hold an amount of carbon that is similar to primary or secondary forests, and greatly surpassing ''[[Imperata]]'' grasslands and [[fallow land]]s.{{sfn|Roshetko|Delaney|Hairiah|Purnomosidhi|2002|p=146}}\n\n=== Natural factors ===\nPlant diversity in pekarangans tends to increase as their size increases.{{sfn|Arifin|Sakamoto|Chiba|1996|pp=492\u2013493}} Diversity of crop species, however, might reach a plateau in very large gardens. Larger pekarangans have a lower density of crop species because of more constant cultivation patterns.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Maass|2006|p=351}} A pekarangan smaller than {{convert|100|m2|sqft|sp=us}} is insufficient for plant diversity and crop production.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=313}} Some plant types, such as trees higher than 10 meters (33 ft), [[Spice|spice plants]], and [[industrial crop]]s are almost not present in gardens of {{convert|100|m2|sqft|sp=us}} or less.{{sfn|Arifin|Sakamoto|Chiba|1996|pp=492\u2013493}} Home gardens in Java tend to be smaller; the majority of them are smaller than {{convert|200|m2|sqft|sp=us|abbr=}}, as suggested by a report from 2004. Meanwhile, similar gardens in other Indonesian islands tend to be larger. Their average size is estimated to be {{convert|2500|m2|sqft|sp=us|abbr=}}; a few reach the size of {{convert|3|ha|sqft|sp=us|abbr=}}.{{sfn|Mitchell|Hanstad|2004|p=3}}\n\nPekarangans at high [[altitude]]s tend to have a smaller size, increased density of plants, and a smaller range of plant diversity. As altitude increases, temperature decreases, limiting plant diversity. Coconuts and fruit trees tend to develop better in lower-altitude pekarangans while vegetables tend to grow better at higher altitudes.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | pp=102\u2013103}}{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=300}}\n\nPekarangans with better access to water\u2014either by climate or by proximity to water resources\u2014are able to facilitate annual crop cultivation.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=107}} Those in West Java, when observed, perform better in accommodating plant diversity when the wet season occurs than in the dry season.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|pp=300\u2013301}} The climatic conditions of Java enable the consistent growth of annual plants in its pekarangans, even in parts of [[East Java]] where the climate is drier.{{sfn|Soemarwoto| Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja |1985|p=195}}\n\n[[Canopy (biology)|Canopy]] in those gardens functions as a protection from intense raindrops. Most of their plants' heights are less than a meter, slowing down raindrops when they hit the soil.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=108}}{{sfn|Torquebiau|1992|p=193}} Leaf litter also helps protecting the soil against erosion. The role of plant canopies in consistently producing organic litter is believed to be more important in reducing erosion than its direct speed-reducing effects on raindrops. Nevertheless, gardens are less effective than natural forests in erosion reduction.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | pp=108\u2013109}}{{sfn|Torquebiau|1992|p=193}}\n\n=== Human impact ===\nHarvesting of rice\u2014the dominant staple of Indonesia\u2014influence the use of pekarangans in some ways. Production in the gardens decreases during rice-harvesting seasons but peaks during the rest of the year.{{sfn|Gliessman|1990|p=163}} Lower-class villagers benefit from the consistent productivity of starch crops in the gardens, especially in a period of food shortage pre-rice harvest or after a failed rice harvest by drought, known as ''paceklik.''{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=3}}{{sfn | Christanty | Abdoellah | Marten | Iskandar | 1986 | p=152}}\n\nSettlement dynamics affect pekarangans in various ways. Expansion of settlements to new lands, caused by population growth, is the cause of the wide presence of food crops in newly-made pekarangans.{{sfn|Wiersum|2006|p=21}} People who resettled via the [[transmigration program|Indonesian transmigration program]] might support plant diversity in the gardens in the places they migrate to. Plant species brought by internal migrants need to adapt well to the local environment.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=304}}\n\nCommercialization, fragmentation, and urbanization are major hazards to pekarangans' plant diversity. These change the organic cycles within the gardens, threatening their ecological sustainability.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=313}} Commercialization requires a systemic change of crop planting. To optimize and produce more crops, a pekarangan's owner must specialize in its crops, making a small number of crops dominate the garden. Some owners turn them into [[monoculture]] gardens.{{sfn|Abdoellah|Parikesit|Gunawan|Hadikusumah|2001|p=142}} Fragmentation stems from the traditional system of inheritance.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=313}} Consequences from the reduction of plant diversity include the loss of canopy structures and organic litter, resulting in less protection of the gardens' soil; loss of pest-control agents, increasing the use of pesticides; loss of production stability; loss of nutrients' diversity; and the disappearance of yields-sharing culture.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|pp=110\u2013111}} Despite urbanization's negative effect in reducing their plant diversity, it increases that of the [[ornamental plant]]s.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Arifin|Maass|2007|p=312}}\n\nA case study of home gardens in [[Bada Valley|Napu Valley]], [[Central Sulawesi]], shows that the decrease in soil protection is caused by insufficient soil fertility management, regular [[Weed control|weeding]] and waste burning, dumping waste in garbage pits instead of using it for compost, and spread of inorganic waste.{{sfn|Kehlenbeck|Maass|2006|p=349}} The decrease of soil fertility worsens the decrease of crop diversity in the gardens.{{sfn|Wiersum|2006|p=19}}\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Pasar buah lokal.jpg|thumb|left|A fruit stall in an Indonesian traditional market]]\n\n=== Subsistence ===\nProducts from pekarangans have multiple uses; for example, a coconut tree can provide food, oil, fuel, and building materials, and also be used in rituals and ceremonies.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=106}} The gardens' plants are known for their products' nutritional benefits and diversity. While rice is low in vitamins [[Vitamin A|A]] and [[Vitamin C|C]], products from the gardens offer an abundance of them. Pekarangans with more perennial crops tend to create more [[carbohydrate]]s and [[protein]]s, and those with more annual plants tend to create more portions of vitamin A.{{sfn|Torquebiau|1992|p=199}}{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=3}} Pekarangans also act as a source of firewood and building materials.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=106}}{{sfn|Abdoellah|Parikesit|Gunawan|Hadikusumah|2001|p=141}}\n\nLower-class families tend to consume more [[Leaf vegetable|leafy vegetables]] than the upper-class ones, due to their consistent availability and low price.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=3}} Low-class families also favor bigger use of fuel sources from the gardens.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=106}} Pekarangans in villages act as [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence]] systems for families rather than an income source. In areas such as [[Gunung Kidul Regency|Gunung Kidul]], food-producing uses of the gardens are more dominant than crop fields due to soil erosion in these regions.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=106}}\n\n=== Commercial ===\n[[File:Picking chili peppers from home garden, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|A child picks [[chili pepper]]s in a pekarangan.]]\nIn urban and suburban areas, major fruit production centers, and tourist destination regions, pekarangans tend to act as an income generator. Income from the gardens is mostly from perennial crops.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=105}} Good market access stimulates the cultivation of commercial crops within the gardens.{{sfn | Wiersum | 2006 | p=19}} Other factors that influence their economic significance are their area and the demand for a particular crop.{{sfn|Abdoellah|Parikesit|Gunawan|Hadikusumah|2001|p=141}}\n\nAccording to a 1991 article, the poor cultivate subsistence plants in their pekarangans with an emphasis on fruits and vegetables, while the rich tend to plant more ornamental plants and cash crops with higher economic value.{{sfn | Yamamoto | Kubota | Ogo | Priyono | 1991 | p=110}} An article from 2006 also concludes that the importance of commercial plants increases with owners' wealth.{{sfn | Wiersum | 2006 | p=19}} A study in [[Sriharjo (village)|Sriharjo]], [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta Special Region]], concludes that poorer pekarangan owners orient toward commercial uses while richer owners orient toward subsistence uses.{{sfn|Dove|1990|p=157}} [[Ann Stoler]] argued that as a rural family acquire more area of rice field, garden use becomes less intense, up until the family-owned rice field reach around {{convert|2000|sqm|sqft|sp=us|abbr=}}, the minimal size typically needed to feed one family. Past this point, garden use starts to increase.{{sfn|Stoler|1978|p=95}}\n\n=== Other uses ===\nThe ''buruan'' (Sundanese for \"front yard\"), part of a Sundanese pekarangan, is used as a children's playground and adults' gathering place.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=107}} Integrated with local customs and philosophies such as ''rukun'' and ''tri-hita-karana'', the gardens aid other social interactions such as yield-sharing, ceremonies, and religious activities.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=109}}{{sfn|Arifin|2013|pp=15\u201316}} Especially in urban areas, pekarangans also function as aesthetic ornaments of a house, mainly the front yard.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=107}}\n\n== Sociology and economy ==\nPekarangans are mainly developed by women. Forms of such gardens in matriarchal tribes and societies, e.g. [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Acehnese people|Aceh]], and communities in the 1960s Central Java, are more developed than in tribes that tend to be patriarchal, e.g. [[Batak]]. For the same reason, matriarchal culture around the gardens started to develop, such as the requirement for the permission of a landowner's wife before selling a plot of land they own&nbsp;\u2013&#32;this happens in cities like [[Tegal (city)|Tegal]].{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | pp=100\u2013101}} A female-led household would orient their use of the gardens toward household needs.{{sfn | Wiersum | 2006 | p=19}} In Madura, however, home gardens are described as the domain of men.{{sfn | Febrianto | Wulandari | Santosa | 2017 | p=60}} Nevertheless, a pekarangan in general, regardless of the culture, is considered a responsibility of the entire family, including their offspring and the offspring's families.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | pp=109\u2013110}} The men prepare the land prior to home garden use, plant tree crops, and sell the garden's crops, while women plant annual crops.{{sfn | Mitchell | Hanstad | 2004 | p=11}}\n\nIn a 2004 report, Javanese pekarangans are suggested to have higher net income-per-area than rice fields. The same report argued that the cost of the Javanese gardens' production is lower than that of rice fields.{{sfn|Mitchell|Hanstad|2004|p=29}} People who focus on the gardens' production instead of rice fields may gain better yields than their counterparts.{{sfn|Torquebiau|1992|p=197}} Poor villagers, however, tend not to concentrate efforts toward the gardens; maintenance of the gardens as a sole income source would require the use of high-risk, high-reward crops, more intensive care, and income would be vulnerable to market fluctuations. Maintenance of diverse cash crops is more intense than that of rice fields and the intensity would make the villagers' gardening schedule less adaptable to rice farming activities.{{sfn|Stoler|1978|p=99}}\n\nIn some cases, people are allowed to build houses in the pekarangans of others in exchange for doing work for their owners. The gardens, however, tend to have a low demand for labor, offering minimal labor opportunities.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=110}}\n\n== Culture ==\n[[file:Proses Pembuatan Gunungan di Keraton Yogyakarta.jpg|thumb|A ''[[gunungan]]'' made of food for [[Sekaten]], a Javanese celebration for ''Mawlid''|alt=|left]]\n\nThe philosophy of living harmoniously, referred to as ''rukun'', is followed by the Javanese and Sundanese; offering yields from pekarangans to others is believed to be the medium of such culture. This can be done by offering its products to their neighbors, for example during events such as births, deaths, weddings, and cultural events like the [[Javanese calendar|Javanese new year]] and the [[Mawlid]] (observance of the birthday of [[Muhammad]]). Some offer their products to cure diseases or to protect owners from dangers. Their products are also given during daily life, especially in rural areas. A rural pekarangan owner usually allows others to enter it for any practical reason: taking dead wood for fuel, pulling water from a well for their own use, or even taking its crops. Such permission towards others might be restricted or denied if the owner has only a limited yield for his or her own consumption. In general, rural pekarangan owners never deny others' requests to take products from the gardens for religious or medicinal purposes. Some people believe asking permission to take medicinal plants in a pekarangan is a taboo, thus allowing their theft.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=109}}\n\nJavanese culture interpreted the gardens as ''pepek ing karang''&nbsp;\u2013&#32;\"a complete design\".{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=103}} It can also be interpreted as ''pepek teng karangan'', which, according to the anthropologist Oekan Abdoellah is a way of thinking, indicating agricultural practices within the gardens are a consequence of thinking about the ways to use their produce and satisfy their needs from them.{{sfn | Christanty | Abdoellah | Marten | Iskandar | 1986 | p=138}} Javanese culture, however, takes offense at the gardens' comparison with forests due to the low social value of forest in the culture. ''[[Wayang]]'' puppet plays depict forests as \"places where wild animals and evil spirits reign\" and its clearing, which is done only by men who are believed to have spiritual powers, is viewed as a respectable deed.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=101}} The backyard of a Sundanese homestead is described as ''supados sungkur'' (to be unseen by others).{{sfn|Christanty|Abdoellah|Marten|Iskandar|1986|p=145}}\n\n[[Plant community|Associations of plants]] in Javanese pekarangans tend to be more complex than those in Sundanese pekarangans. In Javanese gardens, owners also tend to cultivate medicinal plants (''[[jamu]]'') while the Sundanese tend to grow vegetables and ornamental plants.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | p=102}}\n\nThe [[Sundanese language]] has names for each part of a pekarangan. The front yard is called ''buruan'', a space for a garden shed, ornamental plants, fruit trees, a children's playground, benches, and crop-drying. The side yard (''pipir'') is used for wood trees, crops, medicinal herbs, a fish pond, well, and a bathroom. The side yard is also a space for cloth-dying. The back yard (''kebon'') is used to cultivate vegetable plants, spice plants, an animal pent, and industrial plants. {{sfn|Arifin|2013|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nPekarangans in [[Lampung]] have their own elements; alongside plants are feet-washing places used before entering into a house's veranda (''gakhang hadap''{{sfn|Rostiyati|2013|p=464}}), a rice-storage room (''walai''{{sfn|Depdikbud|1993|p=79}}), an outdoor kitchenette or kitchen, a firewood-storage place, and livestock barn.{{sfn|Pratiwi|Gunawan|2017|p=5}} The front yard is called ''tengahbah/terambah/beruan'', the side yard is ''kebik/kakebik'', and the back yard is ''kudan/juyu/kebon''.{{sfn|Pratiwi|Gunawan|2017|p=7}}\n\n[[File:Balinese house compound.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[Balinese traditional house|Balinese dwelling]]. Included: ''sanggah'' areas on the top corner and the left corner, and ''natah,'' the outdoor area in the center. The ''bale daja'' is to the left of ''natah'' in the picture's orientation''.''|alt=]]\n\nBalinese pekarangans are influenced by the philosophy of ''[[Tri Hita Karana|tri-hita-karana]]'' that divides spaces into ''parahyangan'' (top, head, pure), ''pawongan'' (middle, body, neutral), and ''palemahan'' (below, feet, impure). The ''parahyangan'' area of a Balinese pekarangan faces [[Mount Agung]], which is regarded as a sacred place (''prajan'') to pray (''sanggah''). Plants with flowers and leaves that are regularly picked and used for [[Balinese Hinduism]] liturgical purposes are planted in the ''parahyangan'' area. The ''pawongan'' area is planted with regular flowers, fruits, and leaves. The ''palemahan'' area is planted with fruits, stems, leaves, and tubers.{{sfn|Arifin|2013|pp=15\u201316}} Balinese back yards, which are known in [[Tabanan Regency|Tabanan]] and [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]] as ''teba'', are used as a place to cultivate crops and keep livestock for subsistence, commercial, and religious use as offerings.{{sfn|Arifin|2013|p=17}} The Balinese further developed beliefs about what plants should and should not be planted in various parts of their pekarangans, following the teachings from the ''[[Taru Premana]]'' manuscript. As an example, [[nerium]] and [[bougainvillea]] are believed to emit positive [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] while planted in the ''parahyangan/sanggah'' area of a pekarangan while negative auras are believed to appear if they are planted in front of the ''[[bale daja]]'', a building specifically placed in the north part of a dwelling.{{sfn|''Bali Express''|2018}}{{sfn|Saraswati|2009|p=35}}\n\n''Taneyan'', a [[Madura|Madurese]] kind of pekarangan, is used to dry crops and for traditional rituals and family ceremonies.{{sfn|Maningtyas|Gunawan|2017|p=3}}{{sfn|Febrianto|Wulandari|Santosa|2017|p=59}} ''Taneyan'' is a part of the traditional dwelling system of ''[[taneyan lanjhang]] \u2013'' a multiple-family household'','' whose spatial composition is laid out according to the ''[[bappa, babbhu, guru, rato]]'' (father, mother, teacher, leader) philosophy that shows the order of respected figures in the Madurese culture.{{sfn|Maningtyas|Gunawan|2017|p=3}}\n\n== History and development ==\n{{Quote frame|In the first establishment or formation of a village or new ground, the intended settlers take care to provide themselves with sufficient garden ground round their huts for stock and to supply the ordinary wants of their families. The produce of this plantation is the exclusive property of the peasant, and exempted from contribution or burden, and such is their number and extent in some regencies (as in [[Kedu Residency|''Ked\u00fa'']] for instance), that they constitute perhaps a tenth part of the area of the whole district. The spot surrounding his simple habitation, the cottager considers his peculiar patrimony and cultivates with peculiar care. He labours to plant and rear in it those vegetables that may be most useful to his family and those shrubs and trees which may at once yield him their fruit and their shade; nor does he waste his efforts on a thankless soil. The cottages, or the assemblage of huts, that compose the village, become thus completely screened from the rays of a scorching sun, and are so buried amid the foliage of a luxuriant vegetation, that at a small distance no appearance of a human dwelling can be discovered, and the residence of a numerous society appears only a verdant grove or a clump of evergreens. Nothing can exceed the beauty or the interest, which such detached mass of verdure, scattered over the face of the country, and indicating each the abode of a collection of happy peasantry, add to scenery otherwise rich, whether viewed on the sides of the mountains, in the narrow vales, or in the extensive plains.|[[Stamford Raffles]]|[[The History of Java]]|1817.{{sfn | Raffles | 1817 | pp=81\u201382}} <br>{{resize|85%|Parts of the quote were also quoted by [[Ann Stoler]] in ''Garden Use and Household Economy in Rural Java'', 1978{{sfn|Stoler|1978|p=85}}}}}}\n\n{| style=\"float: right; margin:0.5em 0.5em\"; class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"5\" |Distribution of pekarangan areas in Java\n|-\n!Province\n!<100m<sup>2</sup>\n!100m<sup>2</sup>-200m<sup>2</sup>\n!200m<sup>2</sup>-300m<sup>2</sup>\n!>300m<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n|[[West Java]]-[[Banten]]\n|52.29%\n|25.00%\n|8.77%\n|8.95%\n|-\n|[[Central Java]]\n|27.50%\n|27.57%\n|13.20%\n|31.73%\n|-\n|[[East Java]]\n|34.52%\n|25.83%\n|13.33%\n|31.73%\n|-\n|[[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Special Region<br />of Yogyakarta]]\n|33.51%\n|17.48%\n|14.61%\n|34.40%\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |Source: Arifin, Kaswanto & Nakagoshi 2014{{sfn|Arifin|Kaswanto|p=131|Nakagoshi|2014}}\n|}\nBy 1902, pekarangans occupied {{Convert|378,000|ha|sqmi}} of land in Java, and the area increased to {{Convert|1,417,000|ha|sqmi}} in 1937 and {{Convert|1,612,568|ha|sqmi}} in 1986.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=101}} In 2000, they occupied  about {{Convert|1,736,000|ha|sqmi}}.{{sfn|Arifin|Kaswanto|p=130|Nakagoshi|2014}} Indonesia as a whole had {{Convert|5,132,000|ha|sqmi}} of such gardens.{{sfn|Arifin|Kaswanto|p=130|Nakagoshi|2014}} The number peaked at about {{Convert|10,300,000|ha|sqmi}} in 2010.{{sfn|Arifin|2013|p=2}}\n\nCentral Java is considered the pekarangans' center of origin, according to Oekan Abdoellah et al.; the gardens later spread to East Java in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Abdoellah|Parikesit|Gunawan|Hadikusumah|2001|p=140}}{{sfn|Arifin|Sakamoto|Chiba|1998|p=94}} Soemarwoto and Conway propsed that early forms of pekarangan date back to several thousand years ago but the first-known record of them is a Javanese charter from 860.{{sfn|Soemarwoto|Conway|1992|p=100}} During the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial era]], pekarangans were referred to as ''erfcultuur''.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Soemarwato | Karyono | Soekartadiredja | 1985 | p=44}} In the eighteenth century, Javanese pekarangans had already so influenced West Java that they had partly replaced ''talun'' (a local form of mixed gardens) there.{{sfn|Wiersum|2006|p=17}} Since pekarangans contain many species, which mature at different times throughout the year, it has been difficult for governments throughout [[History of Indonesia|Javanese history]] to tax them systematically. In 1990, this difficulty caused the Indonesian government to forbid the reduction of rice fields in favor of pekarangans. Such difficulty might have helped the gardens to become more complex over time. Despite that, past governments still tried to tax the gardens.{{sfn | Dove | 1990 | pp=159\u2013160}}\n\n=== Effects of economic and population growth in the late 20th century ===\nSince the 1970s, Indonesia had observed economic growth rooted in the Indonesian government's five-year development plans ([[Five-Years Development Program (Indonesian program)|Repelita]]), which were launched in 1969. The economic growth helped increase the numbers of middle-class and upper-class families, resulting in better life and higher demand for quality products, including fruits and vegetables. Pekarangans in urban, suburban, and main fruit production areas adapted its efforts to increase their products' quality but this resulted in a reduction of biological diversity in the gardens, leading to an increased vulnerability to pests and plant diseases. Some disease outbreaks in commercial pekarangans occurred in the 1980s and the 1990s, such as the [[citrus greening disease]] that damaged many mandarin orange trees and the spread of the pathogenic fungi ''[[Phyllosticta]]'', which affected almost 20% of clove trees in West Java. This vulnerability also affected their owners' economic and social conditions; owners became more susceptible to debt, the sharing culture in traditional commercial pekarangans vanished, and the poor enjoyed fewer rights from them.{{sfn | Soemarwoto | Conway | 1992 | pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n=== Government programs ===\n[[file:Sby-pacitan-2-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], the sixth president of Indonesia, speaking in front of Kayen Village Seed Garden, a part of KRPL prototypes in Pacitan]]\n\nThe Indonesian government launched a campaign in October 1951, namely ''Karang Kitri'', which aimed to persuade communities to plant trees in their home gardens and other types of land. There was no incentive given in the campaign. The campaign ended in 1960.{{sfn | Nawir | Murniati | Rumboko | 2007 | p=87}} Use of pekarangans was included in a program by the Indonesian government in 1991 under a program called Diversifikasi Pangan dan Gizi (\"Food and Nutrition Diversification\").{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini |2016| p=16}} Despite that, as of 2001, \"the government [had not] paid attention\" to recommendations to include them in national strategies.{{sfn|IPGRI|2001|p=162}}\n\nSince the early 2010s, the government, through the [[Ministry of Agriculture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Agriculture]], runs a pekarangan development program named ''Percepatan Penganekaragaman Konsumsi Pangan'' (P2KP, \"Acceleration on Food Diversification\") that is focused in urban and semi-urban areas. The program applies its agenda to a concept named ''Kawasan Rumah Pangan Lestari'' (KRPL; \"Sustainable Food Houses Region\"{{sfn | Saptana | Sunarsih | Friyatno |2013| p=67}}).{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini |2016| p=17}} P2KP was begun under the Indonesian Presidential Regulation No. 22 Year 2009. There is also an urban women-focused program named ''[[Women Movement for Pekarangan Optimization|Gerakan Perempuan untuk Optimalisasi Pekarangan]]'' (GPOP; \"Women's Movement for Pekarangan Optimization\").{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini |2016| p=17}}\n\nIn addition to the national programs, some regions of Indonesia have implemented their own pekarangan use programs. The government of East Java launched a program called ''Rumah Hijau'' (\"Green House\") in 2010. The provincial government later collaborated with the Ministry of Agriculture to improve upon the ''Rumah Hijau'' program based on KRPL prototypes in [[Pacitan]], making a new program named ''Rumah Hijau Plus-Plus''.{{sfn | Ashari | Saptana | Purwantini |2016| p=17}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== Works cited ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n<div style=\"text-indent: -2em;

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at [[Cambridge University]], and became President of the [[Footlights]] club, touring internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s and was a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for over 50 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.<ref>[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010</ref> His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read Economics and Politics before changing to read Law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'' was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run, that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and the revue transferred to the  [[West End of London|West End]] in London, before being taken to both New Zealand and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> He was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' which he performed in and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.  Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the television series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E. L. Wisty]]. Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary [[right-wing]] [[City of London|City]] gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> The \"[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]\" sketch was co-written by the four writers and performers of the series.<ref name=\"BrightRoss2001\">{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}</ref> The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''. The sketch has since become well-known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.}\n\nAlso in 1968, Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD entitled ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]]; however, the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with Garden (and Oddie joining the for the second series).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", the show was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\", whilst in ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' he took part in the sketches \"Top of the Form\" (with Cleese, Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and \"Cha Cha Cha\" (with Cleese and Chapman). Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform \"Funky Gibbon\". Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue'', which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGarden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in typical game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]].

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at [[Cambridge University]], and became President of the [[Footlights]] club, touring internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He had also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and had been a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for over 50 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.<ref>[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010</ref> His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read Economics and Politics before changing to read Law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'' was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run, that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and the revue transferred to the  [[West End of London|West End]] in London, before being taken to both New Zealand and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> He was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' which he performed in and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.  Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the television series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E.

Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary [[right-wing]] [[City of London|City]] gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> The \"[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]\" sketch was co-written by the four writers and performers of the series.<ref name=\"BrightRoss2001\">{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}</ref> The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''. The sketch has since become well-known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.}\n\nAlso in 1968, Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD entitled ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]]; however, the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with Garden (and Oddie joining the for the second series).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", the show was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\", whilst in ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' he took part in the sketches \"Top of the Form\" (with Cleese, Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and \"Cha Cha Cha\" (with Cleese and Chapman). Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform \"Funky Gibbon\". Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue'', which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGarden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in typical game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''.
