It aired on December 13, 2010. It features guest star [[Alex Trebek]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2015}}\n[[Ted Mosby|Ted]] is outside a [[movie theater]] showing ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', waiting for the rest of the gang and carrying a [[gingerbread house]] as their [[Christmas]]-themed movie snack. [[Future Ted]] backtracks to two days before, when [[Marshall Eriksen|Marshall]] and [[Lily Aldrin|Lily]] eagerly await the results of her latest [[pregnancy test]]. The test is positive and they excitedly tell Ted, [[Barney Stinson|Barney]], and [[Robin Scherbatsky|Robin]] the news, but the doctor later says it is a false alarm and Future Ted tells the story of what happened during the past two days.\n\nPrior to the test, Ted and Punchy begin talking about Punchy's wedding. After hanging up, Ted argues with Robin about his ability to be an effective [[best man]], especially in the event that Punchy gets [[cold feet]]. Robin reveals that she [[audition]]ed as a \"currency rotation specialist\" (coin-flip [[bimbo]]) in the [[game show]] ''Million Dollar Heads or Tails'', hosted by [[Alex Trebek]]. Ted [[rebuke]]s her for bailing on her [[New Year's Resolution]] to be working for the World Wide News network by the end of the year. Robin admits that she applied for the network, but only an associate [[researcher]] position is available. When Marshall and Lily break the news of the pregnancy, Robin becomes aware of how her own life is stalling, and resolves to take the research position, but when they reveal the false positive, she changes her mind once more, deciding that she is content to be a \"coin-flip bimbo\".\n\nBarney, meanwhile, has received an end-of-year [[bonus payment|bonus]], which he intends to spend on luxuries for himself, including a suit with diamond [[pinstripe]]s. When he hears about the pregnancy, he realizes how unfulfilled his [[selfishness]] has left him, and decides to spend the money helping others. After buying the patrons of MacLaren's designer clothes, toys and [[condom]]s, and taking them to a [[strip club]], Barney goes to see Sam Gibbs, his brother's father and a minister, to make a donation to his church. He begins to write a check for $10,000 when he gets the news about the false positive, and adds a decimal point to turn it into $100, returning to his selfish ways and, indeed, buying his diamond-striped suit.\n\nImmediately after they discover and announce the [[pregnancy]] test's results, Marshall and Lily secretly begin to panic about how unprepared they are to raise a child, and scramble to complete pre-delivery remodelling of their apartment in one night. After an argument about playing music for the child, the couple see the doctor, who tells them Lily is not pregnant.\n\nMarshall and Lily meet up with the rest of the gang outside the theater and admit that they are relieved about the false positive. Since they are not ready for kids, they are considering getting a dog for now. When Robin and Barney agree with them, Ted angrily smashes the gingerbread house and orders everybody to reconsider their decisions, forcing Marshall and Lily to go straight back home to try to conceive, yelling to the \"criminals of New York\" about Barney's suit, effectively making him a walking target for theft, and ordering Robin to take the research job. When Punchy calls him, suffering the predicted cold feet, Ted angrily orders him to get married, solving that problem as well. After everyone leaves, he decides to watch ''It's a Wonderful Life'' alone.\n\nIn the end, Marshall and Lily continue trying to conceive, Barney returns the diamond suit, makes his intended cash donation to the ministry and also donates suits for jobless people to wear to interviews, and Robin begins [[Bad News (How I Met Your Mother)|her first day at World Wide News]]. Back at the apartment, Robin thanks Ted for his fit of rage and he accepts her offer to be the best man if she ever marries anyone else.\n\n== Critical response ==\n{{expand section|date=December 2015}}\nDonna Bowman of [[The A.V.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID\u201119. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

As a result of the war, the eastern third of Sweden was established as the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] within the Russian Empire.  Other notable effects were the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Swedish parliament]]'s adoption of a [[Instrument of Government (1809)|new constitution]] and the establishment of the [[House of Bernadotte]], the new [[Swedish Act of Succession|Swedish royal house]], in 1818.\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Chronology of battles and events of the Finnish War}}\n[[File:Alexander I of Russia by G.Dawe (1826, Peterhof).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Alexander I, Emperor of Russia]]\n[[File:Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gustav IV Adolf, King of Sweden]]\nAfter the Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] concluded the 1807 [[Treaty of Tilsit]] with [[Napoleon]], Alexander, in his letter on 24 September 1807 to the Swedish King [[Gustav IV Adolf]], informed the king that the peaceful relations between Russia and Sweden depended on Swedish agreement to abide by the limitations of the Treaty of Tilsit which in practice meant that Sweden would have been required to follow the [[Continental System]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=222}} The king, who viewed [[Napoleon]] as the [[Antichrist]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] as his ally against Napoleon's France, was apprehensive of the system's ruinous consequences for Sweden's maritime commerce.  He instead entered into negotiations with Britain in order to prepare a joint attack against [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]], whose Norwegian possessions he coveted.\n\nIn the meantime, the [[Royal Navy]] [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|attacked Copenhagen]] and the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u20131812)]] was declared. Referring to the treaties of 1780 and 1800, the emperor demanded that Gustav Adolf close the [[Baltic Sea]] to all foreign warships. Although he reiterated his demand on November 16, 1807, it took two months before the king responded that it was impossible to honor the previous arrangements as long as the French were in control of the major Baltic ports. King Gustav Adolf did this after securing an alliance with Britain on 8 February 1808. Meanwhile, on 30 December 1807 Russia announced that should Sweden not give a clear reply Russia would be forced to act.\n\nAlthough most Swedish officers were skeptical about their chances in fighting the larger and more experienced Russian army, Gustav Adolf had an unrealistic view of Sweden's ability to defend itself against Russia. In [[Saint Petersburg]], his stubbornness was viewed as a convenient pretext to occupy [[Finland]], thus pushing the Russo-Swedish frontier considerably to the west of the Russian capital and safeguarding it in case of any future hostilities between the two powers.\n\nThe situation was problematic for Sweden, since it once again faced both Denmark and Russia as potential enemies requiring the Swedes to split their forces.  The king had thought it impossible to defend Finland should the enemy attack during the winter and chose largely to ignore the repeated warnings of the Russian threat he received in early 1808. Most of the Swedish plans assumed that warfare would be impossible during winter, disregarding the lessons from recent wars. In addition, several new good roads had been built into Finland greatly reducing the earlier dependency on naval support for any large operation in Finland.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=223-225}}\n\nThe Swedish plan was to first passively defend and hold on to the fortifications in the southern coast of Finland, in which Sweden had strong garrisons, while the rest of the Swedish army retreated to the north. Then in the spring, counterattack simultaneously from north and south, when the Swedish army would have naval support and the Russian army would be spread over Finland and thus have long supply lines. The basic reason for the plan was to avoid major decisive battles. \n\nSome advocates existed for taking a more active approach immediately, namely Lieutenant Colonel Samuel M\u00f6ller (fi) who advocated for taking an immediate offensive and [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt]] who supported actively delaying the advancing enemies in co-operation with the garrisons in the southern coast. \n\nIn the end instructions which the new Swedish commander in Finland, General [[Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor]], received from the king were an unsuccessful and open-ended mixture of ideas from these very different plans.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=223-226}}\n\nRussia had gathered a wealth of information from Finland using spies and other sources.  The level of detail was so great that Russian maps of Finland were in many respects more accurate than their Swedish counterparts. The Russians used the services of General [[Georg Magnus Sprengtporten]] when forming their plans. Sprengtporten suggested going on to an offensive during the winter since Finland would be mostly isolated when seas were frozen. His ideas were further developed by General [[Jan Pieter van Suchtelen]] before General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden]] was appointed as the commander of the Russian army in Finland in December 1807.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=226-230}}\n\nThe plan involved using the series of fortifications built after 1790 as staging grounds for the Russian advances into Finland. In southern Finland, armies were to isolate the fortifications and first take control of the whole of southern Finland before advancing further to the north. Forces in [[Savonia (historical province)|Savolax]] (Finnish: ''Savo'') were to press hard against the Swedes and reach the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] towards [[Oulu|Ule\u00e5borg]] (Finnish: ''Oulu'') and [[Vaasa|Vasa]] (Finnish: ''Vaasa'') to cut off the retreat of the main body of the Swedish army.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=228-230}}\n\n== February \u2013 May 1808 ==\n[[File:The Finnish war map1.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, February 1808 at the outbreak of the war]]\nOn February 21, 1808, 24,000 Russian troops under [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoevden]] crossed the border in [[Ahvenkoski]] and took the town of [[Loviisa|Lovisa]] (Finnish: ''Loviisa'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/southern_towns_mark_war_of_finland_bicentennial/5823726|title=Southern Towns Mark War of Finland Bicentennial|author=|publisher=Yle News|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2017|language=}}</ref> Since Klingspor had not arrived, Lieutenant General [[Karl Nathanael af Klercker]] acted as Swedish commander in Finland. He was notified of the Russian invasion already on 21 February and since it was impossible to hold the predefined defense lines as the army had not yet fully assembled he ordered the army to assemble at [[H\u00e4meenlinna|Tavastehus]] (Finnish: ''H\u00e4meenlinna''). Before the engagement started Klingspor finally arrived on 2 March and assumed command. Instead of facing the Russians at Tavastehus he ordered the army to withdraw. In [[Savonia (historical province)|Savolax]] the Russians also forced the Swedes to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=234-235}} The king was quite unprepared for the attack, especially as war was not declared until April. About 21,000 Swedish troops were stationed in various fortresses in Finland, while the rest of his army was unable to leave southern Sweden for fear of Danish attack.\n\nThe Russian advance was swift. On the first day of the war they had captured the town of Lovisa and besieged the Swedish sea fortress of [[Svartholm fortress|Svartholm]]. [[Porvoo|Borg\u00e5]] (Finnish: ''Porvoo'') was captured on 24 February and [[Helsinki|Helsingfors]] (Finnish: ''Helsinki'') on 2 March. Abandoned Swedish fortifications on the [[Hang\u00f6 Peninsula]] (Finnish: ''Hanko'') were taken and manned on 21 March and on the same day the Russian army took [[Turku|\u00c5bo]] (Finnish: ''Turku'') while a small detachment was sent to [[\u00c5land]]. Before the end of March 1808 even [[Vaasa|Vasa]] was taken. In Savolax, Russians also advanced rapidly and took [[Kuopio]] on 16 March. Swedish forces had mostly just withdrawn before the advancing Russian often destroying usable materials. For example, the Swedish [[archipelago fleet]]'s ships that been docked in \u00c5bo (nearly 50 gun sloops) were torched to prevent their capture.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=234-235}}\n\nThe Swedish fortress of [[Svartholm fortress|Svartholm]], commanded by Major [[Carl Magnus Gripenberg]], was ill-prepared for a war. While the garrison was 700 men strong, only a third of the men had actually functioning weapons, while most of the fortress' guns had no carriages. The fortress had fallen into disrepair and lacked both adequate food and ammunition stores. Even the wells were found to be unusable. After starting the siege on 21 February, the Russians issued a surrender demand for the fort, but this was refused by the Swedes. The demand was repeated on 2 March but without success. After a meager Russian bombardment, Gripenberg agreed to negotiations on 10 March. The fortress surrendered to the Russians on 18 March after a siege that had lasted roughly a month, with just one man having been wounded in action.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=232,235-238}}\n\n[[Sveaborg]] (Finnish: ''Suomenlinna'') under Admiral [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]] had been well prepared for the war with a garrison of 6,000 men, over 700 cannons, and enough stores to last until the summer of 1808. Defenses were strong enough to prevent the Russians from trying to storm the fortress by surprise. Instead the Russians [[Siege of Sveaborg|laid siege against Sveaborg]]. The fortress surrendered on 6 May 1808 after prolonged negotiations with the Russians as the commanding officer [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]] and his council believed that resistance was futile. The Russians gained the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet intact as well as large stores of supplies and munitions.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=232-233,238-244}}\n\nThe Russians had advanced considerably but they had also gained the long and vulnerable coastline with it. After the sea would be clear of ice there would be nothing to prevent Swedish forces from landing troops on the shore. With the Royal Navy supporting the Swedish battle fleet there was little the Russian battle fleet could accomplish. Capture of the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet had resulted in a real advantage to the Russians since it allowed them to gain superiority in the narrow waters of the Finnish archipelago where large ships of the line could not operate. Even the powerful explosion at Sveaborg which destroyed several of the captured ships did little to change Russian superiority in the Finnish archipelago. The Russians utilized the guns from the burned ships, and from those which burned during the winter, and constructed several fortifications on the coast, both in Hang\u00f6 as well as along narrow passages leading to \u00c5bo.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=245-248}}\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map2.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, March - May 1808]]\nUnder Colonel [[Carl Johan Adlercreutz]] the Swedish army [[Battle of Siikajoki|counter-attacked at Siikajoki]] and began to halt the Russian offensive. Soon after at the [[Battle of Revolax]] (Finnish: ''Revonlahti''), the Swedish army under Colonel [[Johan Adam Cronstedt]] started an advance towards the south. These successes yielded a promotion to Field Marshal for [[Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor]]. The Swedish advance was very slow however, as operations were often halted due to the thaw. An exception was the brigade under Colonel [[Johan August Sandels]], which swiftly advanced towards [[Kuopio]]. [[Nikolay Tuchkov]], a Russian general who was dispatched to the north of Finland, left garrisons in every fort along his way. This reduced his unit to 4,000 troops, which proved insufficient to pacify the hostile country. The Finns rose up in guerrilla fighting as far east as Frederikshamn (Finnish: ''[[Hamina]]'') within the [[Old Finland]] province of Russia.\n\nIn May, the Russians suffered further setbacks when they were driven from [[Gotland]] and \u00c5land, where a Swedish [[flotilla]], supported by the local population, compelled the small Russian force left on the main island of [[Fasta \u00c5land]] to surrender, and then invaded the island of [[Kumlinge]] where the bulk of the Russian garrison on the [[\u00c5land Islands]] was based. After a two-hour-long battle, the local militia, together with the Swedish landing force, overwhelmed their enemies and Colonel Vuich and his garrison were compelled to surrender. \n\nOn May 26, a British fleet carrying 14,000 troops under [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]] entered the [[port of Gothenburg]]. Due to various disagreements with the Swedish king, however, they never landed and sailed off to fight the French in [[Spain]] after leaving 16 battleships and 20 other ships at Sweden's disposal.\n\n== June \u2013 July 1808 ==\nThe Swedish battlefleet which had been expelling Russians from [[Gotland]] was ordered to blockade the [[Hang\u00f6 Peninsula]] and reached the cape on 10 June. Due to bad weather and poor visibility the fleet under [[Rudolf Cederstr\u00f6m|Admiral Rudolph Cederstr\u00f6m]] chose to stay relatively far from the coast. Upon approaching the coast on 21 June, Cederstr\u00f6m learned that the Russians had already passed the cape some time earlier. Attempts to stop the Russians deeper in the archipelago were also unsuccessful. Failure to block the Russians led the king to relieve Cederstr\u00f6m of his duties and replace him with Commander Henrik Johan Nauckhoff.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=256-258}}\n\nMajor General Eberhard Ernst von Vegesack was chosen to lead the first Swedish army to Finland. He was to lead a force of 2,600 men, land somewhere between [[Uusikaupunki|Nystad]] (Finnish: ''Uusikaupunki'') and [[Turku|\u00c5bo]], and then capture the latter. Von Vegesack instead chose to land his force at the Lemo (Finnish: ''Lemu'') manor house a few kilometers south of [[Turku|\u00c5bo]]. [[Battle of Lemo|The landing]] began on 19 June and was initially successful. The surprised Russians garrisoned at \u00c5bo reacted quickly, however, and deployed over 3,000 men to stop the landing force. By the morning of 20 June, the Swedish forces were forced to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=258-262}}  In addition, Colonel Johan Bergenstr\u00e5hle landed 1,100 Swedes just a few kilometers northeast of [[Vaasa|Vasa]] on 25 June and managed to quickly advance to the town. The Russians, however, managed to gather a force of 3,000 men which was able to force the ill-trained Swedes to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=262-264}}\n\nThe advance of the Russian coastal squadron beyond Hang\u00f6 created difficulties for the Swedes. The strength of the Swedish coastal forces deployed to the Finnish archipelago was equal in size to the coastal fleet that the Russians had obtained by the Sveaborg surrender. To prevent the Russians from gaining strength, the Swedish coastal fleet's unit under Rear Admiral Claes Hjelmstjerna tried to engage them twice in battle. The first was at the [[Battle of Rimito Kramp]] on 30 June, and after Russians withdrew closer to [[Turku|\u00c5bo]], the second was a battle at Pukkisaari on 4 July. Fighting ended in a stalemate, but can be viewed as a Swedish failure since they failed to decisively defeat the Russians.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=266-269}}\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map3.svg|thumb|left|Finnish War, May - October 1808]]\nHaving been alerted to the approach of additional Russian coastal units from Sveaborg, the Swedish forces moved to intercept them before they could link up with the Russian coastal unit now bottled up at \u00c5bo. Learning that the Russians intended to go around the island of [[Kimito\u00f6n (island)|Kimito]] (Finnish: ''Kimito\u00f6n''), a Swedish force of gunboats was deployed to the narrows. They met the Russians first at [[Battle of Sand\u00f6str\u00f6m|Tallholmen]] on 21 July and again on 2 August in the [[Battle of Sand\u00f6str\u00f6m]]. Swedish attempts to land troops and artillery in support of the gunboats at Vestank\u00e4rr on 2 August ended in failure, though the attempt came very close to capturing General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden]]. While none of the fights ended with a decisive winner, the overall strategic victory went to Russia, who gained advantage in the Finnish archipelago by managing to link up their separate coastal units.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=270-276}}\n\nSweden performed several small landings along the coast near [[Kristinestad]] (Finnish: ''Kristiinankaupunki'') and [[Kaskinen|Kask\u00f6]] (Finnish: ''Kaskinen'') and managed to raise local men to oppose the Russians. The first occurred on 3 July with several others taking place soon after. Altogether the Swedes had several hundred local men-in-arms. The Russians, however, were able to send reinforcements to the area which were, in addition to being numerically superior, both far better trained and equipped than the peasants and militia the Swedes had raised. By the end of July the small forces Sweden had landed and the men that had supported them were either beaten or withdrawn back to their ships.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=279-280}}\n\n== August \u2013 September 1808 ==\nAfter the Russians were driven from Central Finland, their forces stretched along the line of [[Pori]] \u2014 [[Tampere]] \u2014 [[Mikkeli]]. Having received considerable reinforcements, their numbers increased to 55,000, as opposed to the 36,000 estimated for Sweden. On 14 August, Count [[Nikolay Kamensky]] decided to use this numerical superiority to launch a new offensive.\n\nKamensky's 11,000-strong corps achieved important victories at [[Battle of Kuortane|Kuortane]] (1 September) and [[Salmi (rural locality)|Salmi]] (2 September), and although [[Georg Carl von D\u00f6beln]] won the [[Battle of Jutas]] for Sweden on 13 September, Kamensky gained the most important victory at [[Battle of Oravais|Oravais]] on 14 September. Swedish attempts to land more troops near [[\u00c5bo|Turku]] were stalled by Lieutenant-General [[Pyotr Bagration]]'s prompt actions. In Eastern Finland, the guerrilla movement was gradually extinguished. As a consequence, Russia's situation in Southern Finland improved significantly.\n\nIn the north, the situation was more complicated. Tuchkov's battered unit strained to hold its own against Sandels, while the progress of a relief force under General Alekseyev was contained by guerrilla fighters. It was not until 26 September that Prince [[Mikhail Petrovich Dolgorukov|Dolgorukov]] (Alekseyev's replacement) managed to join his forces with Tuchkov's, inducing Sandels to retreat. Three days later, Buxhoeveden \u2014 pressed by the early onset of winter weather \u2014 signed an armistice, much to the dismay of Alexander I. The emperor refused to ratify the truce and replaced Buxhoeveden with a new commander-in-chief, [[Bogdan von Knorring]], in December of that year.\n\nIn the south, the Swedish battle fleet remained anchored within the Finnish archipelago, blocking some of the deeper coastal sea routes from Hang\u00f6 towards \u00c5bo. Russian ships continued to arrive from the east but remained within the shallow narrows where the Swedish ships of the line could not reach. Small boat actions took place during the night time of 17\u201318 July which became known as the ''skirmish at L\u00f6v\u00f6'' ({{lang-fi|L\u00f6v\u00f6n kahakka}}). However, the Swedish fleet dropped its blockade on 22 August, allowing the Russian coastal units to unite. Odds were very much against the Swedes as the Russians had nearly one hundred coastal ships in the Finnish archipelago, against which Sweden could deploy only 7 galleys and 30 gun sloops.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=277-279}}\n\nSwedish efforts to harass the Russians with landings continued, with roughly 1,000 volunteers under Captain Anders Gyllenb\u00f6gel landing on 1 August to support Swedish-led uprisings on the coast south of Vasa. The landing succeeded, and together with Swedish troops advancing from the north, they managed to drive the Russians towards [[Pori|Bj\u00f6rneborg]] (Finnish: ''Pori''). Swedish patrol ships (consisting of armed merchant vessels) scouted and raided the coast, taking Russians prisoners to \u00c5land. These raids caused much confusion, and Russian responses to them thinned their strength along the coast. Also the Swedish southern army of Finland, consisting of roughly 4,000 men under Major General von Vegesack, was moved from \u00c5land to Finland, and landed at [[Kristinestad]] in late autumn, joining with von D\u00f6beln's forces. However, since von Vegesack had been ordered to land his men at [[Pori|Bj\u00f6rneborg]], the king, after pursuing the matter unsuccessfully in military tribunals, condemned von Vegesack to lose his rank and title.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=281-283}}\n\nA Russian battle fleet under Admiral Pyotr Khanikov (also ''Chanikoff'') sortied in late July to clear the Swedish blockades in the archipelago, to cut contact between \u00c5land and Sweden, and to stop Swedish supply transports sailing in the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. The Russian fleet reached Hang\u00f6 on 6 August and chose not to engage the scattered Swedish fleet elements in the vicinity. On 20 August, two British ships of the line ([[HMS Implacable (1805)|HMS ''Implacable'']] and [[HMS Centaur (1797)|''Centaur'']]) joined the Swedish fleet. The allied fleet moved on 25 August 1808 to engage the Russian fleet, which turned and attempted to reach the relative safety of [[Paldiski|Baltiyskiy Port]]. The British ships were far superior sailing ships compared to those of either the Swedes or Russians, and engaged the withdrawing Russian squadron (nine ships of the line and several frigates) on their own. The last of the Russian ships of the line was disabled and then captured and burned by the British ships. More Royal Navy ships (including [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], [[HMS Mars (1794)|''Mars'']], [[HMS Goliath (1781)|''Goliath'']], and [[HMS Africa (1781)|''Africa'']]) arrived to oversee a blockade of the Russian fleet at Baltiyskiy Port which continued until the sea started to freeze. The Swedish fleet suffered from outbreaks of scurvy and had been unable to maintain the blockade on its own.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=284-287}}\n\nSkirmishes and landings continued in the Finnish archipelago from late summer into autumn. On 30 August, the Swedish coastal fleet defeated its Russian adversaries at the [[Battle of Gr\u00f6nvikssund]], forcing the Russians to abandon their plans to invade \u00c5land and concentrate on defense. On 17 September, the Swedes [[Battle of Palva Sund|landed again]], this time at Lokalax (Finnish: ''Lokalahti''), while the coastal fleet covering the landing managed to keep the Russians away in the [[Battle of Palva Sund]] on 18 September. The troops that landed were forced to withdraw to their ships on 18 September, but [[Helsinki village landing|landed in Finland]] again on 26 September. However, owing to bad weather, only a portion of the troops that had been intended to participate in the landing actually reached the Finnish coast, and this resulted in another withdrawal on 28 September.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=287-298}}\n\nThe Swedish situation was further weakened by being at war with France and Denmark, both of whom threatened Sweden's possessions, with a joint invasion force of 45,000 troops in Denmark (under French general [[Charles XIV of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]]) and a further 36,000 in Norway. This forced the Swedes to allocate forces to southern Sweden and along the Norwegian border (23,000 troops). Denmark had declared war on Sweden on 14 March but no serious hostilities occurred, except for a series of inconclusive minor skirmishes along the [[Norway|Norwegian]] border, as in April Napoleon began to devote more attention to the situation in Spain, and the British navy remained a continuous threat for troop movements between Denmark and Sweden.\n\n== Winter 1808 ==\n[[File:The Finnish war map4.svg|thumb|Finnish War, Winter 1808 - Summer 1809]]\nBy November 1808, Russian forces had overrun all of Finland. On 19 November, the [[Convention of Olkijoki]] was signed and the Swedish army was forced to leave the Finnish countryside. The Russian emperor was, however, now eager to bring hostilities to the territory of Sweden proper, which was certain to bring the war to a victorious end.\n\nWith this objective in mind, Kamensky suggested a daring plan, whereby the Russian army was to cross the frozen [[Gulf of Bothnia]] at two locations: one unit was to march from [[Vaasa|Vasa]] towards [[Ume\u00e5]] and the other from [[Turku|\u00c5bo]] to the [[\u00c5land Islands]] and thence towards the vicinity of [[Stockholm]]. A third unit was to advance into Sweden by land, going around the gulf and through the town of [[Tornio|Torne\u00e5]] (Finnish: ''Tornio'').\n\nAlthough Knorring was urged to execute the plan as quickly as possible, he regarded the idea as unrealistic and procrastinated until March, when the emperor dispatched the War Minister [[Count Arakcheyev|Arakcheyev]] to Finland in order to pressure Knorring into action before joining the army himself.\n\n== Spring 1809 ==\n[[File:Gustavarrest.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Arrest of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV]].]]\nAs Russian forces embarked upon their unprecedented march across the frozen gulf, King Gustav IV \u2014 accused of fatal mistakes leading to the loss of Finland \u2014 was dethroned in Stockholm on 13 March, and his uncle was proclaimed [[Charles XIII of Sweden]]. Four days later, Bagration's corps of 17,000 men occupied the strategic [[\u00c5land Islands]], while Kulnev led a vanguard further across the frozen sea that on 19 March reached the Swedish shore within 70&nbsp;km from Stockholm.\n\nWhen news of Kulnev's incursion spread to the Swedish capital, the new king sent an embassy to Knorring, proposing a truce. The Russian commander agreed and speedily recalled Kulnev back to \u00c5land. Meanwhile, the other Russian contingent \u2014 5,000 men under [[Barclay de Tolly]] \u2014 endured great hardship in crossing the frozen gulf further north; they entered Ume\u00e5 on 24 March.\n\nThe third force, commanded by Count {{ill|Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov (1776-1823)|lt=Shuvalov|ru|\u0428\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 (1776)}}, struck against Torne\u00e5 and, braving fierce frost, encircled a Swedish army, which capitulated on 25 March. Six days later, the czar arrived in \u00c5bo and, on learning about the truce, not only revoked Knorring's signature but named Barclay de Tolly as the new Commander-in-Chief. Hostilities thus continued until May, when Shuvalov finally reached Ume\u00e5, where he was succeeded by Kamensky.\n\n== Summer 1809 and conclusion ==\n[[File:Ratan battle.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Last battle of the war at [[Battle of Ratan and S\u00e4var|Ratan]] near [[Ume\u00e5]] in Swedish [[V\u00e4sterbotten]]]]\nA British Royal Navy fleet under [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Admiral James Saumarez]] had arrived in Sweden in May and he concentrated his ships, 10 ship of the line and 17 smaller ships, to the Gulf of Finland. The presence of the British naval units kept the Russian battlefleet strictly confined to [[Kronstadt]], and after the British constructed artillery batteries to the [[Porkkala]] cape they cut off the coastal sea route from Russian ships. Total British control of the Gulf of Finland was a large obstacle to the Russian supply network and required sizable garrisons to be posted all along the Finnish coast. The Royal Navy captured 35 Russian ships and burnt 20 others before leaving the Baltic Sea on 28 September 1809.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=308-309}}\n\nIn August, Charles XIII, anxious to improve his position at a peace settlement, ordered General [[Gustav Wachtmeister]] to land in the north of Sweden and to attack Kamensky's rear. The last engagements of the war, [[Battle of S\u00e4var|at S\u00e4var]] and [[Battle of Ratan|Ratan]], proved inconclusive and Kamensky succeeded in neutralizing this belated counter-offensive.\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map5.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, aftermath]]\nWachtmeister's action was only a prelude to the peace negotiations that opened in August and resulted in the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] (17 September), in which Sweden ceded the whole of Finland and all of its domains east of the [[Torne River]] (the north-eastern parts of what was then called ''[[V\u00e4sterbotten]]'', today ''[[Norrbotten|Norrbottens l\u00e4n]]'') to Russia. Sweden then joined the [[Continental System]] and closed its harbours to British ships, leading to a formal declaration of [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810\u20131812)|war on Great Britain]]. A few months later, on 6 January 1810, the Russian government mediated the [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]] between Sweden and France.\n\nRussia would create the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] from the territory obtained from Sweden, and would attach the areas gained from Sweden in the 18th century (including so-called [[Old Finland]]) to the new Grand Duchy. The Grand Duchy of Finland was to retain the [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustavian]] [[Constitution of 1772 (Finland)|constitution of 1772]] with only slight modifications until 1919. Almost all Finnish soldiers in Sweden (most of them in the Ume\u00e5 area) were [[Repatriation|repatriated]] after the war.\n\n==Analysis==\nSufficient stocks of supplies had not been prepared for the army, since the King [[Gustaf IV Adolf]] thought it might be taken as provocation by the Russians. Furthermore, Swedish strategy relied on the outdated plans for Finland which took into account neither the advances in weaponry, mobility of the armed forces or the greatly improved road networks of Finland. Most of the fortifications in Finland had not been completed and those that were completed had mostly fallen into neglect and disrepair. Even the strongest of the Swedish fortresses, Sveaborg, still had several of its planned fortifications missing, most notably all the land side fortifications designed to protect against besieging enemy.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=225,230,249,311}}\n\nIn 1808 a British expeditionary force under [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John Moore]] arrived in Sweden, but after months of idleness departed for the beginning of what became known as the [[Peninsular War]]. Had the king accepted the landing of 10,000 British troops in [[Sk\u00e5ne]], where the expeditionary force had been authorized to disembark, it would have enabled the Swedes to release at least 10,000 trained soldiers for the Finnish War. As it happened, the bulk of the Swedish army, including the best units, were kept out of the Finnish War by the king, who reserved them for his plans for conquering either Sj\u00e6lland or Norway. Swedish landings were invariably made with poorly equipped and trained forces, often with troops who had very low morale. Landings were further complicated by the Swedish Navy's failure to tightly block the coastal sea route past [[Hang\u00f6]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=311-312}}\n\n==Commemoration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nThe 200th anniversary of the Finnish War was selected as the main motif for a high value commemorative coin, the \u20ac100 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2008 coinage|200th Anniversary of Finnish War commemorative coin]], minted in 2008.

As a result of the war, the eastern third of Sweden was established as the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] within the Russian Empire.  Other notable effects were the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Swedish parliament]]'s adoption of a [[Instrument of Government (1809)|new constitution]] and the establishment of the [[House of Bernadotte]], the new [[Swedish Act of Succession|Swedish royal house]], in 1818.\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Chronology of battles and events of the Finnish War}}\n[[File:Alexander I of Russia by G.Dawe (1826, Peterhof).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Alexander I, Emperor of Russia]]\n[[File:Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gustav IV Adolf, King of Sweden]]\nAfter the Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] concluded the 1807 [[Treaty of Tilsit]] with [[Napoleon]], Alexander, in his letter on 24 September 1807 to the Swedish King [[Gustav IV Adolf]], informed the king that the peaceful relations between Russia and Sweden depended on Swedish agreement to abide by the limitations of the Treaty of Tilsit which in practice meant that Sweden would have been required to follow the [[Continental System]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=222}} The king, who viewed [[Napoleon]] as the [[Antichrist]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] as his ally against Napoleon's France, was apprehensive of the system's ruinous consequences for Sweden's maritime commerce.  He instead entered into negotiations with Britain in order to prepare a joint attack against [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]], whose Norwegian possessions he coveted.\n\nIn the meantime, the [[Royal Navy]] [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|attacked Copenhagen]] and the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u20131812)]] was declared. Referring to the treaties of 1780 and 1800, the emperor demanded that Gustav Adolf close the [[Baltic Sea]] to all foreign warships. Although he reiterated his demand on November 16, 1807, it took two months before the king responded that it was impossible to honor the previous arrangements as long as the French were in control of the major Baltic ports. King Gustav Adolf did this after securing an alliance with Britain on 8 February 1808. Meanwhile, on 30 December 1807 Russia announced that should Sweden not give a clear reply Russia would be forced to act.\n\nAlthough most Swedish officers were skeptical about their chances in fighting the larger and more experienced Russian army, Gustav Adolf had an unrealistic view of Sweden's ability to defend itself against Russia. In [[Saint Petersburg]], his stubbornness was viewed as a convenient pretext to occupy [[Finland]], thus pushing the Russo-Swedish frontier considerably to the west of the Russian capital and safeguarding it in case of any future hostilities between the two powers.\n\nThe situation was problematic for Sweden, since it once again faced both Denmark and Russia as potential enemies requiring the Swedes to split their forces.  The king had thought it impossible to defend Finland should the enemy attack during the winter and chose largely to ignore the repeated warnings of the Russian threat he received in early 1808. Most of the Swedish plans assumed that warfare would be impossible during winter, disregarding the lessons from recent wars. In addition, several new good roads had been built into Finland greatly reducing the earlier dependency on naval support for any large operation in Finland.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=223-225}}\n\nThe Swedish plan was to first passively defend and hold on to the fortifications in the southern coast of Finland, in which Sweden had strong garrisons, while the rest of the Swedish army retreated to the north. Then in the spring, counterattack simultaneously from north and south, when the Swedish army would have naval support and the Russian army would be spread over Finland and thus have long supply lines. The basic reason for the plan was to avoid major decisive battles. \n\nSome advocates existed for taking a more active approach immediately, namely Lieutenant Colonel Samuel M\u00f6ller (fi) who advocated for taking an immediate offensive and [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt]] who supported actively delaying the advancing enemies in co-operation with the garrisons in the southern coast. \n\nIn the end instructions which the new Swedish commander in Finland, General [[Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor]], received from the king were an unsuccessful and open-ended mixture of ideas from these very different plans.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=223-226}}\n\nRussia had gathered a wealth of information from Finland using spies and other sources.  The level of detail was so great that Russian maps of Finland were in many respects more accurate than their Swedish counterparts. The Russians used the services of General [[Georg Magnus Sprengtporten]] when forming their plans. Sprengtporten suggested going on to an offensive during the winter since Finland would be mostly isolated when seas were frozen. His ideas were further developed by General [[Jan Pieter van Suchtelen]] before General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden]] was appointed as the commander of the Russian army in Finland in December 1807.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=226-230}}\n\nThe plan involved using the series of fortifications built after 1790 as staging grounds for the Russian advances into Finland. In southern Finland, armies were to isolate the fortifications and first take control of the whole of southern Finland before advancing further to the north. Forces in [[Savonia (historical province)|Savolax]] (Finnish: ''Savo'') were to press hard against the Swedes and reach the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] towards [[Oulu|Ule\u00e5borg]] (Finnish: ''Oulu'') and [[Vaasa|Vasa]] (Finnish: ''Vaasa'') to cut off the retreat of the main body of the Swedish army.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=228-230}}\n\n== February \u2013 May 1808 ==\n[[File:The Finnish war map1.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, February 1808 at the outbreak of the war]]\nOn February 21, 1808, 24,000 Russian troops under [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoevden]] crossed the border in [[Ahvenkoski]] and took the town of [[Loviisa|Lovisa]] (Finnish: ''Loviisa'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/southern_towns_mark_war_of_finland_bicentennial/5823726|title=Southern Towns Mark War of Finland Bicentennial|author=|publisher=Yle News|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2017|language=}}</ref> Since Klingspor had not arrived, Lieutenant General [[Karl Nathanael af Klercker]] acted as Swedish commander in Finland. He was notified of the Russian invasion already on 21 February and since it was impossible to hold the predefined defense lines as the army had not yet fully assembled he ordered the army to assemble at [[H\u00e4meenlinna|Tavastehus]] (Finnish: ''H\u00e4meenlinna''). Before the engagement started Klingspor finally arrived on 2 March and assumed command. Instead of facing the Russians at Tavastehus he ordered the army to withdraw. In [[Savonia (historical province)|Savolax]] the Russians also forced the Swedes to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=234-235}} The king was quite unprepared for the attack, especially as war was not declared until April. About 21,000 Swedish troops were stationed in various fortresses in Finland, while the rest of his army was unable to leave southern Sweden for fear of Danish attack.\n\nThe Russian advance was swift. On the first day of the war they had captured the town of Lovisa and besieged the Swedish sea fortress of [[Svartholm fortress|Svartholm]]. [[Porvoo|Borg\u00e5]] (Finnish: ''Porvoo'') was captured on 24 February and [[Helsinki|Helsingfors]] (Finnish: ''Helsinki'') on 2 March. Abandoned Swedish fortifications on the [[Hang\u00f6 Peninsula]] (Finnish: ''Hanko'') were taken and manned on 21 March and on the same day the Russian army took [[Turku|\u00c5bo]] (Finnish: ''Turku'') while a small detachment was sent to [[\u00c5land]]. Before the end of March 1808 even [[Vaasa|Vasa]] was taken. In Savolax, Russians also advanced rapidly and took [[Kuopio]] on 16 March. Swedish forces had mostly just withdrawn before the advancing Russian often destroying usable materials. For example, the Swedish [[archipelago fleet]]'s ships that been docked in \u00c5bo (nearly 50 gun sloops) were torched to prevent their capture.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=234-235}}\n\nThe Swedish fortress of [[Svartholm fortress|Svartholm]], commanded by Major [[Carl Magnus Gripenberg]], was ill-prepared for a war. While the garrison was 700 men strong, only a third of the men had actually functioning weapons, while most of the fortress' guns had no carriages. The fortress had fallen into disrepair and lacked both adequate food and ammunition stores. Even the wells were found to be unusable. After starting the siege on 21 February, the Russians issued a surrender demand for the fort, but this was refused by the Swedes. The demand was repeated on 2 March but without success. After a meager Russian bombardment, Gripenberg agreed to negotiations on 10 March. The fortress surrendered to the Russians on 18 March after a siege that had lasted roughly a month, with just one man having been wounded in action.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=232,235-238}}\n\n[[Sveaborg]] (Finnish: ''Suomenlinna'') under Admiral [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]] had been well prepared for the war with a garrison of 6,000 men, over 700 cannons, and enough stores to last until the summer of 1808. Defenses were strong enough to prevent the Russians from trying to storm the fortress by surprise. Instead the Russians [[Siege of Sveaborg|laid siege against Sveaborg]]. The fortress surrendered on 6 May 1808 after prolonged negotiations with the Russians as the commanding officer [[Carl Olof Cronstedt]] and his council believed that resistance was futile. The Russians gained the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet intact as well as large stores of supplies and munitions.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=232-233,238-244}}\n\nThe Russians had advanced considerably but they had also gained the long and vulnerable coastline with it. After the sea would be clear of ice there would be nothing to prevent Swedish forces from landing troops on the shore. With the Royal Navy supporting the Swedish battle fleet there was little the Russian battle fleet could accomplish. Capture of the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet had resulted in a real advantage to the Russians since it allowed them to gain superiority in the narrow waters of the Finnish archipelago where large ships of the line could not operate. Even the powerful explosion at Sveaborg which destroyed several of the captured ships did little to change Russian superiority in the Finnish archipelago. The Russians utilized the guns from the burned ships, and from those which burned during the winter, and constructed several fortifications on the coast, both in Hang\u00f6 as well as along narrow passages leading to \u00c5bo.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=245-248}}\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map2.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, March - May 1808]]\nUnder Colonel [[Carl Johan Adlercreutz]] the Swedish army [[Battle of Siikajoki|counter-attacked at Siikajoki]] and began to halt the Russian offensive. Soon after at the [[Battle of Revolax]] (Finnish: ''Revonlahti''), the Swedish army under Colonel [[Johan Adam Cronstedt]] started an advance towards the south. These successes yielded a promotion to Field Marshal for [[Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor]]. The Swedish advance was very slow however, as operations were often halted due to the thaw. An exception was the brigade under Colonel [[Johan August Sandels]], which swiftly advanced towards [[Kuopio]]. [[Nikolay Tuchkov]], a Russian general who was dispatched to the north of Finland, left garrisons in every fort along his way. This reduced his unit to 4,000 troops, which proved insufficient to pacify the hostile country. The Finns rose up in guerrilla fighting as far east as Frederikshamn (Finnish: ''[[Hamina]]'') within the [[Old Finland]] province of Russia.\n\nIn May, the Russians suffered further setbacks when they were driven from [[Gotland]] and \u00c5land, where a Swedish [[flotilla]], supported by the local population, compelled the small Russian force left on the main island of [[Fasta \u00c5land]] to surrender, and then invaded the island of [[Kumlinge]] where the bulk of the Russian garrison on the [[\u00c5land Islands]] was based. After a two-hour-long battle, the local militia, together with the Swedish landing force, overwhelmed their enemies and Colonel Vuich and his garrison were compelled to surrender. \n\nOn May 26, a British fleet carrying 14,000 troops under [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]] entered the [[port of Gothenburg]]. Due to various disagreements with the Swedish king, however, they never landed and sailed off to fight the French in [[Spain]] after leaving 16 battleships and 20 other ships at Sweden's disposal.\n\n== June \u2013 July 1808 ==\nThe Swedish battlefleet which had been expelling Russians from [[Gotland]] was ordered to blockade the [[Hang\u00f6 Peninsula]] and reached the cape on 10 June. Due to bad weather and poor visibility the fleet under [[Rudolf Cederstr\u00f6m|Admiral Rudolph Cederstr\u00f6m]] chose to stay relatively far from the coast. Upon approaching the coast on 21 June, Cederstr\u00f6m learned that the Russians had already passed the cape some time earlier. Attempts to stop the Russians deeper in the archipelago were also unsuccessful. Failure to block the Russians led the king to relieve Cederstr\u00f6m of his duties and replace him with Commander Henrik Johan Nauckhoff.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=256-258}}\n\nMajor General Eberhard Ernst von Vegesack was chosen to lead the first Swedish army to Finland. He was to lead a force of 2,600 men, land somewhere between [[Uusikaupunki|Nystad]] (Finnish: ''Uusikaupunki'') and [[Turku|\u00c5bo]], and then capture the latter. Von Vegesack instead chose to land his force at the Lemo (Finnish: ''Lemu'') manor house a few kilometers south of [[Turku|\u00c5bo]]. [[Battle of Lemo|The landing]] began on 19 June and was initially successful. The surprised Russians garrisoned at \u00c5bo reacted quickly, however, and deployed over 3,000 men to stop the landing force. By the morning of 20 June, the Swedish forces were forced to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=258-262}}  In addition, Colonel Johan Bergenstr\u00e5hle landed 1,100 Swedes just a few kilometers northeast of [[Vaasa|Vasa]] on 25 June and managed to quickly advance to the town. The Russians, however, managed to gather a force of 3,000 men which was able to force the ill-trained Swedes to withdraw.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=262-264}}\n\nThe advance of the Russian coastal squadron beyond Hang\u00f6 created difficulties for the Swedes. The strength of the Swedish coastal forces deployed to the Finnish archipelago was equal in size to the coastal fleet that the Russians had obtained by the Sveaborg surrender. To prevent the Russians from gaining strength, the Swedish coastal fleet's unit under Rear Admiral Claes Hjelmstjerna tried to engage them twice in battle. The first was at the [[Battle of Rimito Kramp]] on 30 June, and after Russians withdrew closer to [[Turku|\u00c5bo]], the second was a battle at Pukkisaari on 4 July. Fighting ended in a stalemate, but can be viewed as a Swedish failure since they failed to decisively defeat the Russians.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=266-269}}\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map3.svg|thumb|left|Finnish War, May - October 1808]]\nHaving been alerted to the approach of additional Russian coastal units from Sveaborg, the Swedish forces moved to intercept them before they could link up with the Russian coastal unit now bottled up at \u00c5bo. Learning that the Russians intended to go around the island of [[Kimito\u00f6n (island)|Kimito]] (Finnish: ''Kimito\u00f6n''), a Swedish force of gunboats was deployed to the narrows. They met the Russians first at [[Battle of Sand\u00f6str\u00f6m|Tallholmen]] on 21 July and again on 2 August in the [[Battle of Sand\u00f6str\u00f6m]]. Swedish attempts to land troops and artillery in support of the gunboats at Vestank\u00e4rr on 2 August ended in failure, though the attempt came very close to capturing General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden]]. While none of the fights ended with a decisive winner, the overall strategic victory went to Russia, who gained advantage in the Finnish archipelago by managing to link up their separate coastal units.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=270-276}}\n\nSweden performed several small landings along the coast near [[Kristinestad]] (Finnish: ''Kristiinankaupunki'') and [[Kaskinen|Kask\u00f6]] (Finnish: ''Kaskinen'') and managed to raise local men to oppose the Russians. The first occurred on 3 July with several others taking place soon after. Altogether the Swedes had several hundred local men-in-arms. The Russians, however, were able to send reinforcements to the area which were, in addition to being numerically superior, both far better trained and equipped than the peasants and militia the Swedes had raised. By the end of July the small forces Sweden had landed and the men that had supported them were either beaten or withdrawn back to their ships.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=279-280}}\n\n== August \u2013 September 1808 ==\nAfter the Russians were driven from Central Finland, their forces stretched along the line of [[Pori]] \u2014 [[Tampere]] \u2014 [[Mikkeli]]. Having received considerable reinforcements, their numbers increased to 55,000, as opposed to the 36,000 estimated for Sweden. On 14 August, Count [[Nikolay Kamensky]] decided to use this numerical superiority to launch a new offensive.\n\nKamensky's 11,000-strong corps achieved important victories at [[Battle of Kuortane|Kuortane]] (1 September) and [[Salmi (rural locality)|Salmi]] (2 September), and although [[Georg Carl von D\u00f6beln]] won the [[Battle of Jutas]] for Sweden on 13 September, Kamensky gained the most important victory at [[Battle of Oravais|Oravais]] on 14 September. Swedish attempts to land more troops near [[\u00c5bo|Turku]] were stalled by Lieutenant-General [[Pyotr Bagration]]'s prompt actions. In Eastern Finland, the guerrilla movement was gradually extinguished. As a consequence, Russia's situation in Southern Finland improved significantly.\n\nIn the north, the situation was more complicated. Tuchkov's battered unit strained to hold its own against Sandels, while the progress of a relief force under General Alekseyev was contained by guerrilla fighters. It was not until 26 September that Prince [[Mikhail Petrovich Dolgorukov|Dolgorukov]] (Alekseyev's replacement) managed to join his forces with Tuchkov's, inducing Sandels to retreat. Three days later, Buxhoeveden \u2014 pressed by the early onset of winter weather \u2014 signed an armistice, much to the dismay of Alexander I. The emperor refused to ratify the truce and replaced Buxhoeveden with a new commander-in-chief, [[Bogdan von Knorring]], in December of that year.\n\nIn the south, the Swedish battle fleet remained anchored within the Finnish archipelago, blocking some of the deeper coastal sea routes from Hang\u00f6 towards \u00c5bo. Russian ships continued to arrive from the east but remained within the shallow narrows where the Swedish ships of the line could not reach. Small boat actions took place during the night time of 17\u201318 July which became known as the ''skirmish at L\u00f6v\u00f6'' ({{lang-fi|L\u00f6v\u00f6n kahakka}}). However, the Swedish fleet dropped its blockade on 22 August, allowing the Russian coastal units to unite. Odds were very much against the Swedes as the Russians had nearly one hundred coastal ships in the Finnish archipelago, against which Sweden could deploy only 7 galleys and 30 gun sloops.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=277-279}}\n\nSwedish efforts to harass the Russians with landings continued, with roughly 1,000 volunteers under Captain Anders Gyllenb\u00f6gel landing on 1 August to support Swedish-led uprisings on the coast south of Vasa. The landing succeeded, and together with Swedish troops advancing from the north, they managed to drive the Russians towards [[Pori|Bj\u00f6rneborg]] (Finnish: ''Pori''). Swedish patrol ships (consisting of armed merchant vessels) scouted and raided the coast, taking Russians prisoners to \u00c5land. These raids caused much confusion, and Russian responses to them thinned their strength along the coast. Also the Swedish southern army of Finland, consisting of roughly 4,000 men under Major General von Vegesack, was moved from \u00c5land to Finland, and landed at [[Kristinestad]] in late autumn, joining with von D\u00f6beln's forces. However, since von Vegesack had been ordered to land his men at [[Pori|Bj\u00f6rneborg]], the king, after pursuing the matter unsuccessfully in military tribunals, condemned von Vegesack to lose his rank and title.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=281-283}}\n\nA Russian battle fleet under Admiral Pyotr Khanikov (also ''Chanikoff'') sortied in late July to clear the Swedish blockades in the archipelago, to cut contact between \u00c5land and Sweden, and to stop Swedish supply transports sailing in the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. The Russian fleet reached Hang\u00f6 on 6 August and chose not to engage the scattered Swedish fleet elements in the vicinity. On 20 August, two British ships of the line ([[HMS Implacable (1805)|HMS ''Implacable'']] and [[HMS Centaur (1797)|''Centaur'']]) joined the Swedish fleet. The allied fleet moved on 25 August 1808 to engage the Russian fleet, which turned and attempted to reach the relative safety of [[Paldiski|Baltiyskiy Port]]. The British ships were far superior sailing ships compared to those of either the Swedes or Russians, and engaged the withdrawing Russian squadron (nine ships of the line and several frigates) on their own. The last of the Russian ships of the line was disabled and then captured and burned by the British ships. More Royal Navy ships (including [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], [[HMS Mars (1794)|''Mars'']], [[HMS Goliath (1781)|''Goliath'']], and [[HMS Africa (1781)|''Africa'']]) arrived to oversee a blockade of the Russian fleet at Baltiyskiy Port which continued until the sea started to freeze. The Swedish fleet suffered from outbreaks of scurvy and had been unable to maintain the blockade on its own.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=284-287}}\n\nSkirmishes and landings continued in the Finnish archipelago from late summer into autumn. On 30 August, the Swedish coastal fleet defeated its Russian adversaries at the [[Battle of Gr\u00f6nvikssund]], forcing the Russians to abandon their plans to invade \u00c5land and concentrate on defense. On 17 September, the Swedes [[Battle of Palva Sund|landed again]], this time at Lokalax (Finnish: ''Lokalahti''), while the coastal fleet covering the landing managed to keep the Russians away in the [[Battle of Palva Sund]] on 18 September. The troops that landed were forced to withdraw to their ships on 18 September, but [[Helsinki village landing|landed in Finland]] again on 26 September. However, owing to bad weather, only a portion of the troops that had been intended to participate in the landing actually reached the Finnish coast, and this resulted in another withdrawal on 28 September.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=287-298}}\n\nThe Swedish situation was further weakened by being at war with France and Denmark, both of whom threatened Sweden's possessions, with a joint invasion force of 45,000 troops in Denmark (under French general [[Charles XIV of Sweden|Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]]) and a further 36,000 in Norway. This forced the Swedes to allocate forces to southern Sweden and along the Norwegian border (23,000 troops). Denmark had declared war on Sweden on 14 March but no serious hostilities occurred, except for a series of inconclusive minor skirmishes along the [[Norway|Norwegian]] border, as in April Napoleon began to devote more attention to the situation in Spain, and the British navy remained a continuous threat for troop movements between Denmark and Sweden.\n\n== Winter 1808 ==\n[[File:The Finnish war map4.svg|thumb|Finnish War, Winter 1808 - Summer 1809]]\nBy November 1808, Russian forces had overrun all of Finland. On 19 November, the [[Convention of Olkijoki]] was signed and the Swedish army was forced to leave the Finnish countryside. The Russian emperor was, however, now eager to bring hostilities to the territory of Sweden proper, which was certain to bring the war to a victorious end.\n\nWith this objective in mind, Kamensky suggested a daring plan, whereby the Russian army was to cross the frozen [[Gulf of Bothnia]] at two locations: one unit was to march from [[Vaasa|Vasa]] towards [[Ume\u00e5]] and the other from [[Turku|\u00c5bo]] to the [[\u00c5land Islands]] and thence towards the vicinity of [[Stockholm]]. A third unit was to advance into Sweden by land, going around the gulf and through the town of [[Tornio|Torne\u00e5]] (Finnish: ''Tornio'').\n\nAlthough Knorring was urged to execute the plan as quickly as possible, he regarded the idea as unrealistic and procrastinated until March, when the emperor dispatched the War Minister [[Count Arakcheyev|Arakcheyev]] to Finland in order to pressure Knorring into action before joining the army himself.\n\n== Spring 1809 ==\n[[File:Gustavarrest.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Arrest of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV]].]]\nAs Russian forces embarked upon their unprecedented march across the frozen gulf, King Gustav IV \u2014 accused of fatal mistakes leading to the loss of Finland \u2014 was dethroned in Stockholm on 13 March, and his uncle was proclaimed [[Charles XIII of Sweden]]. Four days later, Bagration's corps of 17,000 men occupied the strategic [[\u00c5land Islands]], while Kulnev led a vanguard further across the frozen sea that on 19 March reached the Swedish shore within 70&nbsp;km from Stockholm.\n\nWhen news of Kulnev's incursion spread to the Swedish capital, the new king sent an embassy to Knorring, proposing a truce. The Russian commander agreed and speedily recalled Kulnev back to \u00c5land. Meanwhile, the other Russian contingent \u2014 5,000 men under [[Barclay de Tolly]] \u2014 endured great hardship in crossing the frozen gulf further north; they entered Ume\u00e5 on 24 March.\n\nThe third force, commanded by Count {{ill|Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov (1776-1823)|lt=Shuvalov|ru|\u0428\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 (1776)}}, struck against Torne\u00e5 and, braving fierce frost, encircled a Swedish army, which capitulated on 25 March. Six days later, the czar arrived in \u00c5bo and, on learning about the truce, not only revoked Knorring's signature but named Barclay de Tolly as the new Commander-in-Chief. Hostilities thus continued until May, when Shuvalov finally reached Ume\u00e5, where he was succeeded by Kamensky.\n\n== Summer 1809 and conclusion ==\n[[File:Ratan battle.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Last battle of the war at [[Battle of Ratan and S\u00e4var|Ratan]] near [[Ume\u00e5]] in Swedish [[V\u00e4sterbotten]]]]\nA British Royal Navy fleet under [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Admiral James Saumarez]] had arrived in Sweden in May and he concentrated his ships, 10 ship of the line and 17 smaller ships, to the Gulf of Finland. The presence of the British naval units kept the Russian battlefleet strictly confined to [[Kronstadt]], and after the British constructed artillery batteries to the [[Porkkala]] cape they cut off the coastal sea route from Russian ships. Total British control of the Gulf of Finland was a large obstacle to the Russian supply network and required sizable garrisons to be posted all along the Finnish coast. The Royal Navy captured 35 Russian ships and burnt 20 others before leaving the Baltic Sea on 28 September 1809.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=308-309}}\n\nIn August, Charles XIII, anxious to improve his position at a peace settlement, ordered General [[Gustav Wachtmeister]] to land in the north of Sweden and to attack Kamensky's rear. The last engagements of the war, [[Battle of S\u00e4var|at S\u00e4var]] and [[Battle of Ratan|Ratan]], proved inconclusive and Kamensky succeeded in neutralizing this belated counter-offensive.\n\n[[File:The Finnish war map5.svg|thumb|right|Finnish War, aftermath]]\nWachtmeister's action was only a prelude to the peace negotiations that opened in August and resulted in the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] (17 September), in which Sweden ceded the whole of Finland and all of its domains east of the [[Torne River]] (the north-eastern parts of what was then called ''[[V\u00e4sterbotten]]'', today ''[[Norrbotten|Norrbottens l\u00e4n]]'') to Russia. Sweden then joined the [[Continental System]] and closed its harbours to British ships, leading to a formal declaration of [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810\u20131812)|war on Great Britain]]. A few months later, on 6 January 1810, the Russian government mediated the [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]] between Sweden and France.\n\nRussia would create the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] from the territory obtained from Sweden, and would attach the areas gained from Sweden in the 18th century (including so-called [[Old Finland]]) to the new Grand Duchy. The Grand Duchy of Finland was to retain the [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustavian]] [[Constitution of 1772 (Finland)|constitution of 1772]] with only slight modifications until 1919. Almost all Finnish soldiers in Sweden (most of them in the Ume\u00e5 area) were [[Repatriation|repatriated]] after the war.\n\n==Analysis==\nSufficient stocks of supplies had not been prepared for the army, since the King [[Gustaf IV Adolf]] thought it might be taken as provocation by the Russians. Furthermore, Swedish strategy relied on the outdated plans for Finland which took into account neither the advances in weaponry, mobility of the armed forces or the greatly improved road networks of Finland. Most of the fortifications in Finland had not been completed and those that were completed had mostly fallen into neglect and disrepair. Even the strongest of the Swedish fortresses, Sveaborg, still had several of its planned fortifications missing, most notably all the land side fortifications designed to protect against besieging enemy.{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=225,230,249,311}}\n\nIn 1808 a British expeditionary force under [[John Moore (British Army officer)|John Moore]] arrived in Sweden, but after months of idleness departed for the beginning of what became known as the [[Peninsular War]]. Had the king accepted the landing of 10,000 British troops in [[Sk\u00e5ne]], where the expeditionary force had been authorized to disembark, it would have enabled the Swedes to release at least 10,000 trained soldiers for the Finnish War. As it happened, the bulk of the Swedish army, including the best units, were kept out of the Finnish War by the king, who reserved them for his plans for conquering either Sj\u00e6lland or Norway. Swedish landings were invariably made with poorly equipped and trained forces, often with troops who had very low morale. Landings were further complicated by the Swedish Navy's failure to tightly block the coastal sea route past [[Hang\u00f6]].{{sfnp|Mattila|1983|p=311-312}}\n\n==Commemoration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nThe 200th anniversary of the Finnish War was selected as the main motif for a high value commemorative coin, the \u20ac100 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2008 coinage|200th Anniversary of Finnish War commemorative coin]], minted in 2008.

He became [[King's Counsel]]  in 1790, and was a commissioner for revenue appeals and an advocate of the Irish Admiralty Court.

In 1807 he effectively  sold  the Parliamentary borough of  [[Tralee (UK Parliament constituency)|Tralee]]  to the future [[Duke of Wellington]]. Wellington  later complained  about the expense involved.<ref>Longford p.168</ref>\n\n==Judge==\n\nHe was appointed a justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)]] in 1798, and almost immediately was appointed to the Special Commission to deal with  the aftermath of the\n[[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].<ref>Ball p.229</ref> He was also the junior judge at the trial of the [[Sheares brothers]],  Henry and John, who  were \nhanged for their part in the Rebellion. He visited England in 1807, where he fell seriously ill, and was unable to perform his judicial duties for almost a year.  In 1814 he was one of the judges who sat at the trial of the publisher  John Magee for [[seditious libel]], where despite their close friendship he clashed bitterly with Daniel O'Connell, who was [[defence counsel]].<ref>Geoghegan pp. 134-5</ref> In 1816 he presided at the much publicised [[quo warranto]] case, ''Rex v. O'Grady'', an the celebrated trial for [[murder]] of the Kerry [[attorney at law|attorney]], Rowan Cashel.  As a judge he was praised for integrity but not ability. Daniel O'Connell said that one could always win a case in front of Day by insisting on making the closing argument, since Day, by his own admission, generally agreed with whoever spoke last (as Geoghegan remarks,  many barristers still employ this tactic).<ref>Geoghegan p.63</ref> During the [[Napoleonic Wars]]  he became preoccupied with the danger of [[revolution]] and his addresses to [[grand juries]]  often consisted of a political harangue on the evils of sedition. J.P Kenyon notes that in England it was a long-standing tradition for the [[justice of the peace]] to address a grand jury in a similar fashion.<ref>''The Stuart Constitution'' 2nd Edition Cambridge University Press 1986 p.443, quoting the address by Sir [[Peter Leycester]] to a Cheshire grand jury in 1677 </ref>\n\nHis personal friendship with O'Connell even survived O'Connell's fatal [[duel ]]with John D'Esterre in January 1815. When Dublin was rife with news of the impending duel, Day was sent to arrest O'Connell, with the aim of preventing it. O'Connell insisted that he was not the aggressor, and Day, seemingly satisfied, merely [[binding over|bound him over]] to keep the peace, this making the duel inevitable. \"Was there ever such a scene?\" O'Connell asked later.<ref>Geoghegan p.150</ref>\n\nHe retired from the Bench in  1818. He lived at [[Merrion Square]] in Dublin city, at [[Loughlinstown]]  House in  south County Dublin,  and at Day Place, Tralee.<ref>Ball p.229</ref> He kept  an  interesting diary  for many years. An extract  covering the years 1808-1813 was  published in 2002, and the full diaries, together with his [[grand jury ]]addresses,  were published in 2004.\n\n==Marriages and children==\n\nHe died in at  Loughlinstown  House in  1841, aged almost ninety-five. By his  first wife Mary (Polly), who died in 1823,   he had a   daughter Elizabeth who married [[Sir Edward Denny, 3rd Baronet]], and had six children including [[Sir Edward Denny, 4th Baronet]].<ref>Ball p.229</ref> Although Day's first marriage was apparently  happy, there is no doubt   that he had two sons, John and Edward, by Mary Fitzgerald,  daughter of Bartholomew Fitzgerald of [[Bandon, County Cork ]], who became his second wife in 1824. The boys were born  in the late 1790s during his first wife's lifetime.<ref>Day  ''Killarney Sketches'' p.3</ref> He made provision for both sons   in  his will, and they adopted the surname Day. Mary, who was a [[Roman Catholic]], had lived with the family for many years as companion and later nurse to Polly.<ref>\"New book details life of famed judge\" ''The Kerryman'' 4/5/2005</ref> She died in 1849.<ref>Day, ''Killarney Sketches<''</ref> John, their elder son, followed the family traddition of entering the Church. He inherited from the senior branch of the family their  property at [[Beaufort, County Kerry]]. He was the grandfather of [[Charles Towry-Law, 4th Baron Ellenborough]].\n\n==Character==\n\nBall, writing in the mid 1920s,  describes Robert as a man who was estimable in every way.<ref>Ball p181</ref>  Whether Ball was aware of his unconventional domestic life is unclear (the first public references  to his affair with Mary Fitzgerald seem to be in the 1938 memoir by Ella Day, who married  a descendant of the judge).  Nonetheless there is ample evidence of his kindly and charitable nature, and  of his great gift for friendship.  Kenny adds that the descriptions we have  his pleasure-filled youth in London gives an attractive picture of a lively and fun-loving young man.<ref>Kenny pp.180-1</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n*Ball, F.

Wellington  later complained  about the expense involved.<ref>Longford p.168</ref>\n\n==Judge==\n\nHe was appointed a justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)]] in 1798, and almost immediately was appointed to the Special Commission to deal with  the aftermath of the\n[[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].<ref>Ball p.229</ref> He was also the junior judge at the trial of the [[Sheares brothers]],  Henry and John, who  were \nhanged for their part in the Rebellion. He visited England in 1807, where he fell seriously ill, and was unable to perform his judicial duties for almost a year.  In 1814 he was one of the judges who sat at the trial of the publisher  John Magee for [[seditious libel]], where despite their close friendship he clashed bitterly with Daniel O'Connell, who was [[defence counsel]].<ref>Geoghegan pp. 134-5</ref> In 1816 he presided at the much publicised [[quo warranto]] case, ''Rex v. O'Grady'', an the celebrated trial for [[murder]] of the Kerry [[attorney at law|attorney]], Rowan Cashel.  As a judge he was praised for integrity but not ability. Daniel O'Connell said that one could always win a case in front of Day by insisting on making the closing argument, since Day, by his own admission, generally agreed with whoever spoke last (as Geoghegan remarks,  many barristers still employ this tactic).<ref>Geoghegan p.63</ref> During the [[Napoleonic Wars]]  he became preoccupied with the danger of [[revolution]] and his addresses to [[grand juries]]  often consisted of a political harangue on the evils of sedition. J.P Kenyon notes that in England it was a long-standing tradition for the [[justice of the peace]] to address a grand jury in a similar fashion.<ref>''The Stuart Constitution'' 2nd Edition Cambridge University Press 1986 p.443, quoting the address by Sir [[Peter Leycester]] to a Cheshire grand jury in 1677 </ref>\n\nHis personal friendship with O'Connell even survived O'Connell's fatal [[duel ]]with John D'Esterre in January 1815. When Dublin was rife with news of the impending duel, Day was sent to arrest O'Connell, with the aim of preventing it. O'Connell insisted that he was not the aggressor, and Day, seemingly satisfied, merely [[binding over|bound him over]] to keep the peace, this making the duel inevitable. \"Was there ever such a scene?\" O'Connell asked later.<ref>Geoghegan p.150</ref>\n\nHe retired from the Bench in  1818. He lived at [[Merrion Square]] in Dublin city, at [[Loughlinstown]]  House in  south County Dublin,  and at Day Place, Tralee.<ref>Ball p.229</ref> He kept  an  interesting diary  for many years. An extract  covering the years 1808-1813 was  published in 2002, and the full diaries, together with his [[grand jury ]]addresses,  were published in 2004.\n\n==Marriages and children==\n\nHe died in at  Loughlinstown  House in  1841, aged almost ninety-five. By his  first wife Mary (Polly), who died in 1823,   he had a   daughter Elizabeth who married [[Sir Edward Denny, 3rd Baronet]], and had six children including [[Sir Edward Denny, 4th Baronet]].<ref>Ball p.229</ref> Although Day's first marriage was happy, there is no doubt   that he had two sons, John and Edward, by Mary Fitzgerald,  daughter of Bartholomew Fitzgerald of [[Bandon, County Cork ]], who became his second wife in 1824. The boys were born  in the late 1790s during his first wife's lifetime.<ref>Day  ''Killarney Sketches'' p.3</ref> He made provision for both sons   in  his will, and they adopted the surname Day. Mary, who was a [[Roman Catholic]], had lived with the family for many years as companion and later nurse to Polly.<ref>\"New book details life of famed judge\" ''The Kerryman'' 4/5/2005</ref> She died in 1849.<ref>Day, ''Killarney Sketches<''</ref> John, their elder son, followed the family traddition of entering the Church. He inherited from the senior branch of the family their  property at [[Beaufort, County Kerry]]. He was the grandfather of [[Charles Towry-Law, 4th Baron Ellenborough]].\n\n==Character==\n\nBall, writing in the mid 1920s,  describes Robert as a man who was estimable in every way.<ref>Ball p181</ref>  Whether Ball was aware of his unconventional domestic life is unclear (the first public references  to his affair with Mary Fitzgerald seem to be in the 1938 memoir by Ella Day, who married  a descendant of the judge).  Nonetheless there is ample evidence of his kindly and charitable nature, and  of his great gift for friendship.  Kenny adds that the descriptions we have  his pleasure-filled youth in London gives an attractive picture of a lively and fun-loving young man.<ref>Kenny pp.180-1</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n*Ball, F.

Primary sources locate the battle at ''\"Ethandun\"'' or ''\"Ethandune\"'', and until a scholarly consensus linked its location with the present-day [[Edington, Wiltshire|Edington]] in [[Wiltshire]] it was known as the '''Battle of ''Ethandun''''', a name which continues to be used.\n\n==Events before the battle==\nThe first Viking raid on Anglo-Saxon England is thought to have been between AD 786 and 802 at [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] in the Kingdom of Wessex, when three Norse ships arrived and killed [[Beorhtric of Wessex|King Beorhtric]]'s [[Reeve (England)|reeve]].<ref name=\"sawyer50\">Sawyer, ''Illustrated History of Vikings'', p. 50</ref> At the other end of the country, in the Kingdom of Northumbria, during AD 793 the holy island of [[Lindisfarne]] was raided.<ref>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, A.D. 793: \"This year came dreadful fore-warnings over the land of the Northumbrians, terrifying the people most woefully: these were immense sheets of light rushing through the air, and whirlwinds, and fiery dragons flying across the firmament. These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine: and not long after, on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year, the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy-island (Lindisfarne), by rapine and slaughter.\"</ref> After the sacking of Lindisfarne the raids around the coasts were somewhat sporadic until the 830s when the attacks became more sustained.<ref name=\"sawyer52\">Sawyer, ''Illustrated History of Vikings'', p. 52</ref> In 835, \"heathen men\" ravaged Sheppey.<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/> In 836, [[Egbert of Wessex|Ecgberht of Wessex]] met in battle a force of 35 ships at [[Carhampton]],<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/> and in 838 he faced a combined force of Vikings and [[Cornishman|Cornishmen]] at [[Hingston Down]] in Cornwall.<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/>\n\nThe raiding continued and with each year became more intense.<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/> In 865/866 it escalated further on the arrival of what the Saxons called the [[Great Heathen Army]].<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/> The annals do not report the size of the army, but modern estimates suggest between five hundred and a thousand men.<ref name=jones219 /> It was said to have been under the leadership of the brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Ubba]], and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]].<ref name=jones219>Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', p. 219</ref> What made this army different from those before it was its intent. Its arrival began \"a new stage, that of conquest and residence\".<ref name=jones218 >Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', p. 218</ref> By 870, the Northmen had conquered the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], and in 871 they attacked Wessex. Of the nine battles mentioned by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' during that year, only one was a West Saxon victory; but in this year Alfred succeeded his brother Ethelred, who died after the [[Battle of Merton]].<ref name=garmonsway70>Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 70-73</ref>\n\n[[Mercia]] had collapsed by 874, and the Army's cohesion went with it. Halfdan went back to Northumbria and fought the [[Picts]] and the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] Welsh to secure his northern kingdom.<ref name=\"jones221\">Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', p. 221</ref> His army settled there and he is not mentioned after 876, when \"[the Danes] were engaged in ploughing and making a living for themselves\".<ref name=\"jones221\"/> Guthrum, with two other unnamed kings, \"departed for [[Cambridge]] in East Anglia\".<ref name=\"jones221\" /> He made several attacks on Wessex, starting in 875, and in the last nearly captured Alfred in his winter fortress at [[Chippenham]].<ref name=\"jones221\" />\nBy 878, the Danes held the east and northeast of England, and their defeat at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] had paused but not halted their advance. Alfred the Great had spent the winter preceding the Battle of Edington in the Somerset marsh of [[Athelney]], the nature of the country giving him some protection. In the spring of 878, he summoned his [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] forces and marched to Edington, where he met the Danes, led by Guthrum, in battle.\n\n==Alfred's position before the battle==\nGuthrum and his men had applied the usual Danish strategy of occupying a fortified town and waiting for a peace \u201ctreaty,\u201d involving money in return for a promise to leave the kingdom immediately; Alfred shadowed the army, trying to prevent more damage than had already occurred. This started in 875 when Guthrum's army \u201celuded the West Saxon levies and got into Wareham\u201d.<ref name=\"G74\">Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 74</ref> They then gave hostages and oaths to leave the country to Alfred, who paid them off.<ref name=\"Smyth 70\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 70</ref> The Danes promptly slipped off to Exeter, even deeper into Alfred's kingdom, where they concluded in the autumn of 877 a \"firm peace\" with Alfred,<ref name=G74/> under terms that entailed their leaving his kingdom and not returning.<ref name=\"Smyth 72\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 72</ref> This they did, spending the rest of 877 (by the Gregorian calendar) in [[Gloucester]].<ref name=\"Smyth 72\"/> Alfred spent [[Christmas]] at Chippenham, thirty miles from Gloucester. The Danes attacked Chippenham \"in midwinter after Twelfth Night\",<ref name=G74/> probably during the night of 6\u20137 January 878. They captured Chippenham and forced Alfred to retreat \"with a small force\" into the wilderness.<ref name=G74/> It is to this period that the story of King Alfred burning the cakes belongs.<ref name=horspool2>Horspool, ''Why Alfred burnt the cakes'', pp. 2&nbsp;\u2013 3. Although there may have been an early oral tradition about the burning of the cakes, there is no contemporary evidence for the cake story. The first time it appears is one hundred years later and it may have been invented to make an obscure saint [St Neot] look good.</ref>\n\nAlfred seems at this time to have ineffectually chased the Danes around Wessex, while the Danes were in a position to do as they pleased. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' attempts to convey the impression that Alfred held the initiative; it is \"a bland chronicle which laconically charts the movements of the Danish victors while at the same time disingenuously striving to convey the impression that Alfred was in control\",<ref name=\"Smyth 70\" /> although it fails. Even if Alfred had caught up with the Danish force, it is unlikely that he could have accomplished anything. The fact that his army could not defend the fortified Chippenham, even in \"an age... as yet untrained in siege warfare\"<ref name=\"Smyth 70\"/> casts great doubt on its ability to defeat the Danes in an open field, unaided by fortifications. There was little that Alfred could do about the Danish menace between 875 and the end of 877, beyond repeatedly paying the invaders off.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|left| upright=1.4 |[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on one supposed site of ''Egbert's Stone'', the mustering place before the battle.<ref>Horspool, ''Why Alfred Burnt the Cakes'', p. 173.

He overthrew the Pagans with great slaughter, and smiting the fugitives, he pursued them as far as the fortress.\"<ref name=smyth26/>}}\n\nAfter the victory, when the Danes had taken refuge in the fortress, the West Saxons removed all food that the Danes might be able to capture in a sortie, and waited.<ref name=smyth26/> After two weeks, the hungry Danes sued for peace, giving Alfred \"preliminary hostages and solemn oaths that they would leave his kingdom immediately\", just as usual, but in addition promising that Guthrum would be baptized.<ref name=\"g76l26\"/> The primary difference between this agreement and the treaties at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Exeter]] was that Alfred had decisively defeated the Danes at Edington, rather than just stopping them, and therefore it seemed more likely that they would keep to the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe primary reason for Alfred's victory was probably the relative size of the two armies. The men of even one [[shire]] could be a formidable fighting force, as those of [[Devon]] proved in the same year, defeating an army under [[Ubba|Ubbe Ragnarsson]] at the [[Battle of Cynwit]].<ref name=smyth26/> In addition, in 875 Guthrum had lost the support of other Danish lords, including Ivar and Ubba. Further Danish forces had settled on the land before Guthrum attacked Wessex: in East Anglia, and in Mercia between the treaty at Exeter and the attack on Chippenham; many others were lost in a storm off [[Swanage]] in 876-7, with 120 ships wrecked.<ref name=S74/> Internal disunity was threatening to tear the Danes apart, and they needed time to reorganize.

These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine: and not long after, on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year, the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy-island (Lindisfarne), by rapine and slaughter.\"</ref> After the sacking of Lindisfarne the raids around the coasts were somewhat sporadic until the 830s when the attacks became more sustained.<ref name=\"sawyer52\">Sawyer, ''Illustrated History of Vikings'', p. 52</ref> In 835, \"heathen men\" ravaged Sheppey.<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/> In 836, [[Egbert of Wessex|Ecgberht of Wessex]] met in battle a force of 35 ships at [[Carhampton]],<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/> and in 838 he faced a combined force of Vikings and [[Cornishman|Cornishmen]] at [[Hingston Down]] in Cornwall.<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/>\n\nThe raiding continued and with each year became more intense.<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/> In 865/866 it escalated further on the arrival of what the Saxons called the [[Great Heathen Army]].<ref name=\"sawyer52\"/> The annals do not report the size of the army, but modern estimates suggest between five hundred and a thousand men.<ref name=jones219 /> It was said to have been under the leadership of the brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Ubba]], and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]].<ref name=jones219>Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', p. 219</ref> What made this army different from those before it was its intent. Its arrival began \"a new stage, that of conquest and residence\".<ref name=jones218 >Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', p. 218</ref> By 870, the Northmen had conquered the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], and in 871 they attacked Wessex. Of the nine battles mentioned by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' during that year, only one was a West Saxon victory; but in this year Alfred succeeded his brother Ethelred, who died after the [[Battle of Merton]].<ref name=garmonsway70>Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 70-73</ref>\n\n[[Mercia]] had collapsed by 874, and the Army's cohesion went with it. Halfdan went back to Northumbria and fought the [[Picts]] and the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] Welsh to secure his northern kingdom.<ref name=\"jones221\">Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'', p. 221</ref> His army settled there and he is not mentioned after 876, when \"[the Danes] were engaged in ploughing and making a living for themselves\".<ref name=\"jones221\"/> Guthrum, with two other unnamed kings, \"departed for [[Cambridge]] in East Anglia\".<ref name=\"jones221\" /> He made several attacks on Wessex, starting in 875, and in the last nearly captured Alfred in his winter fortress at [[Chippenham]].<ref name=\"jones221\" />\nBy 878, the Danes held the east and northeast of England, and their defeat at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] had paused but not halted their advance. Alfred the Great had spent the winter preceding the Battle of Edington in the Somerset marsh of [[Athelney]], the nature of the country giving him some protection. In the spring of 878, he summoned his [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] forces and marched to Edington, where he met the Danes, led by Guthrum, in battle.\n\n==Alfred's position before the battle==\nGuthrum and his men had applied the usual Danish strategy of occupying a fortified town and waiting for a peace \u201ctreaty,\u201d involving money in return for a promise to leave the kingdom immediately; Alfred shadowed the army, trying to prevent more damage than had already occurred. This started in 875 when Guthrum's army \u201celuded the West Saxon levies and got into Wareham\u201d.<ref name=\"G74\">Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 74</ref> They then gave hostages and oaths to leave the country to Alfred, who paid them off.<ref name=\"Smyth 70\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 70</ref> The Danes promptly slipped off to Exeter, even deeper into Alfred's kingdom, where they concluded in the autumn of 877 a \"firm peace\" with Alfred,<ref name=G74/> under terms that entailed their leaving his kingdom and not returning.<ref name=\"Smyth 72\">Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 72</ref> This they did, spending the rest of 877 (by the Gregorian calendar) in [[Gloucester]].<ref name=\"Smyth 72\"/> Alfred spent [[Christmas]] at Chippenham, thirty miles from Gloucester. The Danes attacked Chippenham \"in midwinter after Twelfth Night\",<ref name=G74/> probably during the night of 6\u20137 January 878. They captured Chippenham and forced Alfred to retreat \"with a small force\" into the wilderness.<ref name=G74/> It is to this period that the story of King Alfred burning the cakes belongs.<ref name=horspool2>Horspool, ''Why Alfred burnt the cakes'', pp. 2&nbsp;\u2013 3. Although there may have been an early oral tradition about the burning of the cakes, there is no contemporary evidence for the cake story. The first time it appears is one hundred years later and it may have been invented to make an obscure saint [St Neot] look good.</ref>\n\nAlfred seems at this time to have ineffectually chased the Danes around Wessex, while the Danes were in a position to do as they pleased. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' attempts to convey the impression that Alfred held the initiative; it is \"a bland chronicle which laconically charts the movements of the Danish victors while at the same time disingenuously striving to convey the impression that Alfred was in control\",<ref name=\"Smyth 70\" /> although it fails. Even if Alfred had caught up with the Danish force, it is unlikely that he could have accomplished anything. The fact that his army could not defend the fortified Chippenham, even in \"an age... as yet untrained in siege warfare\"<ref name=\"Smyth 70\"/> casts great doubt on its ability to defeat the Danes in an open field, unaided by fortifications. There was little that Alfred could do about the Danish menace between 875 and the end of 877, beyond repeatedly paying the invaders off.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:King Alfred's Tower, Stourhead, Somerset.jpg|thumb|left| upright=1.4 |[[King Alfred's Tower]] (1772) on one supposed site of ''Egbert's Stone'', the mustering place before the battle.<ref>Horspool, ''Why Alfred Burnt the Cakes'', p. 173.

With his small warband, a fraction of his army at Chippenham, Alfred could not hope to retake the town from the Danes, who had in previous battles (for example at [[Battle of Reading (871)|Reading]] in 871) proved themselves adept at defending fortified positions.<ref name=garmonsway70/> So he retreated to the south, preparing himself and his forces for another battle, and then defeated Guthrum and his host.

According to the ''Life'':\n\n{{quote|\"Fighting ferociously, forming a dense shield-wall against the whole army of the Pagans, and striving long and bravely...at last he [Alfred] gained the victory. He overthrew the Pagans with great slaughter, and smiting the fugitives, he pursued them as far as the fortress.\"<ref name=smyth26/>}}\n\nAfter the victory, when the Danes had taken refuge in the fortress, the West Saxons removed all food that the Danes might be able to capture in a sortie, and waited.<ref name=smyth26/> After two weeks, the hungry Danes sued for peace, giving Alfred \"preliminary hostages and solemn oaths that they would leave his kingdom immediately\", just as usual, but in addition promising that Guthrum would be baptized.<ref name=\"g76l26\"/> The primary difference between this agreement and the treaties at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Exeter]] was that Alfred had decisively defeated the Danes at Edington, rather than just stopping them, and therefore it seemed more likely that they would keep to the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe primary reason for Alfred's victory was probably the relative size of the two armies. The men of even one [[shire]] could be a formidable fighting force, as those of [[Devon]] proved in the same year, defeating an army under [[Ubba|Ubbe Ragnarsson]] at the [[Battle of Cynwit]].<ref name=smyth26/> In addition, in 875 Guthrum had lost the support of other Danish lords, including Ivar and Ubba. Further Danish forces had settled on the land before Guthrum attacked Wessex: in East Anglia, and in Mercia between the treaty at Exeter and the attack on Chippenham; many others were lost in a storm off [[Swanage]] in 876-7, with 120 ships wrecked.<ref name=S74/> Internal disunity was threatening to tear the Danes apart, and they needed time to reorganize. Fortunately for Wessex, they did not use the time available effectively.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Location of the battle==\n[[Image:asser facsimile.png|thumb|right|150px|A 1722 copy of part of Asser's Life of King Alfred.]]\nThe primary sources for the location of the battle are [[Asser]]'s ''Life of King Alfred'', which names the place as \"''Ethandun''\" and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which has ''E\u00f0andune''.

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. [[Mattie Moss Clark]].

Their biggest hits include: \"Is My Living in Vain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"He Gave Me Nothing to Lose\", \"Endow Me\", \"Jesus Is A Love Song\", \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\", \"Pure Gold\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", and their largest mainstream crossover gold-certified hit, \"You Brought the Sunshine\".

With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]],\" the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors, including New York's [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.  The recording was directed and produced by [[Donald Lawrence]] and was released as a [[CD]] on April 10, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theclarksisters.com/whatsnew.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213174605/http://www.theclarksisters.com/whatsnew.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> on EMI Gospel, followed by a CD/DVD Special Edition release June 19, 2007.

The episode, which highlighted the group's role in breaking down barriers in Gospel music, featured interviews with each sister except sister Denise Clark Bradford, who since leaving the group, relocated to California and began a ministry.\n\nIn 2009, the Clark Sisters released their second Christmas album, entitled ''The Clark Sisters' Family Christmas'', which featured special appearances by Karen's daughter Kierra Sheard, and their cousins Bill Moss, Jr. and James Moss (known as [[J.

Their first release in over a decade, features production from J. Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. [[Mattie Moss Clark]]. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. Their biggest hits include: \"Is My Living in Vain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"He Gave Me Nothing to Lose\", \"Endow Me\", \"Jesus Is A Love Song\", \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\", \"Pure Gold\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", and their largest mainstream crossover gold-certified hit, \"You Brought the Sunshine\". The Clark Sisters have won three<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22The+Clark+Sisters%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All&=Search|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|access-date=October 5, 2014}}</ref> [[Grammy Awards]]. With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]],\" the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors, including New York's [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.

Their first release in over a decade, features production from J. Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!
