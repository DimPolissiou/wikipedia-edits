In contrast to most other [[Indo-European languages]], English does not retain [[grammatical gender]] and most of its nouns, adjectives and pronouns are therefore not gender-specific. In most other Indo-European languages, nouns are grammatically masculine (as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el humano'') or grammatically feminine (as in [[French language|French]] ''la personne''), or sometimes grammatically neuter (as in [[German language|German]] ''das M\u00e4dchen''), regardless of the actual gender of the referent.\n\nIn addressing [[Grammatical_gender#Natural gender|natural gender]], English speakers use linguistic strategies that may reflect the speaker's attitude to the issue or the perceived [[Acceptance#Social acceptance|social acceptability]] of such strategies.\n\n==Debate==\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that making language less biased is not only laudable but also achievable. \nMany people find non-neutral language to be offensive.<ref>{{cite web |last = Chappell |first = Virginia |title = Tips for Using Inclusive, Gender Neutral Language |work=Marquette.edu |date=2007 |url=http://www.marquette.edu/wac/neutral/NeutralInclusiveLanguage.shtml | accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[There is] a growing awareness that language does not merely reflect the way we think: it also shapes our thinking.

Essentially this practice means that women's family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.\"<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|p=24}}</ref> Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to the professions they were less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations.<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|pp=164-166}}</ref> However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband's surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high-earning occupations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2011/05/08/the-name-change-dilemma/ |title=The Name Change Dilemma - The Juggle |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 8, 2011 |author=Sue Shelenbarger |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> Increasingly, studies have shown women's decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women's rights or marital roles, as often believed.\n\nThe practice of referring to married women by their husband's first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the [[Reverend]] Samuel May \"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\" of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[Lucretia Mott]] quickly replied: \"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=3}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] refused to be addressed as \"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\".<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=4}}</ref> The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of [[coverture]], the idea that \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\"<ref>Henry Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThere is a tendency to refer to women by their first name and to men by their surname. People therefore often assume it is a male when hearing a surname. \"Cusack, the actor\" can refer to both John Cusack and Joan Cusack but is now \"owned\" by John Cusack. Referring to women by their surname more will change this expectation pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172515-calling-men-by-their-surname-gives-them-an-unfair-career-boost|title=Calling men by their surname gives them an unfair career boost|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Problems and their resolution==\n\n===Job titles===\n{{Main|Gender-specific job title}}\nGender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include ''firefighter'' instead of ''fireman''; ''flight attendant'' instead of ''steward'' or ''stewardess''; ''bartender'' instead of ''barman'' or ''barmaid''; and ''chairperson'' or ''chair'' instead of ''chairman'' or ''chairwoman''.\n\nThere are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \"male\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including ''man''), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include ''actor'' and ''actress''; ''usher'' and ''usherette''; ''comedian'' and ''comedienne''. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using ''comedian'' rather than ''comedienne'', for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).\n\nTerms such as ''male nurse'', ''male model'' or ''female judge'' are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \"my brother is a male nurse\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with ''lady'', as in ''lady doctor'': here ''woman'' or ''female'' is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender.\n\n===Generic words for humans===\nAnother issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words ''man'', ''men'' and ''mankind'' to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.\n\nAlthough [[man (word)|the word ''man'']] originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=11-17}}</ref> In [[Old English]], the word ''[[were|wer]]'' referred to males only and ''wif'' to females only, while ''man'' referred to both,<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=134}}</ref> although in practice ''man'' was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males.<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=163}}</ref> In time, ''wer'' fell out of use, and ''man'' came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\"<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref> By the 18th century, ''man'' had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. [[Anthony Trollope]], for example, writes of \"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=26}}</ref> and when \"[[Edmund Burke]], writing of the [[French Revolution]], used ''men'' in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France....'\"<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\">{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \"man\" are often not in fact generic. Miller and Swift illustrate with the following quotation:\n<blockquote>\"As for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth....\"\n</blockquote>\n\"If ''man'' and ''he'' were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been ''he has difficulties in childbirth''\", Miller and Swift comment.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=15}}</ref> Writing for the [[American Philosophical Association]], Virginia L. Warren follows Janice Moulton and suggests truly generic uses of the word ''man'' would be perceived as \"false, funny, or insulting\", offering as an example the sentence \"Some men are female.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warren |first1=Virginia L. |title=Guidelines for Non-Sexist Use of Language |url=https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]] |accessdate=29 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302025159/https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |archivedate=2 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFurther, some commentators point out that the ostensibly gender-neutral use of ''man'' has in fact sometimes been used to exclude women:<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=492}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] did not make the same distinction in declaring that \"all men are created equal\" and \"governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].\" In a time when women, having no vote, could neither give nor withhold consent, Jefferson had to be using the word ''men'' in its principal sense of ''males'', and it probably never occurred to him that anyone would think otherwise.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\"/>\n</blockquote>\nFor reasons like those above, proponents of gender-neutral language argue that linguistic clarity as well as equality would be better served by having ''man'' and ''men'' refer unambiguously to males, and ''human(s)'' or ''people'' to all persons;<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=493}}</ref> similarly, the word ''mankind'' replaced by ''humankind'' or ''humanity''<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=27}}</ref><!--\n\nIn gender-neutral language, when the description of defined genders has a practical need, the words \"Male and Female\" are often used as opposed to \"Men and Women\" in an attempt to make emphasis on the scientific features of male and female humans as opposed to cultural associations and baggage that may come with the words \"Men and Women\". {{clarification needed|date=January 2013}}-->\n\nThe use of the word ''man'' as a generic word referring to all humans has been declining, particularly among female speakers and writers.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988\"/>\n\n===Pronouns===\n{{See also|Third-person pronoun#English}}\nAnother target of frequent criticism by proponents of gender-neutral language is the use of the masculine [[English personal pronouns|pronoun]] ''he'' (and its derived forms ''him'', ''his'' and ''himself'') to refer to antecedents of [[Grammatical gender#Mixed and indeterminate gender|indeterminate gender]]. Although this usage is traditional, its critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority.<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|pp=147}}. Among writers defending the usage of generic ''he'', the author cites a Thomas Wilson, writing in 1553, and grammarian Joshua Poole (1646).</ref> The use of the generic ''he'' was approved in an Act of Parliament, the [[Interpretation Act 1850]] (the provision continues in the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). However, despite its putative inclusiveness, it has been used to deny women's entry into professions and schools.<ref name=\"UPenn\">{{cite web |author=Carolyn Jacobsen |title=Some Notes on Gender-Neutral Language |work=english.upenn.edu |url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702092056/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archivedate=2 July 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nProposed alternatives to the generic ''he'' include ''he or she'' (or ''she or he''), ''s/he'', or the use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']]. Each of these alternatives has met with objections. Some feel the use of singular ''they'' to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, ''they'', ''their'' and ''them'' have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the [[Middle Ages]], including by a number of prominent authors, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Churchyard |first=Henry |title=Jane Austen and other famous authors violate what everyone learned in their English class |url=http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html | accessdate=14 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430053036/http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html |archivedate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Linguist [[Steven Pinker]] goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular \"they\" are themselves incorrect:\n<blockquote>The logical point that you, [[Holden Caulfield]], and everyone but the language mavens intuitively grasp is that ''everyone'' and ''they'' are not an \"antecedent\" and a \"pronoun\" referring to the same person in the world, which would force them to agree in number. They are a \"quantifier\" and a \"bound variable\", a different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \"For all X, X returned to X's seat.\" The \"X\" does not refer to any particular person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X comes back to.

When the [[Reverend]] Samuel May \"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\" of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[Lucretia Mott]] quickly replied: \"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=3}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] refused to be addressed as \"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\".<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=4}}</ref> The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of [[coverture]], the idea that \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\"<ref>Henry Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThere is a tendency to refer to women by their first name and to men by their surname. People therefore often assume it is a male when hearing a surname. \"Cusack, the actor\" can refer to both John Cusack and Joan Cusack but is now \"owned\" by John Cusack. Referring to women by their surname more will change this expectation pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172515-calling-men-by-their-surname-gives-them-an-unfair-career-boost|title=Calling men by their surname gives them an unfair career boost|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Problems and their resolution==\n\n===Job titles===\n{{Main|Gender-specific job title}}\nGender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include ''firefighter'' instead of ''fireman''; ''flight attendant'' instead of ''steward'' or ''stewardess''; ''bartender'' instead of ''barman'' or ''barmaid''; and ''chairperson'' or ''chair'' instead of ''chairman'' or ''chairwoman''.\n\nThere are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \"male\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including ''man''), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include ''actor'' and ''actress''; ''usher'' and ''usherette''; ''comedian'' and ''comedienne''. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using ''comedian'' rather than ''comedienne'', for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).\n\nTerms such as ''male nurse'', ''male model'' or ''female judge'' are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \"my brother is a male nurse\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with ''lady'', as in ''lady doctor'': here ''woman'' or ''female'' is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender.\n\n===Generic words for humans===\nAnother issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words ''man'', ''men'' and ''mankind'' to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.\n\nAlthough [[man (word)|the word ''man'']] originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=11-17}}</ref> In [[Old English]], the word ''[[were|wer]]'' referred to males only and ''wif'' to females only, while ''man'' referred to both,<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=134}}</ref> although in practice ''man'' was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males.<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=163}}</ref> In time, ''wer'' fell out of use, and ''man'' came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\"<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref> By the 18th century, ''man'' had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. [[Anthony Trollope]], for example, writes of \"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=26}}</ref> and when \"[[Edmund Burke]], writing of the [[French Revolution]], used ''men'' in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France....'\"<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\">{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \"man\" are often not in fact generic.

Although this usage is traditional, its critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority.<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|pp=147}}. Among writers defending the usage of generic ''he'', the author cites a Thomas Wilson, writing in 1553, and grammarian Joshua Poole (1646).</ref> The use of the generic ''he'' was approved in an Act of Parliament, the [[Interpretation Act 1850]] (the provision continues in the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). However, despite its putative inclusiveness, it has been used to deny women's entry into professions and schools.<ref name=\"UPenn\">{{cite web |author=Carolyn Jacobsen |title=Some Notes on Gender-Neutral Language |work=english.upenn.edu |url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702092056/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archivedate=2 July 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nProposed alternatives to the generic ''he'' include ''he or she'' (or ''she or he''), ''s/he'', or the use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']]. Each of these alternatives has met with objections. Some feel the use of singular ''they'' to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, ''they'', ''their'' and ''them'' have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the [[Middle Ages]], including by a number of prominent authors, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Churchyard |first=Henry |title=Jane Austen and other famous authors violate what everyone learned in their English class |url=http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html | accessdate=14 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430053036/http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html |archivedate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Linguist [[Steven Pinker]] goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular \"they\" are themselves incorrect:\n<blockquote>The logical point that you, [[Holden Caulfield]], and everyone but the language mavens intuitively grasp is that ''everyone'' and ''they'' are not an \"antecedent\" and a \"pronoun\" referring to the same person in the world, which would force them to agree in number. They are a \"quantifier\" and a \"bound variable\", a different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \"For all X, X returned to X's seat.\" The \"X\" does not refer to any particular person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X comes back to. The ''their'' there does not, in fact, have plural number, because it refers neither to one thing nor to many things; it does not refer at all.<ref>{{harvp|Pinker |2000}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSome [[style guide]]s {{which|date=April 2020}} accept singular ''they'' as grammatically correct,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Guide to English Usage |last=Peters |first=Pam |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62181-6 |page= |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguideto00pete_0 |ref= }}</ref> while others reject it.

System calls are [[thunk]]ed for [[endianness]] and for 32/64 bit mismatches. Fast cross-compilation and cross-debugging are the main targets for user-mode emulation.\n;System emulation: In this mode QEMU emulates a full computer system, including [[peripheral]]s. It can be used to provide virtual hosting of several virtual computers on a single computer. QEMU can boot many guest [[operating system]]s, including [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[DOS]], and [[BSD]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claunia.com/qemu/|title=QEMU OS Support List|website=www.claunia.com}}</ref> it supports emulating several instruction sets, including [[x86]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], 32-bit [[ARMv7]], [[ARMv8]], [[PowerPC]], [[SPARC]], [[ETRAX CRIS]] and [[MicroBlaze]].\n;KVM Hosting: Here QEMU deals with the setting up and migration of KVM images. It is still involved in the emulation of hardware, but the execution of the guest is done by KVM as requested by QEMU.\n;Xen Hosting: QEMU is involved only in the emulation of hardware; the execution of the guest is done within Xen and is totally hidden from QEMU.\n\n==Features==\nQEMU can save and restore the state of the virtual machine with all programs running. Guest operating systems do not need patching in order to run inside QEMU.\n\nQEMU supports the emulation of various architectures, including:\n* [[IA-32]] (x86) PCs\n* [[x86-64]] PCs\n* [[MIPS architecture|MIPS64]] Release 6<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.prplfoundation.org/wiki/QEMU_PRIP_1_-_support_for_MIPS64_Release_6|title=QEMU PRIP 1 - support for MIPS64 Release 6 - PRPL|website=wiki.prplfoundation.org}}</ref> and earlier variants\n* Sun's [[SPARC]] sun4m\n* Sun's [[SPARC]] sun4u\n* [[ARM architecture|ARM]] development boards (Integrator/CP and Versatile/PB)\n* [[SuperH|SH4]] SHIX board\n* [[PowerPC]] ([[PReP]] and [[Power Macintosh]])\n* [[ETRAX CRIS]]\n* [[MicroBlaze]]\n* [[RISC-V]]\n\nThe virtual machine can interface with many types of physical host hardware, including the user's hard disks, CD-ROM drives, network cards, audio interfaces, and USB devices. USB devices can be completely emulated, or the host's USB devices can be used, although this requires administrator privileges and does not work with all devices.\n\nVirtual disk images can be stored in a special format ([[qcow|qcow or qcow2]]) that only takes up as much disk space as the guest OS actually uses. This way, an emulated 120&nbsp;GB disk may occupy only a few hundred megabytes on the host. The QCOW2 format also allows the creation of overlay images that record the difference from another (unmodified) base image file. This provides the possibility for reverting the emulated disk's contents to an earlier state. For example, a base image could hold a fresh install of an operating system that is known to work, and the overlay images are used. Should the guest system become unusable (through virus attack, accidental system destruction, etc.), the user can delete the overlay and use an earlier emulated disk image.\n\nQEMU can emulate network cards (of different models) which share the host system's connectivity by doing network address translation, effectively allowing the guest to use the same network as the host. The virtual network cards can also connect to network cards of other instances of QEMU or to local [[TUN/TAP|TAP]] interfaces. Network connectivity can also be achieved by bridging a TUN/TAP interface used by QEMU with a non-virtual Ethernet interface on the host OS using the host OS's bridging features.\n\nQEMU integrates several services to allow the host and guest systems to communicate; for example, an integrated [[Server Message Block|SMB]] server and network-port redirection (to allow incoming connections to the virtual machine). It can also boot Linux kernels without a bootloader.\n\nQEMU does not depend on the presence of graphical output methods on the host system. Instead, it can allow one to access the screen of the guest OS via an integrated [[VNC]] server. It can also use an emulated serial line, without any screen, with applicable operating systems.\n\nSimulating multiple CPUs running [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] is possible.\n\nQEMU does not require administrative rights to run unless additional kernel modules for improving speed (like [[#Accelerator|KQEMU]]) are used or certain modes of its network connectivity model are utilized.\n\n===Tiny Code Generator===\nThe Tiny Code Generator (TCG) aims to remove the shortcoming of relying on a particular version of [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] or any compiler, instead incorporating the compiler (code generator) into other tasks performed by QEMU at run time. The whole translation task thus consists of two parts: blocks of target code (''TBs'') being rewritten in '''TCG ops''' - a kind of machine-independent intermediate notation, and subsequently this notation being compiled for the host's architecture by TCG. Optional optimisation passes are performed between them.\n\nTCG requires dedicated code written to support every architecture it runs on. It also requires that the target instruction translation be rewritten to take advantage of TCG ops, instead of the previously used ''dyngen ops''.\n\nStarting with '''QEMU''' Version 0.10.0, TCG ships with the QEMU stable release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2009-03/msg00154.html|title=[Qemu-devel] ANNOUNCE: Release 0.10.0 of QEMU|website=lists.gnu.org}}</ref>\n\n===Accelerator===\n''KQEMU'' was a [[Linux kernel]] [[Loadable kernel module|module]], also written by [[Fabrice Bellard]], which notably sped up emulation of x86 or x86-64 guests on platforms with the same CPU architecture. This worked by running [[user mode]] code (and optionally some kernel code) directly on the host computer's CPU, and by using processor and peripheral emulation only for [[kernel mode|kernel-mode]] and [[real mode|real-mode]] code. KQEMU could execute code from many guest OSes even if the host CPU did not support [[hardware-assisted virtualization]]. KQEMU was initially a [[closed-source]] product available free of charge, but starting from version 1.3.0pre10,<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/220807/ |title=KQEMU 1.3.0pre10 released - under the GPL [LWN.net&#93; |publisher=Lwn.net |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=2009-01-03 }}</ref> it was [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] under the [[GNU General Public License]].

With additional improvements in QEMU by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], Loongson-3 achieves an average of 70% the performance of executing native binaries while running x86 binaries from nine benchmarks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MM.2009.30 |title=Godson-3: A Scalable Multicore RISC Processor with x86 Emulation |publisher=[[IEEE]] |accessdate=2009-04-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Parallel emulation==\nVirtualization solutions that use QEMU are able to execute multiple virtual CPUs in parallel. For user-mode emulation QEMU maps emulated threads to host threads. For full system emulation QEMU is capable of running a host thread for each emulated virtual CPU (vCPU). This is dependent on the guest having been updated to support parallel system emulation, currently ARM, Alpha, HP-PA, PowerPC, RISC-V, s390x, x86 and Xtensa. Otherwise a single thread is used to emulate all virtual CPUS (vCPUS) which executes each vCPU in a round-robin manner.\n\n==Integration==\n\n===VirtualBox===\n[[VirtualBox]], first released in January 2007, uses some of QEMU's virtual hardware devices, and has a built-in [[Dynamic recompilation|dynamic recompiler]] based on QEMU. As with KQEMU, VirtualBox runs nearly all guest code natively on the host via the VMM (Virtual Machine Manager) and uses the recompiler only as a fallback mechanism - for example, when guest code executes in [[real mode]].<ref>{{cite web \n | url        = http://virtualbox.org/wiki/Developer_FAQ \n | title      = VirtualBox Developer FAQ \n | accessdate = 2015-02-02}}</ref>\nIn addition, VirtualBox does a lot of code analysis and patching using a built-in disassembler in order to minimize recompilation. VirtualBox is free and open-source (available under [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]), except for certain features.\n\n===Xen-HVM===\n[[Xen]], a virtual machine monitor, can run in HVM (hardware virtual machine) mode, using [[Intel VT-x]] or [[AMD-V]] hardware [[x86 virtualization]] extensions and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[ARM Cortex-A7|Cortex-A7]] and [[ARM Cortex-A15|Cortex-A15]] virtualization extension.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_ARM_with_Virtualization_Extensions |title=Xen ARM with Virtualization Extensions }}</ref> This means that instead of paravirtualized devices, a real set of virtual hardware is exposed to the domU to use real device drivers to talk to.\n\nQEMU includes several components: CPU emulators, emulated devices, generic devices, machine descriptions, user interface, and a debugger. The emulated devices and generic devices in QEMU make up its device models for I/O virtualization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/blueprints/1107/820-3703.pdf|title=Oracle and Sun Microsystems - Strategic Acquisitions - Oracle|website=www.sun.com}}</ref> They comprise a PIIX3 IDE (with some rudimentary PIIX4 capabilities), Cirrus Logic or plain VGA emulated video, RTL8139 or E1000 network emulation, and ACPI support.<ref>[http://ian.blenke.com/xen/hvm/svm/vtx/qemu Demystifying Xen HVM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222101854/http://ian.blenke.com/xen/hvm/svm/vtx/qemu |date=December 22, 2007 }}</ref> APIC support is provided by Xen.\n\nXen-HVM has device emulation based on the QEMU project to provide I/O virtualization to the VMs. Hardware is emulated via a QEMU \"device model\" daemon running as a backend in dom0. Unlike other QEMU running modes (dynamic translation or KVM), virtual CPUs are completely managed to the hypervisor, which takes care of stopping them while QEMU is emulating memory-mapped I/O accesses.\n\n===KVM===\n[[Kernel-based Virtual Machine|KVM]] (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a FreeBSD and Linux kernel module that allows a [[user space]] program access to the [[Hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware virtualization]] features of various processors, with which QEMU is able to offer virtualization for x86, PowerPC, and S/390 guests. When the target architecture is the same as the host architecture, QEMU can make use of KVM particular features, such as acceleration.\n\n===Win4Lin Pro Desktop===\nIn early 2005, [[Win4Lin]] introduced Win4Lin Pro Desktop, based on a 'tuned' version of QEMU and KQEMU and it hosts NT-versions of Windows.

System calls are [[thunk]]ed for [[endianness]] and for 32/64 bit mismatches. Fast cross-compilation and cross-debugging are the main targets for user-mode emulation.\n;System emulation: In this mode QEMU emulates a full computer system, including [[peripheral]]s. It can be used to provide virtual hosting of several virtual computers on a single computer. QEMU can boot many guest [[operating system]]s, including [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[DOS]], and [[BSD]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claunia.com/qemu/|title=QEMU OS Support List|website=www.claunia.com}}</ref> it supports emulating several instruction sets, including [[x86]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], 32-bit [[ARMv7]], [[ARMv8]], [[PowerPC]], [[SPARC]], [[ETRAX CRIS]] and [[MicroBlaze]].\n;KVM Hosting: Here QEMU deals with the setting up and migration of KVM images. It is still involved in the emulation of hardware, but the execution of the guest is done by KVM as requested by QEMU.\n;Xen Hosting: QEMU is involved only in the emulation of hardware; the execution of the guest is done within Xen and is totally hidden from QEMU.\n\n==Features==\nQEMU can save and restore the state of the virtual machine with all programs running. Guest operating systems do not need patching in order to run inside QEMU.\n\nQEMU supports the emulation of various architectures, including:\n* [[IA-32]] (x86) PCs\n* [[x86-64]] PCs\n* [[MIPS architecture|MIPS64]] Release 6<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.prplfoundation.org/wiki/QEMU_PRIP_1_-_support_for_MIPS64_Release_6|title=QEMU PRIP 1 - support for MIPS64 Release 6 - PRPL|website=wiki.prplfoundation.org}}</ref> and earlier variants\n* Sun's [[SPARC]] sun4m\n* Sun's [[SPARC]] sun4u\n* [[ARM architecture|ARM]] development boards (Integrator/CP and Versatile/PB)\n* [[SuperH|SH4]] SHIX board\n* [[PowerPC]] ([[PReP]] and [[Power Macintosh]])\n* [[ETRAX CRIS]]\n* [[MicroBlaze]]\n* [[RISC-V]]\n\nThe virtual machine can interface with many types of physical host hardware, including the user's hard disks, CD-ROM drives, network cards, audio interfaces, and USB devices. USB devices can be completely emulated, or the host's USB devices can be used, although this requires administrator privileges and does not work with all devices.\n\nVirtual disk images can be stored in a special format ([[qcow|qcow or qcow2]]) that only takes up as much disk space as the guest OS actually uses. This way, an emulated 120&nbsp;GB disk may occupy only a few hundred megabytes on the host. The QCOW2 format also allows the creation of overlay images that record the difference from another (unmodified) base image file. This provides the possibility for reverting the emulated disk's contents to an earlier state. For example, a base image could hold a fresh install of an operating system that is known to work, and the overlay images are used. Should the guest system become unusable (through virus attack, accidental system destruction, etc.), the user can delete the overlay and use an earlier emulated disk image.\n\nQEMU can emulate network cards (of different models) which share the host system's connectivity by doing network address translation, effectively allowing the guest to use the same network as the host. The virtual network cards can also connect to network cards of other instances of QEMU or to local [[TUN/TAP|TAP]] interfaces. Network connectivity can also be achieved by bridging a TUN/TAP interface used by QEMU with a non-virtual Ethernet interface on the host OS using the host OS's bridging features.\n\nQEMU integrates several services to allow the host and guest systems to communicate; for example, an integrated [[Server Message Block|SMB]] server and network-port redirection (to allow incoming connections to the virtual machine). It can also boot Linux kernels without a bootloader.\n\nQEMU does not depend on the presence of graphical output methods on the host system. Instead, it can allow one to access the screen of the guest OS via an integrated [[VNC]] server. It can also use an emulated serial line, without any screen, with applicable operating systems.\n\nSimulating multiple CPUs running [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] is possible.\n\nQEMU does not require administrative rights to run unless additional kernel modules for improving speed (like [[#Accelerator|KQEMU]]) are used or certain modes of its network connectivity model are utilized.\n\n===Tiny Code Generator===\nThe Tiny Code Generator (TCG) aims to remove the shortcoming of relying on a particular version of [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] or any compiler, instead incorporating the compiler (code generator) into other tasks performed by QEMU at run time. The whole translation task thus consists of two parts: blocks of target code (''TBs'') being rewritten in '''TCG ops''' - a kind of machine-independent intermediate notation, and subsequently this notation being compiled for the host's architecture by TCG. Optional optimisation passes are performed between them.\n\nTCG requires dedicated code written to support every architecture it runs on. It also requires that the target instruction translation be rewritten to take advantage of TCG ops, instead of the previously used ''dyngen ops''.\n\nStarting with '''QEMU''' Version 0.10.0, TCG ships with the QEMU stable release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2009-03/msg00154.html|title=[Qemu-devel] ANNOUNCE: Release 0.10.0 of QEMU|website=lists.gnu.org}}</ref>\n\n===Accelerator===\n''KQEMU'' was a [[Linux kernel]] [[Loadable kernel module|module]], also written by [[Fabrice Bellard]], which notably sped up emulation of x86 or x86-64 guests on platforms with the same CPU architecture. This worked by running [[user mode]] code (and optionally some kernel code) directly on the host computer's CPU, and by using processor and peripheral emulation only for [[kernel mode|kernel-mode]] and [[real mode|real-mode]] code. KQEMU could execute code from many guest OSes even if the host CPU did not support [[hardware-assisted virtualization]]. KQEMU was initially a [[closed-source]] product available free of charge, but starting from version 1.3.0pre10,<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/220807/ |title=KQEMU 1.3.0pre10 released - under the GPL [LWN.net&#93; |publisher=Lwn.net |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=2009-01-03 }}</ref> it was [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] under the [[GNU General Public License]].

With additional improvements in QEMU by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], Loongson-3 achieves an average of 70% the performance of executing native binaries while running x86 binaries from nine benchmarks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MM.2009.30 |title=Godson-3: A Scalable Multicore RISC Processor with x86 Emulation |publisher=[[IEEE]] |accessdate=2009-04-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Parallel emulation==\nVirtualization solutions that use QEMU are able to execute multiple virtual CPUs in parallel. For user-mode emulation QEMU maps emulated threads to host threads. For full system emulation QEMU is capable of running a host thread for each emulated virtual CPU (vCPU). This is dependent on the guest having been updated to support parallel system emulation, currently ARM, Alpha, HP-PA, PowerPC, RISC-V, s390x, x86 and Xtensa. Otherwise a single thread is used to emulate all virtual CPUS (vCPUS) which executes each vCPU in a round-robin manner.\n\n==Integration==\n\n===VirtualBox===\n[[VirtualBox]], first released in January 2007, uses some of QEMU's virtual hardware devices, and has a built-in [[Dynamic recompilation|dynamic recompiler]] based on QEMU. As with KQEMU, VirtualBox runs nearly all guest code natively on the host via the VMM (Virtual Machine Manager) and uses the recompiler only as a fallback mechanism - for example, when guest code executes in [[real mode]].<ref>{{cite web \n | url        = http://virtualbox.org/wiki/Developer_FAQ \n | title      = VirtualBox Developer FAQ \n | accessdate = 2015-02-02}}</ref>\nIn addition, VirtualBox does a lot of code analysis and patching using a built-in disassembler in order to minimize recompilation. VirtualBox is free and open-source (available under [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]), except for certain features.\n\n===Xen-HVM===\n[[Xen]], a virtual machine monitor, can run in HVM (hardware virtual machine) mode, using [[Intel VT-x]] or [[AMD-V]] hardware [[x86 virtualization]] extensions and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[ARM Cortex-A7|Cortex-A7]] and [[ARM Cortex-A15|Cortex-A15]] virtualization extension.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_ARM_with_Virtualization_Extensions |title=Xen ARM with Virtualization Extensions }}</ref> This means that instead of paravirtualized devices, a real set of virtual hardware is exposed to the domU to use real device drivers to talk to.\n\nQEMU includes several components: CPU emulators, emulated devices, generic devices, machine descriptions, user interface, and a debugger. The emulated devices and generic devices in QEMU make up its device models for I/O virtualization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/blueprints/1107/820-3703.pdf|title=Oracle and Sun Microsystems - Strategic Acquisitions - Oracle|website=www.sun.com}}</ref> They comprise a PIIX3 IDE (with some rudimentary PIIX4 capabilities), Cirrus Logic or plain VGA emulated video, RTL8139 or E1000 network emulation, and ACPI support.<ref>[http://ian.blenke.com/xen/hvm/svm/vtx/qemu Demystifying Xen HVM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222101854/http://ian.blenke.com/xen/hvm/svm/vtx/qemu |date=December 22, 2007 }}</ref> APIC support is provided by Xen.\n\nXen-HVM has device emulation based on the QEMU project to provide I/O virtualization to the VMs. Hardware is emulated via a QEMU \"device model\" daemon running as a backend in dom0. Unlike other QEMU running modes (dynamic translation or KVM), virtual CPUs are completely managed to the hypervisor, which takes care of stopping them while QEMU is emulating memory-mapped I/O accesses.\n\n===KVM===\n[[Kernel-based Virtual Machine|KVM]] (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a FreeBSD and Linux kernel module that allows a [[user space]] program access to the [[Hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware virtualization]] features of various processors, with which QEMU is able to offer virtualization for x86, PowerPC, and S/390 guests. When the target architecture is the same as the host architecture, QEMU can make use of KVM particular features, such as acceleration.\n\n===Win4Lin Pro Desktop===\nIn early 2005, [[Win4Lin]] introduced Win4Lin Pro Desktop, based on a 'tuned' version of QEMU and KQEMU and it hosts NT-versions of Windows.

Eutrophication is often induced by the discharge of [[nitrate]] or [[phosphate]]-containing [[detergent]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, or [[sewage]] into an aquatic system.\n\n==Mechanism of eutrophication==\nEutrophication most commonly arises from the oversupply of nutrients, most commonly as nitrogen or phosphorus, which leads to overgrowth of plants and algae in aquatic ecosystems. After such organisms die, bacterial degradation of their biomass results in oxygen consumption, thereby creating the state of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].\n\nAccording to Ullmann's Encyclopedia, \"the primary limiting factor for eutrophication is phosphate.\"  The availability of phosphorus generally promotes excessive plant growth and decay, favouring simple algae and plankton over other more complicated plants, and causes a severe reduction in water quality. Phosphorus is a necessary nutrient for plants to live, and is the limiting factor for plant growth in many freshwater ecosystems.  Phosphate adheres tightly to soil, so it is mainly transported by erosion. Once translocated to lakes, the extraction of phosphate into water is slow, hence the difficulty of reversing the effects of eutrophication.<ref name=Nasir>Khan, M. Nasir and Mohammad, F.

This decomposition process consumes oxygen, which reduces the concentration of dissolved oxygen.  The depleted oxygen levels in turn may lead to [[fish kill]]s and a range of other effects reducing biodiversity. Nutrients may become concentrated in an anoxic zone and may only be made available again during autumn turn-over or in conditions of turbulent flow. The dead algae and the organic load carried by the water inflows in to the lake settle at its bottom and undergoes [[anaerobic digestion]] releasing [[greenhouse gases]] like methane and CO<sub>2</sub>. Some part of methane gas is consumed by the anaerobic [[Methanotroph|methane oxidation bacteria]] which in turn works as food source to the [[zooplankton]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.igb-berlin.de/en/news/climate-gases-water-bodies |title= Climate gases from water bodies|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> In case the lake is not deficit of dissolved oxygen at all depths the aerobic methane oxidation bacteria like [[Methylococcus capsulatus]] can consume most of the methane by releasing CO<sub>2</sub> which in turn aid the production of algae.

Runoff from [[agriculture]] and development, pollution from [[septic system]]s and [[sanitary sewer|sewers]], [[sewage sludge]] spreading, and other human-related activities increase the flow of both inorganic nutrients and organic substances into ecosystems. Elevated levels of atmospheric compounds of [[nitrogen]] can increase nitrogen availability. [[Phosphorus]] is often regarded as the main culprit in cases of eutrophication in lakes subjected to \"point source\" pollution from sewage pipes. The concentration of algae and the trophic state of lakes correspond well to phosphorus levels in water. Studies conducted in the Experimental Lakes Area in Ontario have shown a relationship between the addition of phosphorus and the rate of eutrophication. Humankind has increased the rate of [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus cycling]] on Earth by four times, mainly due to agricultural fertilizer production and application. Between 1950 and 1995, an estimated 600,000,000 [[tonne]]s of phosphorus was applied to Earth's surface, primarily on croplands.<ref name=\"Carpenter, S.R. 1998\">{{cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = S.R. | last2 = Caraco | first2 = N.F. | last3 = Smith | first3 = V.H. | year = 1998 | title = Nonpoint pollution of surface waters with phosphorus and nitrogen | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 559\u2013568 | doi = 10.2307/2641247 | jstor = 2641247 | hdl = 1813/60811 | url = https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/60811/1/Carpenter_et_al-1998-Ecological_Applications.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Natural eutrophication===<!--pretty specialised-->\nAlthough eutrophication is commonly caused by human activities, it can also be a natural process, particularly in lakes.

Upwelling in coastal systems also promotes increased productivity by conveying deep, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, where the nutrients can be assimilated by [[algae]]. Examples of anthropogenic sources of nitrogen-rich pollution to coastal waters include seacage [[fish farming]] and discharges of [[ammonia]] from the production of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] from coal.\n\nThe [[World Resources Institute]] has identified 375 [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] coastal zones in the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly Japan.<ref>\nSelman, Mindy (2007) ''Eutrophication: An Overview of Status, Trends, Policies, and Strategies.''

Forest [[undergrowth]] affected by run-off from a nearby fertilized field can be turned into a [[nettle]] and [[bramble]] thicket.\n\nChemical forms of nitrogen are most often of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N<sub>2</sub>, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on [[microbe|microbial]] [[nitrogen fixation]] to convert N<sub>2</sub> into other forms such as [[nitrate]]s. However, there is a limit to how much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a [[Limiting factor|limiting nutrient]].<ref name=\"Hornung 1995\">Hornung M., Sutton M.A. and Wilson R.B.

It has been shown<ref name=\"Sharpley 1996\">{{cite journal|vauthors = Sharpley AN, Daniel TC, Sims JT, Pote DH |year= 1996|title= Determining environmentally sound soil phosphorus levels|journal= Journal of Soil and Water Conservation |volume=51|pages=160\u2013166|url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/20713/PDF}}</ref> that the amount of [[phosphorus]] lost to surface waters increases linearly with the amount of phosphorus in the soil. Thus much of the nutrient loading in soil eventually makes its way to water. Nitrogen, similarly, has a [[turnover time]] of decades.\n\n====Runoff to surface water====\nNutrients from human activities tend to travel from land to either surface or ground water. Nitrogen in particular is removed through [[storm drains]], sewage pipes, and other forms of [[surface runoff]].\nNutrient losses in runoff and [[leachate]] are often associated with [[agriculture]]. Modern agriculture often involves the application of nutrients onto fields in order to maximise production. However, farmers frequently apply more nutrients than are taken up by crops<ref name=\"Buol 1995\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Buol | first1 = S.

Regulations aimed at minimising nutrient exports from agriculture are typically far less stringent than those placed on sewage treatment plants<ref name=\"Carpenter, S.R. 1998\"/> and other point source polluters. It should be also noted that lakes within forested land are also under surface runoff influences. Runoff can wash out the mineral nitrogen and phosphorus from detritus and in consequence supply the water bodies leading to slow, natural eutrophication.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Klimaszyk, P.  |author2=Rzymski, P.|title= Surface Runoff as a Factor Determining Trophic State of Midforest Lake|journal= Polish Journal of Environmental Studies|year= 2010|volume= 20|issue=5|pages= 1203\u20131210|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51986191}}</ref>\n\n====Atmospheric deposition====\nNitrogen is released into the air because of [[ammonia]] [[volatilization]] and nitrous oxide production. The [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuels]] is a large human-initiated contributor to atmospheric nitrogen pollution. Atmospheric nitrogen reaches the ground by two different processes, the first being wet deposition such as rain or snow, and the second being dry deposition which is particles and gases found in the air.<ref>{{cite web|title=Critical Loads \u2013 Atmospheric Deposition|url=https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/airqualityportal/critical_loads/atmospheric_deposition.php|website=U.S Forest Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Atmospheric deposition (e.g., in the form of [[acid rain]]) can also affect nutrient concentration in water,<ref name=\"Paerl 1997\">{{cite journal|author=Paerl H.

In modeling eutrophication, the rate of water renewal plays a critical role; [[stagnant water]] is allowed to collect more nutrients than bodies with replenished water supplies. It has also been shown that the drying of [[wetlands]] causes an increase in nutrient concentration and subsequent eutrophication blooms.<ref name=\"Mungall 1991\">Mungall C. and McLaren, D.J.

Reducing eutrophication should be a key concern when considering future policy, and a [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable solution]] for everyone, including farmers and ranchers, seems feasible. While eutrophication does pose problems, humans should be aware that natural runoff (which causes algal blooms in the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels. Cleanup measures have been mostly, but not completely, successful. [[Finland|Finnish]] phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges. These efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency.<ref name=\"Raike 2003\">{{Cite journal \n| last1 = R\u00e4ike | first1 = A. \n| last2 = Pietil\u00e4inen | first2 = O. -P. \n| last3 = Rekolainen | first3 = S. \n| last4 = Kauppila | first4 = P. \n| last5 = Pitk\u00e4nen | first5 = H. \n| last6 = Niemi | first6 = J. \n| last7 = Raateland | first7 = A. \n| last8 = Vuorenmaa | first8 = J. \n| doi = 10.1016/S0048-9697(02)00622-8 \n| title = Trends of phosphorus, nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations in Finnish rivers and lakes in 1975\u20132000 \n| journal = Science of the Total Environment \n| volume = 310 \n| issue = 1\u20133 \n| pages = 47\u201359 \n| year = 2003 \n| pmid = 12812730 \n| pmc = \n| bibcode = 2003ScTEn.310...47R}}</ref> Still, some targeted point sources did not show a decrease in runoff despite reduction efforts.\n\n===Shellfish in estuaries: unique solutions===\nOne proposed solution to stop and reverse eutrophication in estuaries is to restore shellfish populations, such as [[oysters]] and [[mussels]].

The literature suggests, though, that when these sources are controlled, eutrophication decreases. The following steps are recommended to minimize the amount of pollution that can enter aquatic ecosystems from ambiguous sources.\n\n====Riparian buffer zones====\nStudies show that intercepting non-point pollution between the source and the water is a successful means of prevention.<ref name=\"Carpenter, S.R. 1998\"/> [[riparian|Riparian buffer zones]] are interfaces between a flowing body of water and land, and have been created near waterways in an attempt to filter pollutants; [[sediment]] and nutrients are deposited here instead of in water. Creating buffer zones near farms and roads is another possible way to prevent nutrients from traveling too far. Still, studies have shown<ref name=\"Agnold 1997\">{{cite journal|author=Angold P. G. |year=1997|title= The Impact of a Road Upon Adjacent Heathland Vegetation: Effects on Plant Species Composition|journal= The Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=34|pages=409\u2013417|jstor=2404886|doi=10.2307/2404886|issue=2}}</ref> that the effects of atmospheric nitrogen pollution can reach far past the buffer zone. This suggests that the most effective means of prevention is from the primary source.\n\n====Prevention policy====\nLaws regulating the discharge and [[treatment of sewage]] have led to dramatic nutrient reductions to surrounding ecosystems,<ref name=\"Smith 1999\"/> but it is generally agreed that a policy regulating agricultural use of [[fertilizer]] and animal waste must be imposed. In Japan the amount of nitrogen produced by livestock is adequate to serve the fertilizer needs for the agriculture industry.<ref name=\"Kumazawa 2002\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kumazawa | first1 = K. | journal = Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems | volume = 63 | issue = 2/3 | pages = 129\u2013137 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021198721003 |title=Nitrogen fertilization and nitrate pollution in groundwater in Japan: Present status and measures for sustainable agriculture| year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Thus, it is not unreasonable to command livestock owners to clean up animal waste\u2014which when left stagnant will [[Leaching (pedology)|leach]] into ground water.\n\nPolicy concerning the prevention and reduction of eutrophication can be broken down into four sectors: Technologies, public participation, economic instruments, and cooperation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[http://www.unep.or.jp/ietc/Publications/TechPublications/TechPub-11/ \"Planning and Management of Lakes and Reservoirs: An Integrated Approach to Eutrophication.\"] United Nations Environment Programme, Newsletter and Technical Publications.

Ch.3.4 (2000).</ref> The term technology is used loosely, referring to a more widespread use of existing methods rather than an appropriation of new technologies. As mentioned before, nonpoint sources of pollution are the primary contributors to eutrophication, and their effects can be easily minimized through common agricultural practices. Reducing the amount of pollutants that reach a watershed can be achieved through the protection of its forest cover, reducing the amount of erosion leeching into a watershed. Also, through the efficient, controlled use of land using sustainable agricultural practices to minimize land degradation, the amount of soil runoff and nitrogen-based fertilizers reaching a watershed can be reduced.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Oglesby, R.

In order for a policy to have any effect, the public must be aware of their contribution to the problem, and ways in which they can reduce their effects. Programs instituted to promote participation in the recycling and elimination of wastes, as well as education on the issue of rational water use are necessary to protect water quality within urbanized areas and adjacent water bodies.\n\nEconomic instruments, \"which include, among others, property rights, water markets, fiscal and financial instruments, charge systems and liability systems, are gradually becoming a substantive component of the management tool set used for pollution control and water allocation decisions.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Incentives for those who practice clean, renewable, water management technologies are an effective means of encouraging pollution prevention. By internalizing the costs associated with the negative effects on the environment, governments are able to encourage a cleaner water management.\n\nBecause a body of water can have an effect on a range of people reaching far beyond that of the watershed, cooperation between different organizations is necessary to prevent the intrusion of contaminants that can lead to eutrophication. Agencies ranging from state governments to those of water resource management and non-governmental organizations, going as low as the local population, are responsible for preventing eutrophication of water bodies. In the United States, the most well known inter-state effort to prevent eutrophication is the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150111125613/http://dnr.state.md.us/bay/monitoring/limit/index.html Nutrient Limitation].

Eutrophication is often induced by the discharge of [[nitrate]] or [[phosphate]]-containing [[detergent]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, or [[sewage]] into an aquatic system.\n\n==Mechanism of eutrophication==\nEutrophication most commonly arises from the oversupply of nutrients, most commonly as nitrogen or phosphorus, which leads to overgrowth of plants and algae in aquatic ecosystems. After such organisms die, bacterial degradation of their biomass results in oxygen consumption, thereby creating the state of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].\n\nAccording to Ullmann's Encyclopedia, \"the primary limiting factor for eutrophication is phosphate.\"  The availability of phosphorus generally promotes excessive plant growth and decay, favouring simple algae and plankton over other more complicated plants, and causes a severe reduction in water quality. Phosphorus is a necessary nutrient for plants to live, and is the limiting factor for plant growth in many freshwater ecosystems.  Phosphate adheres tightly to soil, so it is mainly transported by erosion. Once translocated to lakes, the extraction of phosphate into water is slow, hence the difficulty of reversing the effects of eutrophication.<ref name=Nasir>Khan, M. Nasir and Mohammad, F.

With the phasing out of phosphate-containing detergents in the 1970s, industrial/domestic run-off and agriculture have emerged as the dominant contributors to eutrophication.<ref>Werner, Wilfried (2002) \"Fertilizers, 6.

This decomposition process consumes oxygen, which reduces the concentration of dissolved oxygen.  The depleted oxygen levels in turn may lead to [[fish kill]]s and a range of other effects reducing biodiversity. Nutrients may become concentrated in an anoxic zone and may only be made available again during autumn turn-over or in conditions of turbulent flow. The dead algae and the organic load carried by the water inflows in to the lake settle at its bottom and undergoes [[anaerobic digestion]] releasing [[greenhouse gases]] like methane and CO<sub>2</sub>. Some part of methane gas is consumed by the anaerobic [[Methanotroph|methane oxidation bacteria]] which in turn works as food source to the [[zooplankton]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.igb-berlin.de/en/news/climate-gases-water-bodies |title= Climate gases from water bodies|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> In case the lake is not deficit of dissolved oxygen at all depths the aerobic methane oxidation bacteria like [[Methylococcus capsulatus]] can consume most of the methane by releasing CO<sub>2</sub> which in turn aid the production of algae.

Elevated levels of atmospheric compounds of [[nitrogen]] can increase nitrogen availability. [[Phosphorus]] is often regarded as the main culprit in cases of eutrophication in lakes subjected to \"point source\" pollution from sewage pipes. The concentration of algae and the trophic state of lakes correspond well to phosphorus levels in water. Studies conducted in the Experimental Lakes Area in Ontario have shown a relationship between the addition of phosphorus and the rate of eutrophication. Humankind has increased the rate of [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus cycling]] on Earth by four times, mainly due to agricultural fertilizer production and application.

Upwelling in coastal systems also promotes increased productivity by conveying deep, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, where the nutrients can be assimilated by [[algae]]. Examples of anthropogenic sources of nitrogen-rich pollution to coastal waters include seacage [[fish farming]] and discharges of [[ammonia]] from the production of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] from coal.\n\nThe [[World Resources Institute]] has identified 375 [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] coastal zones in the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly Japan.<ref>\nSelman, Mindy (2007) ''Eutrophication: An Overview of Status, Trends, Policies, and Strategies.''

Forest [[undergrowth]] affected by run-off from a nearby fertilized field can be turned into a [[nettle]] and [[bramble]] thicket.\n\nChemical forms of nitrogen are most often of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N<sub>2</sub>, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on [[microbe|microbial]] [[nitrogen fixation]] to convert N<sub>2</sub> into other forms such as [[nitrate]]s. However, there is a limit to how much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a [[Limiting factor|limiting nutrient]].<ref name=\"Hornung 1995\">Hornung M., Sutton M.A. and Wilson R.B.

In aquatic ecosystems, species such as [[algae]] experience a population increase (called an [[algal bloom]]). Algal blooms limit the sunlight available to bottom-dwelling organisms and cause wide swings in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water.\nOxygen is required by all aerobically [[Respiration (physiology)|respiring]] plants and animals and it is replenished in daylight by [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] plants and algae. Under eutrophic conditions, dissolved oxygen greatly increases during the day, but is greatly reduced after dark by the respiring algae and by microorganisms that feed on the increasing mass of dead algae. When dissolved oxygen levels decline to [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] levels, fish and other marine animals suffocate. As a result, creatures such as fish, shrimp, and especially immobile bottom dwellers die off.<ref name=\"Horrigan 2002\">{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1289/ehp.02110445 \n| last1 = Horrigan | first1 = L. \n| last2 = Lawrence | first2 = R.

There are two common sources of nutrients and organic matter: point and [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint]] sources.\n\n===Point sources===\n[[Point source (pollution)|Point sources]] are directly attributable to one influence. In point sources the nutrient waste travels directly from source to water. Point sources are relatively easy to regulate.\n\n===Nonpoint sources===\nNonpoint source pollution (also known as 'diffuse' or 'runoff' pollution) is that which comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources. Nonpoint sources are difficult to regulate and usually vary spatially and temporally (with [[season]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and other [[act of god|irregular events]]).\n\nIt has been shown that nitrogen transport is correlated with various indices of human activity in watersheds,<ref name=\"Cole 1993\">Cole J.J., B.L.

It has been shown<ref name=\"Sharpley 1996\">{{cite journal|vauthors = Sharpley AN, Daniel TC, Sims JT, Pote DH |year= 1996|title= Determining environmentally sound soil phosphorus levels|journal= Journal of Soil and Water Conservation |volume=51|pages=160\u2013166|url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/20713/PDF}}</ref> that the amount of [[phosphorus]] lost to surface waters increases linearly with the amount of phosphorus in the soil. Thus much of the nutrient loading in soil eventually makes its way to water. Nitrogen, similarly, has a [[turnover time]] of decades.\n\n====Runoff to surface water====\nNutrients from human activities tend to travel from land to either surface or ground water. Nitrogen in particular is removed through [[storm drains]], sewage pipes, and other forms of [[surface runoff]].\nNutrient losses in runoff and [[leachate]] are often associated with [[agriculture]]. Modern agriculture often involves the application of nutrients onto fields in order to maximise production. However, farmers frequently apply more nutrients than are taken up by crops<ref name=\"Buol 1995\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Buol | first1 = S.

Regulations aimed at minimising nutrient exports from agriculture are typically far less stringent than those placed on sewage treatment plants<ref name=\"Carpenter, S.R. 1998\"/> and other point source polluters.

Runoff can wash out the mineral nitrogen and phosphorus from detritus and in consequence supply the water bodies leading to slow, natural eutrophication.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Klimaszyk, P.  |author2=Rzymski, P.|title= Surface Runoff as a Factor Determining Trophic State of Midforest Lake|journal= Polish Journal of Environmental Studies|year= 2010|volume= 20|issue=5|pages= 1203\u20131210|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51986191}}</ref>\n\n====Atmospheric deposition====\nNitrogen is released into the air because of [[ammonia]] [[volatilization]] and nitrous oxide production. The [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuels]] is a large human-initiated contributor to atmospheric nitrogen pollution. Atmospheric nitrogen reaches the ground by two different processes, the first being wet deposition such as rain or snow, and the second being dry deposition which is particles and gases found in the air.<ref>{{cite web|title=Critical Loads \u2013 Atmospheric Deposition|url=https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/airqualityportal/critical_loads/atmospheric_deposition.php|website=U.S Forest Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Atmospheric deposition (e.g., in the form of [[acid rain]]) can also affect nutrient concentration in water,<ref name=\"Paerl 1997\">{{cite journal|author=Paerl H.

In modeling eutrophication, the rate of water renewal plays a critical role; [[stagnant water]] is allowed to collect more nutrients than bodies with replenished water supplies. It has also been shown that the drying of [[wetlands]] causes an increase in nutrient concentration and subsequent eutrophication blooms.<ref name=\"Mungall 1991\">Mungall C. and McLaren, D.J.

Reducing eutrophication should be a key concern when considering future policy, and a [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable solution]] for everyone, including farmers and ranchers, seems feasible. While eutrophication does pose problems, humans should be aware that natural runoff (which causes algal blooms in the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels. Cleanup measures have been mostly, but not completely, successful. [[Finland|Finnish]] phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges.

The literature suggests, though, that when these sources are controlled, eutrophication decreases. The following steps are recommended to minimize the amount of pollution that can enter aquatic ecosystems from ambiguous sources.\n\n====Riparian buffer zones====\nStudies show that intercepting non-point pollution between the source and the water is a successful means of prevention.<ref name=\"Carpenter, S.R. 1998\"/> [[riparian|Riparian buffer zones]] are interfaces between a flowing body of water and land, and have been created near waterways in an attempt to filter pollutants; [[sediment]] and nutrients are deposited here instead of in water.

As mentioned before, nonpoint sources of pollution are the primary contributors to eutrophication, and their effects can be easily minimized through common agricultural practices. Reducing the amount of pollutants that reach a watershed can be achieved through the protection of its forest cover, reducing the amount of erosion leeching into a watershed. Also, through the efficient, controlled use of land using sustainable agricultural practices to minimize land degradation, the amount of soil runoff and nitrogen-based fertilizers reaching a watershed can be reduced.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Oglesby, R.

In order for a policy to have any effect, the public must be aware of their contribution to the problem, and ways in which they can reduce their effects. Programs instituted to promote participation in the recycling and elimination of wastes, as well as education on the issue of rational water use are necessary to protect water quality within urbanized areas and adjacent water bodies.\n\nEconomic instruments, \"which include, among others, property rights, water markets, fiscal and financial instruments, charge systems and liability systems, are gradually becoming a substantive component of the management tool set used for pollution control and water allocation decisions.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Incentives for those who practice clean, renewable, water management technologies are an effective means of encouraging pollution prevention. By internalizing the costs associated with the negative effects on the environment, governments are able to encourage a cleaner water management.\n\nBecause a body of water can have an effect on a range of people reaching far beyond that of the watershed, cooperation between different organizations is necessary to prevent the intrusion of contaminants that can lead to eutrophication. Agencies ranging from state governments to those of water resource management and non-governmental organizations, going as low as the local population, are responsible for preventing eutrophication of water bodies.
