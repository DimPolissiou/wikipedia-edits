{"title_page": "Swap (finance)", "text_new": "{{Financial markets}}\nA '''swap''', in [[finance]], is an agreement between two [[counterparty|counterparties]] to [[trade|exchange]] [[financial instrument|financial instruments]] or cashflows or payments for a certain time.

The legs can be almost anything but usually one leg involves cash flows based on a [[notional principal amount]] that both parties agree to.  This principal usually does not change hands during or at the end of the swap;\nthis is ''contrary'' to a [[futures contract|future]], a [[forward contract|forward]] or an [[option (finance)|option]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bp_vAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 ''Finance: A Quantitative Introduction'' by Piotr Staszkiewicz and Lucia Staszkiewicz; Academic Press 2014, pg. 56.]</ref>\n\nIn practice one leg is generally fixed while the other is variable, that is determined by an uncertain variable such as a benchmark interest rate, a [[foreign exchange rate]], an index price, or a commodity price.<ref name=\"hull\">John C Hull'', Options, Futures and Other Derivatives (6th edition)'', New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2006, 149</ref>\n\nSwaps are primarily [[Over-the-counter_(finance)|over-the-counter contracts]] between companies or financial institutions.

Another mortgage holder is paying a [[Fixed interest|fixed rate]] but expects rates to fall in the future.  They enter a fixed-for-floating swap agreement.  Both mortgage holders agree on a [[notional principal amount]] and [[Maturity (finance)|maturity date]] and agree to take on each other's payment obligations. The first mortgage holder from now on is paying a fixed rate to the second mortgage holder while receiving a floating rate.  By using a swap both parties effectively changed their mortgage terms to their preferred interest mode while neither party had to renegotiate terms with their mortgage lenders.\n\nConsidering the next payment only, both parties might as well have entered a fixed-for-floating [[forward contract]].  For the payment after that another forward contract whose terms are the same, i.e. same notional amount and fixed-for-floating, and so on.  The swap contract therefore can be seen as a series of forward contracts.  In the end there are two streams of [[cash flows]], one from the party who is always paying a fixed interest on the notional amount, the ''fixed leg'' of the swap, the other from the party who agreed to pay the floating rate, the ''floating leg''.\n\nSwaps can be used to [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks such as [[interest rate risk]], or to [[speculation|speculate]] on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm|title=Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=chicagofed.org|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSwaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when [[IBM]] and the [[World Bank]] entered into a swap agreement.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th |authorlink= |last=Ross|last2=Westerfield|last3=Jordan |last-author-amp=yes|year=2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding was more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1711.htm|title=OTC derivatives statistics at end-June 2017|date=2017-11-02|website=www.bis.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nMost swaps are traded [[Derivative (finance)#OTC and exchange-traded|over-the-counter]] (OTC), \"tailor-made\" for the counterparties.

It maintains a substantial position in swaps for any of the major swap categories.  A swap bank can be an international commercial bank, an investment bank, a merchant bank, or an independent operator. A swap bank serves as either a swap broker or swap dealer. As a broker, the swap bank matches counterparties but does not assume any risk of the swap. The swap broker receives a commission for this service. Today, most swap banks serve as dealers or market makers. As a market maker, a swap bank is willing to accept either side of a currency swap, and then later on-sell it, or match it with a counterparty. In this capacity, the swap bank assumes a position in the swap and therefore assumes some risks. The dealer capacity is obviously more risky, and the swap bank would receive a portion of the [[cash flows]] passed through it to compensate it for bearing this risk.<ref name=\"FIBO2\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Intermediaries |url=https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/Intermediaries/index.htm |website=U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Swap market efficiency==\nThe two primary reasons for a counterparty to use a currency swap are to obtain debt financing in the swapped currency at an interest cost reduction brought about through [[comparative advantages]] each counterparty has in its national [[capital market]], and/or the benefit of hedging long-run [[exchange rate]] exposure. These reasons seem straightforward and difficult to argue with, especially to the extent that name recognition is truly important in raising funds in the international [[bond market]].  Firms using currency swaps have statistically higher levels of long-term foreign-denominated debt than firms that use no currency derivatives.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geczy |first1=C. |last2=Minton |first2=B. |last3=Schrand |first3=C. |title=Why firms use currency derivatives |journal=Journal of Finance |date=1997 |issue=52 |pages=1323-1354}}</ref>  Conversely, the primary users of currency swaps are non-financial, global firms with long-term foreign-currency financing needs.<ref name=\"why-currency-swap\">{{cite journal |last1=Goswami |first1=G. |last2=Nam |first2=J. |last3=Shrikhande |first3=M. |title=Why do global firms use currency swaps?: Theory and evidence |journal=Journal of Multinational Financial Management |date=2004 |volume=14 |issue=4-5 |pages=315-334}}</ref>  From a foreign investor's perspective, valuation of foreign-currency debt would exclude the ''exposure effect'' that a domestic investor would see for such debt.  Financing foreign-currency debt using domestic currency and a currency swap is therefore superior to financing directly with foreign-currency debt.<ref name=\"why-currency-swap\"/>\n\nThe two primary reasons for swapping interest rates are to better match maturities of assets and liabilities and/or to obtain a cost savings via the [[quality spread differential]] (QSD).  Empirical evidence suggests that the spread between AAA-rated commercial paper (floating) and A-rated commercial is slightly less than the spread between AAA-rated five-year obligation (fixed) and an A-rated obligation of the same tenor.  These findings suggest that firms with lower (higher) credit ratings are more likely to pay fixed (floating) in swaps, and fixed-rate payers would use more short-term debt and have shorter debt maturity than floating-rate payers.  In particular, the A-rated firm would borrow using commercial paper at a spread over the AAA rate and enter into a (short-term) fixed-for-floating swap as payer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=H. |last2=Mao |first2=C. |title=Corporate use of interest rate swaps: Theory and evidence |journal=Journal of Banking & Finance |date=2003 |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1511-1538 |doi=10.1016/S0378-4266(02)00275-3}}</ref>\n\n==Types of swaps==\nThe generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: [[interest rate swap]]s, [[basis swap]]s, [[currency swap]]s, [[inflation swap]]s, [[credit default swap]]s, [[commodity swap]]s and [[equity swap]]s. There are also many other types of swaps.\n\n===Interest rate swaps===\n{{main|Interest rate swap}}\n[[File:Vanilla interest rate swap with bank.png|400px|right|thumb|A is currently paying floating, but wants to pay fixed. B is currently paying fixed but wants to pay floating. By entering into an interest rate swap, the net result is that each party can 'swap' their existing obligation for their desired obligation. Normally, the parties do not swap payments directly, but rather each sets up a separate swap with a financial intermediary such as a bank. In return for matching the two parties together, the bank takes a spread from the swap payments.]]\nThe most common type of swap is an interest rate swap. Some companies may have comparative advantage in fixed rate markets, while other companies have a comparative advantage in floating rate markets. When companies want to borrow, they look for cheap borrowing, i.e. from the market where they have comparative advantage. However, this may lead to a company borrowing fixed when it wants floating or borrowing floating when it wants fixed. This is where a swap comes in. A swap has the effect of transforming a fixed rate loan into a floating rate loan or vice versa.\n\nFor example, party B makes periodic interest payments to party A based on a ''variable'' interest rate of [[LIBOR]] +70 [[basis point]]s. Party A in return makes periodic interest payments based on a fixed rate of 8.65%. The payments are calculated over the [[notional amount|''notional'' amount]]. The first rate is called ''variable'' because it is reset at the beginning of each interest calculation period to the then current [[reference rate]], such as [[LIBOR]]. In reality, the actual rate received by A and B is slightly lower due to a bank taking a spread.\n\n===Basis swaps===\n{{main|Basis swap}}\nA basis swap involves exchanging floating interest rates based on different money markets.  The principal is not exchanged.  The swap effectively limits the interest-rate risk as a result of having differing lending and borrowing rates.<ref>[https://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/About-EDMC-FIBO/ Financial Industry Business Ontology Version 2], Annex D: Derivatives, EDM Council, Inc., Object Management Group, Inc., 2019</ref>\n\n===Currency swaps===\n{{main|Currency swap}}\nA currency swap involves exchanging principal and fixed rate interest payments on a loan in one currency for principal and fixed rate interest payments on an equal loan in another currency.\nJust like interest rate swaps, the currency swaps are also motivated by [[comparative advantage]].\nCurrency swaps entail swapping both principal and interest between the parties, with the cashflows in one direction\nbeing in a different currency than those in the opposite direction. It is also a very crucial uniform pattern in individuals and customers.\n\n===Inflation swaps===\n{{main|Inflation swap}}\nAn inflation-linked swap involves exchanging a fixed rate on a principal for an inflation index expressed in monetary terms.  The primary objective is to hedge against inflation and interest-rate risk.<ref>[https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/04/how-liquid-is-the-inflation-swap-market.html How Liquid Is the Inflation Swap Market?]  Michael J. Fleming and John Sporn, 2013</ref>\n\n===Commodity swaps===\n{{main|Commodity swap}}\nA commodity swap is an agreement whereby a floating (or market or spot) price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. The vast majority of commodity swaps involve [[Petroleum#Crude oil|crude oil]].\n\n===Credit Default Swap===\n{{main|Credit default swap}}\nAn agreement whereby the payer periodically pays premiums, sometimes also or only a one-off or initial premium, to the protection seller on a notional principal for a period of time so long as a specified [[credit event]] has not occurred.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\">Frank J. Fabozzi, 2018.

In the event of default, the payer receives compensation, for example the principal, possibly plus all fixed rate payments until the end of the swap agreement, or any other way that suits the protection buyer or both counterparties.  The primary objective of a CDS is to transfer one party's credit exposure to another party.\n\n===Subordinated risk swaps===\nA subordinated risk swap (SRS), or equity risk swap, is a contract in which the ''buyer'' (or equity holder) pays a premium to the ''seller'' (or silent holder) for the option to transfer certain risks. These can include any form of equity, management or legal risk of the [[underlying]] (for example a [[company]]). Through execution the equity holder can (for example) transfer shares, management responsibilities or else. Thus, general and special entrepreneurial risks can be managed, assigned or prematurely hedged. Those instruments are traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) and there are only a few specialized investors worldwide.\n\n===Equity swap===\n{{main|Equity swap}}\nAn agreement to exchange future cash flows between two parties where one leg is an equity-based cash flow such as the performance of a stock asset, a basket of stocks or a stock index.  The other leg is typically a fixed-income cash flow such as a benchmark interest rate.\n\n===Other variations===\nThere are myriad different variations on the vanilla swap structure, which are limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the desire of corporate treasurers and fund managers for exotic structures.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\n* A '''[[total return swap]]''' is a swap in which party A pays the ''total return'' of an [[asset]], and party B makes periodic interest payments. The total return is the capital gain or loss, plus any interest or dividend payments. Note that if the total return is negative, then party A receives this amount from party B. The parties have exposure to the return of the underlying stock or index, without having to hold the [[underlying]] assets. The profit or loss of party B is the same for him as actually owning the underlying asset.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* An [[option (finance)|option]] on a swap is called a '''[[swaption]]'''. These provide one party with the right but not the obligation at a future time to enter into a swap.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* A '''[[variance swap]]''' is an over-the-counter instrument that allows investors to trade future realized (or historical) volatility against current implied volatility.<ref>[https://wilmott.com/introduction-to-variance-swaps-wilmott-magazine-article-sebastien-bossu/ Introduction to Variance Swaps], Sebastien Bossu, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, Wilmott Magazine, 16th April 2018</ref>\n* A '''[[constant maturity swap]]''' (CMS) is a swap that allows the purchaser to fix the [[Bond duration|duration]] of received flows on a swap.\n* An '''[[Amortising swap|amortizing swap]]''' is usually an [[interest rate swap]] in which the notional principal for the interest payments declines during the life of the swap, perhaps at a rate tied to the prepayment of a mortgage or to an interest rate benchmark such as the LIBOR. It is suitable to those customers of banks who want to manage the interest rate risk involved in predicted funding requirement, or investment programs.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* A '''zero coupon swap''' is of use to those entities which have their liabilities denominated in floating rates but at the same time would like to conserve cash for operational purposes.\n* A '''deferred rate swap''' is particularly attractive to those users of funds that need funds immediately but do not consider the current rates of interest very attractive and feel that the rates may fall in future.\n* An '''accreting swap''' is used by banks which have agreed to lend increasing sums over time to its customers so that they may fund projects.\n* A '''forward swap''' is an agreement created through the synthesis of two swaps differing in duration for the purpose of fulfilling the specific time-frame needs of an investor. Also referred to as a forward start swap, delayed start swap, and a deferred start swap.\n* A '''[[Quanto|quanto swap]]''' is a cash-settled, cross-currency interest rate swap in which one counterparty pays a foreign interest rate to the other, but the notional amount is in domestic currency. The second party may be paying a fixed or floating rate. For example, a swap in which the notional amount is denominated in Canadian dollars, but where the floating rate is set as USD LIBOR, would be considered a quanto swap.  Quanto swaps are known as ''differential'' or ''rate-differential'' or ''diff'' swaps.\n* A '''range accrual swap''' (or '''range accrual note''') is an agreement to pay a fixed or floating rate while receiving cash flows from a fixed or floating rate which are accrued only on those days where the second rate falls within a preagreed range.  The received payments are maximized when the second rate stays entirely within the range for the duration of the swap.\n* A '''three-zone digital''' swap is a generalization of the range accrual swap, the payer of a fixed rate receives a floating rate if that rate stays within a certain preagreed range, or a fixed rate if the floating rate goes above the range, or a different fixed rate if the floating rate falls below the range.\n\n==Valuation and Pricing==\n{{main|Rational pricing#Swaps|Arbitrage}}\n{{further|Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing||Asset swap#Computing the asset swap spread|Credit default swap#Pricing and valuation|Currency swap#Valuation and Pricing|Variance swap#Pricing and valuation}}\n\nThe value of a swap is the [[net present value]] (NPV) of all ''expected'' future cash flows, essentially the difference in leg values. \nA swap is thus \"worth zero\" when it is first initiated, otherwise one party would be at an advantage, and arbitrage would be possible; \nhowever after this time its value may become positive or negative.<ref name=\"hull\"/> \n\nWhile this principle holds true for any swap, the following discussion is for plain vanilla interest rate swaps and is representative of pure rational pricing as it excludes [[credit risk]]. \nFor interest rate swaps, there are in fact two methods, which will (must) return the same value: \nin terms of [[Bond (finance)|bond]] prices, or as a portfolio of [[forward contract]]s.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\nThe fact that these methods agree, underscores the fact that rational pricing will apply ''between'' instruments also.\n<!-- In practice\u2014especially since the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]]\u2014swaps are priced using a \"multi-curve\" framework; see [[Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing]] for formulae, and [[Financial economics#Derivative pricing]] for context. --> \n===Arbitrage arguments===\nAs mentioned, to be arbitrage free, the terms of a swap contract are such that, initially, the NPV of these future cash flows is equal to zero. Where this is not the case, arbitrage would be possible.\n\nFor example, consider a plain vanilla fixed-to-floating interest rate swap where Party A pays a fixed rate, and Party B pays a floating rate. In such an agreement the ''fixed rate'' would be such that the present value of future fixed rate payments by Party A are equal to the present value of the ''expected'' future floating rate payments (i.e. the NPV is zero). Where this is not the case, an [[Arbitrage]]ur, C, could:\n# assume the position with the ''lower'' present value of payments, and borrow funds equal to this present value\n# meet the cash flow obligations on the position by using the borrowed funds, and receive the corresponding payments - which have a higher present value\n# use the received payments to repay the debt on the borrowed funds\n# pocket the difference - where the difference between the present value of the loan and the present value of the inflows is the arbitrage profit.\n\nSubsequently, once traded, the price of the Swap must equate to the price of the various corresponding instruments as mentioned above. Where this is not true, an arbitrageur could similarly [[short (finance)|short sell]] the overpriced instrument, and use the proceeds to purchase the correctly priced instrument, pocket the difference, and then use payments generated to service the instrument which he is short.\n===Using bond prices===\nWhile principal payments are not exchanged in an interest rate swap, assuming that these are received and paid at the end of the swap does not change its value. Thus, from the point of view of the floating-rate payer, a swap is equivalent to a long position in a [[fixed-rate bond]] (i.e. ''receiving'' fixed interest payments), and a short position in a [[floating rate note]] (i.e. ''making'' floating interest payments):\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{fixed} - B_\\mathrm{floating} \\, </math>\n\nFrom the point of view of the fixed-rate payer, the swap can be viewed as having the opposite positions. That is,\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{floating} - B_\\mathrm{fixed} \\, </math>\n\nSimilarly, currency swaps can be regarded as having positions in bonds whose cash flows correspond to those in the swap. Thus, the home currency value is:\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{domestic} - S_0 B_\\mathrm{foreign}</math>, where <math>B_\\mathrm{domestic}</math> is the domestic cash flows of the swap, <math>B_\\mathrm{foreign}</math> is the foreign cash flows of the LIBOR is the rate of interest offered by banks on deposit from other banks in the [[eurocurrency]] market. One-month LIBOR is the rate offered for 1-month deposits, 3-month LIBOR for three months deposits, etc.\nLIBOR rates are determined by trading between banks and change continuously as economic conditions change. Just like the prime rate of interest quoted in the domestic market, LIBOR is a reference rate of interest in the international market.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Swaps (finance)]], for a list of articles\n*[[Constant maturity swap]]\n*[[Credit default swap]]\n*[[Cross currency swap]]\n*[[Equity swap]]\n*[[Forex swap|Foreign exchange swap]]\n*[[Fuel price risk management]]\n*[[Interest rate swap]]\n*[[PnL Explained]]\n*[[Swap Execution Facility]]\n*[[Total return swap]]\n*[[Variance swap]]\n*[[Yield curve]]\n\n==References==\n{{block indent|{{cite book |last1=Saunders |first1=A. |last2=Cornett |first2=M. |date=2006 |title=Financial Institutions Management |publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin}}}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/understanding-derivatives/index Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure] [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]], Financial Markets Group\n* [https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/support/programs/investment-foundations/11-derivatives.ashx?la=en&hash=6BA234D6843721715BA6CB45332CE2D90FC1D75C ''Investment-foundations: Derivatives''], [[CFA Institute]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070509025720/http://www.swap-rates.com/ swaps-rates.com], interest swap rates statistics online\n*[http://www.bis.org Bank for International Settlements]\n*[http://isda.org International Swaps and Derivatives Association]\n*[http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/first-take-sec-cross-border-derivatives-rule.jhtml First take, Dodd-Frank's SEC\u2019s Cross-Border Derivatives Rule]\n\n{{Derivatives market}}\n[[Category:Swaps (finance)| ]]\n[[Category:Derivatives (finance)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Financial markets}}\nA '''swap''', in [[finance]], is an agreement between two [[counterparty|counterparties]] to [[trade|exchange]] [[financial instrument|financial instruments]] or cashflows or payments for a certain time.

This principal usually does not change hands during or at the end of the swap;\nthis is ''contrary'' to a [[futures contract|future]], a [[forward contract|forward]] or an [[option (finance)|option]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bp_vAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 ''Finance: A Quantitative Introduction'' by Piotr Staszkiewicz and Lucia Staszkiewicz; Academic Press 2014, pg. 56.]</ref>\n\nIn practice one leg is generally fixed while the other is variable, that is determined by an uncertain variable such as a benchmark interest rate, a [[foreign exchange rate]], an index price, or a commodity price.<ref name=\"hull\">John C Hull'', Options, Futures and Other Derivatives (6th edition)'', New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2006, 149</ref>\n\nSwaps are primarily [[Over-the-counter_(finance)|over-the-counter contracts]] between companies or financial institutions.

Another mortgage holder is paying a [[Fixed interest|fixed rate]] but expects rates to fall in the future.  They enter a fixed-for-floating swap agreement.  Both mortgage holders agree on a [[notional principal amount]] and [[Maturity (finance)|maturity date]] and agree to take on each other's payment obligations. The first mortgage holder from now on is paying a fixed rate to the second mortgage holder while receiving a floating rate.  By using a swap both parties effectively changed their mortgage terms to their preferred interest mode while neither party had to renegotiate terms with their mortgage lenders.\n\nConsidering the next payment only, both parties might as well have entered a fixed-for-floating [[forward contract]].  For the payment after that another forward contract whose terms are the same, i.e. same notional amount and fixed-for-floating, and so on.  The swap contract therefore can be seen as a series of forward contracts.  In the end there are two streams of [[cash flows]], one from the party who is always paying a fixed interest on the notional amount, the ''fixed leg'' of the swap, the other from the party who agreed to pay the floating rate, the ''floating leg''.\n\nSwaps can be used to [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks such as [[interest rate risk]], or to [[speculation|speculate]] on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm|title=Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=chicagofed.org|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSwaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when [[IBM]] and the [[World Bank]] entered into a swap agreement.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th |authorlink= |last=Ross|last2=Westerfield|last3=Jordan |last-author-amp=yes|year=2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding was more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1711.htm|title=OTC derivatives statistics at end-June 2017|date=2017-11-02|website=www.bis.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nMost swaps are traded [[Derivative (finance)#OTC and exchange-traded|over-the-counter]] (OTC), \"tailor-made\" for the counterparties.

It maintains a substantial position in swaps for any of the major swap categories.  A swap bank can be an international commercial bank, an investment bank, a merchant bank, or an independent operator. A swap bank serves as either a swap broker or swap dealer. As a broker, the swap bank matches counterparties but does not assume any risk of the swap. The swap broker receives a commission for this service. Today, most swap banks serve as dealers or market makers. As a market maker, a swap bank is willing to accept either side of a currency swap, and then later on-sell it, or match it with a counterparty. In this capacity, the swap bank assumes a position in the swap and therefore assumes some risks. The dealer capacity is obviously more risky, and the swap bank would receive a portion of the [[cash flows]] passed through it to compensate it for bearing this risk.<ref name=\"FIBO2\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Intermediaries |url=https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/Intermediaries/index.htm |website=U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Swap market efficiency==\nThe two primary reasons for a counterparty to use a currency swap are to obtain debt financing in the swapped currency at an interest cost reduction brought about through [[comparative advantages]] each counterparty has in its national [[capital market]], and/or the benefit of hedging long-run [[exchange rate]] exposure. These reasons seem straightforward and difficult to argue with, especially to the extent that name recognition is truly important in raising funds in the international [[bond market]].  Firms using currency swaps have statistically higher levels of long-term foreign-denominated debt than firms that use no currency derivatives.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geczy |first1=C. |last2=Minton |first2=B. |last3=Schrand |first3=C. |title=Why firms use currency derivatives |journal=Journal of Finance |date=1997 |issue=52 |pages=1323-1354}}</ref>  Conversely, the primary users of currency swaps are non-financial, global firms with long-term foreign-currency financing needs.<ref name=\"why-currency-swap\">{{cite journal |last1=Goswami |first1=G. |last2=Nam |first2=J. |last3=Shrikhande |first3=M. |title=Why do global firms use currency swaps?: Theory and evidence |journal=Journal of Multinational Financial Management |date=2004 |volume=14 |issue=4-5 |pages=315-334}}</ref>  From a foreign investor's perspective, valuation of foreign-currency debt would exclude the ''exposure effect'' that a domestic investor would see for such debt.  Financing foreign-currency debt using domestic currency and a currency swap is therefore superior to financing directly with foreign-currency debt.<ref name=\"why-currency-swap\"/>\n\nThe two primary reasons for swapping interest rates are to better match maturities of assets and liabilities and/or to obtain a cost savings via the [[quality spread differential]] (QSD).  Empirical evidence suggests that the spread between AAA-rated commercial paper (floating) and A-rated commercial is slightly less than the spread between AAA-rated five-year obligation (fixed) and an A-rated obligation of the same tenor.  These findings suggest that firms with lower (higher) credit ratings are more likely to pay fixed (floating) in swaps, and fixed-rate payers would use more short-term debt and have shorter debt maturity than floating-rate payers.  In particular, the A-rated firm would borrow using commercial paper at a spread over the AAA rate and enter into a (short-term) fixed-for-floating swap as payer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=H. |last2=Mao |first2=C. |title=Corporate use of interest rate swaps: Theory and evidence |journal=Journal of Banking & Finance |date=2003 |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1511-1538 |doi=10.1016/S0378-4266(02)00275-3}}</ref>\n\n==Types of swaps==\nThe generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: [[interest rate swap]]s, [[basis swap]]s, [[currency swap]]s, [[inflation swap]]s, [[credit default swap]]s, [[commodity swap]]s and [[equity swap]]s. There are also many other types of swaps.\n\n===Interest rate swaps===\n{{main|Interest rate swap}}\n[[File:Vanilla interest rate swap with bank.png|400px|right|thumb|A is currently paying floating, but wants to pay fixed. B is currently paying fixed but wants to pay floating. By entering into an interest rate swap, the net result is that each party can 'swap' their existing obligation for their desired obligation. Normally, the parties do not swap payments directly, but rather each sets up a separate swap with a financial intermediary such as a bank. In return for matching the two parties together, the bank takes a spread from the swap payments.]]\nThe most common type of swap is an interest rate swap. Some companies may have comparative advantage in fixed rate markets, while other companies have a comparative advantage in floating rate markets. When companies want to borrow, they look for cheap borrowing, i.e. from the market where they have comparative advantage. However, this may lead to a company borrowing fixed when it wants floating or borrowing floating when it wants fixed. This is where a swap comes in. A swap has the effect of transforming a fixed rate loan into a floating rate loan or vice versa.\n\nFor example, party B makes periodic interest payments to party A based on a ''variable'' interest rate of [[LIBOR]] +70 [[basis point]]s. Party A in return makes periodic interest payments based on a fixed rate of 8.65%. The payments are calculated over the [[notional amount|''notional'' amount]]. The first rate is called ''variable'' because it is reset at the beginning of each interest calculation period to the then current [[reference rate]], such as [[LIBOR]]. In reality, the actual rate received by A and B is slightly lower due to a bank taking a spread.\n\n===Basis swaps===\n{{main|Basis swap}}\nA basis swap involves exchanging floating interest rates based on different money markets.  The principal is not exchanged.  The swap effectively limits the interest-rate risk as a result of having differing lending and borrowing rates.<ref>[https://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/About-EDMC-FIBO/ Financial Industry Business Ontology Version 2], Annex D: Derivatives, EDM Council, Inc., Object Management Group, Inc., 2019</ref>\n\n===Currency swaps===\n{{main|Currency swap}}\nA currency swap involves exchanging principal and fixed rate interest payments on a loan in one currency for principal and fixed rate interest payments on an equal loan in another currency.\nJust like interest rate swaps, the currency swaps are also motivated by [[comparative advantage]].\nCurrency swaps entail swapping both principal and interest between the parties, with the cashflows in one direction\nbeing in a different currency than those in the opposite direction. It is also a very crucial uniform pattern in individuals and customers.\n\n===Inflation swaps===\n{{main|Inflation swap}}\nAn inflation-linked swap involves exchanging a fixed rate on a principal for an inflation index expressed in monetary terms.  The primary objective is to hedge against inflation and interest-rate risk.<ref>[https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/04/how-liquid-is-the-inflation-swap-market.html How Liquid Is the Inflation Swap Market?]  Michael J. Fleming and John Sporn, 2013</ref>\n\n===Commodity swaps===\n{{main|Commodity swap}}\nA commodity swap is an agreement whereby a floating (or market or spot) price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. The vast majority of commodity swaps involve [[Petroleum#Crude oil|crude oil]].\n\n===Credit Default Swap===\n{{main|Credit default swap}}\nAn agreement whereby the payer periodically pays premiums, sometimes also or only a one-off or initial premium, to the protection seller on a notional principal for a period of time so long as a specified [[credit event]] has not occurred.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\">The Handbook of financial instruments, Frank J. Fabozzi, 2002</ref>  The credit event can refer to a single asset or a basket of assets, usually debt obligations.  In the event of default, the payer receives compensation, for example the principal, possibly plus all fixed rate payments until the end of the swap agreement, or any other way that suits the protection buyer or both counterparties.  The primary objective of a CDS is to transfer one party's credit exposure to another party.\n\n===Subordinated risk swaps===\nA subordinated risk swap (SRS), or equity risk swap, is a contract in which the ''buyer'' (or equity holder) pays a premium to the ''seller'' (or silent holder) for the option to transfer certain risks. These can include any form of equity, management or legal risk of the [[underlying]] (for example a [[company]]). Through execution the equity holder can (for example) transfer shares, management responsibilities or else. Thus, general and special entrepreneurial risks can be managed, assigned or prematurely hedged. Those instruments are traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) and there are only a few specialized investors worldwide.\n\n===Equity swap===\n{{main|Equity swap}}\nAn agreement to exchange future cash flows between two parties where one leg is an equity-based cash flow such as the performance of a stock asset, a basket of stocks or a stock index.  The other leg is typically a fixed-income cash flow such as a benchmark interest rate.\n\n===Other variations===\nThere are myriad different variations on the vanilla swap structure, which are limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the desire of corporate treasurers and fund managers for exotic structures.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\n* A '''[[total return swap]]''' is a swap in which party A pays the ''total return'' of an [[asset]], and party B makes periodic interest payments. The total return is the capital gain or loss, plus any interest or dividend payments. Note that if the total return is negative, then party A receives this amount from party B. The parties have exposure to the return of the underlying stock or index, without having to hold the [[underlying]] assets. The profit or loss of party B is the same for him as actually owning the underlying asset.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* An [[option (finance)|option]] on a swap is called a '''[[swaption]]'''. These provide one party with the right but not the obligation at a future time to enter into a swap.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* A '''[[variance swap]]''' is an over-the-counter instrument that allows investors to trade future realized (or historical) volatility against current implied volatility.<ref>[https://wilmott.com/introduction-to-variance-swaps-wilmott-magazine-article-sebastien-bossu/ Introduction to Variance Swaps], Sebastien Bossu, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, Wilmott Magazine, 16th April 2018</ref>\n* A '''[[constant maturity swap]]''' (CMS) is a swap that allows the purchaser to fix the [[Bond duration|duration]] of received flows on a swap.\n* An '''[[Amortising swap|amortizing swap]]''' is usually an [[interest rate swap]] in which the notional principal for the interest payments declines during the life of the swap, perhaps at a rate tied to the prepayment of a mortgage or to an interest rate benchmark such as the LIBOR. It is suitable to those customers of banks who want to manage the interest rate risk involved in predicted funding requirement, or investment programs.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* A '''zero coupon swap''' is of use to those entities which have their liabilities denominated in floating rates but at the same time would like to conserve cash for operational purposes.\n* A '''deferred rate swap''' is particularly attractive to those users of funds that need funds immediately but do not consider the current rates of interest very attractive and feel that the rates may fall in future.\n* An '''accreting swap''' is used by banks which have agreed to lend increasing sums over time to its customers so that they may fund projects.\n* A '''forward swap''' is an agreement created through the synthesis of two swaps differing in duration for the purpose of fulfilling the specific time-frame needs of an investor. Also referred to as a forward start swap, delayed start swap, and a deferred start swap.\n* A '''[[Quanto|quanto swap]]''' is a cash-settled, cross-currency interest rate swap in which one counterparty pays a foreign interest rate to the other, but the notional amount is in domestic currency. The second party may be paying a fixed or floating rate. For example, a swap in which the notional amount is denominated in Canadian dollars, but where the floating rate is set as USD LIBOR, would be considered a quanto swap.  Quanto swaps are known as ''differential'' or ''rate-differential'' or ''diff'' swaps.\n* A '''range accrual swap''' (or '''range accrual note''') is an agreement to pay a fixed or floating rate while receiving cash flows from a fixed or floating rate which are accrued only on those days where the second rate falls within a preagreed range.  The received payments are maximized when the second rate stays entirely within the range for the duration of the swap.\n* A '''three-zone digital''' swap is a generalization of the range accrual swap, the payer of a fixed rate receives a floating rate if that rate stays within a certain preagreed range, or a fixed rate if the floating rate goes above the range, or a different fixed rate if the floating rate falls below the range.\n\n==Valuation and Pricing==\n{{main|Rational pricing#Swaps|Arbitrage}}\n{{further|Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing||Asset swap#Computing the asset swap spread|Credit default swap#Pricing and valuation|Currency swap#Valuation and Pricing|Variance swap#Pricing and valuation}}\n\nThe value of a swap is the [[net present value]] (NPV) of all ''expected'' future cash flows, essentially the difference in leg values. \nA swap is thus \"worth zero\" when it is first initiated, otherwise one party would be at an advantage, and arbitrage would be possible; \nhowever after this time its value may become positive or negative.<ref name=\"hull\"/> \n\nWhile this principle holds true for any swap, the following discussion is for plain vanilla interest rate swaps and is representative of pure rational pricing as it excludes [[credit risk]]. \nFor interest rate swaps, there are in fact two methods, which will (must) return the same value: \nin terms of [[Bond (finance)|bond]] prices, or as a portfolio of [[forward contract]]s.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\nThe fact that these methods agree, underscores the fact that rational pricing will apply ''between'' instruments also.\n<!-- In practice\u2014especially since the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]]\u2014swaps are priced using a \"multi-curve\" framework; see [[Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing]] for formulae, and [[Financial economics#Derivative pricing]] for context. --> \n===Arbitrage arguments===\nAs mentioned, to be arbitrage free, the terms of a swap contract are such that, initially, the NPV of these future cash flows is equal to zero. Where this is not the case, arbitrage would be possible.\n\nFor example, consider a plain vanilla fixed-to-floating interest rate swap where Party A pays a fixed rate, and Party B pays a floating rate. In such an agreement the ''fixed rate'' would be such that the present value of future fixed rate payments by Party A are equal to the present value of the ''expected'' future floating rate payments (i.e. the NPV is zero). Where this is not the case, an [[Arbitrage]]ur, C, could:\n# assume the position with the ''lower'' present value of payments, and borrow funds equal to this present value\n# meet the cash flow obligations on the position by using the borrowed funds, and receive the corresponding payments - which have a higher present value\n# use the received payments to repay the debt on the borrowed funds\n# pocket the difference - where the difference between the present value of the loan and the present value of the inflows is the arbitrage profit.\n\nSubsequently, once traded, the price of the Swap must equate to the price of the various corresponding instruments as mentioned above. Where this is not true, an arbitrageur could similarly [[short (finance)|short sell]] the overpriced instrument, and use the proceeds to purchase the correctly priced instrument, pocket the difference, and then use payments generated to service the instrument which he is short.\n===Using bond prices===\nWhile principal payments are not exchanged in an interest rate swap, assuming that these are received and paid at the end of the swap does not change its value. Thus, from the point of view of the floating-rate payer, a swap is equivalent to a long position in a [[fixed-rate bond]] (i.e. ''receiving'' fixed interest payments), and a short position in a [[floating rate note]] (i.e. ''making'' floating interest payments):\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{fixed} - B_\\mathrm{floating} \\, </math>\n\nFrom the point of view of the fixed-rate payer, the swap can be viewed as having the opposite positions. That is,\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{floating} - B_\\mathrm{fixed} \\, </math>\n\nSimilarly, currency swaps can be regarded as having positions in bonds whose cash flows correspond to those in the swap. Thus, the home currency value is:\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{domestic} - S_0 B_\\mathrm{foreign}</math>, where <math>B_\\mathrm{domestic}</math> is the domestic cash flows of the swap, <math>B_\\mathrm{foreign}</math> is the foreign cash flows of the LIBOR is the rate of interest offered by banks on deposit from other banks in the [[eurocurrency]] market. One-month LIBOR is the rate offered for 1-month deposits, 3-month LIBOR for three months deposits, etc.\nLIBOR rates are determined by trading between banks and change continuously as economic conditions change. Just like the prime rate of interest quoted in the domestic market, LIBOR is a reference rate of interest in the international market.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Swaps (finance)]], for a list of articles\n*[[Constant maturity swap]]\n*[[Credit default swap]]\n*[[Cross currency swap]]\n*[[Equity swap]]\n*[[Forex swap|Foreign exchange swap]]\n*[[Fuel price risk management]]\n*[[Interest rate swap]]\n*[[PnL Explained]]\n*[[Swap Execution Facility]]\n*[[Total return swap]]\n*[[Variance swap]]\n*[[Yield curve]]\n\n==References==\n{{block indent|{{cite book |last1=Saunders |first1=A. |last2=Cornett |first2=M. |date=2006 |title=Financial Institutions Management |publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin}}}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/understanding-derivatives/index Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure] [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]], Financial Markets Group\n* [https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/support/programs/investment-foundations/11-derivatives.ashx?la=en&hash=6BA234D6843721715BA6CB45332CE2D90FC1D75C ''Investment-foundations: Derivatives''], [[CFA Institute]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070509025720/http://www.swap-rates.com/ swaps-rates.com], interest swap rates statistics online\n*[http://www.bis.org Bank for International Settlements]\n*[http://isda.org International Swaps and Derivatives Association]\n*[http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/first-take-sec-cross-border-derivatives-rule.jhtml First take, Dodd-Frank's SEC\u2019s Cross-Border Derivatives Rule]\n\n{{Derivatives market}}\n[[Category:Swaps (finance)| ]]\n[[Category:Derivatives (finance)]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_(finance)"}

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman|Sam Gelfman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books? It's easier to film The Odyssey'|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He had recieved a lot of fanmail on the matter, some proposing to adapt the works to film and some encouraging him to refuse such proposals.<ref name=\":15\" /> Tolkien and his publishers, [[Allen & Unwin|Allen and Unwin]], were willing to play along with film proposals, under the conditions of having a veto on creative decisions or relinquishing those for a hefty sum of money.<ref name=\":2\" /> Materials pertaining to the treatments of Ackerman, Boorman and Bakshi are stored in the Tolkien papers collection of [[Marquette University]].<ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> \n\n=== Walt Disney ===\nIn 1938, just as Tolkien began to work on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Walt Disney]] considered adapting ''The Hobbit'' to animation. An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956,  animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax appearantly wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R.

In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the US to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Uproduced attempts to film dune involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky|Alejandro Jodorowski]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]] and [[Pierre Morel]].\n</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

Some cell animation was produced by the time Goeff Dunbar and Oscar Grillo of Euronimation bowed out. Rankin then outsourced the animation to Japan's Topcraft (later [[Studio Ghibli|Studio Ghilbi]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.intanibase.com/forum/posts/m25152findunread-Middle-Earth-in-Animation|title=Middle Earth in Animation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe designs were done  by Rankin, Bass and several Japanese animators working the US.

He was brought on board again later in the production to help illustrate the Dwarves \u2013 basing Thorin on concept art for Disney's Grumpy.

His first draft tried to encompass the whole of the story, plus a setup for The Lord of the Rings at the end.

While Rankin wanted it to be released in theaters if it was successful enough, this did not come to pass, making Ralph Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'' the only theatrical feature based on Tolkien's works to appear before the WingNut films productions.\n\nThe TV Special received mixed reactions. In 1978, [[Romeo Muller]] won a [[Peabody Award]] for his teleplay.

R. R. Tolkien]] by a director at Terrytoons in 1956. In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rated PG, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was the longest animated film made at the time, and cost $8-12<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce, grossing $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct. Other director's considered before Jackson took over are said to have included [[Neill Blomkamp|Neil Blomkamp]], [[David Yates]], [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] and [[Brett Ratner|Bret Ratner]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/hobbit-rumor-neill-blomkamp-direct-no-job-mgm-gets-together/|title=Neill Blomkamp Rumored to Direct THE HOBBIT and Why No One Is Getting the Job Until MGM Gets It Together|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Tel Toro's ''The Hobbit'' would have had a similar scenario to Jackson's eventual film, but with a different design aesthetic.

Although it is completely unofficial, it has received coverage in major media.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Masters |title=Making Middle-earth on a shoestring |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8022623.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2009}}<br/>{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Sydell |authorlink=Laura Sydell |title=High-Def 'Hunt For Gollum' New Lord Of The Fanvids |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103673352 |work=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nAnother fan made feature film, ''[[Born of Hope]]'', produced and directed by [[Kate Madison]], was released online on December 1, 2009 on [[Dailymotion]] and later on [[YouTube]].

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956,  animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax appearantly wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien told Gutwillig he had \"given a considerable amount of time and thought\" to a film adaptation, noting \"some ideas concerning what I think would be desirable\" as well as the \"difficulties\" involved.<ref name=\":0\" /> Tolkien spoke with Gutwillig's agent and producer, [[Samuel Gelfman|Samuel W.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> \n\nWhile Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the US to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions. By 1967, Sam Gelfman established Katzka-Bernie productions with [[Gabriel Katzka]] and entered neogtiations with Tolkien to adapt ''The Lord of the Rings'' for United Artists,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":26\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/movies/l-lord-of-the-rings-serious-issues-557552.html|title=Samuel Gelfman letter to The New York Times|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"with an option for ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As was the case with Snyder, the emerging contracts would provide United Artists with complete creative freedom over the works, and even offered UA first bidding at the television rights, which were negotiated separately but never sold to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2017/11/15/104416-tolkien-rights-and-the-amazon-television-deal-some-insight/|title=Tolkien Rights and the Amazon Television Deal \u2013 some insight|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of American teenagers unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the rights to ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary who worked for Allen & Unwin, was said to have contacted Disney for the rights at the time,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/tolkien-cs-lewis-disney-snow-white-narnia-hobbit-dwarves|title=The Movie Date That Solidified J.R.R.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Uproduced attempts to film dune involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky|Alejandro Jodorowski]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]] and [[Pierre Morel]].\n</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

Rankin thought adapting the whole ''Lord of the Rings'' was impossible and that the audience \"wouldn't sit still for it.\"<ref name=\":24\" /> He decided \"that the Tolkien property that I could handle was 'The Hobbit',\"<ref name=\":1\" /> although portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'' were optioned as a sequel given pressure from the network.

Some cell animation was produced by the time Goeff Dunbar and Oscar Grillo of Euronimation bowed out. Rankin then outsourced the animation to Japan's Topcraft (later [[Studio Ghibli|Studio Ghilbi]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.intanibase.com/forum/posts/m25152findunread-Middle-Earth-in-Animation|title=Middle Earth in Animation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe designs were done  by Rankin, Bass and several Japanese animators working the US. Lester Abrams sent Rankin 20 character designs after Rankin and Bass liked his work on an excerpt of Tolkien's for ''Children's Digest'' at the time. He was brought on board again later in the production to help illustrate the Dwarves \u2013 basing Thorin on concept art for Disney's Grumpy.

His first draft tried to encompass the whole of the story, plus a setup for The Lord of the Rings at the end.

While Rankin wanted it to be released in theaters if it was successful enough, this did not come to pass, making Ralph Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'' the only theatrical feature based on Tolkien's works to appear before the WingNut films productions.\n\nThe TV Special received mixed reactions. In 1978, [[Romeo Muller]] won a [[Peabody Award]] for his teleplay.

R. R. Tolkien]] by a director at Terrytoons in 1956. In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rated PG, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was the longest animated film made at the time, and cost $8-12<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce, grossing $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter.

He read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nRobert Zemeckis, Universal and Dreamworks declined. Fox were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and Sony and Centropolis didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

Visual effects were again managed by [[Weta Digital]], but [[Joe Letteri]] (a Rings veteran) replaced [[Jim Rygiel]] as animation supervisor. \n\nFollowing the release of ''The Battle of the Five Armies'', Freeman reprised his role as Bilbo Baggins in the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch known interchangeably either as ''The Office: Middle Earth'' or ''The Hobbit Office'', alongside [[Bobby Moynihan]], [[Taran Killam]], [[Kyle Mooney]] and [[Kate McKinnon]] as Gandalf, Gollum, Legolas and Tauriel respectively as they take up office jobs. The skit explains that during the events of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tauriel remained working at this office. The skit is based on the fact that Freeman starred in the [[The Office (U.K. TV series)|British series of ''The Office'']] as [[Tim Canterbury]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg8NS6s0fkw|title=Hobbit Office - SNL|date=December 14, 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Crew===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"| Crew\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Peter Jackson's films\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]''\n|-\n!

He was the lead voice on such famous songs as \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]].\"\n\nKnown for his unique raspy and anguished baritone vocals, Ruffin was ranked as one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 2008.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/david-ruffin-19691231|title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time|publisher=rollingstone.com|page=65|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 for his work with the Temptations.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-temptations|title=the Temptations at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> Fellow [[Motown]] recording artist [[Marvin Gaye]] once said admiringly of Ruffin that, \"I heard [in his voice] a strength my own voice lacked.\"<ref name=rollingstone />\n\n==Early life==\nRuffin was born '''Davis Eli Ruffin''' in the rural [[unincorporated community]] of [[Whynot, Mississippi]], 15 miles from [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. He was the third born son of Elias \"Eli\" Ruffin, a [[Baptist]] minister, and Ophelia Ruffin. His siblings were Quincy B. Ruffin, Rita Mae Ruffin, and [[Jimmy Ruffin|Jimmy L. Ruffin]]. Ruffin also had another sister, who died in infancy.\n\n===Ancestry===\nDavid Ruffin's parents were both natives of Mississippi. His father Eli worked as a truck driver at numerous lumber mills, and his mother Ophelia worked out of their home. Eli's parents had moved from [[Alabama]] to Mississippi, because of the harsh circumstances of living after the [[American Civil War]]. Prior to living in Alabama, David Ruffin's great grandparents, John Ruffin and Clara Ruffin, had moved from [[Bertie County, North Carolina]]. John Ruffin was a Civil War Veteran, fighting with the 14th United States Colored Heavy [[Artillery]] Regiment.\n\n===Childhood and adolescence===\nRuffin's father was strict and at times violently abusive.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" /> Ruffin's mother died ten months after his birth in 1941; and his father married Earline, a [[schoolteacher]], in 1942.<ref name=soulbot>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulbot.com/David%20Ruffin%20bad%20news.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911052258/http://www.soulbot.com/David%20Ruffin%20bad%20news.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2009|title=Low notes for David Ruffin|last=Noriyuki|first=Duane|date=May 26, 1988|publisher=soulbot.com|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> As a young child, Ruffin, along with his other siblings (older brothers Quincy and [[Jimmy Ruffin|Jimmy]], and sister Rita Mae), traveled with their father and their stepmother as a family [[gospel (music)|gospel]] group, opening shows for [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[The Five Blind Boys of Mississippi]], among others.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\">Ribowsky, Mark (2010).

Billed as Little David Bush, Ruffin continued to sing at talent shows, worked with horses at a jockey club and eventually became a member of [[The Dixie Nightingales]]. He also sang with [[The Soul Stirrers]] briefly after the departure of [[Johnnie Taylor]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" /> It was in Ruffin's travels as a teenager that he met such later popular personalities as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Little Richard]], [[Frankie Lymon]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Swan Silvertones]] and [[The Dixie Hummingbirds]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" />\n\nAfter some of his singing idols such as [[Sam Cooke]] and [[Jackie Wilson]] had left [[gospel (music)|gospel music]] and gone secular, Ruffin also turned in that direction. Eddie Bush and his wife, Dorothy Helen, took the then-16-year-old Ruffin to [[Detroit, Michigan]], where his brother Jimmy was pursuing a career in music while simultaneously working at the [[Ford Motor Company]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nAfter moving to Detroit with the Bushes, Ruffin recorded his first released record with the songs \"You and I\" (1958) b/w \"Believe Me\" (1958). These songs were recorded at Vega Records and released under the name \"Little David Bush\", using the last name of his guardian. Ruffin would later recall how he initially recorded \"a different kind of music\", strongly influenced by the smoother pop and R&B of the time, when he first recorded in Detroit for Vega.<ref name=\"StreetGold\">{{cite AV media|people=Farag, Henry|year=1992|trans-title=|medium=VHS videocasette|title=David Ruffin|publisher=Street Gold Records|location=Merrillville, Indiana}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Ruffin met [[Berry Gordy Jr.]], then a songwriter with ambitions of running his own label.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/> Ruffin lived with Gordy's father, a [[General contractor|contractor]], and helped \"Pops\" Gordy do construction work on the building that would become [[Hitsville USA]], the headquarters for Gordy's [[Tamla Records]] (later [[Motown Records]]) label.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/><ref name=\"StreetGold\"/> Ruffin's brother Jimmy would eventually be signed to Tamla's Miracle Records label as an artist.\n\nRuffin also worked alongside another ambitious singer, [[Marvin Gaye]], as an apprentice at [[Anna Records]], a [[Chess Records|Chess]]-distributed label run by Gordy's sister [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua]] and his songwriting partner [[Roquel Billy Davis|Billy Davis]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/><ref name=\"StreetGold\"/>\n\nAsked about Ruffin in the ''Detroit Free Press'' in 1988, Gordy Fuqua said: \"He was very much a gentleman, yes ma'am and no ma'am, but the thing that really impressed me about David was that he was one of the only artists I've seen who rehearsed like he was on stage\".<ref name=soulbot/> According to Ruffin, both he and Gaye would pack records for Anna Records.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nRuffin created music as both the vocalist and drummer in the Voice Masters, a doo-wop style combo<ref name=\"Ruffin, David 2016\">\"Ruffin, David.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 15 Jun. 2016.</ref> and eventually started recording at Anna Records, and recorded the song \"I'm in Love\" b/w \"One of These Days\" (1961), with the Voice Masters, a group which included future Motown producer, [[Lamont Dozier]]. Other group members included members of [[The Originals (band)|The Originals]]: Ty Hunter, CP Spencer, Hank Dixon and (Voice Masters and The Originals founder) Walter Gaines. (At one time, The Voice Masters also included another future Temptations member, [[Melvin Franklin]], one of numerous people David would claim as a cousin).<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/> Ruffin did sign to Anna Records as a solo artist, but his work in that time was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Ruffin, David 2016\"/>\n\nRuffin eventually met an up-and-coming local group by the name of [[The Temptations]]. His older brother Jimmy went on a [[Motortown Revue]] tour with the Temptations, and he told David that they needed someone to sing [[tenor]] in their group. David shared his interest in joining the group with [[Otis Williams]], who lived very close to Ruffin in Detroit.\n\nIn January 1964, Ruffin became a member of the Temptations after founding member [[Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant]] was fired from the group. Ruffin's first recording session with the group was January 9, 1964. Though both David and Jimmy were considered, David was given the edge, thanks to his performance skills. These were displayed when he joined the Temptations on stage during the label's New Year's Eve party in 1963.<ref>Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 68\u201370.</ref>\n\n===With the Temptations (1964-1968)===\n{{main|The Temptations}}\nAfter joining the Temptations, the bespectacled Ruffin initially sang [[background singer|backgrounds]] while the role of lead singer mostly alternated between [[Eddie Kendricks]] and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]]. He did sing a few lead parts, both on stage and in the studio, during his first year with the group, but his leads on these studio tracks would not be released for over a year, as they were not considered good enough to showcase his vocals. However, [[Smokey Robinson]], who produced and [[songwriter|co-wrote]] most of the Temptations' material at this point, saw Ruffin during this period as a \"sleeping giant\" in the group with a unique voice that was \"mellow\" yet \"gruff.\"<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1074993|title=My Girl|last=Blair|first=Elizabeth |publisher=npr.org|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> Robinson thought that if he could write just the 'perfect song' for Ruffin's voice, then he could have a smash hit.<ref name=\"npr\" /> The song was to be something that Ruffin could \"belt out\" yet something that was also \"melodic and sweet\".<ref name=\"npr\" /> When Robinson achieved his goal, the song, \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\", was recorded in November 1964 and released a month later. It became the group's first number-one single in 1965. \"My Girl\" subsequently became the Temptations' signature song, and elevated Ruffin to the role of lead singer and frontman.\n\nThe follow-ups to \"My Girl\" were also extremely successful singles, and included the Ruffin-led hits \"[[It's Growing]]\" (1965), \"[[Since I Lost My Baby]]\" (1965), \"[[My Baby (Temptations song)|My Baby]]\" (1965), \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]\" (1966), \"[[Beauty Is Only Skin Deep]]\" (1966), \"[[(I Know) I'm Losing You]]\" (1966), \"[[All I Need (The Temptations song)|All I Need]]\" (1967), \"[[(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need]]\" (1967), \"[[I Wish It Would Rain]]\" (1967), and \"[[I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)]]\" (1968). Ruffin also shared lead vocals on the 1967 hit single \"[[You're My Everything (The Temptations song)|You're My Everything]]\" with Eddie Kendricks.  The tall, 6'3\", Ruffin's passionate and dramatic performances endeared him to the Temptations' audiences and fans. According to [[Otis Williams]], Ruffin (playfully nicknamed \"Ruff\" by the group) was a natural comedian and a hard-working singer when he first joined the group.\n\nRuffin's most notable non-vocal contribution to the Temptations was the masterminding of their trademark four-headed microphone stand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|page=185}}</ref> This enabled the other members to sing and do their dances without having to crowd around one microphone while the lead singer would sing into a separate microphone.\n\n[[File:Temptations-group-pic.jpg|250px|right|thumb|David Ruffin (center) with the Temptations 1967.]]\n\nBy 1967, however, difficulties with Ruffin became an issue for the group. He became addicted to [[cocaine]] and began missing rehearsals and performances.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\" /> Refusing to travel with the other Temptations, Ruffin and his then girlfriend, [[Tammi Terrell]], traveled in a custom [[Limousine|limo]] (with the image of his trademark black rimmed glasses painted on the door).<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=s|isbn=|page=129}}</ref> After [[the Supremes]] had their name changed to ''Diana Ross & the Supremes'' in early 1967, Ruffin felt that he should become the focal point of the Temptations, just as [[Diana Ross]] was for her group, and began demanding that the group name be changed to ''David Ruffin & the Temptations''.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\">{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|pages=164\u2013168}}</ref> This led to a number of disagreements between Ruffin and the group's ''de facto'' leader, Otis Williams.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\" />\n \nIn addition to the group's problems with Ruffin's ego, he began inquiring into the Temptations' financial records, demanding an accounting of the group's money.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\">{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|pages=161\u2013162, 198\u2013203}}</ref> This caused friction between Ruffin and Gordy.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /><ref name=\"ClayMcMurray\">{{cite interview |last= McMurray |first=Clay |interviewer= |title=[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]: \"The Story of David Ruffin\" |type= |url= |format= |work= [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]\n |location=[[Silver Spring, Maryland]] |date=March 2012 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1968, the Temptations agreed that Ruffin had finally crossed the line when he missed a June 22 [[Cleveland, Ohio]], date with the Temptations in order to attend a performance by his new girlfriend, Barbara Gail Martin ([[Dean Martin]]'s daughter).<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> Ruffin was fired on June 27, and replaced with [[Dennis Edwards]], a former member of [[the Contours]], who had been a friend of Ruffin and the group as a whole beforehand.<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> Though Ruffin himself personally encouraged Edwards to take his place, Ruffin began turning up unannounced at Temptations concerts during Edwards' first few dates with the group.<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> When the group started to perform a Ruffin-era song such as \"My Girl\" or \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\", Ruffin would suddenly walk on to the stage, take the microphone from Edwards' hands, and steal the show, embarrassing the group but entertaining the fans.<ref name=\"RuffOut\">Ribowsky (2010), ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'', pp. 180\u2013188.</ref> According to Edwards, the adulation and Ruffin's pleas convinced the other four Temptations to give Ruffin a second chance, but when he arrived late to what was to be his return show with the group in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], The Temptations decided to keep Edwards and drop considerations of rehiring Ruffin.<ref name=\"Interview with Dennis Edwards\">{{cite web|last=Meros|first=Tom|title=Dennis Edwards (Interview)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjZtVCRBQk}}</ref><ref name=\"RuffinReturn\">Ribowsky (2010), ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'', pp. 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nIn October 1968, Ruffin filed suit against Motown Records, seeking a release from the label and an accounting of his money.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /> Motown counter-sued to keep the singer from leaving the label and eventually the case was settled.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /> The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown to finish out his initial contract (Ruffin joined Motown as a solo artist and always had a separate contract from the other Temptations, which some felt caused a lot of the in-fighting within the group).<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" />\n\n=== Solo years ===\n[[File:David Ruffin My Whole World Ended.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The album cover of Ruffin's solo debut LP released in 1969]]\n\nRuffin's first solo single was a song originally intended for the Temptations, \"[[My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)]]\". The single (from the album also entitled ''[[My Whole World Ended]]'') was released in 1969, and reached the US Pop and R&B Top Ten. This was followed by the 1969 album ''[[Feelin' Good (David Ruffin)|Feelin' Good]]''. A third album, titled ''[[David (David Ruffin album)|David]]'', was recorded in 1970\u201371, but was shelved by Motown and did not see commercial release until 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-unreleased-album-mw0001895171|title=The Unreleased Album - David Ruffin {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=|first=|date=|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> \n\nIn 1970, Ruffin recorded an album with his brother Jimmy, [[I Am My Brother's Keeper]], for which they had minor hits with \"When My Love Hand (Comes Tumbling Down)\" and \"Your Love Was Worth Waiting For.\" His next official release for Motown did not arrive until 1973 when ''[[David Ruffin (album)|David Ruffin]]'' was released. While his solo career initially showed promise, Ruffin went into decline, reportedly in part because of his cocaine addiction and the lack of support from Motown.\n\nHis final Top Ten hit was \"[[Walk Away from Love]]\" in 1975, produced by [[Van McCoy]], which reached #9 on the Pop Charts. It was also Ruffin's only entry into the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]] (as a solo artist), and was a hit there as well, making it into the Top Ten (peaking at #10) in early 1976.

He later signed with [[RCA Records]], accompanied by former Temptations colleague Eddie Kendricks, who chose to rekindle their friendship when Kendricks himself started experiencing problems with the Temptations.\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nIn 1982, Ruffin and [[Eddie Kendricks]] re-joined the Temptations for the recording of their album ''[[Reunion (The Temptations album)|Reunion]]'' and a tour to promote the album. The album included the R&B hit \"Standing on the Top\" with [[Rick James]]. The reunion tour was short lived, however, as Ruffin started to miss shows as a result of his cocaine addiction, leading the group to be fined thousands of dollars. Otis Williams fired Ruffin from the group for the second and final time (along with Kendricks, whose voice was weakened due to heavy smoking) by Christmas 1982.<ref name=ReferenceA />\n\nRuffin started touring with Kendricks (who dropped the \"s\" from his last name at this time) as a duo act in 1985. That year, longtime Temptations fans [[Hall & Oates]] teamed up with Ruffin and Kendrick to perform at the re-opening of the [[Apollo Theater]] in New York.

He was the lead voice on such famous songs as \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]].\"\n\nKnown for his unique raspy and anguished baritone vocals, Ruffin was ranked as one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 2008.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/david-ruffin-19691231|title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time|publisher=rollingstone.com|page=65|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 for his work with the Temptations.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-temptations|title=the Temptations at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> Fellow [[Motown]] recording artist [[Marvin Gaye]] once said admiringly of Ruffin that, \"I heard [in his voice] a strength my own voice lacked.\"<ref name=rollingstone />\n\n==Early life==\nRuffin was born '''Davis Eli Ruffin''' in the rural [[unincorporated community]] of [[Whynot, Mississippi]], 15 miles from [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. He was the third born son of Elias \"Eli\" Ruffin, a [[Baptist]] minister, and Ophelia Ruffin. His siblings were Quincy B. Ruffin, Rita Mae Ruffin, and [[Jimmy Ruffin|Jimmy L. Ruffin]]. Ruffin also had another sister, who died in infancy.\n\n===Ancestry===\nDavid Ruffin's parents were both natives of Mississippi. His father Eli worked as a truck driver at numerous lumber mills, and his mother Ophelia worked out of their home. Eli's parents had moved from [[Alabama]] to Mississippi, because of the harsh circumstances of living after the [[American Civil War]]. Prior to living in Alabama, David Ruffin's great grandparents, John Ruffin and Clara Ruffin, had moved from [[Bertie County, North Carolina]]. John Ruffin was a Civil War Veteran, fighting with the 14th United States Colored Heavy [[Artillery]] Regiment.\n\n===Childhood and adolescence===\nRuffin's father was strict and at times violently abusive.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" /> Ruffin's mother died ten months after his birth in 1941; and his father married Earline, a [[schoolteacher]], in 1942.<ref name=soulbot>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulbot.com/David%20Ruffin%20bad%20news.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911052258/http://www.soulbot.com/David%20Ruffin%20bad%20news.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2009|title=Low notes for David Ruffin|last=Noriyuki|first=Duane|date=May 26, 1988|publisher=soulbot.com|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> As a young child, Ruffin, along with his other siblings (older brothers Quincy and [[Jimmy Ruffin|Jimmy]], and sister Rita Mae), traveled with their father and their stepmother as a family [[gospel (music)|gospel]] group, opening shows for [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[The Five Blind Boys of Mississippi]], among others.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\">Ribowsky, Mark (2010).

Billed as Little David Bush, Ruffin continued to sing at talent shows, worked with horses at a jockey club and eventually became a member of [[The Dixie Nightingales]]. He also sang with [[The Soul Stirrers]] briefly after the departure of [[Johnnie Taylor]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" /> It was in Ruffin's travels as a teenager that he met such later popular personalities as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Little Richard]], [[Frankie Lymon]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Swan Silvertones]] and [[The Dixie Hummingbirds]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\" />\n\nAfter some of his singing idols such as [[Sam Cooke]] and [[Jackie Wilson]] had left [[gospel (music)|gospel music]] and gone secular, Ruffin also turned in that direction. Eddie Bush and his wife, Dorothy Helen, took the then-16-year-old Ruffin to [[Detroit, Michigan]], where his brother Jimmy was pursuing a career in music while simultaneously working at the [[Ford Motor Company]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nAfter moving to Detroit with the Bushes, Ruffin recorded his first released record with the songs \"You and I\" (1958) b/w \"Believe Me\" (1958). These songs were recorded at Vega Records and released under the name \"Little David Bush\", using the last name of his guardian. Ruffin would later recall how he initially recorded \"a different kind of music\", strongly influenced by the smoother pop and R&B of the time, when he first recorded in Detroit for Vega.<ref name=\"StreetGold\">{{cite AV media|people=Farag, Henry|year=1992|trans-title=|medium=VHS videocasette|title=David Ruffin|publisher=Street Gold Records|location=Merrillville, Indiana}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Ruffin met [[Berry Gordy Jr.]], then a songwriter with ambitions of running his own label.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/> Ruffin lived with Gordy's father, a [[General contractor|contractor]], and helped \"Pops\" Gordy do construction work on the building that would become [[Hitsville USA]], the headquarters for Gordy's [[Tamla Records]] (later [[Motown Records]]) label.<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/><ref name=\"StreetGold\"/> Ruffin's brother Jimmy would eventually be signed to Tamla's Miracle Records label as an artist.\n\nRuffin also worked alongside another ambitious singer, [[Marvin Gaye]], as an apprentice at [[Anna Records]], a [[Chess Records|Chess]]-distributed label run by Gordy's sister [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua]] and his songwriting partner [[Roquel Billy Davis|Billy Davis]].<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/><ref name=\"StreetGold\"/>\n\nAsked about Ruffin in the ''Detroit Free Press'' in 1988, Gordy Fuqua said: \"He was very much a gentleman, yes ma'am and no ma'am, but the thing that really impressed me about David was that he was one of the only artists I've seen who rehearsed like he was on stage\".<ref name=soulbot/> According to Ruffin, both he and Gaye would pack records for Anna Records.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nRuffin created music as both the vocalist and drummer in the Voice Masters, a doo-wop style combo<ref name=\"Ruffin, David 2016\">\"Ruffin, David.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed.

Other group members included members of [[The Originals (band)|The Originals]]: Ty Hunter, CP Spencer, Hank Dixon and (Voice Masters and The Originals founder) Walter Gaines. (At one time, The Voice Masters also included another future Temptations member, [[Melvin Franklin]], one of numerous people David would claim as a cousin).<ref name=\"RuffinEarlyYears\"/> Ruffin did sign to Anna Records as a solo artist, but his work in that time was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Ruffin, David 2016\"/>\n\nRuffin eventually met an up-and-coming local group by the name of [[The Temptations]]. His older brother Jimmy went on a [[Motortown Revue]] tour with the Temptations, and he told David that they needed someone to sing [[tenor]] in their group. David shared his interest in joining the group with [[Otis Williams]], who lived very close to Ruffin in Detroit.\n\nIn January 1964, Ruffin became a member of the Temptations after founding member [[Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant]] was fired from the group. Ruffin's first recording session with the group was January 9, 1964. Though both David and Jimmy were considered, David was given the edge, thanks to his performance skills. These were displayed when he joined the Temptations on stage during the label's New Year's Eve party in 1963.<ref>Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 68\u201370.</ref>\n\n===With the Temptations (1964-1968)===\n{{main|The Temptations}}\nAfter joining the Temptations, the bespectacled Ruffin initially sang [[background singer|backgrounds]] while the role of lead singer mostly alternated between [[Eddie Kendricks]] and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]]. He did sing a few lead parts, both on stage and in the studio, during his first year with the group, but his leads on these studio tracks would not be released for over a year, as they were not considered good enough to showcase his vocals. However, [[Smokey Robinson]], who produced and [[songwriter|co-wrote]] most of the Temptations' material at this point, saw Ruffin during this period as a \"sleeping giant\" in the group with a unique voice that was \"mellow\" yet \"gruff.\"<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1074993|title=My Girl|last=Blair|first=Elizabeth |publisher=npr.org|accessdate=December 28, 2009}}</ref> Robinson thought that if he could write just the 'perfect song' for Ruffin's voice, then he could have a smash hit.<ref name=\"npr\" /> The song was to be something that Ruffin could \"belt out\" yet something that was also \"melodic and sweet\".<ref name=\"npr\" /> When Robinson achieved his goal, the song, \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\", was recorded in November 1964 and released a month later. It became the group's first number-one single in 1965. \"My Girl\" subsequently became the Temptations' signature song, and elevated Ruffin to the role of lead singer and frontman.\n\nThe follow-ups to \"My Girl\" were also extremely successful singles, and included the Ruffin-led hits \"[[It's Growing]]\" (1965), \"[[Since I Lost My Baby]]\" (1965), \"[[My Baby (Temptations song)|My Baby]]\" (1965), \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]\" (1966), \"[[Beauty Is Only Skin Deep]]\" (1966), \"[[(I Know) I'm Losing You]]\" (1966), \"[[All I Need (The Temptations song)|All I Need]]\" (1967), \"[[(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need]]\" (1967), \"[[I Wish It Would Rain]]\" (1967), and \"[[I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)]]\" (1968). Ruffin also shared lead vocals on the 1967 hit single \"[[You're My Everything (The Temptations song)|You're My Everything]]\" with Eddie Kendricks.  The tall, 6'3\", Ruffin's passionate and dramatic performances endeared him to the Temptations' audiences and fans. According to [[Otis Williams]], Ruffin (playfully nicknamed \"Ruff\" by the group) was a natural comedian and a hard-working singer when he first joined the group.\n\nRuffin's most notable non-vocal contribution to the Temptations was the masterminding of their trademark four-headed microphone stand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|page=185}}</ref> This enabled the other members to sing and do their dances without having to crowd around one microphone while the lead singer would sing into a separate microphone.\n\n[[File:Temptations-group-pic.jpg|250px|right|thumb|David Ruffin (center) with the Temptations 1967.]]\n\nBy 1967, however, difficulties with Ruffin became an issue for the group. He became addicted to [[cocaine]] and began missing rehearsals and performances.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\" /> Refusing to travel with the other Temptations, Ruffin and his then girlfriend, [[Tammi Terrell]], traveled in a custom [[Limousine|limo]] (with the image of his trademark black rimmed glasses painted on the door).<ref>{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=s|isbn=|page=129}}</ref> After [[the Supremes]] had their name changed to ''Diana Ross & the Supremes'' in early 1967, Ruffin felt that he should become the focal point of the Temptations, just as [[Diana Ross]] was for her group, and began demanding that the group name be changed to ''David Ruffin & the Temptations''.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\">{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|pages=164\u2013168}}</ref> This led to a number of disagreements between Ruffin and the group's ''de facto'' leader, Otis Williams.<ref name=\"RuffinProbs\" />\n \nIn addition to the group's problems with Ruffin's ego, he began inquiring into the Temptations' financial records, demanding an accounting of the group's money.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\">{{cite book|last=Ribowsky|title=Ain't Too Proud to Beg|year=2010|publisher=|isbn=|pages=161\u2013162, 198\u2013203}}</ref> This caused friction between Ruffin and Gordy.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /><ref name=\"ClayMcMurray\">{{cite interview |last= McMurray |first=Clay |interviewer= |title=[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]: \"The Story of David Ruffin\" |type= |url= |format= |work= [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]\n |location=[[Silver Spring, Maryland]] |date=March 2012 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1968, the Temptations agreed that Ruffin had finally crossed the line when he missed a June 22 [[Cleveland, Ohio]], date with the Temptations in order to attend a performance by his new girlfriend, Barbara Gail Martin ([[Dean Martin]]'s daughter).<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> Ruffin was fired on June 27, and replaced with [[Dennis Edwards]], a former member of [[the Contours]], who had been a friend of Ruffin and the group as a whole beforehand.<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> Though Ruffin himself personally encouraged Edwards to take his place, Ruffin began turning up unannounced at Temptations concerts during Edwards' first few dates with the group.<ref name=\"RuffOut\" /> When the group started to perform a Ruffin-era song such as \"My Girl\" or \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\", Ruffin would suddenly walk on to the stage, take the microphone from Edwards' hands, and steal the show, embarrassing the group but entertaining the fans.<ref name=\"RuffOut\">Ribowsky (2010), ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'', pp. 180\u2013188.</ref> According to Edwards, the adulation and Ruffin's pleas convinced the other four Temptations to give Ruffin a second chance, but when he arrived late to what was to be his return show with the group in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], The Temptations decided to keep Edwards and drop considerations of rehiring Ruffin.<ref name=\"Interview with Dennis Edwards\">{{cite web|last=Meros|first=Tom|title=Dennis Edwards (Interview)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjZtVCRBQk}}</ref><ref name=\"RuffinReturn\">Ribowsky (2010), ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'', pp. 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nIn October 1968, Ruffin filed suit against Motown Records, seeking a release from the label and an accounting of his money.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /> Motown counter-sued to keep the singer from leaving the label and eventually the case was settled.<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" /> The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown to finish out his initial contract (Ruffin joined Motown as a solo artist and always had a separate contract from the other Temptations, which some felt caused a lot of the in-fighting within the group).<ref name=\"RuffinMoneyLawsuit1968\" />\n\n=== Solo years ===\n[[File:David Ruffin My Whole World Ended.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The album cover of Ruffin's solo debut LP released in 1969]]\n\nRuffin's first solo single was a song originally intended for the Temptations, \"[[My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)]]\". The single (from the album also entitled ''[[My Whole World Ended]]'') was released in 1969, and reached the US Pop and R&B Top Ten. This was followed by the 1969 album ''[[Feelin' Good (David Ruffin)|Feelin' Good]]''. A third album, titled ''[[David (David Ruffin album)|David]]'', was recorded in 1970\u201371, but was shelved by Motown and did not see commercial release until 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-unreleased-album-mw0001895171|title=The Unreleased Album - David Ruffin {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=|first=|date=|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> \n\nIn 1970, Ruffin recorded an album with his brother Jimmy, [[I Am My Brother's Keeper]], for which they had minor hits with \"When My Love Hand (Comes Tumbling Down)\" and \"Your Love Was Worth Waiting For.\" His next official release for Motown did not arrive until 1973 when ''[[David Ruffin (album)|David Ruffin]]'' was released. While his solo career initially showed promise, Ruffin went into decline, reportedly in part because of his cocaine addiction and the lack of support from Motown.\n\nHis final Top Ten hit was \"[[Walk Away from Love]]\" in 1975, produced by [[Van McCoy]], which reached #9 on the Pop Charts. It was also Ruffin's only entry into the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]] (as a solo artist), and was a hit there as well, making it into the Top Ten (peaking at #10) in early 1976.

The album included the R&B hit \"Standing on the Top\" with [[Rick James]]. The reunion tour was short lived, however, as Ruffin started to miss shows as a result of his cocaine addiction, leading the group to be fined thousands of dollars. Otis Williams fired Ruffin from the group for the second and final time (along with Kendricks, whose voice was weakened due to heavy smoking) by Christmas 1982.<ref name=ReferenceA />\n\nRuffin started touring with Kendricks (who dropped the \"s\" from his last name at this time) as a duo act in 1985. That year, longtime Temptations fans [[Hall & Oates]] teamed up with Ruffin and Kendrick to perform at the re-opening of the [[Apollo Theater]] in New York. Their performance was released as a successful live album and single. The four singers also sang a medley of Temptations hits at [[Live Aid]] on July 13, 1985. In 1985, a live medley of \"[[The Way You Do the Things You Do|The Way You Do The Things You Do]]\" and \"My Girl\" was released by Hall & Oates featuring Ruffin and Kendrick.
