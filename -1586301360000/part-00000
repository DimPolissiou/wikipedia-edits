It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premiss that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others.

It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premise that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. However, according to left-libertarians the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.

Strongly opposed to [[feudalism]] and the [[Land tenure|privatisation of land]], George created the philosophy of [[Georgism]], or [[geoism]], influential among many left-libertarians, including [[Geolibertarianism|geolibertarians]] and [[geoanarchists]]. Much like the English [[The Diggers|Digger movement]], [[Communism|who held all material possessions in common]], George claimed that land and its financial properties belong to everyone, and that to hold land as [[private property]] would lead to immense inequalities, including authority from the private owners of such ground.\n\nPrior to [[State (polity)|states]] assigning property owners slices of either once populated or uninhabited land, the world's earth was held in common. When all resources that derive from land are put to achieving a higher quality of life, not just for [[Ruling class|employers or landlords]], but to serve the general interests and comforts of a wider community, Geolibertarians claim vastly higher qualities of life can be reached, especially with ever advancing technology and industrialised agriculture.\n\n[[File:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|The [[Diggers]], early [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communists]], [[Common property|held all things in common]], including [[Enclosure|land which was often violently seized]] by the European [[aristocracy]]]]\nThe [[Levellers]], also known as the [[Diggers]], were a 17th-century [[anti-authoritarian]] movement that stood in resistance to the English government and the [[feudalism]] it was pushing through the forced privatisation of land around the time of the [[First English Civil War]]. Devout [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Gerrard Winstanley]] was a prominent member of the community and with a [[Christian communism|very progressive interpretation of his religion]] sought to end buying and selling, instead for all inhabitants of a society to share their material possessions and to hold all things in common, without money or payment. With the complete abolition of private property, including that of private land, the English Levellers created a pool of property where all properties belonged in equal measure to everyone. Often seen as some of the first practising anarchists, the Digger movement is considered extremely early [[libertarian communism]].\n\n=== Modern libertarianism in the United States ===\n{{main|Libertarianism in the United States}}\nBy around the start of the 20th century, the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed.<ref>[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]] (1995) [2006].

From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions\u2014the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions\u2014neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a ''laissez-faire'' 'free' market.

It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premiss that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property. Historic proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Henry George.

It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premise that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. However, according to left-libertarians the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.

Strongly opposed to [[feudalism]] and the [[Land tenure|privatisation of land]], George created the philosophy of [[Georgism]], or [[geoism]], influential among many left-libertarians, including [[Geolibertarianism|geolibertarians]] and [[geoanarchists]]. Much like the English [[The Diggers|Digger movement]], [[Communism|who held all material possessions in common]], George claimed that land and its financial properties belong to everyone, and that to hold land as [[private property]] would lead to immense inequalities, including authority from the private owners of such ground.\n\nPrior to [[State (polity)|states]] assigning property owners slices of either once populated or uninhabited land, the world's earth was held in common. When all resources that derive from land are put to achieving a higher quality of life, not just for [[Ruling class|employers or landlords]], but to serve the general interests and comforts of a wider community, Geolibertarians claim vastly higher qualities of life can be reached, especially with ever advancing technology and industrialised agriculture.\n\n[[File:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|The [[Diggers]], early [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communists]], [[Common property|held all things in common]], including [[Enclosure|land which was often violently seized]] by the European [[aristocracy]]]]\nThe [[Levellers]], also known as the [[Diggers]], were a 17th-century [[anti-authoritarian]] movement that stood in resistance to the English government and the [[feudalism]] it was pushing through the forced privatisation of land around the time of the [[First English Civil War]]. Devout [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Gerrard Winstanley]] was a prominent member of the community and with a [[Christian communism|very progressive interpretation of his religion]] sought to end buying and selling, instead for all inhabitants of a society to share their material possessions and to hold all things in common, without money or payment. With the complete abolition of private property, including that of private land, the English Levellers created a pool of property where all properties belonged in equal measure to everyone. Often seen as some of the first practising anarchists, the Digger movement is considered extremely early [[libertarian communism]].\n\n=== Modern libertarianism in the United States ===\n{{main|Libertarianism in the United States}}\nBy around the start of the 20th century, the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed.<ref>[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]] (1995) [2006].

He also argued that \"ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears\" is an \"absurdity\".<ref name=\"Landauer\"/> In response, ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' states the following: \"Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies\". It also states that \"some sort of 'court' system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens\".<ref>Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective (2017).

It is known from the [[Type species|type]] and only known species, '''''S. indicus'''''. ''Shringasaurus'' is known from the Denwa Formation in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. ''Shringasaurus'' was an [[allokotosaur]], a group of unusual herbivorous reptiles from the Triassic, and is most closely related to the smaller and better known ''[[Azendohsaurus]]'' in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Azendohsauridae]]. Like some [[Ceratopsidae|ceratopsid]] [[dinosaurs]], ''Shringasaurus'' had two large horns over its eyes that faced up and forwards from its [[skull]]. These horns were likely used for display, and possibly during fights with other ''Shringasaurus'', much like what has been suggested for the horns of ceratopsids like ''[[Triceratops]]''. ''Shringsaurus'' also bears similarities to [[sauropodomorph]] dinosaurs, such as its long neck and teeth, and likely occupied a similar [[ecological niche]] as a large browsing herbivore before they had evolved.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Shringasaurus indicus.png|thumb|left|Skeletal restoration and various bones of ''Shringasaurus''.]]\n''Shringasaurus'' was a large-bodied quadruped, with an estimated body length of {{convert|3\u20134|m}} long. Its closely resembles the related ''Azendohsaurus'', with a small, boxy head on a long neck and a large, barrel-shaped body with deep shoulders and ribs, sprawled to semi-sprawled limbs and a short tail. Aside from being notably larger than ''Azendohsaurus'', ''Shringasaurus'' is most recognisable for its long curving brow horns, as well as having a proportionately shorter and thicker neck than other azendohsaurids with much taller [[neural spine]]s in the neck and over the shoulders.<ref name=description>{{cite journal |last1=Sengupta |first1=S.|last2=Ezcurra |first2=M.D.|last3=Bandyopadhyay |first3=S.|year=2017|title=A new horned and long-necked herbivorous stem-archosaur from the Middle Triassic of India|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|volume=7|pages=8366|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-08658-8|pmc=5567049 |pmid=28827583}}</ref><ref name=\"nesbitt2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Nesbitt|first1=S.J.|last2=Flynn|first2=J.J.|last3=Pritchard|first3=A.C.|last4=Parrish|first4=M.J.|last5=Ranivoharimanana|first5=L.|last6=Wyss|first6=A.R.|year=2015|title=Postcranial osteology of ''Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis'' (?Middle to Upper Triassic, Isalo Group, Madagascar) and its systematic position among stem archosaur reptiles.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286412354|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History]]|volume=|issue=398|pages=1\u2013126|doi=10.5531/sd.sp.15|issn=0003-0090|via=|hdl=2246/6624}}</ref>\n\n===Skull===\nThe skull of ''Shringasaurus'' is not completely known, but what's preserved indicates that the skull was small and boxy, with a short, deep snout with rounded jaw tips and [[Nostril|bony nostrils]] fused into a single, confluent opening at the front of the snout. This is broadly similar to the completely known skull of ''Azendohsaurus'', however the lower jaw of ''Shringasaurus'' has a more conspicuous taper towards the tip compared to the deep, down-turned [[dentary bone|dentary]] of ''Azendohsaurus''.<ref name=description/><ref name=\"Fetal10\">{{cite journal|last=Flynn|first=J.J.|author2=Nesbitt, S.J.|author3=Parrish, J.M.|author4=Ranivoharimanana, L.|author5=Wyss, A.R.|year=2010|title=A new species of ''Azendohsaurus'' (Diapsida: Archosauromorpha) from the Triassic Isalo Group of southwestern Madagascar: cranium and mandible |journal=[[Palaeontology (journal)|Palaeontology]]|volume=53|issue=3|pages=669\u2013688|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2010.00954.x}}</ref>\n\nThe horns of ''Shringasaurus'' closely resemble those seen in ceratopsid dinosaurs, despite being totally unrelated to each other. The horns are attached to the [[frontal bone]]s on the roof of the skull over the eyes, and sit across almost the entire breadth of the skull. These horns a pointed up and curve forwards from the skull, with slight variation in size and orientation between large individuals. Smaller and younger individuals had smaller, more gracile horns, indicating that the horns did not fully develop until the animals were mature. Intriguingly, at least one small specimen lacks horns entirely, whereas another similarly small specimen has small but well developed horns. It's suggested then that ''Shringasaurus'' was [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], and that possibly the females lacked horns.<ref name=description/>\n\nThe horns themselves have a rough, grooved texture that implies they were covered with a [[keratin]]ous sheath of horn in life, also like ceratopsid horns, and so would have likely been longer than the bony cores indicate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hieronymus |first1=T.

At least seven to eight individuals were recovered from the bone bed, based on the number of different left humeri, skull roofs and horns discovered, and they are all from varying ontogenetic stages of growth with a wide range of body sizes.

It is particularly similar to ''Azendohsaurus'' in features of the [[parietal bone|pareitals]], the lower jaw, shoulder, hip, femur and vertebrae, but can be distinguished by teeth that are not expanded above the roots, the lack of a groove on the inside surface of the maxilla, tall neural spines, and of course the horns.<ref name=description/>\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n[[File:Shringasaurus skull.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the skull and horns compared to that of the ceratopsid dinosaur ''[[Arrhinoceratops]]'', and a comparison of various horns from different sized individuals, including a possibly female hornless specimen.]]\n\n===Function of the horns===\nThe horns of ''Shringasaurus'' are its most prominent feature, and so some focus was placed on their role and function in its initial description. The horns were likely products of [[sexual selection]], and were not primarily for defence or [[species recognition]] (as has been proposed for the head ornaments of dinosaurs).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hone |first1=D.W.E. |last2=Naish |first2=D. |year=2013 |title=The \u2018species recognition hypothesis\u2019 does not explain the presence and evolution of exaggerated structures in nonavialan dinosaurs |journal=[[Journal of Zoology]] |volume=290 |issue=3 |pages=172\u2013180 |doi=10.1111/jzo.12035}}</ref> The horns grow notably larger and more robust in large adults, while smaller individuals have shorter and more graceful horns.

Its climate is classified as very similar to its twin city [[Islamabad]], but the geographical location and extreme urbanization of Rawalpindi has led to weather and climatic conditions that are notably different from its twin. Rawalpindi's weather has historically been known to change rather quickly due to its proximity to [[Himalayas]] and the [[Pir Panjal Range]]. These mountains not only influence the weather of the city, but also provide great recreation during the hot months. Furthermore, Its warm comfortable mean annual temperature of {{Convert|21.3|C|F|0|lk=on}} attracts people to live here permanently from all over [[Pakistan]]. The average annual rainfall is abundant at {{Convert|1346.8|mm|in}}, most of which falls in the monsoon season. However, frontal cloud bands also bring significant rainfall in the winter. In summers, June is the hottest with record maximum temperature at a blistering {{Convert|48.3|C|F|0|lk=on}} recorded on 13 June 1953.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.met.gov.pk/cdpc/islamabad.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508170538/http://www.met.gov.pk/cdpc/islamabad.htm |archivedate=2009-05-08 }} Islamabad (During 1931-2006)</ref> On the other hand, January is the coldest month of the year when temperature can drop to a minimum {{Convert|-3.9|C|F|0|lk=on}} in the winter recorded on 17 January 1967. Throughout the year, [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Islamabad]] experience an average of about 98 thunderstorms, which is the highest frequency of thunderstorms in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province of any plane station. In fact, most rainfall in the city is accompanied by a thunderstorm with peak activity experienced in August. Record rainfall was experienced in the year 2013 at a massive {{Convert|1988|mm|in}} mostly due to an unusually wet monsoon season. On a typical day, the city hosts breezy afternoons ({{convert|30|km/h|mph}}+), but usually calm to light breeze ([[Beaufort scale]]) wind conditions are observed after midnight. The mean annual [[wind speed]] of Rawalpindi is roughly {{convert|10|km/h|mph}} at 14 m height. Moreover, just a few kilometers southwest of Rawalpindi, the potential power generation has been identified by U.S. Aid to be between marginal to good ({{convert|5.4|m/s|km/h}} to {{convert|7.4|m/s|km/h}}) at 50 m height.\n\n==Prevailing conditions==\n[[Western Disturbance]], [[Monsoon]] and localized convection currents during the summers are responsible for changing weather conditions in Rawalpindi. Following is a list and conditions provided for the change in weather conditions.\n\n* '''Western Disturbances''' occur almost every month in the city, but peaks during the winter months.  Not only do these disturbances decrease day and night temperatures, but provides the city with rainfall during its dry months.  However, by the time these winds reach Rawalpindi, these westerly waves are quite weak in intensity resulting in only light to moderate amounts of rainfall.  Heavy rainfall from these disturbances are rare. Nonetheless, February 2013 experienced record rains accumulating to {{convert|310|mm|in}}\n* '''Monsoon''' result in the greatest amount of rainfall in the city and reduces the excruciating heat of the relatively dry early summer months. During late June, July, August, and early September swith every out easterly \nwinds with the intensity of fresh breeze bring along the monsoon clouds and push them against the mighty [[Himalayas]]. Most often, significant rainfall in [[Rawalpindi]] doesn't occur until these moisture laden air interact with western disturbances, producing powerful supercell thunderstorms accompanied with heavy winds, lightning and heavy to very heavy rainfall. Furthermore, these storms can last from 20 minutes to several hours in duration. The highest dew point is experienced during this time of the year with extremely high [[heat index|heat indices]].\n* '''Dust storms''' occur most frequently during the dry heat of May and June, but may well also be occur during the months of late March and April. Dust storms in Rawalpindi are most often accompanied by thunderstorms producing [[squalls]] and lightning. Visibilities drop below 100 meters in extreme cases with wind speeds surpass a fierce {{convert|157|km/h|mph}}.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2012/6/12/DailyHistory.html Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Rainfall from these storms is generally low to moderate.\n* '''Continental Air''' prevails during the dry periods of the year with ample sunshine and partly cloudy to clear skies. As high pressure is established atmosphere becomes stable result in no precipitation until a western disturbance intervenes. Strong breeze from westerly direction blow during the day, while nights are calm during this time.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2013/2/19/DailyHistory.html Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Thunderstorms==\nRawalpindi experiences one of the greatest number of thunderstorms in [[Pakistan]]. At a frequency of 89.45 thunderstorms per year on average, which is quite high, these numbers are comparable to those of [[Florida]], USA.<ref>[http://climatecenter.fsu.edu/topics/thunderstorms Thunderstorms - Florida Climate Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some of the strongest thunderstorms in the country occur here either accompanied by dusty [[squalls]], [[microbursts]], [[cloudburst]] and sometimes even [[funnel clouds]]. Its location allows it to experience the maximum wind speed of the storm relative to its twin city [[Islamabad]]. On 13 October 2006, wind gusts from a powerful thunderstorm reported by [[Pakistan Meteorological Department]] to have reached {{convert|167|km/h|mph}}.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2006/10/13/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The strongest wind gust during this storm was reported to be 95 knots or {{convert|176|km/h|mph}}, which is the highest recorded wind speed in [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Islamabad]] region and adjoining areas. As a matter of fact, a funnel cloud was also observed during this storm near Chaklala, Rawalpindi. Tornadoes are rare, but have been reported thrice in the past decade in 2006 and 2012, 2014. The biggest challenge that arises due to these dangerous conditions include fallen trees, downed power lines, and damage to infrastructure including mud houses in the slums and billboards around the city.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Monthly conditions==\n\n{{Weather box\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| location = Rawalpindi\n| Jan high C = 17.0\n| Feb high C = 19.5\n| Mar high C = 24.2\n| Apr high C = 29.9\n| May high C = 35.4\n| Jun high C = 39.5\n| Jul high C = 35.8\n| Aug high C = 33.7\n| Sep high C = 33.6\n| Oct high C = 30.9\n| Nov high C = 25.0\n| Dec high C = 19.3\n| Jan mean C = 9.8\n| Feb mean C = 12.5\n| Mar mean C = 17.3\n| Apr mean C = 22.6\n| May mean C = 27.6\n| Jun mean C = 32.0\n| Jul mean C = 30.3\n| Aug mean C = 28.6\n| Sep mean C = 27.6\n| Oct mean C = 22.7\n| Nov mean C = 16.2\n| Dec mean C = 11.3\n| Jan low C = 2.7\n| Feb low C = 5.5\n| Mar low C = 10.4\n| Apr low C = 15.3\n| May low C = 19.9\n| Jun low C = 24.5\n| Jul low C = 24.8\n| Aug low C = 23.6\n| Sep low C = 21.6\n| Oct low C = 14.5\n| Nov low C = 7.5\n| Dec low C = 3.3\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 64.1\n| Feb precipitation mm = 87.1\n| Mar precipitation mm = 102.4\n| Apr precipitation mm = 65.2\n| May precipitation mm = 34.1\n| Jun precipitation mm = 85.3\n| Jul precipitation mm = 365.3\n| Aug precipitation mm = 340.3\n| Sep precipitation mm = 120.7\n| Oct precipitation mm = 31.7\n| Nov precipitation mm = 14.4\n| Dec precipitation mm = 36.2\n| source 1 = ''Climate-Data.org'', altitude: 497m<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">[https://en.climate-data.org/asia/pakistan/punjab/rawalpindi-1009/ Rawalpindi]</ref>\n}}\n\nEvery month in Rawalpindi is marked by its own unique characteristics, conditions and weather pattern. Following is also a summary of each month's averages and records.\n\n===January===\nJanuary is the coldest month in Rawalpindi with an average low of {{Convert|3.1|C|F}} and a record low of {{Convert|-3.9|C|F}} recorded in 1967.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.pmd.gov.pk/cdpc/extrems/islamabad.htm QUETTA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Most days are clear blue skies, however this month is prone to foggy nights and mornings. Near zero visibility is experienced during extremely foggy nights that absolutely hampers air traffic and [[Motorways of Pakistan|motorways]]. [[Western Disturbance]] brings cloudy days, rain and sometimes thunderstorms, which are essential for breaking long dry spells in the city experienced during this cool month. Moreover, it eliminates the conditions suitable for the formation of fog at night. Average rainfall for the month sums up to {{convert|67.1|mm|in}} and a record rainfall of {{convert|166.9|mm|in}} recorded in 1954. However, strong thunder/windstorm is uncommon during this month. The average high is {{Convert|17.6|C|F}} while a record high of {{Convert|30.1|C|F}} was recorded on 30 January 1995. Strong winds blow from the west during most clear days, but nights are calm with cool to cold temperatures.\n\n===February===\nFebruary experiences similar weather to January except that usually it is a few degrees warmer. Most nights are cool and days are warm with an average low and high of {{Convert|5.4|C|F}} and {{Convert|19.2|C|F}}, respectively. Overcast for several days is not uncommon during this month with the least amount of sunshine experienced during this month. A record high of {{Convert|30.0|C|F}} recorded on 28 February 1985, while the coldest {{Convert|-2.0|C|F}}<ref name=autogenerated1 /> on 8 February 1978 have been recorded. Average rainfall is relatively greater than January totaling to {{convert|84.1|mm|in}}. In 2013, record rainfall of {{convert|306.1|mm|in}} and a thunderstorms breakout was experienced from three western disturbances that caused bizarre conditions of frequent hailstorms and {{convert|93|km/h|mph}} wind gusts.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2013/2/5/DailyHistory.html Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Moreover, hailstorms with thunderstorms are not a rare occurrence in this cool time of the year. Observations demonstrate that cold weather (below zero temperature) is not experienced after halfway through the month as plantation season officially begins during the last fortnight.\n\n===March===\nMarch has a splendid spring time feel in Rawalpindi with perfect warm temperatures of {{Convert|23.7|C|F}} during the day and cool crispy night temperatures averaging to {{Convert|10.1|C|F}}. A freak heat wave was experienced in Rawalpindi with maximum temperature reaching{{Convert|36.0 |C|F}} on 20 March 2010, breaking the old record of {{Convert|34.4 |C|F}} recorded exactly on the same day in 2002. An extreme minimum of {{Convert|-0.3|C|F}} was recorded 17 March 1967. As spring season begins to settle, rainfall also increases from Western Disturbances accumulating to {{convert|92.4|mm|in}}. 2015 set a record rainfall of a massive {{convert|331.1|mm|in}}. A few strong thunderstorms develop every year during this month and sometimes these can accompanied by dust storms and gusts near hurricane force at {{convert|120|km/h|mph}}. Hailstorms are both greater in frequency and intensity during March and weather can quickly change during the day.\n\n===April===\nApril in Rawalpindi transitions from warm to hot during day time, while night temperatures begin to move from cool to warm. Typically, late April sees a sharp rise in the both day and night time temperature. Mean high during day time is {{Convert|30.2|C|F}}, while nights enjoy a mean of {{Convert|15.4|C|F}}. Record high for April is a very hot {{Convert|40.6|C|F}} recorded on 29 April 2006, on the other hand, a chilly low of {{Convert|5.1|C|F}} on 7 April 1994 have been witnessed. Western Disturbance is responsible for localized rainfall during this month, but typically these systems are not as strong as during March since rainfall totals {{convert|63.2|mm|in}}. Moreover, thunderstorms often cause horrid dust storms that become a frequent occurrence as the weather becomes drier, transitioning into summer. An average 1.0 dust storms are experienced in Rawalpindi (Average 1961-1991). On the other hand, record rainfall of {{convert|264.9|mm|in}} was recorded in 1983. One such thunderstorm was blamed for the disaster of Bhoja Air jet, flight BHO-213 when a lightning strike or wind shear was blamed for the tragedy.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17788698 BBC News - Pakistan plane crashes near Islamabad airport<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A full report has yet to be released to the public. Heavy rain showers are rare during this month as dust storms frequently only cause drizzle or light scattered rain that makes the weather pleasant.\n\n===May===\nAs May begins day time temperatures begin to rise and the day and night time temperature range is high during this time. It is categorized as a hot dry month with a record maximum of {{Convert|45.6|C|F}} experienced on 31 May 1988. Furthermore, during the record breaking heat wave of 2013 in [[Pakistan]], near record temperature of {{Convert|45.5|C|F}} was recorded on 24 May 2013. This heat wave witnessed an average high of {{Convert|37.4|C|F}}, which is 2.5 degrees higher than its average high of {{Convert|34.9|C|F}}. Average minimum stands at {{Convert|20.1|C|F}} with record low of {{Convert|10.1|C|F}} experienced in 9 May 1997. Nevertheless, night time temperatures during heat waves could remain well above average with the warmest low of {{Convert|28.0|C|F}} recorded in 2013. Mid-May and June typically are the dry heat season. Thunderstorms that occur are typically strong, accompany heavy dust with blinding visibility and wind speed in excess of {{convert|130|km/h|mph}} in some storms. These storms truly testify as \"Kali Andhi\", a common phrase used by the locals as they witness an average of 1.6 dust storms per year (average 1961-1991). Most storms occur during night time that brings relief from the relentless heat of the day. Rainfall however is scanty as the mean is only {{convert|34.1|mm|in}}, while 1965 was the wettest May at {{convert|115.3|mm|in}}. Wind speeds during this month are the second highest averaging to more than {{convert|16|km/h|mph}}.\n\n===June===\nJune is undoubtedly the hottest month of the year. Most day time temperatures are excruciatingly hot with the maximum record temperature of {{Convert|46.6|C|F}} recorded on 23 June 2005 in Chaklala, Rawalpindi with an average high reaching {{Convert|36.8|C|F}}. However, a maximum temperature of {{Convert|47.8|C|F}} was recorded in Saddar (city center) on 19 June 1952 and even that record was broken the following year on 13 June when the temperature soared to an astonishing {{Convert|48.3|C|F}}. Heat waves experienced during this season often raises temperature to over {{Convert|45|C|F}}. Nights are warm at an average of {{Convert|24.2|C|F}}; however, during heat waves night time temperatures may not fall below {{Convert|30|C|F}} and begin to rise again soon after sunrise. The record low of {{Convert|15.0|C|F}} for June was experienced on 2 June 1979. June experiences the highest number of dust storms averaging 2.4 (average of 1961-1991). Thunderstorm activity is high and the city often experiences severe thunderstorms during this month. Rainfall for June averages {{convert|75.3|mm|in}} and comes from both western disturbances, localized thunderstorms and monsoons. Record breaking wind speed for June was recorded on 5 June 2003 when a wind/thunderstorm broke havoc in the city with gusts up to 90 knots {{convert|167|km/h|mph}} that caused most of the city to lose power and property damage. These powerful thunderstorms develop as a result of moist warm monsoon winds colliding with cool dry western disturbance creating monstrous thunderstorms accompanied with powerful microburst that cause extensive damage to billboards, pylons, roofs, crops and trees. Unfortunately, every year these wind storms kill as well.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} One such microburst of 85 knots was recorded by a weather station at Chaklala on 12 June 2012.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Usually, late June welcomes the monsoon season which causes [[dew point]] to rise, and wind direction shifts from west to southeast. Relative humidity increases from these southeasterly winds that causes great discomfort without air conditioning as head indices (feels like) can rise in excess of {{Convert|50|C|F}}. In 2008, the city experienced record rainfall of {{convert|255|mm|in}}. The month of June is also the windiest of all with an average wind speed of {{convert|17|km/h|mph}}.\n\n===July===\nJuly is the second wettest month with an average rainfall of {{convert|305.3|mm|in}} as the monsoon activity increases. The highest rainfall ever recorded in a month accumulated to {{convert|743.3|mm|in}} recorded in 1995 with very dramatic weather as rain was brought by severe thunderstorms and [[cloudburst]]. The highs are relatively cooler than June, but the [[heat index]] (feels like temperature) makes the heat all the more blistering with southeastern monsoons winds increasing [[dew point]] up to {{Convert|28|C|F}}.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2011/7/13/DailyHistory.html Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The average high temperature for July is {{Convert|35.3|C|F}} categorized as hot, an extreme of {{Convert|45.4|C|F}} recorded on 3 July 2012. Nights are also warm at an average {{Convert|24.4|C|F}} since the temperature range is small during these humid months. However, a record low of {{Convert|17.8|C|F}} was experienced on 8 July 1966. Thunderstorm activity is the second highest during this month but most of the rumbling and anger of the clouds is heard at night. Rain showers can be extremely heavy at times especially during cloudburst events. Unprecedented flooding cannot be ruled out during such events. One such cloud burst took the twin cities by surprise also known as the [[2001 Islamabad cloud burst]], brought historic [[flash floods]] in the stream of \"Nullah Lai\" and brought tragic scenes to the city. This 100-year storm dropped Pakistan's highest 24-hour rainfall ever reported in the neighboring city of Islamabad accumulating to an astounding {{convert|620|mm|in}}, while Rawalpindi at Shamasabad (Northern Rawalpindi) received {{convert|335|mm|in}} during the same storm, while Chaklala, Rawalpindi recorded {{convert|152|mm|in}}.<ref>http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/DPS/TC-DPFS-2002/Papers-Posters/Topic3-NaeemShah.pdf</ref>\n\n===August===\nAugust is the wettest month with an average rainfall of {{convert|340.3|mm|in}} as the monsoon peak during this month. August is a hot and humid month, however, thunderstorm activity reaches its peak primarily due to the monsoon. On average a thunderstorm happens every other day also attributing it as the wettest month of the year. Slightly lower mean maximum temperature of {{Convert|33.7|C|F}} is recorded, while average minimum of {{Convert|23.8|C|F}} has been observed. Record high temperature for August is {{Convert|42|C|F}} was recorded on 11 August 1987 and the record low of {{Convert|17|C|F}} on 3 August 1976. Similarly to July, some of the strongest thunderstorms are formed during this month that result in severe wind storms. One such powerful thunderstorm was reported from Northerly direction on 26 August 2005, which not only caused most of the city to lose power, but motorists faced hazardous conditions due to falling trees. [[Pakistan Meteorological Department]] recorded wind gusts of 90 knots or {{convert|167|km/h|mph}}. Record rainfall for the month is a massive {{convert|670.3|mm|in}} recorded in 2013.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Furthermore, it is not unusual to experience {{convert|150|mm|in}}+ rain showers within 24 hours during July and August. The highest dew point was of {{Convert|29|C|F}} was recorded on the morning of 7 August 2015, which made the temperature of {{Convert|32|C|F}} felt like an oppressive {{Convert|46|C|F}}. Flooding in lower elevations of the city is common as well. The temperature by mid August becomes comfortable enough that plantation season begins in the city.\n\n===September===\nSeptember is cooler and relatively less humid than the subsequent two monsoon months. It is referred as a post monsoon month, which usually entertains less moisture than the peak season.  However, Western Disturbance interact more with the monsoons during this month resulting in strong thunderstorm activity and heavy wind and rain. Not only do the temperatures begin to decrease from August, but the drop in humidity makes the outdoors more comfortable. This month holds plenty of sunshine as the average high of {{Convert|33.7|C|F}} , while average low is recorded at {{Convert|21.1|C|F}}. the record high and low temperature is {{Convert|38.1|C|F}} was recorded 5 September 1982, and {{Convert|13.3|C|F}} was recorded on 26 September 1984, respectively. Rainfall during this month is plenty at {{convert|110.7|mm|in}}. However, recent years have experienced a spike in post monsoon rainfall activity. On 14 September 2011, a severe thunderstorm struck Rawalpindi with a maximum gust of 85 knots (157&nbsp;km/h) and caused torrential downpour recording a total of {{convert|105|mm|in}} in a matter of couple of hours. In 2011, a total {{convert|281|mm|in}} was recorded, which was at that time a recent record . However, in 2014, this monthly rainfall record shattered completely by a low air pressure system that moved and stalled over the North East Punjab region causing cloud burst conditions in some areas between 3 and 5 September. At Chaklala, the 24 hour rainfall was recorded at an astounding {{convert|298|mm|in}}, while Shamasabad weather station recorded {{convert|277|mm|in}}. The total accumulation for the month was {{convert|416.3|mm|in}} setting a new record for 2014.\n\n===October===\nOctober is a warm and dry month with plenty of sunshine throughout the day. Humidity drops rapidly as the monsoons recede from the country and is replaced by westerly winds. Typically, wind speed increase around noon and usually dies down by night time. However, these winds are dry as western disturbance activity also drop significantly. Some of the lowest relative humidity values are experienced during this month. Therefore, average rainfall is scanty at {{convert|31.7|mm|in}}. Temperature range is high during this month as nights begin to enter the cool temperature range with warm sunny days. The average low is a cool at {{Convert|14.5|C|F}} while a warm {{Convert|30.9|C|F}} is the average high. Record high for the month is hot {{Convert|37.8|C|F}} recorded on 1 October 2009. and a record low of {{Convert|5.7|C|F}} has been recorded on 31 October 1984. The previous record rainfall for the month was a shy {{convert|95.8|mm|in}} recorded in 1997. However, October is witnessing erratic rainfall patterns in recent years increasing its monthly average. One such example happened in 2015 between the 25th and 26th of the month when {{convert|132.5|mm|in}} of rain fell in just 24 hours on 25 October 2015<ref>Lai Nullah Flood Forecasting and Warning System Pakistan Meteorological Department Islamabad</ref>. This 24 hour accumulation alone was 4 times higher than monthly average of the month. The record set for 2015 totalled an impressive {{convert|199.2|mm|in}}.\n\n===November===\nNovember is a pleasant; however the driest month of the year as the mean rainfall is barely {{convert|14.4|mm|in}}. Therefore, relative humidity during this month is also the lowest throughout the year. This month receives the greatest amount of sunshine hours as overcast days during both October and November are very rare. Moreover, November demonstrates a continuation of very similar weather pattern observed in October, but with significantly cooler day and night temperatures. A few thundershowers cool down the weather further and officially sets cold weather during this month. But more recently, not only has the month exhibited warmer temperatures during the day and night, it is also becoming even drier. The average low for November is {{Convert|8.3|C|F}}. Day temperature ;however, due to high temperature range, is still warm at an average of {{Convert|25.9|C|F}} Record low for this month {{Convert|-0.6|C|F}} recorded on 28 November 1970, while the record high of {{Convert|32.2|C|F}} has been recorded on 2 November 1999.\n\n===December===\nDecember is the second coldest month in Rawalpindi after January with a record low temperature of {{Convert|-2.8|C|F}} recorded on 25 December 1984. The average low for the month is a chilly {{Convert|4.3|C|F}}, while comfortable highs of {{Convert|20.2|C|F}} are typically recorded during the day. The record high has been recorded at {{Convert|28.3|C|F}} on 7 December 1998. Typically on a sunny day temperature range during the last three months can be in excess of {{Convert|20.0|C|F}} that results in the comfortable outside temperature during day time. During the least active weather periods, lack of rainfall, low wind speeds and cool temperatures during the month results in foggy/smoggy conditions during early morning times. It is the second least windiest month of the year. It is not uncommon for people of all age groups to enjoy the afternoon and evening sun because of its irreplaceable warmth. Western Disturbances begin to affect the city more frequently, but strong thunderstorms are rarely experienced. Mean rainfall increases significantly from the month of November to an average of {{convert|36.2|mm|in}}, most of which happens in the last fortnight of the month.\n\n==Heat island effect==\n\nLike most major cities of Pakistan, Rawalpindi not only lack vegetation, but experiences a phenomenon known as the [[Urban Heat Island]]. Urban Sprawl and lack of adequate vegetation has witnessed a rise in both day and especially night temperatures. Although some of the above normal temperatures can be attributed to climate change. However, in comparison to its green neighbour Islamabad, Rawalpindi can experience nights up to 2-5&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer. During the recent years (after 2012), Rawalpindi on average is starting to experience warmer temperatures at an average of 1.5 degree Celsius. Not long ago (up until the late 1990s), Rawalpindi was merely 0.5 to maximum 1 degree Celsius warmer than its twin city, Islamabad. In 2015, during the month of May, Rawalpindi's night temperatures were on average 21.6 degrees Celsius, while Islamabad (only 8 kilometers north in a much vegetated area) recorded an average low of 18.1 degrees Celsius. To show the extremity of this phenomenon, on 8 May 2015, Islamabad experienced a minimum temperature of 18 degrees, while Rawalpindi recorded 25.5 degrees Celsius. This is the highest temperature difference experienced on a clear night between the two cities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Climate of Islamabad]]\n* [[2001 Islamabad cloud burst]]\n* [[Climate of Pakistan]]\n* [[List of extreme weather records in Pakistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Climate by city in Pakistan|Rawalpindi]]\n[[Category:Rawalpindi District]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Pakistani English|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Coord|33.6|N|73.05|E|display=title}}\nRawalpindi features a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen]]: Cwa) with long and hot summers, a [[monsoon]] and short, mild and wet winters. Its climate is classified as very similar to its twin city [[Islamabad]], but the geographical location and extreme urbanization of Rawalpindi has led to weather and climatic conditions that are notably different from its twin. Rawalpindi's weather has historically been known to change rather quickly due to its proximity to [[Himalayas]] and the [[Pir Panjal Range]]. These mountains not only influence the weather of the city, but also provide great recreation during the hot months. Furthermore, Its warm comfortable mean annual temperature of {{Convert|21.3|C|F|0|lk=on}} attracts people to live here permanently from all over [[Pakistan]]. The average annual rainfall is abundant at {{Convert|1346.8|mm|in}}, most of which falls in the monsoon season. However, frontal cloud bands also bring significant rainfall in the winter. In summers, June is the hottest with record maximum temperature at a blistering {{Convert|48.3|C|F|0|lk=on}} recorded on 13 June 1953.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.met.gov.pk/cdpc/islamabad.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508170538/http://www.met.gov.pk/cdpc/islamabad.htm |archivedate=2009-05-08 }} Islamabad (During 1931-2006)</ref> On the other hand, January is the coldest month of the year when temperature can drop to a minimum {{Convert|-3.9|C|F|0|lk=on}} in the winter recorded on 17 January 1967. Throughout the year, [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Islamabad]] experience an average of about 98 thunderstorms, which is the highest frequency of thunderstorms in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] province of any plane station. In fact, most rainfall in the city is accompanied by a thunderstorm with peak activity experienced in August. Record rainfall was experienced in the year 2013 at a massive {{Convert|1988|mm|in}} mostly due to an unusually wet monsoon season. On a typical day, the city hosts breezy afternoons ({{convert|30|km/h|mph}}+), but usually calm to light breeze ([[Beaufort scale]]) wind conditions are observed after midnight. The mean annual [[wind speed]] of Rawalpindi is roughly {{convert|10|km/h|mph}} at 14 m height. Moreover, just a few kilometers southwest of Rawalpindi, the potential power generation has been identified by U.S. Aid to be between marginal to good ({{convert|5.4|m/s|km/h}} to {{convert|7.4|m/s|km/h}}) at 50 m height.\n\n==Prevailing conditions==\n[[Western Disturbance]], [[Monsoon]] and localized convection currents during the summers are responsible for changing weather conditions in Rawalpindi. Following is a list and conditions provided for the change in weather conditions.\n\n* '''Western Disturbances''' occur almost every month in the city, but peaks during the winter months.  Not only do these disturbances decrease day and night temperatures, but provides the city with rainfall during its dry months.  However, by the time these winds reach Rawalpindi, these westerly waves are quite weak in intensity resulting in only light to moderate amounts of rainfall.  Heavy rainfall from these disturbances are rare. Nonetheless, February 2013 experienced record rains accumulating to {{convert|310|mm|in}}\n* '''Monsoon''' result in the greatest amount of rainfall in the city and reduces the excruciating heat of the relatively dry early summer months. During late June, July, August, and early September swith every out easterly \nwinds with the intensity of fresh breeze bring along the monsoon clouds and push them against the mighty [[Himalayas]]. Most often, significant rainfall in [[Rawalpindi]] doesn't occur until these moisture laden air interact with western disturbances, producing powerful supercell thunderstorms accompanied with heavy winds, lightning and heavy to very heavy rainfall. Furthermore, these storms can last from 20 minutes to several hours in duration. The highest dew point is experienced during this time of the year with extremely high [[heat index|heat indices]].\n* '''Dust storms''' occur most frequently during the dry heat of May and June, but may well also be occur during the months of late March and April. Dust storms in Rawalpindi are most often accompanied by thunderstorms producing [[squalls]] and lightning. Visibilities drop below 100 meters in extreme cases with wind speeds surpass a fierce {{convert|157|km/h|mph}}.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2012/6/12/DailyHistory.html Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Rainfall from these storms is generally low to moderate.\n* '''Continental Air''' prevails during the dry periods of the year with ample sunshine and partly cloudy to clear skies. As high pressure is established atmosphere becomes stable result in no precipitation until a western disturbance intervenes. Strong breeze from westerly direction blow during the day, while nights are calm during this time.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2013/2/19/DailyHistory.html Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Thunderstorms==\nRawalpindi experiences one of the greatest number of thunderstorms in [[Pakistan]]. At a frequency of 89.45 thunderstorms per year on average, which is quite high, these numbers are comparable to those of [[Florida]], USA.<ref>[http://climatecenter.fsu.edu/topics/thunderstorms Thunderstorms - Florida Climate Center<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some of the strongest thunderstorms in the country occur here either accompanied by dusty [[squalls]], [[microbursts]], [[cloudburst]] and sometimes even [[funnel clouds]]. Its location allows it to experience the maximum wind speed of the storm relative to its twin city [[Islamabad]]. On 13 October 2006, wind gusts from a powerful thunderstorm reported by [[Pakistan Meteorological Department]] to have reached {{convert|167|km/h|mph}}.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2006/10/13/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The strongest wind gust during this storm was reported to be 95 knots or {{convert|176|km/h|mph}}, which is the highest recorded wind speed in [[Rawalpindi]]/[[Islamabad]] region and adjoining areas. As a matter of fact, a funnel cloud was also observed during this storm near Chaklala, Rawalpindi. Tornadoes are rare, but have been reported thrice in the past decade in 2006 and 2012, 2014. The biggest challenge that arises due to these dangerous conditions include fallen trees, downed power lines, and damage to infrastructure including mud houses in the slums and billboards around the city.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Monthly conditions==\n\n{{Weather box\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| location = Rawalpindi\n| Jan high C = 17.0\n| Feb high C = 19.5\n| Mar high C = 24.2\n| Apr high C = 29.9\n| May high C = 35.4\n| Jun high C = 39.5\n| Jul high C = 35.8\n| Aug high C = 33.7\n| Sep high C = 33.6\n| Oct high C = 30.9\n| Nov high C = 25.0\n| Dec high C = 19.3\n| Jan mean C = 9.8\n| Feb mean C = 12.5\n| Mar mean C = 17.3\n| Apr mean C = 22.6\n| May mean C = 27.6\n| Jun mean C = 32.0\n| Jul mean C = 30.3\n| Aug mean C = 28.6\n| Sep mean C = 27.6\n| Oct mean C = 22.7\n| Nov mean C = 16.2\n| Dec mean C = 11.3\n| Jan low C = 2.7\n| Feb low C = 5.5\n| Mar low C = 10.4\n| Apr low C = 15.3\n| May low C = 19.9\n| Jun low C = 24.5\n| Jul low C = 24.8\n| Aug low C = 23.6\n| Sep low C = 21.6\n| Oct low C = 14.5\n| Nov low C = 7.5\n| Dec low C = 3.3\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 64.1\n| Feb precipitation mm = 87.1\n| Mar precipitation mm = 102.4\n| Apr precipitation mm = 65.2\n| May precipitation mm = 34.1\n| Jun precipitation mm = 85.3\n| Jul precipitation mm = 365.3\n| Aug precipitation mm = 340.3\n| Sep precipitation mm = 120.7\n| Oct precipitation mm = 31.7\n| Nov precipitation mm = 14.4\n| Dec precipitation mm = 36.2\n| source 1 = ''Climate-Data.org'', altitude: 497m<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">[https://en.climate-data.org/asia/pakistan/punjab/rawalpindi-1009/ Rawalpindi]</ref>\n}}\n\nEvery month in Rawalpindi is marked by its own unique characteristics, conditions and weather pattern. Following is also a summary of each month's averages and records.\n\n===January===\nJanuary is the coldest month in Rawalpindi with an average low of {{Convert|3.1|C|F}} and a record low of {{Convert|-3.9|C|F}} recorded in 1967.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.pmd.gov.pk/cdpc/extrems/islamabad.htm QUETTA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Most days are clear blue skies, however this month is prone to foggy nights and mornings. Near zero visibility is experienced during extremely foggy nights that absolutely hampers air traffic and [[Motorways of Pakistan|motorways]]. [[Western Disturbance]] brings cloudy days, rain and sometimes thunderstorms, which are essential for breaking long dry spells in the city experienced during this cool month. Moreover, it eliminates the conditions suitable for the formation of fog at night. Average rainfall for the month sums up to {{convert|67.1|mm|in}} and a record rainfall of {{convert|166.9|mm|in}} recorded in 1954. However, strong thunder/windstorm is uncommon during this month. The average high is {{Convert|17.6|C|F}} while a record high of {{Convert|30.1|C|F}} was recorded on 30 January 1995. Strong winds blow from the west during most clear days, but nights are calm with cool to cold temperatures.\n\n===February===\nFebruary experiences similar weather to January except that usually it is a few degrees warmer. Most nights are cool and days are warm with an average low and high of {{Convert|5.4|C|F}} and {{Convert|19.2|C|F}}, respectively. Overcast for several days is not uncommon during this month with the least amount of sunshine experienced during this month. A record high of {{Convert|30.0|C|F}} recorded on 28 February 1985, while the coldest {{Convert|-2.0|C|F}}<ref name=autogenerated1 /> on 8 February 1978 have been recorded. Average rainfall is relatively greater than January totaling to {{convert|84.1|mm|in}}. In 2013, record rainfall of {{convert|306.1|mm|in}} and a thunderstorms breakout was experienced from three western disturbances that caused bizarre conditions of frequent hailstorms and {{convert|93|km/h|mph}} wind gusts.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2013/2/5/DailyHistory.html Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Moreover, hailstorms with thunderstorms are not a rare occurrence in this cool time of the year. Observations demonstrate that cold weather (below zero temperature) is not experienced after halfway through the month as plantation season officially begins during the last fortnight.\n\n===March===\nMarch has a splendid spring time feel in Rawalpindi with perfect warm temperatures of {{Convert|23.7|C|F}} during the day and cool crispy night temperatures averaging to {{Convert|10.1|C|F}}. A freak heat wave was experienced in Rawalpindi with maximum temperature reaching{{Convert|36.0 |C|F}} on 20 March 2010, breaking the old record of {{Convert|34.4 |C|F}} recorded exactly on the same day in 2002. An extreme minimum of {{Convert|-0.3|C|F}} was recorded 17 March 1967. As spring season begins to settle, rainfall also increases from Western Disturbances accumulating to {{convert|92.4|mm|in}}. 2015 set a record rainfall of a massive {{convert|331.1|mm|in}}. A few strong thunderstorms develop every year during this month and sometimes these can accompanied by dust storms and gusts near hurricane force at {{convert|120|km/h|mph}}. Hailstorms are both greater in frequency and intensity during March and weather can quickly change during the day.\n\n===April===\nApril in Rawalpindi transitions from warm to hot during day time, while night temperatures begin to move from cool to warm. Typically, late April sees a sharp rise in the both day and night time temperature. Mean high during day time is {{Convert|30.2|C|F}}, while nights enjoy a mean of {{Convert|15.4|C|F}}. Record high for April is a very hot {{Convert|40.6|C|F}} recorded on 29 April 2006, on the other hand, a chilly low of {{Convert|5.1|C|F}} on 7 April 1994 have been witnessed. Western Disturbance is responsible for localized rainfall during this month, but typically these systems are not as strong as during March since rainfall totals {{convert|63.2|mm|in}}. Moreover, thunderstorms often cause horrid dust storms that become a frequent occurrence as the weather becomes drier, transitioning into summer. An average 1.0 dust storms are experienced in Rawalpindi (Average 1961-1991). On the other hand, record rainfall of {{convert|264.9|mm|in}} was recorded in 1983. One such thunderstorm was blamed for the disaster of Bhoja Air jet, flight BHO-213 when a lightning strike or wind shear was blamed for the tragedy.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17788698 BBC News - Pakistan plane crashes near Islamabad airport<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A full report has yet to be released to the public. Heavy rain showers are rare during this month as dust storms frequently only cause drizzle or light scattered rain that makes the weather pleasant.\n\n===May===\nAs May begins day time temperatures begin to rise and the day and night time temperature range is high during this time. It is categorized as a hot dry month with a record maximum of {{Convert|45.6|C|F}} experienced on 31 May 1988. Furthermore, during the record breaking heat wave of 2013 in [[Pakistan]], near record temperature of {{Convert|45.5|C|F}} was recorded on 24 May 2013. This heat wave witnessed an average high of {{Convert|37.4|C|F}}, which is 2.5 degrees higher than its average high of {{Convert|34.9|C|F}}. Average minimum stands at {{Convert|20.1|C|F}} with record low of {{Convert|10.1|C|F}} experienced in 9 May 1997. Nevertheless, night time temperatures during heat waves could remain well above average with the warmest low of {{Convert|28.0|C|F}} recorded in 2013. Mid-May and June typically are the dry heat season. Thunderstorms that occur are typically strong, accompany heavy dust with blinding visibility and wind speed in excess of {{convert|130|km/h|mph}} in some storms. These storms truly testify as \"Kali Andhi\", a common phrase used by the locals as they witness an average of 1.6 dust storms per year (average 1961-1991). Most storms occur during night time that brings relief from the relentless heat of the day. Rainfall however is scanty as the mean is only {{convert|34.1|mm|in}}, while 1965 was the wettest May at {{convert|115.3|mm|in}}. Wind speeds during this month are the second highest averaging to more than {{convert|16|km/h|mph}}.\n\n===June===\nJune is undoubtedly the hottest month of the year. Most day time temperatures are excruciatingly hot with the maximum record temperature of {{Convert|46.6|C|F}} recorded on 23 June 2005 in Chaklala, Rawalpindi with an average high reaching {{Convert|36.8|C|F}}. However, a maximum temperature of {{Convert|47.8|C|F}} was recorded in Saddar (city center) on 19 June 1952 and even that record was broken the following year on 13 June when the temperature soared to an astonishing {{Convert|48.3|C|F}}. Heat waves experienced during this season often raises temperature to over {{Convert|45|C|F}}. Nights are warm at an average of {{Convert|24.2|C|F}}; however, during heat waves night time temperatures may not fall below {{Convert|30|C|F}} and begin to rise again soon after sunrise. The record low of {{Convert|15.0|C|F}} for June was experienced on 2 June 1979. June experiences the highest number of dust storms averaging 2.4 (average of 1961-1991). Thunderstorm activity is high and the city often experiences severe thunderstorms during this month. Rainfall for June averages {{convert|75.3|mm|in}} and comes from both western disturbances, localized thunderstorms and monsoons. Record breaking wind speed for June was recorded on 5 June 2003 when a wind/thunderstorm broke havoc in the city with gusts up to 90 knots {{convert|167|km/h|mph}} that caused most of the city to lose power and property damage. These powerful thunderstorms develop as a result of moist warm monsoon winds colliding with cool dry western disturbance creating monstrous thunderstorms accompanied with powerful microburst that cause extensive damage to billboards, pylons, roofs, crops and trees. Unfortunately, every year these wind storms kill as well.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} One such microburst of 85 knots was recorded by a weather station at Chaklala on 12 June 2012.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Usually, late June welcomes the monsoon season which causes [[dew point]] to rise, and wind direction shifts from west to southeast. Relative humidity increases from these southeasterly winds that causes great discomfort without air conditioning as head indices (feels like) can rise in excess of {{Convert|50|C|F}}. In 2008, the city experienced record rainfall of {{convert|255|mm|in}}. The month of June is also the windiest of all with an average wind speed of {{convert|17|km/h|mph}}.\n\n===July===\nJuly is the second wettest month with an average rainfall of {{convert|305.3|mm|in}} as the monsoon activity increases. The highest rainfall ever recorded in a month accumulated to {{convert|743.3|mm|in}} recorded in 1995 with very dramatic weather as rain was brought by severe thunderstorms and [[cloudburst]]. The highs are relatively cooler than June, but the [[heat index]] (feels like temperature) makes the heat all the more blistering with southeastern monsoons winds increasing [[dew point]] up to {{Convert|28|C|F}}.<ref>[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2011/7/13/DailyHistory.html Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan | Weather Underground<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The average high temperature for July is {{Convert|35.3|C|F}} categorized as hot, an extreme of {{Convert|45.4|C|F}} recorded on 3 July 2012. Nights are also warm at an average {{Convert|24.4|C|F}} since the temperature range is small during these humid months. However, a record low of {{Convert|17.8|C|F}} was experienced on 8 July 1966. Thunderstorm activity is the second highest during this month but most of the rumbling and anger of the clouds is heard at night. Rain showers can be extremely heavy at times especially during cloudburst events. Unprecedented flooding cannot be ruled out during such events. One such cloud burst took the twin cities by surprise also known as the [[2001 Islamabad cloud burst]], brought historic [[flash floods]] in the stream of \"Nullah Lai\" and brought tragic scenes to the city. This 100-year storm dropped Pakistan's highest 24-hour rainfall ever reported in the neighboring city of Islamabad accumulating to an astounding {{convert|620|mm|in}}, while Rawalpindi at Shamasabad (Northern Rawalpindi) received {{convert|335|mm|in}} during the same storm, while Chaklala, Rawalpindi recorded {{convert|152|mm|in}}.<ref>http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/DPS/TC-DPFS-2002/Papers-Posters/Topic3-NaeemShah.pdf</ref>\n\n===August===\nAugust is the wettest month with an average rainfall of {{convert|340.3|mm|in}} as the monsoon peak during this month. August is a hot and humid month, however, thunderstorm activity reaches its peak primarily due to the monsoon. On average a thunderstorm happens every other day also attributing it as the wettest month of the year. Slightly lower mean maximum temperature of {{Convert|33.7|C|F}} is recorded, while average minimum of {{Convert|23.8|C|F}} has been observed. Record high temperature for August is {{Convert|42|C|F}} was recorded on 11 August 1987 and the record low of {{Convert|17|C|F}} on 3 August 1976. Similarly to July, some of the strongest thunderstorms are formed during this month that result in severe wind storms. One such powerful thunderstorm was reported from Northerly direction on 26 August 2005, which not only caused most of the city to lose power, but motorists faced hazardous conditions due to falling trees. [[Pakistan Meteorological Department]] recorded wind gusts of 90 knots or {{convert|167|km/h|mph}}. Record rainfall for the month is a massive {{convert|670.3|mm|in}} recorded in 2013.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Furthermore, it is not unusual to experience {{convert|150|mm|in}}+ rain showers within 24 hours during July and August. The highest dew point was of {{Convert|29|C|F}} was recorded on the morning of 7 August 2015, which made the temperature of {{Convert|32|C|F}} felt like an oppressive {{Convert|46|C|F}}. Flooding in lower elevations of the city is common as well. The temperature by mid August becomes comfortable enough that plantation season begins in the city.\n\n===September===\nSeptember is cooler and relatively less humid than the subsequent two monsoon months. It is referred as a post monsoon month, which usually entertains less moisture than the peak season.  However, Western Disturbance interact more with the monsoons during this month resulting in strong thunderstorm activity and heavy wind and rain. Not only do the temperatures begin to decrease from August, but the drop in humidity makes the outdoors more comfortable. This month holds plenty of sunshine as the average high of {{Convert|33.7|C|F}} , while average low is recorded at {{Convert|21.1|C|F}}. the record high and low temperature is {{Convert|38.1|C|F}} was recorded 5 September 1982, and {{Convert|13.3|C|F}} was recorded on 26 September 1984, respectively. Rainfall during this month is plenty at {{convert|110.7|mm|in}}. However, recent years have experienced a spike in post monsoon rainfall activity. On 14 September 2011, a severe thunderstorm struck Rawalpindi with a maximum gust of 85 knots (157&nbsp;km/h) and caused torrential downpour recording a total of {{convert|105|mm|in}} in a matter of couple of hours. In 2011, a total {{convert|281|mm|in}} was recorded, which was at that time a recent record . However, in 2014, this monthly rainfall record shattered completely by a low air pressure system that moved and stalled over the North East Punjab region causing cloud burst conditions in some areas between 3 and 5 September. At Chaklala, the 24 hour rainfall was recorded at an astounding {{convert|298|mm|in}}, while Shamasabad weather station recorded {{convert|277|mm|in}}. The total accumulation for the month was {{convert|416.3|mm|in}} setting a new record for 2014.\n\n===October===\nOctober is a warm and dry month with plenty of sunshine throughout the day. Humidity drops rapidly as the monsoons recede from the country and is replaced by westerly winds. Typically, wind speed increase around noon and usually dies down by night time. However, these winds are dry as western disturbance activity also drop significantly. Some of the lowest relative humidity values are experienced during this month. Therefore, average rainfall is scanty at {{convert|31.7|mm|in}}. Temperature range is high during this month as nights begin to enter the cool temperature range with warm sunny days. The average low is a cool at {{Convert|14.5|C|F}} while a warm {{Convert|30.9|C|F}} is the average high. Record high for the month is hot {{Convert|37.8|C|F}} recorded on 1 October 2009. and a record low of {{Convert|5.7|C|F}} has been recorded on 31 October 1984. The previous record rainfall for the month was a shy {{convert|95.8|mm|in}} recorded in 1997. However, October is witnessing erratic rainfall patterns in recent years increasing its monthly average. One such example happened in 2015 between the 25th and 26th of the month when {{convert|132.5|mm|in}} of rain fell in just 24 hours on 25 October 2015<ref>Lai Nullah Flood Forecasting and Warning System Pakistan Meteorological Department Islamabad</ref>. This 24 hour accumulation alone was 4 times higher than monthly average of the month. The record set for 2015 totalled an impressive {{convert|199.2|mm|in}}.\n\n===November===\nNovember is a pleasant; however the driest month of the year as the mean rainfall is barely {{convert|14.4|mm|in}}. Therefore, relative humidity during this month is also the lowest throughout the year. This month receives the greatest amount of sunshine hours as overcast days during both October and November are very rare. Moreover, November demonstrates a continuation of very similar weather pattern observed in October, but with significantly cooler day and night temperatures. A few thundershowers cool down the weather further and officially sets cold weather during this month. But more recently, not only has the month exhibited warmer temperatures during the day and night, it is also becoming even drier. The average low for November is {{Convert|8.3|C|F}}. Day temperature ;however, due to high temperature range, is still warm at an average of {{Convert|25.9|C|F}} Record low for this month {{Convert|-0.6|C|F}} recorded on 28 November 1970, while the record high of {{Convert|32.2|C|F}} has been recorded on 2 November 1999.\n\n===December===\nDecember is the second coldest month in Rawalpindi after January with a record low temperature of {{Convert|-2.8|C|F}} recorded on 25 December 1984. The average low for the month is a chilly {{Convert|4.3|C|F}}, while comfortable highs of {{Convert|20.2|C|F}} are typically recorded during the day. The record high has been recorded at {{Convert|28.3|C|F}} on 7 December 1998. Typically on a sunny day temperature range during the last three months can be in excess of {{Convert|20.0|C|F}} that results in the comfortable outside temperature during day time. During the least active weather periods, lack of rainfall, low wind speeds and cool temperatures during the month results in foggy/smoggy conditions during early morning times. It is the second least windiest month of the year. It is not uncommon for people of all age groups to enjoy the afternoon and evening sun because of its irreplaceable warmth. Western Disturbances begin to affect the city more frequently, but strong thunderstorms are rarely experienced. Mean rainfall increases significantly from the month of November to an average of {{convert|36.2|mm|in}}, most of which happens in the last fortnight of the month.\n\n==Heat island effect==\n\nLike most major cities of Pakistan, Rawalpindi not only lack vegetation, but experiences a phenomenon known as the [[Urban Heat Island]]. Urban Sprawl and lack of adequate vegetation has witnessed a rise in both day and especially night temperatures. Although some of the above normal temperatures can be attributed to climate change. However, in comparison to its green neighbour Islamabad, Rawalpindi can experience nights up to 2-5&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer. During the recent years (after 2012), Rawalpindi on average is starting to experience warmer temperatures at an average of 1.5 degree Celsius. Not long ago (up until the late '90's), Rawalpindi was merely 0.5 to maximum 1 degree Celsius warmer than its twin city, Islamabad. In 2015, during the month of May, Rawalpindi's night temperatures were on average 21.6 degrees Celsius, while Islamabad (only 8 kilometers north in a much vegetated area) recorded an average low of 18.1 degrees Celsius. To show the extremity of this phenomenon, on 8 May 2015, Islamabad experienced a minimum temperature of 18 degrees, while Rawalpindi recorded 25.5 degrees Celsius. This is the highest temperature difference experienced on a clear night between the two cities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Climate of Islamabad]]\n* [[2001 Islamabad cloud burst]]\n* [[Climate of Pakistan]]\n* [[List of extreme weather records in Pakistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Climate by city in Pakistan|Rawalpindi]]\n[[Category:Rawalpindi District]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo/fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Rawalpindi"}
