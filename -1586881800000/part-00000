Additionally, lift releases, effecting entry into buildings, flooding incidents and animal rescues are also incidents dealt with by ECFRS. However, around 40 percent of these incidents are false alarms and require no further action. Between 2004 and 2014 the number of incidents attended by ECFRS decreased significantly by around 50 percent, with around 38 calls per day, compared to around 77 calls per day in 2004.<ref name=\"essex-fire.gov.uk\">http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/_img/pics/pdf_1441197562.pdf</ref>\n\nECFRS employs 1,448 staff: 620 full-time [[firefighter]]s, 519 [[retained firefighter]]s, 33 control personnel and 240 support staff.<ref>http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/_img/pics/pdf_1487254707.pdf</ref>\n\nThere are 50 [[fire station]]s in Essex, 12 of which are wholetime and generally located in the more densely populated areas; 34 are retained and 4 are day-crewed. ECFRS have 74 frontline fire appliances, with between 55 and 70 available for mobilisation at any moment.<ref name=\"essex-fire.gov.uk\"/>\n\nMajor risks covered include [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] and [[London Southend Airport|Southend airport]], [[Harwich International Port|Harwich seaport]], [[Lakeside Shopping Centre|Lakeside shopping centre]], [[Coryton Refinery|Coryton oil refinery]], [[Tilbury power stations|power stations]] and [[Port of Tilbury|docks at Tilbury]] and part of the [[M25 motorway|M25]] and [[M11 motorway]]s, [[A127]] and [[A12 road (England)|A12 road]].\n\nAs well as attending fires, traffic collisions and other rescue operations, ECFRS provides emergency response to [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] incidents and has an [[Urban Search and Rescue]] (USAR) team of officers with specialist training and equipment to conduct rescues from collapsed buildings and enclosed spaces. The [[Urban Search and Rescue]] (USAR) team have their own fire station separate from others across the county, ECFRS being the first to do this in the country. One of their resources include a search dog trained to locate people trapped in rubble. Another primary role of the service is preventive community safety work; in 2010 ECFRS fitted over 7,000 smoke alarms in houses across the county.<ref name=2010report/>\n\n== Organisation ==\nECFRS's headquarters is located in [[Kelvedon]]. The Service is divided into four Groups:<ref name=quickfacts>{{Cite web |url=http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/pages/index.asp?area=2&id=359 |title=Essex County Fire & Rescue Service: About us, (accessed 16 Jan 07) |access-date=2010-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718062557/http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/pages/index.asp?area=2&id=359 |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n#North East Group \n#North West Group\n#South East Group\n#South West Group\n\nThe [[Chief Fire Officer]]/[[Chief Executive]] is Jo Turton.\n\nOn 1 October 2017, governance of ECFRS was transferred from the Essex Fire Authority (EFA) to the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner (PFCC), Roger Hirst.  It was made very clear, that both [[Essex Police]] and ECFRS would retain their Chief Officers, however the new PFCC would have overlying governance over the two, and the Chief Officers would answer to the PFCC. Essex were the first to do this in the country.<ref>http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/EPFCC_FR_Authority/</ref>\n\nThe Emergency Operational Fire Control is situated in the headquarters at [[Kelvedon, Essex|Kelvedon]]. 33 control staff handle over 14,000 [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] emergency calls. The control staff also carry out incident co-ordination, appliance mobilisation and movements to ensure strategic fire cover. Radio communications are made between incidents and Fire Control, and control staff liaise with other [[emergency services]] to provide additional resources when requested by firefighting personnel. Emergency calls are handled on an average of 54 seconds from the time of answering the call, to the time of dispatching the fire crew(s).\n\nThere are five firefighter training centres, located in [[Basildon]], [[Chelmsford]], [[Orsett]], [[Witham]] and [[Wethersfield, Essex|Wethersfield]]. Each of these centres specialise in different forms of training firefighters must become accustomed to, in order to be operationally prepared.<ref name=quickfacts/>\n\nThe Service workshop is in [[Lexden]], Colchester, where the operational fleet of frontline [[Fire apparatus|fire appliances]] and specialist appliances are maintained, and the reserve fleet of spare appliances are stored.\n\nIn 2016, the Service started a co-responding scheme with the [[East of England Ambulance Service]], whereby fire crews would respond to life-threatening cardiac emergencies, alongside ambulances, in a way to ease pressure off the ambulance service, and grant better survival for patients. Fire Stations that partook in the scheme were: [[Basildon]], [[Frinton]], [[Ongar, Essex|Ongar]], [[Newport, Essex|Newport]], [[Coggeshall]] and [[Colchester]]. However, in 2017, the co-responding scheme ceased due to disputes between the union and the Service. Regardless, the Service still have close relations with the ambulance service, and on a daily basis, fire crews work with partners like paramedics and police officers efficiently.<ref>http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/news/Fire_appliances_responding_to_cardiac_arrests/</ref>\n\n== Appliances ==\n[[File:ECFRS RP Scania.jpg|thumb|Rescue Pump (RP)]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ECFRS SOV Merc.jpg|thumb|Specialist Operations Vehicle (SOV)]] -->\n[[File:ECFRS Officer Car.jpg|thumb|Officer Incident Response Vehicle (IRV)]]\nECFRS has the following [[Fire apparatus|fire appliance]]s in operation:\n\n*'''43 Rescue Pumps (RP):''' the standard firefighting vehicle mobilised to all emergency calls.

These appliances will have a smaller 10.5 metre ladder but similar equipment to the Rescue Pump. The Water Tender is mobilised to support the Rescue Pump or respond to incidents that require only one pump. These appliances ride with a Crew Manager in charge, along with another 3 - 5 firefighters on board.<ref name=\"whatdotheyknow.com\"/>\n*'''8 Heavy Rescue Pumps (HRP):''' similar to the standard Rescue Pump but specialised more towards heavy rescue operations and incidents (e.g. [[road traffic collision]]s). These appliances ride with a Watch Manager in charge, along with another 3 - 5 Firefighters on board.<ref name=\"whatdotheyknow.com\"/>\n*'''4 [[Fire apparatus#Aerial ladder platform|Aerial Ladder Platforms (ALP)]]:''' 32 meter extendable ladder platform with a rescue cage, stretchers and additional lighting, these vehicles provide high-level access and firefighting capability, with a vertical reach of almost 32m, almost 25m sideways, and up to 15m below ground level.

Under a money-saving purchasing agreement with [[Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service]], 44 new Angloco [[Scania]] appliances are being rolled out to fire stations across Essex over the span of 4 years. They will replace: Heavy Rescue Pumps (HRP), Rescue Pumps (RP) and Water Tenders (WrT).<ref>http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/news/New_fire_appliances_for_Essex/</ref>\n\n== Roles ==\n*'''Firefighter (FF):''' carries out day-to-day firefighting work and community safety. \n*'''Crew Manager (CM):''' in charge of the crew on a fire appliance. Carries out day-today firefighting work and community safety. Can take charge of an incident of up to 2 pumping appliances. \n*'''Watch Manager (WM):''' in charge of the watch of a fire station.

Responsible for overseeing and managing the overall organisation. Will attend the strategic meeting for a large incident.\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that the service will change its rank based structure, to a role based structure, commonly known as 'rank to role'. This process was part of the Peoples Structures Project in the 2016-2020 Essex County Fire and Rescue Service report. This new role based structure is highly popular among many fire services in the country, and suits the modern and flexible requirement of a fire service. This process did not hugely effect the staff and their roles, however did require changes to some Sub Officer's (Watch Manager's) based station of work, in order for the process to be implemented. The service was one of the last organisations to implement 'rank to role'.<ref>http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/_img/pics/pdf_1488196029.pdf</ref>\n\n== Performance ==\nIn 2010, the service responded to the scene within an average of 8 minutes 56 seconds (10 minute target), and 93% within 15 minutes (90% target).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/_img/pics/pdf_1482341003.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the service responded to the scene within an average of 9 minutes 10 seconds (10 minute target), and 91% within 15 minutes (90% target).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhen the control operator receives an emergency call, the average time it took to identify the emergency and allocate the right resources was between 70\u201380 seconds. For wholetime crews, a turnout took on average 2 minutes to be ready for mobilisation. For on-call crews, a turnout took on average 4 minutes 30 seconds to be ready for mobilisation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Fire Stations ==\n*[http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/locations/ See: Interactive map of fire stations]\n[[File:Orsett Fire Station, Essex - geograph.org.uk - 56678.jpg|right|thumb|[[Orsett]] Fire Station]]\n[[File:BasildonFireStation.jpg|thumb|right|[[Basildon]] Fire Station]]\n\nThis is a complete list of the service's 50 fire stations (wholetime, retained and day crewed), appliances allocated to them, and number of emergency callouts received in 2016:<ref name=2011report>[http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/images/pics/Annual_Report_2011.pdf]</ref><ref name=foi>[http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/images/pics/FOI_Q_and_A%27s_resized_2.pdf]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Station\n!Number\n!Duty system\n!Standard appliances\n!Specialist appliances\n!Callouts in 2016\n|-\n|[[Basildon]]\n|W52\n|Wholetime\n|2\n|1\n|1,509\n|-\n|[[Billericay]]\n|W68\n|Retained\n|1\n|1 \n|334\n|-\n|[[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]]\n|W78\n|Retained\n|2\n|1\n|477\n|-\n|[[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]]\n|W51\n|Wholetime & Retained\n|2\n|0\n|783\n|-\n|[[Brightlingsea]]\n|E20\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|85\n|-\n|[[Burnham-on-Crouch|Burnham]]\n|E43\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|59\n|-\n|[[Canvey Island]]\n|W54\n|Retained\n|2\n|0\n|290\n|-\n|[[Chelmsford]]\n|E34\n|Wholetime\n|2\n|1 \n|1,272\n|-\n|[[Clacton-on-Sea|Clacton]]\n|E12\n|Wholetime & Retained\n|2\n|1\n|698\n|-\n|[[Coggeshall]]\n|E24\n|Retained\n|1\n|1\n|166\n|-\n|[[Colchester]]\n|E10\n|Wholetime\n|2\n|1\n|1,296\n|-\n|[[Corringham, Essex|Corringham]]\n|W66\n|Retained\n|1\n|1\n|228\n|-\n|[[Dovercourt]]\n|E11\n|Day crewed\n|2\n|0\n|185\n|-\n|[[Great Dunmow|Dunmow]]\n|W87\n|Retained\n|2\n|0\n|368\n|-\n|[[Epping, Essex|Epping]]\n|W89\n|Retained\n|1\n|0 \n|306\n|-\n|[[Frinton-on-Sea|Frinton]]\n|E18\n|Retained\n|2\n|0\n|220\n|-\n|[[Grays, Essex|Grays]]\n|W50\n|Wholetime\n|2\n|1\n|1,218\n|-\n|[[Great Baddow]]\n|E33\n|Day crewed\n|1\n|0\n|409\n|-\n|[[Halstead]]\n|W81\n|Retained\n|2\n|1 \n|271\n|-\n|[[Harlow]]\n|W70\n|Wholetime\n|2\n|1\n|1,084\n|-\n|[[Hawkwell]]\n|E47\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|186\n|-\n|[[Ingatestone]]\n|W67\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|111\n|-\n|[[Leaden Roding]]\n|W88\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|69\n|-\n|[[Leigh-on-Sea|Leigh]]\n|E31\n|Wholetime\n|1\n|1\n|744\n|-\n|[[Loughton]]\n|W72\n|Wholetime\n|1\n|0\n|754\n|-\n|[[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]]\n|E46\n|Retained\n|2\n|1\n|319\n|-\n|[[Manningtree]]\n|E17\n|Retained\n|1\n|1 \n|137\n|-\n|[[Newport, Essex|Newport]]\n|W84\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|190\n|-\n|[[Old Harlow]]\n|W82\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|179\n|-\n|[[Chipping Ongar|Ongar]]\n|W71\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|96\n|-\n|[[Orsett]]\n|W55\n|Wholetime\n|1\n|1 \n|881\n|-\n|[[Rayleigh, Essex|Rayleigh Weir]]\n|E35\n|Wholetime\n|1\n|2\n|929\n|-\n|[[Rochford]]\n|E49\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|202\n|-\n|[[Saffron Walden]]\n|W85\n|Retained\n|2\n|0\n|203\n|-\n|[[Shoeburyness]]\n|E42\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|232\n|-\n|[[Sible Hedingham]]\n|W80\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|41\n|-\n|[[South Woodham Ferrers]]\n|E32\n|Day crewed\n|1\n|2\n|225\n|-\n|[[Southend-on-Sea|Southend]]\n|E30\n|Wholetime\n|2\n|1 \n|1,348\n|-\n|[[Stansted Mountfitchet|Stansted]]\n|W83\n|Retained\n|1\n|2 \n|221\n|-\n|[[Thaxted]]\n|W86\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|58\n|-\n|[[Tillingham]]\n|E44\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|85\n|-\n|[[Tiptree]]\n|E23\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|171\n|-\n|[[Tollesbury]]\n|E45\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|48\n|-\n|[[Waltham Abbey (town)|Waltham Abbey]]\n|W73\n|Day crewed\n|1\n|1\n|350\n|-\n|[[Weeley]]\n|E19\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|166\n|-\n|[[West Mersea]]\n|E22\n|Retained\n|1\n|1\n|77\n|-\n|[[Wethersfield, Essex|Wethersfield]]\n|W79\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|79\n|-\n|[[Wickford]]\n|W69\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|194\n|-\n|[[Witham]]\n|W25\n|Retained\n|2\n|0\n|344\n|-\n|[[Wivenhoe]]\n|E21\n|Retained\n|1\n|0\n|141\n|}\n\nSouthend Fire Station is also home to the UK's first dedicated Young Firefighters' (now Fire Cadets) Centre, opened in July 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/pages/index.asp?area=4&id=484 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718062626/http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/pages/index.asp?area=4&id=484 |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Urban Search and Rescue Team (USAR)==\nState-of-the-art equipment, multi-purpose vehicles, a search and rescue dog and a purpose-built base staffed with a highly trained and experienced team comprise the county's [[urban search and rescue]] (USAR) team.\n\nThe team is equipped to rescue victims trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings, or major transport accidents, for example. They are able to locate and safely extract trapped person, and can shore up unstable buildings so that firefighters can continue with rescue operations.\n\nThe USAR team are equipped with [[Tractor unit|prime mover]]s, specialist hook-lift vehicles that can be loaded with one of five different equipment pods, depending on what situation the team are going to face. These pods include hose layers and high-volume pumps, technical rescue, timber for shoring up unstable structures, and even a multi-purpose [[skid loader]] that can access tight spaces, explore voids, and move heavy loads of debris.\n\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]] new risks were identified for which rescue services would need to be better prepared, and the British government responded with the announcement that USAR units were to be established throughout the country. The Lexden base became the UK's first such facility.\n\nECFRS was chosen as one of the 17 strategically suitable services partly because it already had 14 officers trained in urban rescue, members of the UK Fire Service Safety & Rescue Team who were part of the rescue effort that was sent to [[Bam, Iran|Bam]] in [[Iran]] after it was hit by a major [[2003 Bam earthquake|earthquake in December 2003]] where they helped in the search for victims amongst the ruins of the ancient city.\n\nThe station commander at Lexden, a specialist co-ordinator of search and rescue operations, was also sent with the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to [[Haiti]] in January 2010 after a [[2010 Haiti earthquake|major earthquake]] struck the country.\n\nIn February 2011, six ECFRS firefighters, including two from the USAR unit at Lexden, joined the UK's International Search and Rescue (ISAR) team sent to assist with rescue efforts in New Zealand's second city [[Christchurch]] after an [[2011 Canterbury earthquake|earthquake hit the region]].<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-12687191</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, six firefighters and rescue dog have been deployed to [[Nepal earthquakes|Nepal]] to join a team of 67 search and rescue and medical experts to help and look for [[earthquake]] survivors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Essex Firefighters Sent To Nepal After Earthquake|url=http://www.heart.co.uk/essex/news/local/essex-firefighters-sent-to-nepal-after-earthquake/}}</ref>\n\nFormed in 1992, the UK's [http://www.ukisar.org ISAR] team comprises specialist search and rescue officers drawn from 13 brigades who are on call 24 hours a day. The ECFRS team's primary role is urban search and rescue but it has also trained and involved in water rescue and working at height.\n\n== Cross-county assistance ==\n\nECFRS assisted in the emergency response to [[2007 United Kingdom floods|floods in Oxfordshire in 2007]], where seven firefighters from the Swift Water Rescue team helped rescue victims trapped by the floods with a specialist fireboat.\n\nEssex was also one of 16 brigades called in to attend the [[Buncefield fire|Buncefield oil depot fire]] near [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Hertfordshire]], in December 2005. Fire appliances from Orsett, Hadleigh, Harlow, and foam appliances from Grays, Maldon and Epping assisted in operations at the largest ever blaze in peacetime Britain.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Fire services in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Orsett Hall#The fire|Orsett Hall fire]]\n* [[List of British firefighters killed in the line of duty]]\n\nOther emergency services:\n*[[Essex Air Ambulance]]\n*[[East of England Ambulance Service]]\n*[[Essex Police]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/ Official site]\n* [http://www.ukisar.org United Kingdom International Search & Rescue Team]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160309020816/http://www.fireresilience.org.uk/workstreams/national-resilience-capabilites/international-search-and-rescue-isar/uk-isar-deployment-structure/ CFOA National Resilience]\n*\n\n{{UK fire service}}\n\n[[Category:Fire and rescue services of England]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Essex]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox fire department\n| name               = Essex County Fire and Rescue Service\n| logo               = Essex County Fire and Rescue Service crest.png\n| country            = England\n| subdivision_type2  = County\n| subdivision_name2  = [[Essex]]\n| address            = Kelvedon Park, [[Witham]]\n| coordinates        = \n| established        = {{Start date|1948|04|01|df=y}}\n| annual calls       = ~14,000 incidents\n| annual budget      = \u00a370.1 million\n| employees          = 1,448\n| staffing           = \n| CFO                = \n| stations           = 50\n| website            =  {{Official website|http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/}}\n}}\n\n'''Essex County Fire and Rescue Service (ECFRS)''' is the [[statute|statutory]] [[Fire department|fire and rescue service]] for the county of [[Essex]] in the [[east of England]], and is one of the largest [[Fire services in the United Kingdom|fire services in the country]], covering an area of 1,338 square miles and a population of over 1.7 million people.<ref name=2010report>[http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/images/izone/Annual_Report_2010_FINAL_LR_3.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the service attended around 14,000 emergency incidents within the year, mostly fires and [[road traffic collision]]s (RTC). Additionally, lift releases, effecting entry into buildings, flooding incidents and animal rescues are also incidents dealt with by ECFRS. However, around 40 percent of these incidents are false alarms and require no further action. Between 2004 and 2014 the number of incidents attended by ECFRS decreased significantly by around 50 percent, with around 38 calls per day, compared to around 77 calls per day in 2004.<ref name=\"essex-fire.gov.uk\">http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/_img/pics/pdf_1441197562.pdf</ref>\n\nECFRS employs 1,448 staff: 620 full-time [[firefighter]]s, 519 [[retained firefighter]]s, 33 control personnel and 240 support staff.<ref>http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/_img/pics/pdf_1487254707.pdf</ref>\n\nThere are 50 [[fire station]]s in Essex, 12 of which are wholetime and generally located in the more densely populated areas; 34 are retained and 4 are day-crewed. ECFRS have 74 frontline fire appliances, with between 55 and 70 available for mobilisation at any moment.<ref name=\"essex-fire.gov.uk\"/>\n\nMajor risks covered include [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] and [[London Southend Airport|Southend airport]], [[Harwich International Port|Harwich seaport]], [[Lakeside Shopping Centre|Lakeside shopping centre]], [[Coryton Refinery|Coryton oil refinery]], [[Tilbury power stations|power stations]] and [[Port of Tilbury|docks at Tilbury]] and part of the [[M25 motorway|M25]] and [[M11 motorway]]s, [[A127]] and [[A12 road (England)|A12 road]].\n\nAs well as attending fires, traffic collisions and other rescue operations, ECFRS provides emergency response to [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] incidents and has an [[Urban Search and Rescue]] (USAR) team of officers with specialist training and equipment to conduct rescues from collapsed buildings and enclosed spaces. The [[Urban Search and Rescue]] (USAR) team have their own fire station separate from others across the county, ECFRS being the first to do this in the country. One of their resources include a search dog trained to locate people trapped in rubble. Another primary role of the service is preventive community safety work; in 2010 ECFRS fitted over 7,000 smoke alarms in houses across the county.<ref name=2010report/>\n\n== Organisation ==\nECFRS's headquarters is located in [[Kelvedon]]. The Service is divided into four Groups:<ref name=quickfacts>{{Cite web |url=http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/pages/index.asp?area=2&id=359 |title=Essex County Fire & Rescue Service: About us, (accessed 16 Jan 07) |access-date=2010-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718062557/http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/pages/index.asp?area=2&id=359 |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n#North East Group \n#North West Group\n#South East Group\n#South West Group\n\nThe [[Chief Fire Officer]]/[[Chief Executive]] is Jo Turton.\n\nOn 1 October 2017, governance of ECFRS was transferred from the Essex Fire Authority (EFA) to the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner (PFCC), Roger Hirst.  It was made very clear, that both [[Essex Police]] and ECFRS would retain their Chief Officers, however the new PFCC would have overlying governance over the two, and the Chief Officers would answer to the PFCC. Essex were the first to do this in the country.<ref>http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/EPFCC_FR_Authority/</ref>\n\nThe Emergency Operational Fire Control is situated in the headquarters at [[Kelvedon, Essex|Kelvedon]]. 33 control staff handle over 14,000 [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] emergency calls. The control staff also carry out incident co-ordination, appliance mobilisation and movements to ensure strategic fire cover. Radio communications are made between incidents and Fire Control, and control staff liaise with other [[emergency services]] to provide additional resources when requested by firefighting personnel. Emergency calls are handled on an average of 54 seconds from the time of answering the call, to the time of dispatching the fire crew(s).\n\nThere are five firefighter training centres, located in [[Basildon]], [[Chelmsford]], [[Orsett]], [[Witham]] and [[Wethersfield, Essex|Wethersfield]]. Each of these centres specialise in different forms of training firefighters must become accustomed to, in order to be operationally prepared.<ref name=quickfacts/>\n\nThe Service workshop is in [[Lexden]], Colchester, where the operational fleet of frontline [[Fire apparatus|fire appliances]] and specialist appliances are maintained, and the reserve fleet of spare appliances are stored.\n\nIn 2016, the Service started a co-responding scheme with the [[East of England Ambulance Service]], whereby fire crews would respond to life-threatening cardiac emergencies, alongside ambulances, in a way to ease pressure off the ambulance service, and grant better survival for patients. Fire Stations that partook in the scheme were: [[Basildon]], [[Frinton]], [[Ongar, Essex|Ongar]], [[Newport, Essex|Newport]], [[Coggeshall]] and [[Colchester]]. However, in 2017, the co-responding scheme ceased due to disputes between the union and the Service. Regardless, the Service still have close relations with the ambulance service, and on a daily basis, fire crews work with partners like paramedics and police officers efficiently.<ref>http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/news/Fire_appliances_responding_to_cardiac_arrests/</ref>\n\n== Appliances ==\n[[File:ECFRS RP Scania.jpg|thumb|Rescue Pump (RP)]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ECFRS SOV Merc.jpg|thumb|Specialist Operations Vehicle (SOV)]] -->\n[[File:ECFRS Officer Car.jpg|thumb|Officer Incident Response Vehicle (IRV)]]\nECFRS has the following [[Fire apparatus|fire appliance]]s in operation:\n\n*'''43 Rescue Pumps (RP):''' the standard firefighting vehicle mobilised to all emergency calls.

This process was part of the Peoples Structures Project in the 2016-2020 Essex County Fire and Rescue Service report. This new role based structure is highly popular among many fire services in the country, and suits the modern and flexible requirement of a fire service. This process did not hugely effect the staff and their roles, however did require changes to some Sub Officer's (Watch Manager's) based station of work, in order for the process to be implemented. The service was one of the last organisations to implement 'rank to role'.<ref>http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/_img/pics/pdf_1488196029.pdf</ref>\n\n== Performance ==\nIn 2010, the service responded to the scene within an average of 8 minutes 56 seconds (10 minute target), and 93% within 15 minutes (90% target).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/_img/pics/pdf_1482341003.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the service responded to the scene within an average of 9 minutes 10 seconds (10 minute target), and 91% within 15 minutes (90% target).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhen the control operator receives an emergency call, the average time it took to identify the emergency and allocate the right resources was between 70\u201380 seconds.

They are able to locate and safely extract trapped person, and can shore up unstable buildings so that firefighters can continue with rescue operations.\n\nThe USAR team are equipped with [[Tractor unit|prime mover]]s, specialist hook-lift vehicles that can be loaded with one of five different equipment pods, depending on what situation the team are going to face. These pods include hose layers and high-volume pumps, technical rescue, timber for shoring up unstable structures, and even a multi-purpose [[skid loader]] that can access tight spaces, explore voids, and move heavy loads of debris.\n\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]] new risks were identified for which rescue services would need to be better prepared, and the British government responded with the announcement that USAR units were to be established throughout the country. The Lexden base became the UK's first such facility.\n\nECFRS was chosen as one of the 17 strategically suitable services partly because it already had 14 officers trained in urban rescue, members of the UK Fire Service Safety & Rescue Team who were part of the rescue effort that was sent to [[Bam, Iran|Bam]] in [[Iran]] after it was hit by a major [[2003 Bam earthquake|earthquake in December 2003]] where they helped in the search for victims amongst the ruins of the ancient city.\n\nThe station commander at Lexden, a specialist co-ordinator of search and rescue operations, was also sent with the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to [[Haiti]] in January 2010 after a [[2010 Haiti earthquake|major earthquake]] struck the country.\n\nIn February 2011, six ECFRS firefighters, including two from the USAR unit at Lexden, joined the UK's International Search and Rescue (ISAR) team sent to assist with rescue efforts in New Zealand's second city [[Christchurch]] after an [[2011 Canterbury earthquake|earthquake hit the region]].<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-12687191</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, six firefighters and rescue dog have been deployed to [[Nepal earthquakes|Nepal]] to join a team of 67 search and rescue and medical experts to help and look for [[earthquake]] survivors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Essex Firefighters Sent To Nepal After Earthquake|url=http://www.heart.co.uk/essex/news/local/essex-firefighters-sent-to-nepal-after-earthquake/}}</ref>\n\nFormed in 1992, the UK's [http://www.ukisar.org ISAR] team comprises specialist search and rescue officers drawn from 13 brigades who are on call 24 hours a day. The ECFRS team's primary role is urban search and rescue but it has also trained and involved in water rescue and working at height.\n\n== Cross-county assistance ==\n\nECFRS assisted in the emergency response to [[2007 United Kingdom floods|floods in Oxfordshire in 2007]], where seven firefighters from the Swift Water Rescue team helped rescue victims trapped by the floods with a specialist fireboat.\n\nEssex was also one of 16 brigades called in to attend the [[Buncefield fire|Buncefield oil depot fire]] near [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Hertfordshire]], in December 2005. Fire appliances from Orsett, Hadleigh, Harlow, and foam appliances from Grays, Maldon and Epping assisted in operations at the largest ever blaze in peacetime Britain.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Fire services in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Orsett Hall#The fire|Orsett Hall fire]]\n* [[List of British firefighters killed in the line of duty]]\n\nOther emergency services:\n*[[Essex Air Ambulance]]\n*[[East of England Ambulance Service]]\n*[[Essex Police]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.essex-fire.gov.uk/ Official site]\n* [http://www.ukisar.org United Kingdom International Search & Rescue Team]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160309020816/http://www.fireresilience.org.uk/workstreams/national-resilience-capabilites/international-search-and-rescue-isar/uk-isar-deployment-structure/ CFOA National Resilience]\n*\n\n{{UK fire service}}\n\n[[Category:Fire and rescue services of England]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Essex]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toGrays(link changed toGrays, Essex; link changed toGrays, Essex) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County_Fire_and_Rescue_Service"}

Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html|title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit|date=March 8, 1932|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=November 15, 2017|page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf|title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys|date=October 16, 1940|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 21, 2017}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

Three {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} signs with the hall's name on it were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented [[fire escape]]s were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets.

Caldwell & Co.]] hang from the ceiling.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}}{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=18}} The northern side of the grand foyer contains Ezra Winter's mural, and a grand staircase leading up to the first-mezzanine foyer runs along the northern wall next to Winter's mural.<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\"/>{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=11, 15}} Another set of stairs below the grand staircase descends from the northern side of the foyer to the main lounge one level below.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} A smaller staircase to the first-mezzanine lounge runs along the southern wall, connecting to a curved extension of that level's balcony.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} The southern and northern sides of the grand foyer, respectively leading to 50th and 51st Streets, contain shallow vestibules with red marble walls. The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mirrors within gold frames.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level. At ground level, a marble lobby for these elevators is located to the west of the northern exit vestibule.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Chambellan also designed the elevator doors with reliefs of musicians in atypical representations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=48}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The maple circular roundels inside the cabs were designed by [[Edward Trumbull]], and represent wine, women, and song.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=51}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\n====Auditorium====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 3051638324 4a385c5623.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of stage and orchestra seating from mezzanine seating]]\nThe auditorium itself is very large and striking. Architectural critic [[Douglas Haskell]] describes it thus: \"The focus is the great proscenium arch, over {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\"{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that \"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and \"finest precision dancers\", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}\n\nThe auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27|title=Secrets of the Magic Theater|journal=Popular Mechanics|page=27|date=January 1941|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news|title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale|first=Walter Rendell|last=Storey|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=December 25, 1932|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site. The offstage rooms include a [[carpenter (theatre)|carpenter]]'s studio, a [[scene shop]], sewing rooms, dressing rooms for 600 people, a [[green room]] for performers' guests, and a dormitory.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio City Music Hall To Be Opened Dec. 27; Brilliant Program Is Planned for Premiere \u2013 Theatre to Have Dormitory for the Chorus.|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=November 18, 1932|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/11/18/105886921.pdf | access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe elevator system was designed by Peter Clark and built by Otis Elevators.

Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html|title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit|date=March 8, 1932|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=November 15, 2017|page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf|title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys|date=October 16, 1940|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 21, 2017}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

Three {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} signs with the hall's name on it were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented [[fire escape]]s were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets.

Caldwell & Co.]] hang from the ceiling.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}}{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=18}} The northern side of the grand foyer contains Ezra Winter's mural, and a grand staircase leading up to the first-mezzanine foyer runs along the northern wall next to Winter's mural.<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\"/>{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=11, 15}} Another set of stairs below the grand staircase descends from the northern side of the foyer to the main lounge one level below.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} A smaller staircase to the first-mezzanine lounge runs along the southern wall, connecting to a curved extension of that level's balcony.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} The southern and northern sides of the grand foyer, respectively leading to 50th and 51st Streets, contain shallow vestibules with red marble walls. The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mirrors within gold frames.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=11}} Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level. At ground level, a marble lobby for these elevators is located to the west of the northern exit vestibule.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} Chambellan also designed the elevator doors with reliefs of musicians in atypical representations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=48}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}} The maple circular roundels inside the cabs were designed by [[Edward Trumbull]], and represent wine, women, and song.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=51}}{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=12}}\n\n====Auditorium====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 3051638324 4a385c5623.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of stage and orchestra seating from mezzanine seating]]\nThe auditorium itself is very large and striking. Architectural critic [[Douglas Haskell]] describes it thus: \"The focus is the great proscenium arch, over {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\"{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that \"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and \"finest precision dancers\", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}\n\nThe auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27|title=Secrets of the Magic Theater|journal=Popular Mechanics|page=27|date=January 1941|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news|title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale|first=Walter Rendell|last=Storey|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=December 25, 1932|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site. The offstage rooms include a [[carpenter (theatre)|carpenter]]'s studio, a [[scene shop]], sewing rooms, dressing rooms for 600 people, a [[green room]] for performers' guests, and a dormitory.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio City Music Hall To Be Opened Dec. 27; Brilliant Program Is Planned for Premiere \u2013 Theatre to Have Dormitory for the Chorus.|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=November 18, 1932|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/11/18/105886921.pdf | access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe elevator system was designed by Peter Clark and built by Otis Elevators.

The number of street dogs in Moscow is estimated to be up to 50,000 animals.

When the number of street dogs massively increased in the nineties and in the beginning of the new millennium it came to many attacks on human, the dogs were hunted and killed. In recent years the attitude and strategy towards street dogs has changed. The dogs are caught, sterilized and it is organized that the dogs have enough to eat. The dogs keep the city free of food leftovers and rats. Since 2002 in Moscow exists a monument dedicated to the stray dog [[Malchik]] ([[English language|eng]]: boy).

The number of street dogs in Moscow is estimated to be up to 50,000 animals.

When the number of street dogs massively increased in the nineties and in the beginning of the new millennium it came to many attacks on human, the dogs were hunted and killed. In recent years the attitude and strategy towards street dogs has changed. The dogs are caught, sterilized and it is organized that the dogs have enough to eat. The dogs keep the city free of food leftovers and rats. Since 2002 in Moscow exists a monument dedicated to the stray dog [[Malchik]] ([[English language|eng]]: boy).

As a consequence, the [[Thurrock Urban District|Urban District of Thurrock]] (created largely from amalgamating the Urban Districts of Grays Thurrock and Tilbury and the Rural District of Orsett) was formed as the new [[Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)|Thurrock]] Division of Essex.\u00a0 Other marginal changes resulting from changes to local authority boundaries.\n\nFollowing the [[First Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] the seat was abolished.

Traditionally, the major four were [[Amalfi]], [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]], whose coats of arms appear in the flag of the [[Marina Militare]] (Italian Navy). These city states competed with each other both militarily and commercially. From the 10th to the 13th centuries they built fleets of ships both for their own protection and to support extensive trade networks across the Mediterranean, and had an essential role in the Crusades. As they found themselves in competition, these republics engaged in shifting alliances and warfare. A modern scholar has referred to Venice as a \"city without territory\" and a \"merchant republic.\" It is said that \"the government was that of a joint-stock trading company, the Doge its president, the Senate its board of directors, the populace its shareholders\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Broadening the Horizons of Chinese History: Discourses, Syntheses, and Comparisons|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RLloK7hHiGAC&pg=PA75|accessdate=27 August 2013|year=1999|publisher=M.E.

However, other towns in Italy also have a history of being merchant republics, though historically less prominent. These include [[Gaeta]], [[Ancona]], [[Molfetta, Italy|Molfetta]], [[Trani]] and, in [[Dalmatia]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] and [[Zara]]. \"Lord Novgorod the Great\", as it was called by the Russians, was a rich Russian merchant-republic in the thirteenth century. It extended its dominion over vast territories in the northern parts of the country, but it continued to invite princes from the House of Rurik to be its military governors and thus remained linked with the rest of the nation.<ref name=\"Zernov1978\">{{cite book|author=Nicolas Zernov|title=The Russians and Their Church|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JTqWtaoxAZMC&pg=PA21|accessdate=26 August 2013|year=1978|publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press|isbn=978-0-913836-36-1|page=21}}</ref>\n\nThe merchant republic were city-states. They were generally [[republic|republics]] in that they were formally independent, though like the rest of medieval [[Europe]] subject to the powers of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and/or the [[Catholic Church]]. All these cities during the time of their independence had similar (though not identical) systems of government in which the merchant class had considerable power. The welfare of a merchant republic was not compatible with the caprice inseparable from monarchy, which would subordinate trade to politics, diplomacy, fiscalism, and war. The 'state' that was built on traditional political institutions and the inherited and developing economic structure was far too atomistic and too vulnerable to harbour plans such as those attributed to it by Colbert.<ref name=\"PostanRich1967\">{{cite book|author1=Michael Mo\u00efssey Postan|author2=Edwin Ernest Rich|author3=H.

The [[Fourth Crusade]], notionally intended to \u2018liberate\u2019 Jerusalem, actually entailed the Venetian conquest of Zara and [[Constantinople]], which transformed the city from a merchant republic to a maritime empire. No other event in the Middle Ages had so profound an impact on Venice.<ref name=\"Madden2008\">{{cite book|author=Thomas F.

The idea of a nation is peculiar to a merchant republic accustomed from early times to negotiating with other states for the privileges of extraterritoriality and concessions of a commercial nature. Thus, Venice had begun to construct its network of \"colonies\" in the eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the Crusades.<ref name=\"StillmanZucker1993\">{{cite book|author1=Yedida Kalfon Stillman|author2=George K.

However, other towns in Italy also have a history of being merchant republics, though historically less prominent. These include [[Gaeta]], [[Ancona]], [[Molfetta, Italy|Molfetta]], [[Trani]] and, in [[Dalmatia]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] and [[Zara]]. \"Lord Novgorod the Great\", as it was called by the Russians, was a rich Russian merchant-republic in the thirteenth century. It extended its dominion over vast territories in the northern parts of the country, but it continued to invite princes from the House of Rurik to be its military governors and thus remained linked with the rest of the nation.<ref name=\"Zernov1978\">{{cite book|author=Nicolas Zernov|title=The Russians and Their Church|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JTqWtaoxAZMC&pg=PA21|accessdate=26 August 2013|year=1978|publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press|isbn=978-0-913836-36-1|page=21}}</ref>\n\nThe merchant republic were city-states. They were generally [[republic|republics]] in that they were formally independent, though like the rest of medieval [[Europe]] subject to the powers of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and/or the [[Catholic Church]]. All these cities during the time of their independence had similar (though not identical) systems of government in which the merchant class had considerable power. The welfare of a merchant republic was not compatible with the caprice inseparable from monarchy, which would subordinate trade to politics, diplomacy, fiscalism, and war. The 'state' that was built on traditional political institutions and the inherited and developing economic structure was far too atomistic and too vulnerable to harbour plans such as those attributed to it by Colbert.<ref name=\"PostanRich1967\">{{cite book|author1=Michael Mo\u00efssey Postan|author2=Edwin Ernest Rich|DUPLICATE_author3=H.

The [[Fourth Crusade]], notionally intended to \u2018liberate\u2019 Jerusalem, actually entailed the Venetian conquest of Zara and [[Constantinople]], which transformed the city from a merchant republic to a maritime empire. No other event in the Middle Ages had so profound an impact on Venice.<ref name=\"Madden2008\">{{cite book|author=Thomas F.

The idea of a nation is peculiar to a merchant republic accustomed from early times to negotiating with other states for the privileges of extraterritoriality and concessions of a commercial nature. Thus, Venice had begun to construct its network of \"colonies\" in the eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the Crusades.<ref name=\"StillmanZucker1993\">{{cite book|author1=Yedida Kalfon Stillman|author2=George K.
