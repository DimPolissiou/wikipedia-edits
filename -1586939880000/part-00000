The building was constructed in 1855 as a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Colonial Renaissance]] style, but was significantly remodelled during [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]], resulting in the current hybrid Japanese-[[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] form.\n\nGovernment House was the official residence of the [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]] from 1855 to 1997, when the city was under [[Colonial Hong Kong|British rule]]. 25 governors of Hong Kong, out of total 28, used this building as their official residence.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n== History ==\n[[File:Government House in 1868.jpg|thumb|Government House in 1868]]\n[[File:HK Government House Living Room.jpg|thumb|Living Room]]\n\nGovernment House was designed by [[Charles St George Cleverly]]. Construction started in 1851, eight years after Hong Kong was declared a British colony, and took four years to complete. The first governor to live there was [[Sir John Bowring]], the fourth governor of the territory. The last one was the last governor, [[Chris Patten]].\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] during World War II (1941\u20131945), it was occupied by the Japanese Military Governor. The form of the building changed to a hybrid Japanese/neoclassical image by [[Seichi Fujimura]] in 1944, primarily through the addition of a tower and roof elements.\n\nGovernment House also housed the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] from 1855 to the 1930s. The Council used the ballroom from 1891 onward.\n\nAfter the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong]] to the People's Republic of China in 1997, the House became a reception for ceremonies (such as the conferring of Honours and formal banquets). [[Tung Chee Hwa]], the first [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], did not reside in Government House but rather at [[Grenville House]].\n\n[[Donald Tsang]], the second Chief Executive moved into Government House in January 2006, following extensive renovations. ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'' criticised that the renovation cost was estimated at HK$14.5 million, including a sum of HK$300,000 allocated to a new fish pond designed to accommodate Tsang's collection of [[koi]].<ref name=stdren>{{cite web|title=Tsang fends off renovation criticism |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GH12Ak07.html |work=The Standard |accessdate=19 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109163138/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GH12Ak07.html |archivedate=9 November 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Major features==\nThe main entrance of the house faces south towards [[Victoria Peak]]. Down on the northern side is the [[Former Central Government Offices]], where most government secretariat offices were situated until 2011.\n\nGovernment House has a front lawn and a back garden. Eminent among the plants in the garden are the numerous azaleas that come to full bloom in spring. Inside, the ballroom, the drawing room, the dining room and the conference room are frequently used for receiving guests at [[official functions]].\n\n=== Gate Lodges and Government House Guards ===\nAt the front entrance on Upper Albert Road, there are two buildings with an iron gate known as the Gate Lodges. The lodges once housed the Government House Guards, who stood in front of the house and protected the [[Governor of Hong Kong]]. Various units of the [[British Army]] stationed in Hong Kong were used as guard units.\n\n* 1st Battalion of the Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment 1962-63\n* C Company of the 1st Battalion of the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Regiment Berkshire and Wiltshire\n\nFollowing the handover in 1997, officers of the [[Hong Kong Police]] have guarded the building.\n\n== Open days ==\n[[File:GH dining room.JPG|thumb|right|Dining room]]\n\nThe garden of Government House is opened twice a year to the public. At least one will be arranged in spring to enable members of the public to share the delight in viewing the full bloom of the azaleas. Visitors are usually allowed to pass by the drawing room, dining room and ballroom where key official functions are held.\n\nThe open days are generally arranged during weekends. Dates are announced through press releases one week in advance. No admission fee is charged.\n\n== Booking ==\nThe ballroom of Government House was made available in the 1990s on three Fridays each month for bookings by charitable, non-profit or public organisations to host events that benefit the community. The nature of the event under application must be well-matched with the identity of Government House as an important historical monument of Hong Kong and with its status as a dignified location for the [[Hong Kong Government]] to hold official functions. In early 2006, the Chief Executive moved into Government House and used it as official residence and office. Most of the staff in the Chief Executive's Office have also been relocated to Government House to support the Chief Executive. Since then, Government House is no longer available for booking due to security and operational reasons.\n\n== Other official residences ==\nIn 1900, [[Mountain Lodge]], on [[Victoria Peak]], was built as an alternate summer home for the Governor, a role it retained until 1934. The building survived until 1946, but today only the [[Gate Lodge]] and [[Victoria Peak Garden]] remain. One of three \"GOVERNOR'S RESIDENCE\" marking stones of the former Mountain Lodge was erected in the small flower bed in front of the entrance of the Government House in 1980.\n\nFrom 1934, [[Fanling Lodge]], in the [[New Territories]], was used as a summer residence for the Governor. It has retained this role, and is now the alternate residence of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. The lodge is occupied mainly at weekends and on holidays.\n\n== Feng shui ==\nAccording to ''The New York Times'', alleged bad [[feng shui]] was the reason [[Tung Chee Hwa]] refused to live or work in Government House upon becoming Chief Executive. During his terms as Chief Executive, he was still heavily criticised by Hong Kongers, and his popularity fell well below 40% by the time of his resignation.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/hongkong/archive/970127feng-shui.html |title=3 Things Matter: Location, Location and Feng Shui |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=19 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124133157/http://www.nytimes.com/specials/hongkong/archive/970127feng-shui.html |archivedate=24 November 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'' believed Tung's reason to stay away from the mansion was political: a subtle effort to reduce the age-old British legacy over Hong Kong.

Since then, Government House is no longer available for booking due to security and operational reasons.\n\n== Other official residences ==\nIn 1900, [[Mountain Lodge]], on [[Victoria Peak]], was built as an alternate summer home for the Governor, a role it retained until 1934. The building survived until 1946, but today only the [[Gate Lodge]] and [[Victoria Peak Garden]] remain. One of three \"GOVERNOR'S RESIDENCE\" marking stones of the former Mountain Lodge was erected in the small flower bed in front of the entrance of the Government House in 1980.\n\nFrom 1934, [[Fanling Lodge]], in the [[New Territories]], was used as a summer residence for the Governor. It has retained this role, and is now the alternate residence of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. The lodge is occupied mainly at weekends and on holidays.\n\n== Feng shui ==\nAccording to ''The New York Times'', alleged bad [[feng shui]] was the reason Tung Chee Hwa refused to live or work in Government House upon becoming Chief Executive. During his terms as Chief Executive, he was still heavily criticised by Hong Kongers, and his popularity fell well below 40% by the time of his resignation.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/hongkong/archive/970127feng-shui.html |title=3 Things Matter: Location, Location and Feng Shui |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=19 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124133157/http://www.nytimes.com/specials/hongkong/archive/970127feng-shui.html |archivedate=24 November 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'' believed Tung's reason to stay away from the mansion was political: a subtle effort to reduce the age-old British legacy over Hong Kong.

This is significant, since it is the principal threat most users believe they are solving with this technology.\n\nThe simplest practical vulnerability with any password container is losing the special key device or the activated smart phone with the integrated key function. Such vulnerability cannot be healed with any single token container device within the preset time span of activation. All further consideration presumes loss prevention, e.g. by additional [[electronic leash]] or body sensor and alarm.\n\nWhile RSA SecurID tokens offer a level of protection against password [[replay attack]]s, they are not designed to offer protection against [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle]] type attacks when used alone.  If the attacker manages to block the authorized user from authenticating to the server until the next token code will be valid, he will be able to log into the server. Risk-based analytics (RBA), a new feature in the latest version (8.0) provides significant protection against this type of attack if the user is enabled and authenticating on an agent enabled for RBA. RSA SecurID does not prevent [[Man in the Browser|man in the browser]] (MitB) based attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Multiple_Factors_Authentication_(OWASP-AT-009) |title=Testing Multiple Factors Authentication (OWASP-AT-009)}}</ref>\n\nSecurID authentication server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented within a given time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard.<ref>http://malpaso.ru/securid/brainard.htm</ref> If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume that it is the user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].\n\nAlthough soft tokens may be more convenient, critics indicate that the [[tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]] property of hard tokens is unmatched in soft token implementations,<ref>http://securology.blogspot.com/2007/11/soft-tokens-arent-tokens-at-all.html</ref> which could allow seed record secret keys to be duplicated and user impersonation to occur.\n\nHard tokens, on the other hand, can be physically stolen (or acquired via [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]]) from end users. The small form factor makes hard token theft much more viable than laptop/desktop scanning. A user will typically wait more than one day before reporting the device as missing, giving the attacker plenty of time to breach the unprotected system. This could only occur, however, if the users UserID and PIN are also known. Risk-based analytics can provide additional protection against the use of lost or stolen tokens, even if the users UserID and PIN are known by the attackers.\n\nBatteries go flat periodically, requiring complicated replacement and re-enrollment procedures.\n\n== Reception and competing products ==\nAs of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsa.com/press_release.aspx?id=5028 |title=RSA SecurID Solution Named Best Third-Party Authentication Device by Windows IT Pro Magazine Readers\u2019 Choice 2004 |work=RSA.com |date=2004-09-16 |accessdate=2011-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106232859/http://rsa.com/press_release.aspx?id=5028 |archivedate=2010-01-06 }}</ref> and 25 million devices have been produced to date.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A number of competitors, such as [[VASCO Data Security International, Inc.|VASCO]], make similar [[security token]]s, mostly based on the open [[Initiative For Open Authentication|OATH HOTP]] standard.

All further consideration presumes loss prevention, e.g. by additional [[electronic leash]] or body sensor and alarm.\n\nWhile RSA SecurID tokens offer a level of protection against password [[replay attack]]s, they are not designed to offer protection against [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle]] type attacks when used alone.  If the attacker manages to block the authorized user from authenticating to the server until the next token code will be valid, he will be able to log into the server. Risk-based analytics (RBA), a new feature in the latest version (8.0) provides significant protection against this type of attack if the user is enabled and authenticating on an agent enabled for RBA. RSA SecurID does not prevent [[Man in the Browser|man in the browser]] (MitB) based attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Multiple_Factors_Authentication_(OWASP-AT-009) |title=Testing Multiple Factors Authentication (OWASP-AT-009)}}</ref>\n\nSecurID authentication server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented within a given time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard.<ref>http://malpaso.ru/securid/brainard.htm</ref> If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume that it is the user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].\n\nAlthough soft tokens may be more convenient, critics indicate that the [[tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]] property of hard tokens is unmatched in soft token implementations,<ref>http://securology.blogspot.com/2007/11/soft-tokens-arent-tokens-at-all.html</ref> which could allow seed record secret keys to be duplicated and user impersonation to occur.\n\nHard tokens, on the other hand, can be physically stolen (or acquired via [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]]) from end users. The small form factor makes hard token theft much more viable than laptop/desktop scanning. A user will typically wait more than one day before reporting the device as missing, giving the attacker plenty of time to breach the unprotected system. This could only occur, however, if the users UserID and PIN are also known. Risk-based analytics can provide additional protection against the use of lost or stolen tokens, even if the users UserID and PIN are known by the attackers.\n\nBatteries go flat periodically, requiring complicated replacement and re-enrollment procedures.\n\n== Reception and competing products ==\nAs of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsa.com/press_release.aspx?id=5028 |title=RSA SecurID Solution Named Best Third-Party Authentication Device by Windows IT Pro Magazine Readers\u2019 Choice 2004 |work=RSA.com |date=2004-09-16 |accessdate=2011-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106232859/http://rsa.com/press_release.aspx?id=5028 |archivedate=2010-01-06 }}</ref> and 25 million devices have been produced to date.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A number of competitors, such as [[VASCO Data Security International, Inc.|VASCO]], make similar [[security token]]s, mostly based on the open [[Initiative For Open Authentication|OATH HOTP]] standard.

It became the foundation of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Meiji Emperor|Meiji]] assumed all the powers of state during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The Imperial Guard, which consisted of 12,000 men organized and trained along French Military lines, first saw action in the [[Satsuma Rebellion]]. It was organized into the 1st Guards Infantry [[Brigade]] which had the 1st and 2nd Regiments. The 3rd and 4th Regiments belonged to the 2nd Guards infantry Brigade.\n\nBy 1885 the Imperial Japanese Army consisted of seven divisions, one of which was the [[Imperial Guard]]. A division consisted of four regiments containing two battalions each. The Imperial Guard division was based in [[Tokyo]] and recruited nationally.\n\nAfter the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, a second Guard Brigade was formed from [[Taiwanese aboriginals|indigenous Formosans]].  In 1920 the Guards Cavalry Regiment, Guards Field Artillery Regiment, Guards Engineer Battalion, Guards Transport Battalion, plus other Guards service units were added.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1939 the Guards Engineer Battalion was expanded into a regiment as was the Guards Transport Battalion.\n\n===Pacific War===\nIn September 1939, the division was split into the 1st and 2nd Guards Brigades.\n\nThe 1st Guards Brigade, which contained the 1st and 2nd Guards Infantry Regiments, the cavalry regiment, and half of the support units, was transferred to [[Northern and southern China|South China]]. Here it became known as the [[Guards Mixed Brigade|Mixed Guards Brigade]]. In October 1940, it joined other Japanese units occupying [[French Indo-China]].  In April 1941 the Mixed Guards Brigade returned to Tokyo but it did not rejoin the Imperial Guards Division.\n\nThe 2nd Guards Brigade, which contained 3rd and 4th Guards Regiments, also went to China. In 1940, it went to [[Shanghai]] before being posted to [[Hainan]] Island. In June 1941, the 5th Guards Infantry Regiment joined the 2nd Guards Brigade becoming the Imperial Guard Division again. It later saw action in the [[Battle of Malaya|Battles of Malaya]] and  [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]] with [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]]'s 25th Army.\n\nIn May 1943, all designated Imperial Guard units were renamed again. The Mixed Guards Brigade in [[Tokyo]] became the [[1st Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|1st Guards Division]] (which now consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 6th Guard Regiments) and the Imperial Guard Division became the [[2nd Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Guards Division]]. The [[3rd Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|3rd Guards Division]], which never left Japan, was formed in 1944.  It consisted of the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Regiments. Sources do not agree if there ever was a 7th Guard Regiment.\n\nAll military Imperial Guard Divisions were dissolved at the end of [[World War II]].\n\n===War crimes===\nIn [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore]], the Guard Division was involved in several notorious [[Japanese war crimes]] such as the [[Parit Sulong Massacre]] and the [[Sook Ching massacre]]. [[Lieutenant General|Lt Gen.]] [[Takuma Nishimura]], who was sentenced to life imprisonment by a British military court in relation to the Sook Ching killings, was later convicted of war crimes by an Australian Military Court in relation to the Parit Sulong massacre. He was executed by hanging on June 11, 1951.<ref>[http://www.thisisfolkestone.co.uk/ms/info/massacresinthepacific.htm 7th Battalion The Cameronians Multiple Sclerosis Research Initiative<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Uniform===\n{{Main|Imperial Japanese Army Uniforms}}\n\n[[File:Hirohito_wedding.jpg|thumb|left|Mounted Imperial Guards wearing the dark blue dress uniform during Emperor [[Hirohito]]'s wedding in 1924]]\n\nUntil 1939, the Cavalry of the Imperial Guard wore a French style parade uniform consisting of a dark-blue [[tunic]] with red Brandenburg braiding, a red [[kepi]] and red [[breeches]]. The red kepi had a white [[hackle|plume]] with a red base.  Prior to the general adoption of khaki by the Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), an all white [[linen]] uniform had been worn in hot weather.\n\nThe Infantry of the Imperial Guard wore a dark blue uniform with white leggings for both parade and service wear until 1905.  It was distinguished from that of the line infantry by a red band and piping on the peaked service cap (instead of yellow).  Officers wore a dark blue tunic with 5 rows of black mohair froggings and dark blue breeches with a red stripe down each seam.\n\nFollowing the adoption of a khaki service dress, the Guard Infantry wore this on all occasions, although officers retained the blue and red uniform for certain ceremonial occasions when not parading with troops.\n\nIn the field, the army's standard khaki uniform was worn by all Imperial Guard units from 1905 to 1945.

It became the foundation of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Meiji Emperor|Meiji]] assumed all the powers of state during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The Imperial Guard, which consisted of 12,000 men organized and trained along French Military lines, first saw action in the [[Satsuma Rebellion]]. It was organized into the 1st Guards Infantry [[Brigade]] which had the 1st and 2nd Regiments. The 3rd and 4th Regiments belonged to the 2nd Guards infantry Brigade.\n\nBy 1885 the Imperial Japanese Army consisted of seven divisions, one of which was the [[Imperial Guard]]. A division consisted of four regiments containing two battalions each. The Imperial Guard division was based in [[Tokyo]] and recruited nationally.\n\nAfter the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, a second Guard Brigade was formed from [[Taiwanese aboriginals|indigenous Formosans]].  In 1920 the Guards Cavalry Regiment, Guards Field Artillery Regiment, Guards Engineer Battalion, Guards Transport Battalion, plus other Guards service units were added.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1939 the Guards Engineer Battalion was expanded into a regiment as was the Guards Transport Battalion.\n\n===Pacific War===\nIn September 1939, the division was split into the 1st and 2nd Guards Brigades.\n\nThe 1st Guards Brigade, which contained the 1st and 2nd Guards Infantry Regiments, the cavalry regiment, and half of the support units, was transferred to [[Northern and southern China|South China]]. Here it became known as the [[Guards Mixed Brigade|Mixed Guards Brigade]]. In October 1940, it joined other Japanese units occupying [[French Indo-China]].  In April 1941 the Mixed Guards Brigade returned to Tokyo but it did not rejoin the Imperial Guards Division.\n\nThe 2nd Guards Brigade, which contained 3rd and 4th Guards Regiments, also went to China. In 1940, it went to [[Shanghai]] before being posted to [[Hainan]] Island. In June 1941, the 5th Guards Infantry Regiment joined the 2nd Guards Brigade becoming the Imperial Guard Division again. It later saw action in the [[Battle of Malaya|Battles of Malaya]] and  [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]] with [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]]'s 25th Army.\n\nIn May 1943, all designated Imperial Guard units were renamed again. The Mixed Guards Brigade in [[Tokyo]] became the [[1st Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|1st Guards Division]] (which now consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 6th Guard Regiments) and the Imperial Guard Division became the [[2nd Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Guards Division]]. The [[3rd Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|3rd Guards Division]], which never left Japan, was formed in 1944.  It consisted of the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Regiments. Sources do not agree if there ever was a 7th Guard Regiment.\n\nAll military Imperial Guard Divisions were dissolved at the end of [[World War II]].\n\n===War crimes===\nIn [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore]], the Guard Division was involved in several notorious [[Japanese war crimes]] such as the [[Parit Sulong Massacre]] and the [[Sook Ching massacre]]. [[Lieutenant General|Lt Gen.]] [[Takuma Nishimura]], who was sentenced to life imprisonment by a British military court in relation to the Sook Ching killings, was later convicted of war crimes by an Australian Military Court in relation to the Parit Sulong massacre. He was executed by hanging on June 11, 1951.<ref>[http://www.thisisfolkestone.co.uk/ms/info/massacresinthepacific.htm 7th Battalion The Cameronians Multiple Sclerosis Research Initiative<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Uniform===\n{{Main|Imperial Japanese Army Uniforms}}\n\n[[File:Hirohito_wedding.jpg|thumb|left|Mounted Imperial Guards wearing the dark blue dress uniform during Emperor [[Hirohito]]'s wedding in 1924]]\n\nUntil 1939, the Cavalry of the Imperial Guard wore a French style parade uniform consisting of a dark-blue [[tunic]] with red Brandenburg braiding, a red [[kepi]] and red [[breeches]]. The red kepi had a white [[hackle|plume]] with a red base.  Prior to the general adoption of khaki by the Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), an all white [[linen]] uniform had been worn in hot weather.\n\nThe Infantry of the Imperial Guard wore a dark blue uniform with white leggings for both parade and service wear until 1905.  It was distinguished from that of the line infantry by a red band and piping on the peaked service cap (instead of yellow).  Officers wore a dark blue tunic with 5 rows of black mohair froggings and dark blue breeches with a red stripe down each seam.\n\nFollowing the adoption of a khaki service dress, the Guard Infantry wore this on all occasions, although officers retained the blue and red uniform for certain ceremonial occasions when not parading with troops.\n\nIn the field, the army's standard khaki uniform was worn by all Imperial Guard units from 1905 to 1945.

When a federal court is faced with a choice of ruling on a [[Statute|statutory]], [[Regulation|regulatory]] or constitutional basis, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has instructed the lower court to decide the federal constitutional issue only as a last resort: \"The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of.\" ''[[Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Auth.]]'', 297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\nThe avoidance doctrine flows from the canon of judicial self-restraint, and is intertwined with the debate over the proper scope of federal judicial review and the allocation of power among the three branches of the federal government and the states. It is also premised on the \"delicacy\" and \"finality\" of judicial review of legislation for constitutionality, concerns regarding the credibility of the federal courts, and the \"paramount importance of constitutional adjudication in our system.\"<ref>Rescue Army v.
