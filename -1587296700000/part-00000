New York: DaCapo Press. {{ISBN|0-306-80783-1}}, pp. 24, 76, 93, 101\u201318.</ref> Initially a [[slide guitar]]ist, Jones would go on to play a wide variety of instruments on Rolling Stones recordings and in concerts, such as [[rhythm guitar|rhythm]] and [[lead guitar]], [[sitar]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimer]], various [[keyboard instrument]]s such as [[piano]] and [[mellotron]], [[marimba]], wind instruments such as [[harmonica]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[saxophone]], as well as [[drums]], [[vocals]] and numerous others.\n\nJones and fellow guitarist [[Keith Richards]] developed a unique style of guitar play that Richards refers to as the \"ancient art of weaving\" where both players would play rhythm and lead parts together; Richards would carry the style on with later Stones guitarists and the sound would become a Rolling Stones trademark.\n\nAfter he founded the Rolling Stones as a [[British blues]] outfit in 1962, and gave the band its name, Jones' fellow band members Richards and [[Mick Jagger]] began to take over the band's musical direction, especially after they became a successful [[Jagger/Richards|songwriting team]]. Jones also did not get along with the band's manager, [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], who pushed the band into a musical direction at odds with Jones' blues background. When Jones developed alcohol and drug problems, his performance in the studio became increasingly unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he had founded. In June 1969, the Rolling Stones dismissed Jones; guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] took his place in the group. Jones died less than a month later, drowning in the swimming pool at his home [[27 club|at the age of 27]].\n\nLong-time Rolling Stones bass guitarist [[Bill Wyman]] said of Jones, \"He formed the band. He chose the members. He named the band. He chose the music we played. He got us gigs. ... he was very influential, very important, and then slowly lost it \u2013 highly intelligent \u2013 and just kind of wasted it and blew it all away.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Lowman |first=Rob |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=93511441 |title=Roll of a lifetime: Founding bassist Bill Wyman looks back at the Stones |date=27 October 2002 |work=Daily News |location=Los Angeles |publisher=thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=19 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918152345/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=93511441|archivedate=2018-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nLewis Brian Hopkins Jones was born in the Park Nursing Home in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], on 28 February 1942.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=3}}<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\">{{cite book |last=Wyman |first=Bill |title=Rolling With the Stones |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7513-4646-2}}p. 10 & 16.</ref> An attack of [[croup]] at the age of four left Jones with [[asthma]] that lasted for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\" /> His middle-class parents, Lewis Blount Jones and Louisa Beatrice Jones (''n\u00e9e'' Simmonds), were of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent.

Jones persuaded his parents to buy him a [[saxophone]] and two years later his parents gave him his first [[acoustic guitar]] as a 17th-birthday present.<ref name=\"wymanp23\">Wyman 2002. p. 23.</ref>\n\nJones attended local schools, including [[Dean Close School]] from September 1949 to July 1953, and [[Pate's Grammar School|Cheltenham Grammar School for Boys]], which he entered in September 1953 after passing the [[eleven-plus]] exam.

Prior to his firing in 1969, on any instrument apart from the standard rock set up of drums, guitars, piano, or bass, Jones was  the one playing it. His ability to play a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966), ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967) and ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (1967). As a guitarist, in the early days he favoured a white teardrop-shaped electric guitar produced by the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] company, especially in live performances; he also played a wide variety of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as [[Rickenbacker]], [[Gibson]], and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. As a slide guitarist, he favoured the [[open E tuning]] and [[open G tuning]].<ref>Paul Trynka interview with [[Dick Taylor]], early bass player for the Rolling Stones: {{cite web |last1=[[Paul Trynka|Trynka]] |first1=Paul |title=Open G tunings and open secrets |url=http://trynka.net/2014/08/open-g-tunings-and-open-secrets/ |accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nExamples of Jones' contributions are his slide guitar on \"[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]\" (1963), \"[[I'm a King Bee]]\", \"[[Little Red Rooster]]\" (1964), \"[[I'm Movin' On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]\" (1965), \"Doncha Bother Me\" and \"[[No Expectations]]\". Jones can also be heard playing [[Bo Diddley]]-style rhythm guitar on \"[[Mona (I Need You Baby)|I Need You Baby]]\" and on \"[[Please Go Home]]\", the guitar riff in \"[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]\";<ref>{{cite web |author=Ian |url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/SOLastTime.html |title=The Last Time |publisher=Timeisonourside.com |accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref> [[sitar]] on \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\"; organ on \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\"; [[marimba]] on \"[[Under My Thumb]]\", \"[[Out of Time (The Rolling Stones song)|Out of Time]]\" and \"[[Yesterday's Papers]]\"; [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] on \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" and \"All Sold Out\"; saxophone on \"Child of the Moon\" and \"[[Citadel (song)|Citadel]]\"; [[kazoo]] on \"Cool, Calm and Collected\"; [[Appalachian dulcimer]] on \"I Am Waiting\" and \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", [[Mellotron]] on \"[[She's a Rainbow]]\", \"[[We Love You]]\", \"[[Stray Cat Blues]]\", \"[[2000 Light Years from Home]]\", and \"Citadel\"; and the [[autoharp]] on \"[[Ride On, Baby]]\" and (for his final recording as a Rolling Stone) on \"[[You Got the Silver]]\". He also played the oboe/soprano sax solo in \"[[Dandelion]]\".\n\nJones also played harmonica on many of the Rolling Stones' early songs. Examples of Jones' playing are on \"[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]\", \"[[Stoned (The Rolling Stones song)|Stoned]]\" (1963), \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" (1964), \"[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]\", \"Now I've Got a Witness\" (1964), \"Good Times, Bad Times\" (1964), \"[[2120 South Michigan Avenue]]\" (1964) (from the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Five By Five''), \"The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man\", \"One More Try\" (1965), \"High and Dry\" and \"[[Goin' Home (The Rolling Stones song)|Goin' Home]]\" (1966), \"Who's Driving Your Plane?\" (1966), \"Cool Calm and Collected\", \"Who's Been Sleeping Here\" (1967), and \"[[Dear Doctor (song)|Dear Doctor]]\" and \"Prodigal Son\" (1968).\n\nIn the early years, Jones often served as a backing [[vocalist]]. Notable examples are \"[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]\", \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"I Just Wanna Make Love to You\", \"[[Walking the Dog]]\", \"[[Money (That's What I Want)|Money]]\", \"I'm Alright\", \"[[You Better Move On (song)|You Better Move On]]\" and \"[[It's All Over Now]]\". He contributed backing vocals as late as 1968 on \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\". He is also responsible for the whistling on \"Walking the Dog\".\n\nRichards maintains that what he calls \"guitar weaving\"<ref>[http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view Rolling Stones' Guitar Weaving (Podcast)-Q107 Toronto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021141144/http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view |date=21 October 2013}}</ref> emerged from this period, from listening to [[Jimmy Reed]] albums: \"We listened to the teamwork, trying to work out what was going on in those records; how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five\".<ref>Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood 2003. p. 39</ref> Jones' and Richards' guitars became a signature of the sound of the Rolling Stones, with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles.\n\n===Estrangement from bandmates===\n[[File:MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Michael Cooper (photographer)|Michael Cooper]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], Shepard Sherbell, Jones and [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] (Amsterdam, 1967)]]\nOldham's arrival as manager marked the beginning of Jones' slow [[wikt:estrangement|estrangement]]. Oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers' writing their own songs, as exemplified by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], and that playing [[cover version|covers]] would not sustain a band in the limelight for long. Further, he wanted to make Jagger's charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances. Jones saw his influence over the Stones' direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred; more [[Jagger/Richards]] originals developed, and Oldham increased his own managerial control, displacing Jones from yet another role.<ref name=\"wymanp76\">Wyman 2002. p. 76.</ref>\n\nAccording to Oldham in his book ''Stoned'', Jones was an outsider from the beginning.<ref>Andrew Loog Oldham, ''Stoned'' (St. Martin's Press, 2005), p. 210 \u2013 300.</ref> When the first [[concert tour|tour]]s were arranged in 1963, he travelled separately from the band, stayed at different hotels, and demanded extra pay. According to Oldham, Jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away. He \"resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle, and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day. None of us were looking forward to Brian totally cracking up\".<ref>Oldham 2005. p. 210.</ref> The toll from days on the road, the money and fame, and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in Jones' overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs. These excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and, according to Oldham, Jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times.\n\nIn March 1967, [[Anita Pallenberg]], Jones' girlfriend of two years, left him for Richards when Jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to [[Morocco]],<ref>''Life'', pp. 198\u2013199</ref> further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Richards. As tensions and Jones' [[substance abuse]] increased, his musical contributions became sporadic. He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play, and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions. In [[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]]'s promotional film for ''[[We Love You#Promotional film|We Love You]]'', made in July 1967, he appears extremely groggy and disoriented.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=161}}\n\nJones was arrested for [[drug possession]] on 10 May 1967, shortly after the \"Redlands\" incident at Richards' Sussex home. Authorities found [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]] in his flat. He confessed to marijuana use, but claimed he did not use hard drugs.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=154}}\n\nIn June 1967, he attended the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. There he met [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], and went on stage to introduce the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] who were not yet well known in the [[United States]].\n\nHostility grew between Jones, Jagger, and Richards, alienating Jones further from the group.<ref>Stanley Booth, ''The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones'' (Canongate Books, 2012), p. 107.</ref> Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing, Wyman, Richards, and Watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult.<ref>Richards and Fox, ''Life'', pp. 271\u2013272</ref> By most accounts, Jones' attitude changed frequently; he was one minute caring and generous, the next making an effort to anger everyone. As Wyman observed in ''Stone Alone'': \"There were at least two sides to Brian's personality. One Brian was introverted, shy, sensitive, deep-thinking. The other was a preening peacock, gregarious, artistic, desperately needing assurance from his peers.\"<ref>Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 83</ref> \"He pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond\".<ref>Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 76</ref>\n\nJones' last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in spring and summer of 1968, when the Stones produced \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\" and the ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' album. He can be seen in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (1968 film)|One Plus One]]'' playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards, although Jones is neglected in the music-making. The film chronicles the making of \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\".\n\nWhere once Jones played multiple instruments on many tracks, he now played only minor roles on a few pieces. Jones' last formal appearance was in the December 1968 ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'', a part-concert, part circus-act film organised by the band. It went unreleased for more than 25 years because Jagger was unhappy with the band's performance compared to others in the film such as [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[John Lennon]], [[the Who]], and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]].<ref name=\"rnrcircus\">{{cite video |people=The Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend | title=Rock and Roll Circus |medium=commentary to the 2004 DVD release |publisher=ABKCO Films |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of Jones' time with the Rolling Stones was near, and [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Pete Townshend]] of the Who thought it would be Jones' last live musical performance.<ref name=\"rnrcircus\"/>\n\n===Legal troubles and departure from the Rolling Stones===\nJones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968, for possession of [[cannabis]], which he said had been left by previous tenants of the flat. Owing to his being on [[probation]], he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty. The jury found him guilty, but the judge had sympathy for Jones; instead of jailing him, he fined him \u00a350 ({{Inflation|UK|50|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) plus \u00a3105 in costs ({{Inflation|UK|105|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn |UK |df=y}}) and told him: \"For goodness sake, don't get into trouble again or it really ''will'' be serious\".<ref name=\"wymanp311\">Wyman 2002. p. 311</ref>\n\nJones' legal troubles, estrangement from his bandmates, substance abuse, and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band. The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the US in 1969, for the first time in three years, but Jones was not in a fit condition to tour, and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a US [[work visa]]. In addition, Jones' attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic; and when he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or, when he did, his bandmates would switch off his amplifier, leaving Richards to play nearly all the guitars. According to author Gary Herman, Jones was \"literally incapable of making music; when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding\".<ref>Gary Herman, ''Rock 'N' Roll Babylon'' (Norfolk: Fakenham Press, 1982), p. 44.</ref>\n\nThis behaviour was problematic during the ''Their Satanic Majesties Request'' and ''Beggar's Banquet'' sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording ''Let It Bleed''. In March 1969, Jones borrowed the group's [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] and went shopping in Pimlico Road. After the parked car was towed away by police, Jones hired a chauffeur-driven car to get home.<ref name=\"wymanp323\">Wyman 2002. p. 323</ref> In May 1969, Jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name.<ref name=\"wymanp323\" /> From this point, he was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the band's music.<ref name=\"wymanp323\" /> By May, he had made two contributions to the work in progress: [[autoharp]] on \"[[You Got the Silver]]\" and percussion on \"[[Midnight Rambler]]\". Jagger informed Jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session. Looking frail, he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a Rolling Stone took place on 21 May 1969, first at [[St. Katherine Docks]], [[Tower Bridge]], London and then at [[Ethan Russell]]'s photographic studio in [[South Kensington]]. The photos would appear on the album ''[[Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol.2)]]'' in September 1969.<ref>\"Wyman\".\"Rolling with the Stones\" p.\"344\"</ref>\n\nThe Stones decided that following the release of the ''Let it Bleed'' album (scheduled for a July 1969 release in the US) they would start a tour of North America in November 1969. However, the Stones' management was informed that Jones would not receive a work permit, owing to his drug convictions. At the suggestion of Stewart, the Stones decided to add a new guitarist; on 8 June 1969, Jones was visited by Jagger, Richards and Watts, and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him.<ref name=\"wymanp324-326\">Wyman 2002. p. 324-326</ref>\n\nTo the public it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily; the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave, it was his choice how to break it to the public. Jones released a statement on 9 June 1969, announcing his departure. In this statement he said, among other things, that, \"I no longer see eye-to-eye with the others over the discs we are cutting\".<ref name=\"wymanp326\">Wyman 2002. p. 326</ref> He was replaced by the 20-year-old guitarist [[Mick Taylor]], formerly of [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]].\n\nDuring the period of his decreasing involvement in the band, Jones was living at [[Cotchford Farm]] in [[East Sussex]], the residence formerly owned by ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' author [[A. A. Milne]],<ref name=\"teleg2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/9258085/The-rock-n-roll-house-at-Pooh-corner.html |title=The rock 'n' roll house at Pooh corner |first=Christopher |last=Middleton| date=12 May 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> which Jones had purchased in November 1968. Alexis Korner, who visited in late June, noted that Jones seemed \"happier than he had ever been\".<ref name=\"wymanp329\">Wyman 2002, p. 329</ref> Jones is known to have contacted Korner, Stewart, [[John Lennon]], [[Mitch Mitchell]], [[Alan Price]], and [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]] about intentions to put together another band.

His [[Swedish people|Swedish]] girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, was convinced he was alive when he was taken out of the pool, insisting he still had a pulse. However, by the time the doctors arrived, it was too late and he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, at the age of 27.

The band decided to dedicate the concert (which had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present their new guitarist, Mick Taylor) to Jones. Before the Stones' set, Jagger read excerpts from \"[[Adonais]]\", a poem by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] about the death of his friend [[John Keats]], and [[stagehand]]s released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute. The band opened with a [[Johnny Winter]] song that was one of Jones' favourites, \"I'm Yours and I'm Hers\".\n\nJones was reportedly buried {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} deep in Cheltenham Cemetery, to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters.

The journalist has also uncovered unseen police files held at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]. According to Trevor Hobley, chairman of the Brian Jones Fan Club, a neighbour was leaving for work on the morning of Jones' death and saw a large [[bonfire]] on Jones' estate in which documentation was being burned.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> In 2010, following the review, Sussex Police stated it would not be reopening the case. It asserted that \"this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Police's Crime Policy and Review Branch, but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroner's original verdict of 'death by misadventure' was incorrect.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Death of Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones case will not reopen despite new evidence which suggests he was murdered|newspaper=The Mail on Sunday|date= 31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Songwriting credits==\nUnsure and insecure as a composer, Jones was not a prolific songwriter. The 30-second \"[[Rice Krispies]]\" [[advertising jingle|jingle]] for [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], co-written with the [[J. Walter Thompson]] advertising agency in 1963 and performed by The Rolling Stones incognito, was credited to Jones; this did not sit well with the rest of the band, who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally.<ref name=\"wymanp90\">Wyman 2002. p. 90.</ref> Jones was also included in the \"[[Nanker Phelge|Nanker/Phelge]]\" songwriting credit, a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and Andrew Oldham.\n\nAccording to Oldham, the main reason for Jones' not writing songs was that Jones, being a blues purist, did not love simple pop music enough. Oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and [[Gene Pitney]] after \"becoming bored senseless by Jones' bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion\", but after two days of sessions \"the results remain best to be unheard, even by Rolling Stones' completists\".<ref>Oldham (2005). p. 288.</ref> In 1995, Mick Jagger told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine that Jones had been jealous of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team, and added: \"To be honest, Brian had no talent for writing songs. None. I've never known a guy with less talent for songwriting.\"<ref name=\"jaggerremembers\" />\n\nFaithfull reported that Jones wrote an early version of the melody for \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" and presented it to the group. [[Victor Bockris]] reported that Richards and Jones worked out the final melody in the studio.<ref>Bockris, Keith Richards, Dutch translation, 1993, p.93-94</ref> Additionally, Jones is credited (along with Richards) for the instrumental piece \"Hear It\". However, in 1966, Jones composed, produced, and played on the soundtrack to ''[[Mord und Totschlag]]'' (English title: ''A Degree Of Murder''), an avant-garde [[Germany|German]] film with Anita Pallenberg, adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack.\n\nThe only known released Jones song is \"(Thank You) For Being There\", which reportedly is a poem by Jones put to music by [[Carla Olson]]. It appeared on the 1990 album ''True Voices'' as performed by [[Natural Acoustic Band#Krysia Kocjan .28Krysia Kristianne.29|Krysia Kristianne]] and [[Robin Williamson]].\n\n==Other contributions==\n[[File:Brian Jones guitar, HRC Sacramento.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Jones' [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox Mark VI]], retired for display]]\nIn summer 1968, Jones recorded the Morocco-based ensemble, the [[Master Musicians of Joujouka]] ([[Jajouka]]), which was later used by the band; the recording was released in 1971 as ''[[Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka]]''. Jagger and Richards visited [[Jajouka]] in 1989 after recording \"Continental Drift\" for the Rolling Stones album ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' with [[The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar]] in [[Tangier]]. An homage to Jones entitled \"Brian Jones Joujouka very Stoned\", painted by [[Mohamed Hamri]], who had brought Jones to Jajouka in 1967, appeared on the cover of ''[[Joujouka Black Eyes]]'' by the Master Musicians of Joujouka in 1995.\n\n''Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Jajouka'' was rereleased in co-operation with [[Bachir Attar]] and [[Philip Glass]] in 1995.

He can also be seen playing a [[Fender Telecaster]] in the 1968 \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" promo video.\n\n==Public image and legacy==\nPallenberg has stated in an interview that Jones wanted to look like [[Fran\u00e7oise Hardy]], loved \"dressing up and posing about\" and that he would ask her to do his hair and make-up.<ref name = \"AnitaP\">{{cite book |first= Anita|last= Pallenberg |title= Interview in The Times, p9 |date= 16 October 2010|work=The Times |location=UK}}</ref> [[Bo Diddley]] described Jones as \"a little dude that was trying to pull the group ahead.

The coincidence of their deaths at that age has been referred to in popular culture as the \"[[27 Club]]\". When Alastair Johns, who owned Cotchford Farm for over 40 years after Jones' death, refurbished the pool, he sold the original tiles to Jones' fans for \u00a3100 each, which paid for half of the work.<ref name=\"teleg2012\"/> Johns noted that Cotchford Farm remained for decades an attraction for Jones' fans.\n\nThe [[Psychic TV]] song \"Godstar\" is about Jones' death, as are [[Robyn Hitchcock]]'s \"Trash\", [[The Drovers]]' \"She's as Pretty as Brian Jones Was\", [[Jeff Dahl]]'s \"Mick and Keith killed Brian\", [[Ted Nugent]]'s \"Death by Misadventure\", and [[Salmonblaster]]'s \"Brian Jones\". [[Toy Love]]'s song \"Swimming Pool\" lists several dead rock icons including Jones (the others are Morrison, Hendrix, and [[Marc Bolan]]) just as [[A House]]'s \"[[Endless Art]]\" does; Jones is also mentioned in [[De Phazz]]'s song \"Something Special\". The Master Musicians of Joujouka song \"Brian Jones Joujouka Very Stoned\" was released in 1974 and 1996.<ref>\"Return to Joujouka, BBC Radio 4, 29 August 2000, Master Musicians of Joujouka, \"Joujouka Black Eyes, Le Coeur Du Monde 1995</ref> The band [[Tigers Jaw]] heavily references Jones and his death in their song \"I Saw Water\".

The part of Brian was played by English actor [[Leo Gregory]].\n\nA fictionalised version of Jones and the tribute concert to him appears in [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century]]'' in its second issue, \"Paint it Black\".\n\nHis musicianship and contribution to the band are featured heavily in the documentary ''[[Crossfire Hurricane]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n'''With [[The Rolling Stones]]'''\n*''[[The Rolling Stones (EP)]]'' (1964)\n*''[[The Rolling Stones (album)|The Rolling Stones]]'' (1964)\n*''[[England's Newest Hit Makers]]'' (1964)\n*''[[Five by Five (The Rolling Stones EP)|Five by Five]]'' (1964)\n*''[[12 X 5]]'' (1964)\n*''[[The Rolling Stones No. 2]]'' (1965)\n*''[[The Rolling Stones, Now!]]'' (1965)\n*''[[Got Live If You Want It!

Jones also did not get along with the band's manager, [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], who pushed the band into a musical direction at odds with Jones' blues background. When Jones developed alcohol and drug problems, his performance in the studio became increasingly unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he had founded. In June 1969, the Rolling Stones dismissed Jones; guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] took his place in the group. Jones died less than a month later, drowning in the swimming pool at his home [[27 club|at the age of 27]].\n\nLong-time Rolling Stones bass guitarist [[Bill Wyman]] said of Jones, \"He formed the band. He chose the members. He named the band. He chose the music we played.

Brian had two sisters: Pamela, who was born on 3 October 1943 and died on 14 October 1945 of [[leukemia]]; and Barbara, born on 22 August 1946.<ref>Wyman 2002, p. 10.</ref>\n\nBoth Jones' parents were interested in music: his father, Lewis, was a [[piano]] teacher in addition to his job as an [[aeronautical engineer]], and his mother, Louisa, played piano and [[organ (music)|organ]] and led the [[choir]] at the local [[Church (building)|church]].<ref name=\"wymanp10p16\"/> In 1957, Jones first heard [[Cannonball Adderley]]'s music; this inspired his interest in [[jazz]].

He enjoyed [[badminton]] and [[diving (sport)|diving]] at school, and became first [[clarinet]] in the school orchestra. He reportedly obtained seven [[O-levels|O-level]] passes in 1957, thence continuing into the [[sixth form]] and obtaining a further two O-levels. He also took three [[A-levels]] in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], passing the first two and failing biology.<ref name=\"wymanp19\">Wyman 2002. p.19.</ref>\n\nJones was able to perform well in exams despite a lack of academic effort.<ref name=\"wymanp19\" /> However, he found school regimented, and disliked the school uniforms and [[conformism]] in general; he angered teachers with his behaviour, though he was popular with classmates.<ref name=\"wymanp19\"/> Jones himself said: \"When I made the sixth form I found myself accepted by the older boys; suddenly I was in.\"<ref name=\"wymanp19\" /> His hostility to authority figures resulted in his suspension from school on two occasions.<ref name=\"wymanp19\" /> According to Dick Hattrell, a childhood friend: \"He was a rebel without a cause, but when examinations came he was brilliant.\"<ref name=\"wymanp19\"/>\n\nIn late summer 1959, Jones' girlfriend (they were both aged 17), a Cheltenham schoolgirl named Valerie Corbett, became pregnant.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ride |first=Graham |title=Foundation Stone |year=2001 |isbn=1-904221-02-5 |pages=103\u20137}}</ref> Although Jones is said to have encouraged her to have an [[abortion]], she carried the child to term and placed baby Barry David Corbett (later Simon) for [[adoption]].<ref name=\"wymanp19\"/> Jones quit school in disgrace and left home, travelling for a summer through northern Europe. During this period, he lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, [[busking]] with his guitar on the streets for money, and living off the charity of others. Eventually, he ran short of money and returned to England.<ref name=\"wymanp28\">Wyman 2002. p. 28.</ref>\n\nJones listened to [[classical music]] as a child but preferred [[blues]], particularly [[Elmore James]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]. Jones began performing at local blues and jazz clubs, while busking and working odd jobs. He reportedly stole small amounts of money from work to pay for cigarettes, for which he was fired.<ref name=\"wymanp35-36\">Wyman 2002. pp. 35&ndash;36.</ref>\n\nIn November 1959, Jones went to the Wooden Bridge Hotel in [[Guildford]] to see a band perform. He met a young married woman named Angeline, and the two had a one-night stand that resulted in her pregnancy. Angeline and her husband decided to raise the baby, Belinda, born on 4 August 1960. Jones never knew about her birth.<ref name=\"wymanp28\" />\n\nIn 1961, Jones applied for a scholarship to [[Cheltenham Art College]]. He was initially accepted into the programme, but two days later the offer was withdrawn after an unidentified acquaintance wrote to the college, calling Jones an irresponsible [[vagrant|drifter]].<ref name=\"wymanp29\">Wyman 2002. p. 29.</ref>\n\nOn 22 October 1961, Jones' girlfriend Pat Andrews gave birth to his third child, Julian Mark Andrews.<ref name=\"wymanp30-31\">Wyman 2002. pp. 30&ndash;31.</ref> Jones sold his record collection to buy flowers for Pat and clothes for the newborn. He lived with them for a while. On 23 July 1964, another woman, Linda Lawrence (later married to [[Donovan]]), gave birth to Jones' fourth child, Julian Brian Lawrence.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=93}} In early October 1964 an occasional girlfriend of Brian's, Dawn Molloy, announced to Brian and [[the Rolling Stones]]'s management that she was pregnant by him. She received a cheque for \u00a3700 ({{Inflation|UK|700|1964|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) from group manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. In return, she signed an agreement that the matter was now closed and that she would make no statement about Jones or the child to the public or the press.

At the time, Watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in London; he had played with (among others) Alexis Korner's group [[Blues Incorporated]].\n\nWatts described Jones' role in these early days: \"Brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning. Keith and I would look at him and say he was barmy. It was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid [[Half crown (British coin)|half-a-crown]] and to be billed as an R&B band\".<ref>Jagger, Mick; Richards, Keith; Watts, Charlie; Wood, Ronnie. ''According to the Rolling Stones.''

Prior to his firing in 1969, on any instrument apart from the standard rock set up of drums, guitars, piano, or bass, Jones was  the one playing it. His ability to play a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966), ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967) and ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (1967). As a guitarist, in the early days he favoured a white teardrop-shaped electric guitar produced by the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] company, especially in live performances; he also played a wide variety of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as [[Rickenbacker]], [[Gibson]], and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. As a slide guitarist, he favoured the [[open E tuning]] and [[open G tuning]].<ref>Paul Trynka interview with [[Dick Taylor]], early bass player for the Rolling Stones: {{cite web |last1=[[Paul Trynka|Trynka]] |first1=Paul |title=Open G tunings and open secrets |url=http://trynka.net/2014/08/open-g-tunings-and-open-secrets/ |accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nExamples of Jones' contributions are his slide guitar on \"[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]\" (1963), \"[[I'm a King Bee]]\", \"[[Little Red Rooster]]\" (1964), \"[[I'm Movin' On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]\" (1965), \"Doncha Bother Me\" and \"[[No Expectations]]\". Jones can also be heard playing [[Bo Diddley]]-style rhythm guitar on \"[[Mona (I Need You Baby)|I Need You Baby]]\" and on \"[[Please Go Home]]\", the guitar riff in \"[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]\";<ref>{{cite web |author=Ian |url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/SOLastTime.html |title=The Last Time |publisher=Timeisonourside.com |accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref> [[sitar]] on \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\"; organ on \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\"; [[marimba]] on \"[[Under My Thumb]]\", \"[[Out of Time (The Rolling Stones song)|Out of Time]]\" and \"[[Yesterday's Papers]]\"; [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] on \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" and \"All Sold Out\"; saxophone on \"Child of the Moon\" and \"[[Citadel (song)|Citadel]]\"; [[kazoo]] on \"Cool, Calm and Collected\"; [[Appalachian dulcimer]] on \"I Am Waiting\" and \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", [[Mellotron]] on \"[[She's a Rainbow]]\", \"[[We Love You]]\", \"[[Stray Cat Blues]]\", \"[[2000 Light Years from Home]]\", and \"Citadel\"; and the [[autoharp]] on \"[[Ride On, Baby]]\" and (for his final recording as a Rolling Stone) on \"[[You Got the Silver]]\". He also played the oboe/soprano sax solo in \"[[Dandelion]]\".\n\nJones also played harmonica on many of the Rolling Stones' early songs. Examples of Jones' playing are on \"[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]\", \"[[Stoned (The Rolling Stones song)|Stoned]]\" (1963), \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" (1964), \"[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]\", \"Now I've Got a Witness\" (1964), \"Good Times, Bad Times\" (1964), \"[[2120 South Michigan Avenue]]\" (1964) (from the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Five By Five''), \"The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man\", \"One More Try\" (1965), \"High and Dry\" and \"[[Goin' Home (The Rolling Stones song)|Goin' Home]]\" (1966), \"Who's Driving Your Plane?\" (1966), \"Cool Calm and Collected\", \"Who's Been Sleeping Here\" (1967), and \"[[Dear Doctor (song)|Dear Doctor]]\" and \"Prodigal Son\" (1968).\n\nIn the early years, Jones often served as a backing [[vocalist]]. Notable examples are \"[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]\", \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"I Just Wanna Make Love to You\", \"[[Walking the Dog]]\", \"[[Money (That's What I Want)|Money]]\", \"I'm Alright\", \"[[You Better Move On (song)|You Better Move On]]\" and \"[[It's All Over Now]]\". He contributed backing vocals as late as 1968 on \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\". He is also responsible for the whistling on \"Walking the Dog\".\n\nRichards maintains that what he calls \"guitar weaving\"<ref>[http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view Rolling Stones' Guitar Weaving (Podcast)-Q107 Toronto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021141144/http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view |date=21 October 2013}}</ref> emerged from this period, from listening to [[Jimmy Reed]] albums: \"We listened to the teamwork, trying to work out what was going on in those records; how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five\".<ref>Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood 2003. p. 39</ref> Jones' and Richards' guitars became a signature of the sound of the Rolling Stones, with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles.\n\n===Estrangement from bandmates===\n[[File:MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Michael Cooper (photographer)|Michael Cooper]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], Shepard Sherbell, Jones and [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] (Amsterdam, 1967)]]\nOldham's arrival as manager marked the beginning of Jones' slow [[wikt:estrangement|estrangement]]. Oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers' writing their own songs, as exemplified by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], and that playing [[cover version|covers]] would not sustain a band in the limelight for long. Further, he wanted to make Jagger's charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances. Jones saw his influence over the Stones' direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred; more [[Jagger/Richards]] originals developed, and Oldham increased his own managerial control, displacing Jones from yet another role.<ref name=\"wymanp76\">Wyman 2002. p. 76.</ref>\n\nAccording to Oldham in his book ''Stoned'', Jones was an outsider from the beginning.<ref>Andrew Loog Oldham, ''Stoned'' (St. Martin's Press, 2005), p. 210 \u2013 300.</ref> When the first [[concert tour|tour]]s were arranged in 1963, he travelled separately from the band, stayed at different hotels, and demanded extra pay. According to Oldham, Jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away. He \"resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle, and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day. None of us were looking forward to Brian totally cracking up\".<ref>Oldham 2005. p. 210.</ref> The toll from days on the road, the money and fame, and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in Jones' overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs. These excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and, according to Oldham, Jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times.\n\nIn March 1967, [[Anita Pallenberg]], Jones' girlfriend of two years, left him for Richards when Jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to [[Morocco]],<ref>''Life'', pp. 198\u2013199</ref> further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Richards. As tensions and Jones' [[substance abuse]] increased, his musical contributions became sporadic. He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play, and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions. In [[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]]'s promotional film for ''[[We Love You#Promotional film|We Love You]]'', made in July 1967, he appears extremely groggy and disoriented.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=161}}\n\nJones was arrested for [[drug possession]] on 10 May 1967, shortly after the \"Redlands\" incident at Richards' Sussex home. Authorities found [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]] in his flat. He confessed to marijuana use, but claimed he did not use hard drugs.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=154}}\n\nIn June 1967, he attended the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. There he met [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], and went on stage to introduce the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] who were not yet well known in the [[United States]].\n\nHostility grew between Jones, Jagger, and Richards, alienating Jones further from the group.<ref>Stanley Booth, ''The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones'' (Canongate Books, 2012), p. 107.</ref> Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing, Wyman, Richards, and Watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult.<ref>Richards and Fox, ''Life'', pp. 271\u2013272</ref> By most accounts, Jones' attitude changed frequently; he was one minute caring and generous, the next making an effort to anger everyone. As Wyman observed in ''Stone Alone'': \"There were at least two sides to Brian's personality. One Brian was introverted, shy, sensitive, deep-thinking. The other was a preening peacock, gregarious, artistic, desperately needing assurance from his peers.\"<ref>Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 83</ref> \"He pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond\".<ref>Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 76</ref>\n\nJones' last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in spring and summer of 1968, when the Stones produced \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\" and the ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' album. He can be seen in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (1968 film)|One Plus One]]'' playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards, although Jones is neglected in the music-making. The film chronicles the making of \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\".\n\nWhere once Jones played multiple instruments on many tracks, he now played only minor roles on a few pieces. Jones' last formal appearance was in the December 1968 ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'', a part-concert, part circus-act film organised by the band. It went unreleased for more than 25 years because Jagger was unhappy with the band's performance compared to others in the film such as [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[John Lennon]], [[the Who]], and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]].<ref name=\"rnrcircus\">{{cite video |people=The Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend | title=Rock and Roll Circus |medium=commentary to the 2004 DVD release |publisher=ABKCO Films |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of Jones' time with the Rolling Stones was near, and [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Pete Townshend]] of the Who thought it would be Jones' last live musical performance.<ref name=\"rnrcircus\"/>\n\n===Legal troubles and departure from the Rolling Stones===\nJones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968, for possession of [[cannabis]], which he said had been left by previous tenants of the flat. Owing to his being on [[probation]], he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty. The jury found him guilty, but the judge had sympathy for Jones; instead of jailing him, he fined him \u00a350 ({{Inflation|UK|50|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) plus \u00a3105 in costs ({{Inflation|UK|105|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn |UK |df=y}}) and told him: \"For goodness sake, don't get into trouble again or it really ''will'' be serious\".<ref name=\"wymanp311\">Wyman 2002. p. 311</ref>\n\nJones' legal troubles, estrangement from his bandmates, substance abuse, and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band. The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the US in 1969, for the first time in three years, but Jones was not in a fit condition to tour, and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a US [[work visa]]. In addition, Jones' attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic; and when he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or, when he did, his bandmates would switch off his amplifier, leaving Richards to play nearly all the guitars. According to author Gary Herman, Jones was \"literally incapable of making music; when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding\".<ref>Gary Herman, ''Rock 'N' Roll Babylon'' (Norfolk: Fakenham Press, 1982), p. 44.</ref>\n\nThis behaviour was problematic during the ''Their Satanic Majesties Request'' and ''Beggar's Banquet'' sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording ''Let It Bleed''. In March 1969, Jones borrowed the group's [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] and went shopping in Pimlico Road. After the parked car was towed away by police, Jones hired a chauffeur-driven car to get home.<ref name=\"wymanp323\">Wyman 2002. p. 323</ref> In May 1969, Jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name.<ref name=\"wymanp323\" /> From this point, he was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the band's music.<ref name=\"wymanp323\" /> By May, he had made two contributions to the work in progress: [[autoharp]] on \"[[You Got the Silver]]\" and percussion on \"[[Midnight Rambler]]\". Jagger informed Jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session. Looking frail, he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a Rolling Stone took place on 21 May 1969, first at [[St. Katherine Docks]], [[Tower Bridge]], London and then at [[Ethan Russell]]'s photographic studio in [[South Kensington]]. The photos would appear on the album ''[[Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol.2)]]'' in September 1969.<ref>\"Wyman\".\"Rolling with the Stones\" p.\"344\"</ref>\n\nThe Stones decided that following the release of the ''Let it Bleed'' album (scheduled for a July 1969 release in the US) they would start a tour of North America in November 1969. However, the Stones' management was informed that Jones would not receive a work permit, owing to his drug convictions. At the suggestion of Stewart, the Stones decided to add a new guitarist; on 8 June 1969, Jones was visited by Jagger, Richards and Watts, and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him.<ref name=\"wymanp324-326\">Wyman 2002. p. 324-326</ref>\n\nTo the public it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily; the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave, it was his choice how to break it to the public. Jones released a statement on 9 June 1969, announcing his departure. In this statement he said, among other things, that, \"I no longer see eye-to-eye with the others over the discs we are cutting\".<ref name=\"wymanp326\">Wyman 2002. p. 326</ref> He was replaced by the 20-year-old guitarist [[Mick Taylor]], formerly of [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]].\n\nDuring the period of his decreasing involvement in the band, Jones was living at [[Cotchford Farm]] in [[East Sussex]], the residence formerly owned by ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' author [[A. A. Milne]],<ref name=\"teleg2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/9258085/The-rock-n-roll-house-at-Pooh-corner.html |title=The rock 'n' roll house at Pooh corner |first=Christopher |last=Middleton| date=12 May 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> which Jones had purchased in November 1968. Alexis Korner, who visited in late June, noted that Jones seemed \"happier than he had ever been\".<ref name=\"wymanp329\">Wyman 2002, p. 329</ref> Jones is known to have contacted Korner, Stewart, [[John Lennon]], [[Mitch Mitchell]],[[Alan Price]], and [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]] about intentions to put together another band. Jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death, including \"Has Anybody Seen My Baby?\" and \"Chow Time\".<ref name=\"aeppli.ch\">{{cite web |url=http://aeppli.ch/TUG08/CDJonesUp.pdf |title=The Pipes of Pan |publisher=Aeppli.ch |accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Later life and death===\n[[File:Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones - geograph.org.uk - 670236.jpg|thumb|right|Jones' grave in Cheltenham Cemetery]]\nAt around midnight on the night of 2\u20133 July 1969, Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm. His [[Swedish people|Swedish]] girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, was convinced he was alive when he was taken out of the pool, insisting he still had a pulse. However, by the time the doctors arrived, it was too late and he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, at the age of 27. The coroner's report stated \"[[death by misadventure]]\", and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by past drug and alcohol abuse.<ref name=\"wymanp329\"/> However, during the [[autopsy]] doctors found that the cause of Jones' death was accidental drowning.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Staff|first=Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/08/archive-brian-jones-death-1969|title=From the archive, 8 July 1969: Jones drowned while 'drunk and drugged'|date=2011-07-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nUpon Jones' death, the Who's Pete Townshend wrote a poem titled \"A Normal Day for Brian, A Man Who Died Every Day\" (printed in ''[[The Times]]''), Jimi Hendrix dedicated a song to him on US television, and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]] published a poem titled \"Ode to L.A.

The band decided to dedicate the concert (which had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present their new guitarist, Mick Taylor) to Jones. Before the Stones' set, Jagger read excerpts from \"[[Adonais]]\", a poem by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] about the death of his friend [[John Keats]], and [[stagehand]]s released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute. The band opened with a [[Johnny Winter]] song that was one of Jones' favourites, \"I'm Yours and I'm Hers\".\n\nJones was reportedly buried {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} deep in Cheltenham Cemetery, to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters.

The journalist has also uncovered unseen police files held at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]. According to Trevor Hobley, chairman of the Brian Jones Fan Club, a neighbour was leaving for work on the morning of Jones' death and saw a large [[bonfire]] on Jones' estate in which documentation was being burned.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> In 2010, following the review, Sussex Police stated it would not be reopening the case. It asserted that \"this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Police's Crime Policy and Review Branch, but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroner's original verdict of 'death by misadventure' was incorrect.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Death of Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones case will not reopen despite new evidence which suggests he was murdered|newspaper=The Mail on Sunday|date= 31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Songwriting credits==\nUnsure and insecure as a composer, Jones was not a prolific songwriter. The 30-second \"[[Rice Krispies]]\" [[advertising jingle|jingle]] for [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], co-written with the [[J. Walter Thompson]] advertising agency in 1963 and performed by The Rolling Stones incognito, was credited to Jones; this did not sit well with the rest of the band, who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally.<ref name=\"wymanp90\">Wyman 2002. p. 90.</ref> Jones was also included in the \"[[Nanker Phelge|Nanker/Phelge]]\" songwriting credit, a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and Andrew Oldham.\n\nAccording to Oldham, the main reason for Jones' not writing songs was that Jones, being a blues purist, did not love simple pop music enough. Oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and [[Gene Pitney]] after \"becoming bored senseless by Jones' bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion\", but after two days of sessions \"the results remain best to be unheard, even by Rolling Stones' completists\".<ref>Oldham (2005). p. 288.</ref> In 1995, Mick Jagger told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine that Jones had been jealous of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team, and added: \"To be honest, Brian had no talent for writing songs. None. I've never known a guy with less talent for songwriting.\"<ref name=\"jaggerremembers\" />\n\nFaithfull reported that Jones wrote an early version of the melody for \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" and presented it to the group. [[Victor Bockris]] reported that Richards and Jones worked out the final melody in the studio.<ref>Bockris, Keith Richards, Dutch translation, 1993, p.93-94</ref> Additionally, Jones is credited (along with Richards) for the instrumental piece \"Hear It\". However, in 1966, Jones composed, produced, and played on the soundtrack to ''[[Mord und Totschlag]]'' (English title: ''A Degree Of Murder''), an avant-garde [[Germany|German]] film with Anita Pallenberg, adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack.\n\nThe only known released Jones song is \"(Thank You) For Being There\", which reportedly is a poem by Jones put to music by [[Carla Olson]]. It appeared on the 1990 album ''True Voices'' as performed by [[Natural Acoustic Band#Krysia Kocjan .28Krysia Kristianne.29|Krysia Kristianne]] and [[Robin Williamson]].\n\n==Other contributions==\n[[File:Brian Jones guitar, HRC Sacramento.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Jones' [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox Mark VI]], retired for display]]\nIn summer 1968, Jones recorded the Morocco-based ensemble, the [[Master Musicians of Joujouka]] ([[Jajouka]]), which was later used by the band; the recording was released in 1971 as ''[[Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka]]''. Jagger and Richards visited [[Jajouka]] in 1989 after recording \"Continental Drift\" for the Rolling Stones album ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' with [[The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar]] in [[Tangier]]. An homage to Jones entitled \"Brian Jones Joujouka very Stoned\", painted by [[Mohamed Hamri]], who had brought Jones to Jajouka in 1967, appeared on the cover of ''[[Joujouka Black Eyes]]'' by the Master Musicians of Joujouka in 1995.\n\n''Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Jajouka'' was rereleased in co-operation with [[Bachir Attar]] and [[Philip Glass]] in 1995.

The coincidence of their deaths at that age has been referred to in popular culture as the \"[[27 Club]]\". When Alastair Johns, who owned Cotchford Farm for over 40 years after Jones' death, refurbished the pool, he sold the original tiles to Jones' fans for \u00a3100 each, which paid for half of the work.<ref name=\"teleg2012\"/> Johns noted that Cotchford Farm remained for decades an attraction for Jones' fans.\n\nThe [[Psychic TV]] song \"Godstar\" is about Jones' death, as are [[Robyn Hitchcock]]'s \"Trash\", [[The Drovers]]' \"She's as Pretty as Brian Jones Was\", [[Jeff Dahl]]'s \"Mick and Keith killed Brian\", [[Ted Nugent]]'s \"Death by Misadventure\", and [[Salmonblaster]]'s \"Brian Jones\".

Two additional characters were added; a younger brother named Larry ([[Warren Berlinger]]), and Frank ([[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]]), the husband of Joey's older sister Betty.

The firm is headed by J.P. Willoughby ([[John Griggs (actor)|John Griggs]]), Joey's demanding boss. Willoughby's secretary, Barbara Simpson (Nancy Hadley) has an unrequited crush on a mostly oblivious Joey.

In the second incarnation, Joey Barnes is the host of a New York City talk/variety television show. [[Abby Dalton]] joined the cast as Joey's new wife Ellie (whom Joey called \"Texas\" because she hailed from [[Texas]]) and the two live at the Carlton Arms, a posh [[Manhattan]] apartment building. Towards the end of season two, Ellie discovers she is pregnant with the couple's first child. Their son, Joey Barnes, Jr. (played by Dalton's real son Matthew David Smith), was born in the season-two finale \"The Baby Cometh\". Also joining the cast was [[Guy Marks]], who portrayed Freddie, Joey's manager. Marks left the series after 19 episodes and [[Corbett Monica]] joined the cast as Larry Corbett, Joey's head writer. The supporting cast also includes [[Mary Treen]] as Hilda, the Barnes' maid and baby nurse, with whom Joey frequently trades insults.

Although the second incarnation of the series was seemingly unrelated to the first incarnation, the series featured Danny Thomas in two season-three episodes: \"Danny Gives Joey Advice\" and \"Andy Williams Visits Joey\".

In the second incarnation, Joey Barnes is the host of a New York City talk/variety television show. [[Abby Dalton]] joined the cast as Joey's new wife Ellie (whom Joey called \"Texas\" because she hailed from [[Texas]]) and the two live at the Carlton Arms, a posh [[Manhattan]] apartment building. Towards the end of season two, Ellie discovers she is pregnant with the couple's first child. Their son, Joey Barnes, Jr. (played by Dalton's real son Matthew David Smith), was born in the season-two finale \"The Baby Cometh\". Also joining the cast was [[Guy Marks]], who portrayed Freddie, Joey's manager. Marks left the series after 19 episodes and [[Corbett Monica]] joined the cast as Larry Corbett, Joey's head writer. The supporting cast also includes [[Mary Treen]] as Hilda, the Barnes' maid and baby nurse, with whom Joey frequently trades insults.

As such, various celebrities (who typically appeared as themselves) who were guests on Joey Barnes' talk show appeared throughout the series' run. Although the second incarnation of the series was seemingly unrelated to the first incarnation, the series featured Danny Thomas in two season-three episodes: \"Danny Gives Joey Advice\" and \"Andy Williams Visits Joey\".

His father was a luthier who also played guitar, as well his brother. \nHe began messing around with the guitar at the age of 5, played on and off for a few years, but did not start to actually practice until he was around 14-15. His first guitar was a 12 fret cheap nylon string that he inherited from his brother. His first electric guitar was a black [[Squier]] Stratocaster included in a guitar pack. \nHe has said that the moment he began taking the guitar seriously was when his cousins introduced him to both [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]] and [[Michael Angelo Batio]]. Before this, he primarily focused on playing like [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Joe Satriani]]. During his teen years, he was able to teach himself all of the ''[[Best of the Beast]]'' by [[Iron Maiden]]. Being an all-time fan of Iron Maiden, it was a great honour when Cry Venom were asked to cover \"Aces High\" on track 10 on Kerrang magazines Maiden Heaven Volume 2 - An All-Star Tribute To Iron Maiden, released in June 2016, accompanying issue 1623 of the magazine.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kerrang Iron Maiden Tribute CD |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Iron_Maiden_tribute_albums |website=Wikipedia Iron Maiden Tribute CD |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>  He attended a music school in England, but has never stated which one, but has credited it with helping him with practice schedules.\n\n===Falling in Reverse (2008\u20132015)===\n{{main|Falling in Reverse}}\nVincent joined [[Falling in Reverse]] in 2008 as a founding member of the band.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

The siege was part of a three-pronged attack on the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] [[Impi]]s of king [[Cetshwayo]] at [[Ulundi]]. After an incursion as far as [[Eshowe]] (then also known as '''Fort Ekowe''' or '''kwaMondi'''){{sfn|Laband|2009|pp=81, 366}} Colonel [[Charles Pearson (soldier)|Charles Pearson]] was besieged there for two months by the Zulus.\n\n==Prelude: Inyezane==\n\nNo.1 Column of the British invasion force, under Colonel Charles Pearson, had been ordered to establish an advanced base at Eshowe before continuing the advance upon [[Ulundi]]. The force crossed the [[Tugela River]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] into [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] on 12 January 1879. The advance was unopposed until 22 January, when a Zulu force attempted to bar their way. The British were camped about {{cvt|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the [[Inyezane River]], which they had crossed the previous day, beneath a steep ridge with three spurs leading down towards the river and surrounded by scrub. A prominent knoll sat about halfway and there was a small [[kraal]] near the left of the crest.\n\nShortly after 08:00 a small number of Zulus appeared near the knoll on the ridge and a company of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] (NNC), under Lieutenant Hart, were sent up the spur after them. While this company gave chase a mass of Zulus appeared over the crest of the ridge and began pouring downwards. These men were the left \"horn\" of a 6,000 strong force, dispatched at the same time as the army that engaged the British at Isandlwana, who were preparing just over the crest, to attack the British camp. This left horn had been prompted into a premature attack by the advance of Lieutenant Hart's company and in the face of this advance the NNC fled, leaving their European officers and NCOs to make a fruitless stand before being swept aside. As soon as Hart and his men began firing, the camp prepared for defence, forming a hasty firing line. A naval company and two companies of [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]] with a [[Gatling gun]] and several [[RML 7-pounder Mountain Gun|7-pounders]] moved up to the knoll, opening up across the advancing Zulu column. When the Zulus emerged from scrub and began their assault on the camp, they were subjected to massed fire from the flank and front; the Zulus wavered and then withdrew the way they had come.\n\nWhile the left horn was being repulsed, the rest of the Zulu [[impi]] appeared over the crest. The kraal was taken and switching their guns to focus on it, the British force that had attacked the flank of the left horn advanced up the slope and captured the kraal. This position allowed the British to move the Gatling gun onto the crest where its rapid fire soon drove the Zulus off the centre and left end of the ridge, as the British mounted troops came up the right-hand spur to complete the action. The counter-attack resulted in 10 British killed and 16 wounded. The Zulu impi withdrew with 350 killed.\n\n==Arrival at Eshowe==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Crossingtugela.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Troops crossing the Tugela River.]] -->\nPearson continued his march unhindered and the following day reached the mission fort near Eshowe at {{coord|28|54|28.7|S|31|27|41|E|type:landmark|name=Fort Nongqwayi}}, {{cvt|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. Eshowe consisted of a deserted church, school and the house of a [[Norway|Norwegian]] missionary. Low hills surrounded it about a quarter of a mile away to the north, east and west but to the south the Indian Ocean could be seen. Pearson sent a group of empty wagons with escorts to collect fresh supplies from the Lower Drift, while the rest of his force began to dig in. The next day, 24 January, bore a disturbing message for Pearson that Colonel [[Anthony Durnford]]'s No. 2 Column had been wiped out in the Middle Drift, leaving the Lower Drift behind Eshowe in grave danger. If the Zulus took the lower drift, Eshowe would be cut off and there would be nothing between the Zulu Army and Natal.\n\nTwo days later, [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] contacted Pearson. Without giving any details of the disaster at the  [[Battle of Isandlwana]] he informed him that all orders were cancelled and that he was to take such as action as he thought fit to preserve his column, including withdrawal from Eshowe if necessary. If he withdrew, he was to hold the bridgehead at the Lower Drift but he might be attacked by the whole Zulu Army. Pearson had no precise information on the whereabouts of the Zulu and although his defences around the mission would soon be complete, it was not an ideal position to defend. His force had plenty of ammunition but other supplies were insufficient and the consensus of his subordinates was to pull back to the Lower Drift. The decision to stay was settled on when news arrived of the return of the supply wagons, with five further companies as reinforcement from the Lower Drift.\n\n==Siege==\n\nThe fort enclosing the mission was roughly rectangular, {{cvt|200|\u00d7|50|yd|m|abbr=on}}, with loopholed walls {{cvt|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, and was surrounded by a broad ditch in which sharpened sticks were embedded. A second line of defence, should the outer rampart fall, was formed by [[laager]]ing the wagons inside the walls. A horse and cattle kraal was constructed, as was an [[abattis]]; a field of fire was cleared all round out to {{cvt|800|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The garrison numbered 1,300 soldiers and sailors, plus 400 wagoners.\n\nThe appearance of large bodies of Zulu on the surrounding hills on 2 February, although they retreated under shelling from the 7-pounders, compelled Pearson to request reinforcements. A week later, he learned for the first time the full extent of the centre column's defeat at Isandlwana and was told that there could be no reinforcement. Pearson considered withdrawing part of his garrison, if Chelmsford agreed but receiving no response and no further runners, it became clear that Eshowe had been cut off. The garrison would run out of provisions by the beginning of April.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=92}}\n\nFebruary passed with no Zulu attack, save for sniping attacks and skirmishes between patrols. The beginning of March led Pearson to attack a kraal 7 miles away, to keep the soldiers from idling. The next day a [[heliostat]] was spotted signalling from [[Fort Tenedos]] and a makeshift apparatus allowed Eshowe to reply. The garrison learnt that a relief force would depart the Lower Drift on 13 March and that they were to advance to the Inyezane to meet it. This was cheering news for the garrison, with rations running low and sickness having killed 20 men. A few days later another message advised a delay in the arrival of the relief column until 1 April.\n\n==Relief Column==\n\n{{main|Battle of Gingindlovu}}\n\n[[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] led the relief column, consisting of 3,390 Europeans and 2,280 Africans to [[Eshowe]]. The artillery with the column consisted of two [[RML 9-pounder 8 and 6 cwt guns|9-pounder]] guns, four 24-pounder [[Congreve rocket]]s tubes and two [[Gatling gun]]s. The progress was slow, as in addition to taking a roundabout route to avoid ambush, the rivers they had to traverse were swollen by heavy rains. By the evening of 1 April, Pearson's observers at Eshowe could see the relief column laagering on the south bank of the Inyezane. The laager was sited on a 300-foot ridge running roughly west\u2013east. West of the ridge, the ground dipped, only to rise again to the 470-foot [[Umisi Hill]]. The ground sloped away in all directions, allowing a good field of fire. A trench surrounded a waist high wall of earth, which enclosed 120 wagons formed a square with sides of 130 yards in length. Here the relief column fought the Battle of Gingindlovu, a British victory, before continuing on to Eshowe.\n\n==Eshowe relieved==\n\nOn 3 April, the relief column entered Eshowe, led by the pipers of the [[91st Highlanders]]. The two-month siege had been lifted. Chelmsford concluded that Eshowe did not need to be retained, and the laboriously constructed defences were demolished. Bivouacking on the first night after their departure from it on 6 April, Pearson's men could see that the Zulus had set Eshowe alight.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Barthorp|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Barthorp|title=The Zulu War: Isandhlwana to Ulundi|year=2002|publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|isbn=0-304-36270-0}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Brookes|first1=Edgar H|authorlink=|last2=Webb |first2=Colin de B. |title=A History of Natal|publisher=[[University of Natal Press]]|year=1965|location=[[Brooklyn]]|isbn=0-86980-579-7}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances E.|first2=Edward |last2=Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and its Origin|location=London|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich}}\n* {{cite news|last=David|first=Saul|author-link=Saul David|title=The Forgotten Battles of the Zulu War|newspaper=[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History Magazine]]|volume=10|issue=2|pages=26\u201333|date=February 2009|url = }}\n* {{cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

The siege was part of a three-pronged attack on the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] [[Impi]]s of king [[Cetshwayo]] at [[Ulundi]]. After an incursion as far as [[Eshowe]] (then also known as '''Fort Ekowe''' or '''kwaMondi'''){{sfn|Laband|2009|pp=81, 366}} Colonel [[Charles Pearson (soldier)|Charles Pearson]] was besieged there for two months by the Zulus.\n\n==Prelude: Inyezane==\n\nNo.1 Column of the British invasion force, under Colonel Charles Pearson, had been ordered to establish an advanced base at Eshowe before continuing the advance upon [[Ulundi]]. The force crossed the [[Tugela River]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] into [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] on 12 January 1879. The advance was unopposed until 22 January, when a Zulu force attempted to bar their way. The British were camped about {{cvt|4|mi\\km|abbr=on}} south of the [[Inyezane River]], which they had crossed the previous day, beneath a steep ridge with three spurs leading down towards the river and surrounded by scrub. A prominent knoll sat about halfway and there was a small [[kraal]] near the left of the crest.\n\nShortly after 08:00 a small number of Zulus appeared near the knoll on the ridge and a company of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] (NNC), under Lieutenant Hart, were sent up the spur after them. While this company gave chase a mass of Zulus appeared over the crest of the ridge and began pouring downwards. These men were the left \"horn\" of a 6,000 strong force, dispatched at the same time as the army that engaged the British at Isandlwana, who were preparing just over the crest, to attack the British camp. This left horn had been prompted into a premature attack by the advance of Lieutenant Hart's company and in the face of this advance the NNC fled, leaving their European officers and NCOs to make a fruitless stand before being swept aside. As soon as Hart and his men began firing, the camp prepared for defence, forming a hasty firing line. A naval company and two companies of [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]] with a [[Gatling gun]] and several [[RML 7-pounder Mountain Gun|7-pounders]] moved up to the knoll, opening up across the advancing Zulu column. When the Zulus emerged from scrub and began their assault on the camp, they were subjected to massed fire from the flank and front; the Zulus wavered and then withdrew the way they had come.\n\nWhile the left horn was being repulsed, the rest of the Zulu [[impi]] appeared over the crest. The kraal was taken and switching their guns to focus on it, the British force that had attacked the flank of the left horn advanced up the slope and captured the kraal. This position allowed the British to move the Gatling gun onto the crest where its rapid fire soon drove the Zulus off the centre and left end of the ridge, as the British mounted troops came up the right-hand spur to complete the action. The counter-attack resulted in 10 British killed and 16 wounded.

It was designed by [[Christopher Upward]] and was for a time being popularized by the [[Simplified Spelling Society]]. The resulting words are 8\u201315% shorter than standard spellings. The name ''Cut Spelling'' was coined by psychologist [[Valerie Yule]].<ref>[http://grammar.about.com/od/c/g/cutspellingterm.htm About.com]</ref>{{not in ref|date=September 2017}}\n\nUnlike some other proposed reforms, Cut Spelling does not attempt to make English spelling phonemic, but merely attempts to remove many of the unneeded difficulties of the current spelling. Cut Spelling differs from \"traditional orthography\" mainly in removing letters from words and makes relatively few substitutions of letters compared with other proposed reforms. According to its designers, this allows readers accustomed to traditional orthography to get used to Cut Spelling fairly quickly and easily, while still giving learners of the language a much-simplified and more systematic spelling system.\n\n==Rules==\nCut Spelling uses '''three main substitution rules''' to convert traditional spellings into \"cut spellings\":\n\n# Letters irrelevant to pronunciation. This rule deletes most silent letters, except when these letters (such as \"[[silent e|magic e]]\") help indicate pronunciation. Omitting or including the wrong silent letters are common errors. Examples: ''peace'' \u2192 ''pece'', ''except'' \u2192 ''exept'', ''plaque'' \u2192 ''plaq'', ''blood'' \u2192 ''blod'', ''pitch'' \u2192 ''pich''.\n# Cutting [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] vowels. English unstressed syllables are usually pronounced with the vowel [[schwa]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, which has no standard spelling, but can be represented by any vowel letter. Writing the wrong letter in these syllables is a common error, for example, ''{{sic|sepe|rate|hide=y}}'' for ''separate''. Cut Spelling eliminates these vowel letters completely before approximants ({{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}) and nasals ({{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, and {{IPA|/\u014b/}}). In addition, some vowel letters are dropped in suffixes, reducing the confusion between ''-able'' and ''-ible''. Examples: ''symbol'' \u2192 ''symbl'', ''victim'' \u2192 ''victm'', ''lemon'' \u2192 ''lemn'', ''glamour/glamor'' \u2192 ''glamr'', ''permanent'' \u2192 ''permnnt'', ''waited'' \u2192 ''waitd'', ''churches'' \u2192 ''churchs'', ''warmest'' \u2192 ''warmst'', ''edible'' \u2192 ''edbl''.\n# Simplifying doubled consonants. This rule helps with another of the most common spelling errors: failing to double letters (''accommodate'' and ''committee'' are often misspelled) or introducing erroneously doubled letters. Cut Spelling does not eliminate all doubled letters: in some words (especially two-syllable words) the doubled consonant letter is needed to differentiate from another differently pronounced word (e.g., ''holly'' and ''holy''). Examples: ''innate'' \u2192 ''inate'', ''necessary'' \u2192 ''{{not a typo|necesary}}'', ''spell'' \u2192 ''spel''.\n\n==Substitution rules==\nThe Cut Spelling system also uses three substitution rules:\n# The [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''gh'' and ''ph'' become ''f'' when pronounced {{IPA|/f/}}. Examples: ''draught'' \u2192 ''draft'', ''sulphur'' \u2192 ''sulfr'', ''photograph'' \u2192 ''fotograf''.\n# The letter ''g'' is changed to ''j'' when pronounced {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} or {{IPA|/\u0292/}}. Examples: ''judge'' \u2192 ''juj'', ''rouge'' \u2192 ''ruje''.\n# The combinations ''ig'' and ''igh'' are changed to ''y'' when pronounced {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}. Examples: ''flight'' \u2192 ''flyt'', ''sign'' \u2192 ''syn''.\n\n''The Cut Spelling Handbook'' also lists optional additional rules such as replacing ''ch'' with ''k'' when it makes the {{IPA|/k/}} sound, respelling as ''y'' unusual patterns that make the {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} [[diphthong]], as well as replacing ''-tion'', ''-cian'', ''-sion'', ''-ssion'', etc. with ''-shn''.\n\n==Examples ==\n\n<!-- Do not correct the misspellings in the blockquote.
