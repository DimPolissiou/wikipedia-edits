In 1202, Philip II Augustus re-conquered the city, and after him, several French kings were attracted by the Lyons forest and the good hunting grounds.\n\nFrom 1359 to 1398, the castellan domain of Lyons was part of [[Blanche d'\u00c9vreux|Blanche de Navarre]]'s [[dower]] after she became the widow of King [[Philip VI of France]].

The 293-lap race, the 100th NASCAR Cup Series event at Darlington Raceway, was won by [[PPI Motorsports]] driver [[Ricky Craven]] after he started from the 31st position. [[Kurt Busch]] of the [[Roush Fenway Racing|Roush Racing]] squad finished in second place and [[Dave Blaney]] third for the [[Jasper Motorsports]] team.\n\n[[Elliott Sadler]] won the pole position by recording the fastest lap in qualifying.

On lap 197, [[Jeff Gordon]] led at a [[Rolling start|rolling restart]] after a [[Racing flags#Yellow flag|yellow caution flag]], ahead of Sadler. Busch passed Gordon on the 269th lap but later had a [[power steering]] failure, allowing Craven to gradually lower his lead. By lap 291, Craven drew close enough to challenge Busch; after two attempts at a pass failed, he overtook Busch on the final lap, and won by two-thousands of a second, tied for the closest finish in series history.\n\nIt was Craven's second win of his career.

It was held on March 16, 2003, before a crowd of 55,000, in [[Darlington, South Carolina]], at [[Darlington Raceway]]. The 293-lap race, the 100th NASCAR Cup Series event at Darlington Raceway, was won by [[PPI Motorsports]] driver [[Ricky Craven]] after he started from the 31st position. [[Kurt Busch]] of the [[Roush Fenway Racing|Roush Racing]] squad finished in second place and [[Dave Blaney]] third for the [[Jasper Motorsports]] team.\n\n[[Elliott Sadler]] won the pole position by recording the fastest lap in qualifying. He and [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] traded the lead for the first two laps. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] assumed the lead on lap 17 and went on to lead for 91 laps, more than any other driver. On lap 197, [[Jeff Gordon]] led at a [[Rolling start|rolling restart]] after a [[Racing flags#Yellow flag|yellow caution flag]], ahead of Sadler. Busch passed Gordon on the 269th lap but later had a [[power steering]] failure, allowing Craven to gradually lower his lead. By lap 291, Craven drew close enough to challenge Busch; after two attempts at a pass failed, he overtook Busch on the final lap, and won by two-thousands of a second, tied for the closest finish in series history.\n\nIt was Craven's second win of his career. The result advanced him from sixteenth to fifth in the [[List of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champions|Drivers' Championship]], 143 [[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|points]] behind [[Matt Kenseth]], whose eighth-place finished  maintained his championship lead over [[Tony Stewart]]. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] maintained its lead in the [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|Manufacturers' Championship]], five points ahead of [[Chevrolet]] in second.

It has a latitude and longitude of {{Coord|12|36|N|37|28|E}} with an elevation of 2133 meters above sea level. It is surrounded by the [[Gondar Zuria]] woreda. Gondar served as a strong Christian kingdom for many years. \n\nGondar previously served as the capital of both the Ethiopian Empire and the subsequent [[Begemder Province]]. The city holds the remains of several royal castles, including those in [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (the Royal Enclosure), for which Gondar has been called the \"Camelot of Africa\".<ref>http://bjtoursandtrekking.com/tours/index.htm Gondar World Heritage Site</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nUntil the 16th century, the [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic]] [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperors of Ethiopia]] usually had no fixed capital town, but instead lived in tents in temporary royal camps as they moved around their realms while their family, bodyguard and retinue devoured surplus crops and cut down nearby trees for firewood. One exception to this rule was [[Debre Berhan]], founded by [[Zara Yaqob]] in 1456; [[Tegulet]] in [[Shewa]] was also essentially the capital during the first century of Solomonic rule. Gondar was founded by Emperor [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]] around the year 1635, and grew as an agricultural and market town. There was a superstition at the time that the capital's name should begin with the letter 'G\u02b7a' (modern pronunciation 'G\u02b7e'; Gonder was originally spelt G\u02b7andar), which also contributed to [[Gorgora]]'s (founded as G\u02b7arg\u02b7ara) growth in the centuries after 1600. Tradition also states that a buffalo led the Emperor Fasilides to a pool beside the [[Angereb River|Angereb]], where an \"old and venerable hermit\" told the Emperor he would locate his capital there. Fasilides had the pool filled in and built his castle on that same site.<ref>Richard K.P. Pankhurst, ''History of Ethiopian Towns: From the Middle Ages to the Early Nineteenth Century'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), vol. 1 p. 117.</ref> The emperor also built a total of seven churches; the first two, Fit Mikael and Fit Abbo, were built to end local epidemics.{{what|date=January 2018}} The five emperors who followed him also built their palaces in the town. \n[[File:Fasilides Palace 02.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Fasil Ghebbi|Fasilides Castle]], founded by Emperor [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]]]]\n\n===16th century===\nBeginning with [[Emperor]] [[Menas of Ethiopia|Menas]] in 1559, the rulers of [[Ethiopia]] began spending the rainy season near [[Lake Tana]], often returning to the same location each year. These encampments, which flourished as cities for a short time, include [[Emfraz]], [[Ayba]], [[Gorgora]] and [[Dankaz]].\n\n=== 17th century ===\nIn 1668, as a result of a church council, the Emperor [[Yohannes I of Ethiopia|Yohannes I]] ruled that the inhabitants of Gondar were to be segregated by religion.  This caused the [[Muslim]]s to move into their own quarter, ''Islamge'' ({{lang-am|\u12a5\u1235\u120b\u121d\u130c}}, \"Islam place,\" or \"Islam country\") or ''Islam Bayt'' (\u12a5\u1235\u120b\u121d\u1264\u1275\"House of Islam,\" lit. \"Islam house\"), within two years. This quarter came to be known as [[Addis Alem, Shewa|Addis Alem]] (Amharic for \"New World\").<ref>Solomon Getamun, ''History of the City of Gondar'' (Africa World Press, 2005), p. 16</ref>\n\nDuring the seventeenth century, the city's population is estimated to have exceeded 60,000. Many of the buildings from this period survive, despite the turmoil of the eighteenth century. By the reign of [[Iyasu I|Iyasu the Great]], Gondar had acquired a sense of community identity; when the Emperor called upon the inhabitants to decamp and follow him on his campaign against the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] in [[Damot]] and [[Gojjam]], as had the court and subjects of earlier emperors, they refused.<ref>Getamun, ''City of Gondar'', p. 5</ref> Although Gondar was by any definition a city, it was not a melting pot of diverse traditions, nor Ethiopia's window to the larger world, according to Donald Levine. \"It served rather as an agent for the quickened development of the [[Amhara people|Amhara]]'s own culture. And thus it became a focus of national pride... not as a hotbed of alien custom and immorality, as they often regard [[Addis Ababa]] today, but as the most perfect embodiment of their traditional values.\"<ref>Donald N. Levine, ''Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopia Culture'' (Chicago: University Press, 1972), p. 42</ref> As Levine elaborates in a footnote, it was an [[orthogenetic]] pattern of development, as distinguished from an heterogenetic one.<ref>Levine, ''Wax and Gold'', p. 42 n. 42</ref>\n[[File:Gondar City.jpg|thumb|An overview of the medieval city buildings]]\n\n=== 19th century ===\nThe town served as Ethiopia's capital until [[Tewodros II]] moved the Imperial capital to [[Magdala, Ethiopia|Magadala]] upon being crowned Emperor in 1855;<ref>{{cite book|title=Ethiopia: The Unknown Land |author=Stuart Munro-Hay |year=2002 |page=69 |publisher=I.B.

Gondar and its surrounding countryside constitute the homeland of most [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]].\n\nThe modern city of Gondar is popular as a tourist destination for its many picturesque ruins in [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (the Royal Enclosure), from which the emperors once reigned. The most famous buildings in the city lie in the Royal Enclosure, which include [[Fasilides]]' castle, [[Iyasu I|Iyasu]]'s palace, [[Dawit III|Dawit]]'s Hall, a banqueting hall, stables, Empress [[Mentewab]]'s castle, a [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancellery]], library and three churches. Near the city lie [[Fasilides' Bath]], home to an annual ceremony where it is blessed and then opened for bathing; the [[Qusquam]] complex, built by Empress Mentewab; the eighteenth century [[Ras Mikael Sehul's Palace]] and the [[Debre Berhan Selassie Church]].\n\nDowntown Gondar shows the influence of the Italian occupation of the late 1930s.  The main piazza features shops, a cinema, and other public buildings in a simplified Italian [[Art Deco|Moderne]] style still distinctively of the period despite later changes and, frequently, neglect.  Villas and flats in the nearby quarter that once housed occupation officials and colonists are also of interest.\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is home to the [[University of Gondar]], which includes Ethiopia's main faculty of medicine.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Church of Debra Berhan Selassie 01.jpg|thumb|Debre Birhan Selassie Church in Gondar]]\nBased on the 2007 national census conducted by the [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]] of Ethiopia (CSA), Gondar had a total population of 207,044, of whom 98,120 were men and 108,924 women.

''G\u02b7ender'') is a city and separate [[Districts of Ethiopia|woreda]] in [[Ethiopia]]. Located in the [[Semien Gondar Zone]] of the [[Amhara Region]], Gondar is north of [[Tana Lake]] on the [[Lesser Angereb River]] and southwest of the [[Simien Mountains]]. It has a latitude and longitude of {{Coord|12|36|N|37|28|E}} with an elevation of 2133 meters above sea level. It is surrounded by the [[Gondar Zuria]] woreda. Gondar served as a strong Christian kingdom for many years. \n\nGondar previously served as the capital of both the Ethiopian Empire and the subsequent [[Begemder Province]]. The city holds the remains of several royal castles, including those in [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (the Royal Enclosure), for which Gondar has been called the \"Camelot of Africa\".<ref>http://bjtoursandtrekking.com/tours/index.htm Gondar World Heritage Site</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nUntil the 16th century, the [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic]] [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperors of Ethiopia]] usually had no fixed capital town, but instead lived in tents in temporary royal camps as they moved around their realms while their family, bodyguard and retinue devoured surplus crops and cut down nearby trees for firewood. One exception to this rule was [[Debre Berhan]], founded by [[Zara Yaqob]] in 1456; [[Tegulet]] in [[Shewa]] was also essentially the capital during the first century of Solomonic rule. Gondar was founded by Emperor [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]] around the year 1635, and grew as an agricultural and market town. There was a superstition at the time that the capital's name should begin with the letter 'G\u02b7a' (modern pronunciation 'G\u02b7e'; Gonder was originally spelt G\u02b7andar), which also contributed to [[Gorgora]]'s (founded as G\u02b7arg\u02b7ara) growth in the centuries after 1600. Tradition also states that a buffalo led the Emperor Fasilides to a pool beside the [[Angereb River|Angereb]], where an \"old and venerable hermit\" told the Emperor he would locate his capital there. Fasilides had the pool filled in and built his castle on that same site.<ref>Richard K.P. Pankhurst, ''History of Ethiopian Towns: From the Middle Ages to the Early Nineteenth Century'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), vol. 1 p. 117.</ref> The emperor also built a total of seven churches; the first two, Fit Mikael and Fit Abbo, were built to end local epidemics.{{what|date=January 2018}} The five emperors who followed him also built their palaces in the town. \n[[File:Fasilides Palace 02.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Fasil Ghebbi|Fasilides Castle]], founded by Emperor [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]]]]\n\n===16th century===\nBeginning with [[Emperor]] [[Menas of Ethiopia|Menas]] in 1559, the rulers of [[Ethiopia]] began spending the rainy season near [[Lake Tana]], often returning to the same location each year. These encampments, which flourished as cities for a short time, include [[Emfraz]], [[Ayba]], [[Gorgora]] and [[Dankaz]].\n\n=== 17th century ===\nIn 1668, as a result of a church council, the Emperor [[Yohannes I of Ethiopia|Yohannes I]] ruled that the inhabitants of Gondar were to be segregated by religion.  This caused the [[Muslim]]s to move into their own quarter, ''Islamge'' ({{lang-am|\u12a5\u1235\u120b\u121d\u130c}}, \"Islam place,\" or \"Islam country\") or ''Islam Bayt'' (\u12a5\u1235\u120b\u121d\u1264\u1275\"House of Islam,\" lit. \"Islam house\"), within two years. This quarter came to be known as [[Addis Alem, Shewa|Addis Alem]] (Amharic for \"New World\").<ref>Solomon Getamun, ''History of the City of Gondar'' (Africa World Press, 2005), p. 16</ref>\n\nDuring the seventeenth century, the city's population is estimated to have exceeded 60,000. Many of the buildings from this period survive, despite the turmoil of the eighteenth century. By the reign of [[Iyasu I|Iyasu the Great]], Gondar had acquired a sense of community identity; when the Emperor called upon the inhabitants to decamp and follow him on his campaign against the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] in [[Damot]] and [[Gojjam]], as had the court and subjects of earlier emperors, they refused.<ref>Getamun, ''City of Gondar'', p. 5</ref> Although Gondar was by any definition a city, it was not a melting pot of diverse traditions, nor Ethiopia's window to the larger world, according to Donald Levine. \"It served rather as an agent for the quickened development of the [[Amhara people|Amhara]]'s own culture. And thus it became a focus of national pride... not as a hotbed of alien custom and immorality, as they often regard [[Addis Ababa]] today, but as the most perfect embodiment of their traditional values.\"<ref>Donald N. Levine, ''Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopia Culture'' (Chicago: University Press, 1972), p. 42</ref> As Levine elaborates in a footnote, it was an [[orthogenetic]] pattern of development, as distinguished from an heterogenetic one.<ref>Levine, ''Wax and Gold'', p. 42 n. 42</ref>\n[[File:Gondar City.jpg|thumb|An overview of the medieval city buildings]]\n\n=== 19th century ===\nThe town served as Ethiopia's capital until [[Tewodros II]] moved the Imperial capital to [[Magdala, Ethiopia|Magadala]] upon being crowned Emperor in 1855;<ref>{{cite book|title=Ethiopia: The Unknown Land |author=Stuart Munro-Hay |year=2002 |page=69 |publisher=I.B.

Gondar and its surrounding countryside constitute the homeland of most [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]].\n\nThe modern city of Gondar is popular as a tourist destination for its many picturesque ruins in [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (the Royal Enclosure), from which the emperors once reigned. The most famous buildings in the city lie in the Royal Enclosure, which include [[Fasilides]]' castle, [[Iyasu I|Iyasu]]'s palace, [[Dawit III|Dawit]]'s Hall, a banqueting hall, stables, Empress [[Mentewab]]'s castle, a [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancellery]], library and three churches. Near the city lie [[Fasilides' Bath]], home to an annual ceremony where it is blessed and then opened for bathing; the [[Qusquam]] complex, built by Empress Mentewab; the eighteenth century [[Ras Mikael Sehul's Palace]] and the [[Debre Berhan Selassie Church]].\n\nDowntown Gondar shows the influence of the Italian occupation of the late 1930s.  The main piazza features shops, a cinema, and other public buildings in a simplified Italian [[Art Deco|Moderne]] style still distinctively of the period despite later changes and, frequently, neglect.  Villas and flats in the nearby quarter that once housed occupation officials and colonists are also of interest.\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is home to the [[University of Gondar]], which includes Ethiopia's main faculty of medicine.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Church of Debra Berhan Selassie 01.jpg|thumb|Debre Birhan Selassie Church in Gondar]]\nBased on the 2007 national census conducted by the [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]] of Ethiopia (CSA), Gondar had a total population of 207,044, of whom 98,120 were men and 108,924 women.

However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

There are five to six rabbis and six synagogues in the country.\n\nShi'a, Sunni, Russian Orthodox, and Jews are considered to be the country's \"traditional\" religious groups. Small congregations of [[Lutherans]], [[Roman Catholics]], [[Baptists]], [[Molokans]] ([[Old Believers]]), [[Seventh-day Adventists]], and [[Baha'i]]s have been present for over 100 years.\n\nIn the last decade, a number of religious groups considered foreign or \"nontraditional\" have established a presence, including \"[[Wahhabi]]\" and [[Salafist]] Muslims, [[Pentecostal]] and [[evangelical Christians]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and Hare Krishnas.\n\nThere were significant expatriate Christian and Muslim communities in Baku; authorities generally permitted these groups to worship freely.\n\n==Status of religious freedom==\n\n===Legal and policy framework===\nThe [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] provides that persons of all faiths may choose and practice their religion without restriction. Under the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] each person has the right to choose and change his or her own religious affiliation and belief (including atheism), to join or establish the religious group of his or her choice, and to practice his or her religion.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.president.az/azerbaijan/constitution|title=The Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=en.president.az|access-date=2017-10-09|quote=Article 48}}</ref> The law on religious freedom expressly prohibits the Government from interfering in the religious activities of any individual or group; however, there are exceptions, including cases where the activity of a religious group \"threatens public order and stability\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-qanun.az/alpidata/framework/data/7/f_7649.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009010101/http://www.e-qanun.az/alpidata/framework/data/7/f_7649.htm|title=Law on Freedom of Religious belief of the Republic of Azerbaijan|website=www.e-qanun.az|language=Azerbaijani|archive-date=2017-10-09|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-10-09}}</ref>\n\nA number of legal provisions enable the Government to regulate religious groups, The requirement for religious organizations in Azerbaijan to register through [[The State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan|SCWRA]] is according to the law accepted on June 21, 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scwra.gov.az/docs/150/4/|title=Decree On the establishment of the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=scwra.gov.az|language=Azerbaijani|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref> After Amendments to the Law on Freedom of Religion was adopted (8 May 2009), registration process was modified and already registered organizations had to register again through SCWRA this time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.meclis.gov.az/?/az/legislation/view/1428|title=Amendments and additions to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"On freedom of religion\" (08.05.2009)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.meclis.gov.az|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref> This process enables SCWRA to monitor the registration process; and if necessary, appeal to the courts to discontinue activities of religions groups. Registration is processed based on the location as mentioned in the application. When there is any change in the location of the organization, it should be reported to SCWRA and appropriate modifications should be made in registration process. After registering through SCWRA, religious groups obtain rights to function as a legal entity, have a bank account and rent a possession. The organizations, which were unsuccessful to register may be proclaimed as illegal and prohibited to function.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSince 2001 religious groups must register with the SCWRA. The SCWRA has broad powers over registration and the publication, import, and distribution of religious literature, and it may suspend the activities of religious groups who violate the law.\n\nSome religious groups experienced difficulties with disapproval of registration according to the ''[[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|International Religious Freedom Report]] 2015'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2015religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816033000/https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2015religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-08-16|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2015|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref> applications are denied according to the legislation. When all necessary documents organized appropriately are presented to the responsible entity, registration is accomplished. If the actions, objects or instructions of the religious groups oppose the [[Law of Azerbaijan|legislation of Azerbaijan]], or its charter and other documents are in contrast with the laws, or they contain false information, then registration of those groups can be refused by responsible authorities. Religious groups have rights to appeal the disapproval of registration to the courts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to the SCWRA, it registered 48 new groups from May 2006 through June 2007 and did not reject any applications. All of the newly registered groups were Muslim communities. The SCWRA reported 392 total registered [[Religious community|religious communities]] in the country.\n\nUnder the law on religious freedom, political parties cannot engage in religious activity, and religious leaders are forbidden from seeking public office. Religious facilities may not be used for political purposes.\n\nThe law on religious freedom, which the Government enforces, prohibits foreigners from [[Proselytism|proselytizing]].\n\nRegistered Muslim organizations are subordinate to the Caucasian Muslim Board (CMB), a Soviet-era muftiate that appoints Muslim clerics to mosques, periodically monitors sermons, and organizes annual pilgrimages to [[Mecca]]. Muslim religious groups must receive a letter of approval from the CMB before they can be registered by the SCWRA. Some Muslim religious leaders objected to interference from both the CMB and the SCWRA.\n\nReligious instruction is not mandatory, and there is no [[Religious education|religious curriculum]] for public elementary and high schools; however, there is no restriction on teaching religion in public schools.\n\n===Restrictions on religious freedom===\nOf the five main [[Baptists|Baptist churches]], three have successfully registered; however, during the reporting period the SCWRA again rejected the applications of the Baptist churches in [[Aliabad, Beylagan|Aliabad]] (which has sought registration for 15 years) and [[Neft\u00e7ala]]. Baptists stated the Aliabad notary refused to review the community's registration documents.\n\nIn December 2006 SCWRA officials reportedly told the Assembly of God community in Baku that it would have to give the SCWRA advance notice of meetings in order to be registered. The [[Assemblies of God]] reported that they tried to register their churches in Baku and [[Sumgayit]] several times\u2014most recently in January 2007\u2014but did not receive a response from the SCWRA. An Assembly of God representative met with SCWRA officials in May and June 2007 to advance the registration process, but the SCWRA said that it was still examining the application. In June police also interfered in one of the church's gatherings in Baku.\n\nThe Juma Mosque{{Which one|which one=|date=December 2017}} has remained closed since June 2004; the mosque's imam was still not allowed to travel abroad at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn May 2007 SCWRA head [[Hidayat Orujov]] stated that only 9 of 49 mosques in Guba were registered. Local commentators reported that Salafists were particularly active in the country's northern regions of Guba and Kachmaz.\n\nThe law on religious freedom expressly prohibits religious proselytizing by foreigners, and the Government strictly enforced this. The Government was concerned about [[Islamic missionary activity|Islamic missionary groups]] (predominantly Iranian and Wahhabi) operating in the country and, as in previous years, restricted their activities.\n\nSome Muslims complained about the SCWRA's allegedly indiscriminate use of the term \"Wahhabi\" to cast a shadow on devout Muslims. Local Protestant Christians also claimed that SCWRA Chairman Orujov derogatorily referred to their organizations as \"sects.\"\n\nIn May 2007 a Baku court sentenced a journalist and the editor of the Sanat newspaper on charges of \"inciting religious hatred.\" The journalist was given a 3-year prison term, and the editor was given a 4-year term. The journalist had written an article, published in November 2006, arguing Islamic values retarded the country's development.\n\nThe law permits the production and dissemination of religious literature with the approval of the [[The State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan|SCWRA]]; only religious literature, which promote religious intolerance, discrimination and radical religious ideas are restricted to import to the country by SCWRA.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Government regulates travel for the purpose of religious training. Prospective travelers must obtain permission from, or register with, the SCWRA or the Ministry of Education to go abroad for religious studies.\n\nNo religious identification is required in passports or other identity documents. However, the Center for the Protection of [[Conscience]] and Religious Freedom reported that authorities prohibited Muslim women from wearing headscarves in passport photos and other official identity documents.\n\nSome local officials continued to discourage Muslim women from wearing [[Headscarf|headscarves]] in schools.\n\nThe official website of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] reported on March 23, 2015 that \"religious intolerance is escalating in Azerbaijan as law-enforcement authorities impose heavy fines on Jehovah's Witnesses and imprison them.\" It added: \"Authorities are criminally prosecuting the Witnesses for meeting together for worship and for talking to others about their beliefs.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/by-region/azerbaijan/religious-intolerance/ | title=Azerbaijan's Religious Intolerance Against Jehovah's Witnesses}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=July 2017}}\n\nPress reports indicated that the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] enjoyed a special status in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region. The largely Muslim, ethnic Azerbaijani population in Nagorno-Karabakh and the seven occupied territories had fled the region during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|conflict with Armenia in the 1990s]] and remained unable to return to these areas.\n\nDuring the reporting period, there were several incidents of police arresting Wahhabis and sometimes confiscating weapons and literature, particularly in the northern regions of Guba, Khachmaz, Gax, and [[Zaqatala (city)|Zaqatala]], according to local contacts and the press. In April 2007, for example, police detained 16 alleged radical Salafists in Khachmaz.\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\n[[Antisemitism]] is one of the forms of national intolerance, expressed in a hostile attitude towards [[Jewish people|Jews]] as an ethnic or religious group. [[Antisemitism]] is not observed in Azerbaijan. Over the centuries, different [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[Language family|linguistic groups]] of Jews lived on the territory of Azerbaijan: [[Mountain Jews]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]], [[Krymchaks]], [[Kurds in Azerbaijan|Kurdish Jews]], and [[History of the Jews in Georgia|Georgian Jews]]. In the 19th century majority of the Jewish population of Azerbaijan were mountain Jews, in the 20th century the majority were Ashkenazi.\nThe main Jewish center was the city of [[Quba|Guba]], where in 1835 were 5492 Jews (of whom 2718 people concentrated in the Jewish quarter); In 1866 in the city lived 6282 Jews. Comparatively large communities of Mountain Jews were also present in the villages of Vartashen and Mudji. In 1864, in the village of Vartashen (since 1990 - Oguz), the majority of the population were Jews. In 1886 there lived 1400 Jews, there were three prayer houses, two Talmud-Huns with 40 pupils. It is known that the total number of literate who can read the Torah, was 70 people, among them there were five Jews who were called rabbis. In 1917 the weekly \"Kavkazer Vochenblat\" (in [[Yiddish]]) was published in Baku, in 1917-1918 - the weekly \"[[Jewish Herald-Voice|Caucasian Jewish Herald]]\" with the application \"[[Palestine]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}}\". In 1919 the newspaper \"Tobushi sabhi\" (in the Hebrew-Tatar language) was issued for some time. With the final establishment of Soviet power (April 1920), the independent Jewish press ceased to exist. Since 1922, the newspaper Korsokh was published in the capital of [[Azerbaijan]] in the Hebrew-Tatar language - the organ of the Caucasian Committee of the Jewish Communist Party and its youth organization. In the 1990s, there were two synagogues in Baku (mountain Jews and Ashkenazi), as well as synagogues of mountain Jews in Guba and Oguz and a synagogue of gays in Privolnoye. In September 1993, a seminar of rabbis of Azerbaijan, Georgia and [[Dagestan]] was held in Baku. In 1994, a yeshiva was opened there. In 1997, a synagogue of Georgian Jews was opened in Baku. In the early 2000s. In the suburbs of [[Quba|Guba]], the Red Sloboda, there were three synagogues of Mountain Jews, and the yeshiva operated. Since 1999, a religious Jewish high school has been working in Baku. According to 1994 data, Hebrew was taught at the university and in two high schools in the capital. Hebrew courses were conducted in [[Baku]], Guba and Oguz. Representatives of the Jewish Agency and teachers from Israel provided great assistance in organizing classes; Among the students of the courses there were also non-Jews. In front of the audience were a Jewish ensemble of [[chamber music]], a children's choir, a [[dance ensemble]]. Local radio and television regularly broadcast records of [[Music of Israel|Israeli pop music]].\nThe leadership of Azerbaijan seeks to establish political and economic ties with Israel. Diplomatic relations were established in 1993. On 11 May 1994, the [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] of the State of Israel in Azerbaijan, Eliezer Yotvat, presented his credentials to President [[Heydar Aliyev]]. In August 1999, the Israeli parliamentary delegation paid an official visit to Azerbaijan. The volume of exports from Israel to Azerbaijan in 1993 amounted to 545 thousand dollars, imports - twelve thousand; In 1994, exports and imports increased significantly.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/azerbaijan-virtual-jewish-history-tour | title=Azerbaijan Virtual Jewish History Tour}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.day.az/society/81646.html | title=\u041c\u0435\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043d \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044f\u043b\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0435 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439| date=June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===\nSome religious groups in the country reported improvements in their ability to function freely. Several churches indicated that they received or expected to receive their registration, were able to import religious literature, and met without government interference.\n\nThe Government promotes interfaith understanding. The [[The State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan|SCWRA]] convened leaders of various religious communities on several occasions to resolve disputes in private and provided forums for visiting officials to discuss religious issues with religious figures. The [[SCWRA]] organizes several seminars, conferences, and regional meetings on religious freedom and tolerance regularly.<ref name=\":1\" /> On 26\u201327 April 2007 Azerbaijan hosted the international conference on the \u201cRole of Media in Development of Tolerance and Mutual Understanding\" as a member of the [[Organization of Islamic Conference]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Islamic World in the New Century: The Organisation of the Islamic Conference|last=Ihsanoglu|first=Ekmeleddin|publisher=Hurst Publishers|year=2010|isbn=9781849040631|location=|pages=164}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007 construction began on a new Jewish educational complex. Authorities also reserved one wing of a Baku school for secular and religious classes for 200 Jewish students.\n\nAzerbaijani Government allocates financial support to different religious groups continuously. The latest allocation was determined among Caucasian Muslims Office, Archbishop of Baku and Azerbaijan of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], Community of Mountain Jews in Baku, Community of European Jews in Baku, [[Apostolic prefecture]] of the Roman [[Catholic Church in Azerbaijan]] and [[Church of Caucasian Albania|Alban-Udi Christian Community]] from the 2018 Presidential Reserve Fund according to Presidential Decree dated 11 June 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/29031|title=Order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on providing financial assistance to religious organizations in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=president.az|language=az|access-date=2018-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.apa.az/azerbaijan_religion_news/president-ilham-aliyev-allocates-financial-aid-to-religious-organizations.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618010101/http://en.apa.az/azerbaijan_religion_news/president%2Dilham%2Daliyev%2Dallocates%2Dfinancial%2Daid%2Dto%2Dreligious%2Dorganizations.html|title=Azerbaijani president allocates financial aid to religious organizations|work=APA Information Agency|access-date=2018-06-18|archive-date=2018-06-18|url-status=dead|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Inter-religious activities ==\nThe [[Government of Azerbaijan]] promotes religious tolerance by organizing inter-religious events, financially supporting workshops relating to this issue.

Therefore, Catholicos of all Armenians [[Karekin II]] visited [[Baku]] to take part at the World religious Leaders Summit. He has also been to Armenian Church in the center of Baku during his visit.<ref name=\":2\" /> This event has a historic significance, as it was the first time an Armenian religious leader visited Baku after territories of [[Azerbaijan]] was occupied.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[World Summit of Religious Leaders|Summit of World Religious Leaders]] was held in [[Baku]] on June 1, 2010 initiated by the Board of Caucasus Muslims and organized by Inter-Religious Council of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]].

In the end of the conference, a final declaration was signed inviting religious leaders to broaden their activities in promoting peace and discarding radicalism, extremist ideologies, aggressive separatism, and terrorism.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://teas.eu/news-interfaith-baku|title=Interfaith in Baku|work=The European Azerbaijan Society|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n\n==Societal abuses and discrimination==\nThere were some reports of [[Structural abuse|societal abuses]] or [[discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice. There was popular prejudice against Muslims who convert to other faiths and hostility toward groups that proselytize, particularly [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] and other missionary groups. This was accentuated by the unresolved conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nHostility between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, intensified by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, remained strong. In those areas of the country controlled by Armenians, all ethnic [[Azerbaijanis]] have fled, and the mosques that had not been destroyed remained inactive. Animosity toward ethnic Armenians elsewhere in the country forced most of them to flee between 1988 and 1990, and all Armenian churches, many of which were damaged in [[List of ethnic riots|ethnic riots]] that took place more than a decade ago, remained closed. As a consequence, the estimated 10,000 to 30,000 ethnic Armenians who briefly remained were unable to attend services in their traditional [[Place of worship|places of worship]] and had to hide their identity. Due to the lack of physical safety, almost all of the remaining Armenians also later fled.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in Baku reported being unable to use a building they had rented for the purpose of religious meetings since signing a rental agreement in September 2006. According to Jehovah's Witnesses, local residents hired private [[Security guard|security guards]] to prevent their access to the property on September 21, 2006, and local police informed the group on September 24 that they would not be able to hold meetings in the space due to residents' complaints. On April 17, 2007, four men reportedly broke into the building and attacked two Jehovah's Witnesses and property inside. The group reported that local police refused to investigate the incident despite the attackers being identified.\n\nAs in previous reporting periods, newspapers and television broadcasts depicted \"nontraditional\" religious groups as threats to the identity of the nation and as undermining the country's traditions of interfaith harmony, which led to local harassment.\n\nDuring the reporting period, articles critical of Wahhabism and of Christian missionaries appeared in newspapers, and one television channel aired \"exposes\" of Christian church services.\n\nHostility also existed toward foreign (mostly Iranian and Wahhabi) Muslim missionary activity, which many viewed as attempts to spread political Islam, and therefore as a threat to stability and peace. The media targeted some Muslim communities that the Government claimed were involved in illegal activities.\n\nOn April 11, 2007, unidentified individuals threw a burning object through the window of a newly constructed Roman Catholic church in Baku. The church's priest publicly stated that the incident was almost certainly criminal and thanked [[Local government|local authorities]] for investigating the matter.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Religion in Azerbaijan]]\n*[[Human rights in Azerbaijan]]\n*[[State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations (Azerbaijan)|State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of Azerbaijan Republic]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

There were no reliable statistics on membership in specific religious groups; however, according to official figures approximately 96 percent of the population is Muslim. The remainder of the population consists mostly of Russian Orthodox, [[Armenian Apostolic]] (Almost all of which live in the break-away region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]), Jews, and nonbelievers. Among the Muslim majority, religious observance is relatively low, and Muslim identity tends to be based more on culture and ethnicity than religion. According to the [[State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations (Azerbaijan)|State Committee on Work with Religious Associations]] (SCWRA), the Muslim population is approximately 85 percent [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and 15 percent [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]];{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} traditionally, differences are not defined sharply.

According to the U.S. Department of State, their \"identity, like that of Muslims, tends to be based as much on culture and ethnicity as religion\". Christians were concentrated in the urban areas of [[Baku]], which is the nation's capital, and [[Sumgayit]], its third-largest city.\n\nOf a total [[Jewish population by country|Jewish population]] of approximately 15,000, the vast majority live in Baku. Much smaller communities exist in [[Guba, Azerbaijan|Guba]] in village and municipality named Red Town and elsewhere. There are five to six rabbis and six synagogues in the country.\n\nShi'a, Sunni, Russian Orthodox, and Jews are considered to be the country's \"traditional\" religious groups. Small congregations of [[Lutherans]], [[Roman Catholics]], [[Baptists]], [[Molokans]] ([[Old Believers]]), [[Seventh-day Adventists]], and [[Baha'i]]s have been present for over 100 years.\n\nIn the last decade, a number of religious groups considered foreign or \"nontraditional\" have established a presence, including \"[[Wahhabi]]\" and [[Salafist]] Muslims, [[Pentecostal]] and [[evangelical Christians]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and Hare Krishnas.\n\nThere were significant expatriate Christian and Muslim communities in Baku; authorities generally permitted these groups to worship freely.\n\n==Status of religious freedom==\n\n===Legal and policy framework===\nThe [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] provides that persons of all faiths may choose and practice their religion without restriction.

Registration is processed based on the location as mentioned in the application. When there is any change in the location of the organization, it should be reported to SCWRA and appropriate modifications should be made in registration process. After registering through SCWRA, religious groups obtain rights to function as a legal entity, have a bank account and rent a possession. The organizations, which were unsuccessful to register may be proclaimed as illegal and prohibited to function.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSince 2001 religious groups must register with the SCWRA. The SCWRA has broad powers over registration and the publication, import, and distribution of religious literature, and it may suspend the activities of religious groups who violate the law.\n\nSome religious groups experienced difficulties with disapproval of registration according to the ''[[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|International Religious Freedom Report]] 2015'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2015religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816033000/https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2015religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-08-16|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2015|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref> applications are denied according to the legislation. When all necessary documents organized appropriately are presented to the responsible entity, registration is accomplished. If the actions, objects or instructions of the religious groups oppose the [[Law of Azerbaijan|legislation of Azerbaijan]], or its charter and other documents are in contrast with the laws, or they contain false information, then registration of those groups can be refused by responsible authorities. Religious groups have rights to appeal the disapproval of registration to the courts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to the SCWRA, it registered 48 new groups from May 2006 through June 2007 and did not reject any applications. All of the newly registered groups were Muslim communities. The SCWRA reported 392 total registered [[Religious community|religious communities]] in the country.\n\nUnder the law on religious freedom, political parties cannot engage in religious activity, and religious leaders are forbidden from seeking public office. Religious facilities may not be used for political purposes.\n\nThe law on religious freedom, which the Government enforces, prohibits foreigners from [[Proselytism|proselytizing]].\n\nRegistered Muslim organizations are subordinate to the Caucasian Muslim Board (CMB), a Soviet-era muftiate that appoints Muslim clerics to mosques, periodically monitors sermons, and organizes annual pilgrimages to [[Mecca]]. Muslim religious groups must receive a letter of approval from the CMB before they can be registered by the SCWRA. Some Muslim religious leaders objected to interference from both the CMB and the SCWRA.\n\nReligious instruction is not mandatory, and there is no [[Religious education|religious curriculum]] for public elementary and high schools; however, there is no restriction on teaching religion in public schools.\n\n===Restrictions on religious freedom===\nOf the five main [[Baptists|Baptist churches]], three have successfully registered; however, during the reporting period the SCWRA again rejected the applications of the Baptist churches in [[Aliabad, Beylagan|Aliabad]] (which has sought registration for 15 years) and [[Neft\u00e7ala]]. Baptists stated the Aliabad notary refused to review the community's registration documents.\n\nIn December 2006 SCWRA officials reportedly told the Assembly of God community in Baku that it would have to give the SCWRA advance notice of meetings in order to be registered. The [[Assemblies of God]] reported that they tried to register their churches in Baku and [[Sumgayit]] several times\u2014most recently in January 2007\u2014but did not receive a response from the SCWRA. An Assembly of God representative met with SCWRA officials in May and June 2007 to advance the registration process, but the SCWRA said that it was still examining the application. In June police also interfered in one of the church's gatherings in Baku.\n\nThe Juma Mosque{{Which one|which one=|date=December 2017}} has remained closed since June 2004; the mosque's imam was still not allowed to travel abroad at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn May 2007 SCWRA head [[Hidayat Orujov]] stated that only 9 of 49 mosques in Guba were registered. Local commentators reported that Salafists were particularly active in the country's northern regions of Guba and Kachmaz.\n\nThe law on religious freedom expressly prohibits religious proselytizing by foreigners, and the Government strictly enforced this. The Government was concerned about [[Islamic missionary activity|Islamic missionary groups]] (predominantly Iranian and Wahhabi) operating in the country and, as in previous years, restricted their activities.\n\nSome Muslims complained about the SCWRA's allegedly indiscriminate use of the term \"Wahhabi\" to cast a shadow on devout Muslims. Local Protestant Christians also claimed that SCWRA Chairman Orujov derogatorily referred to their organizations as \"sects.\"\n\nIn May 2007 a Baku court sentenced a journalist and the editor of the Sanat newspaper on charges of \"inciting religious hatred.\" The journalist was given a 3-year prison term, and the editor was given a 4-year term. The journalist had written an article, published in November 2006, arguing Islamic values retarded the country's development.\n\nThe law permits the production and dissemination of religious literature with the approval of the [[The State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan|SCWRA]]; only religious literature, which promote religious intolerance, discrimination and radical religious ideas are restricted to import to the country by SCWRA.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Government regulates travel for the purpose of religious training. Prospective travelers must obtain permission from, or register with, the SCWRA or the Ministry of Education to go abroad for religious studies.\n\nNo religious identification is required in passports or other identity documents. However, the Center for the Protection of [[Conscience]] and Religious Freedom reported that authorities prohibited Muslim women from wearing headscarves in passport photos and other official identity documents.\n\nSome local officials continued to discourage Muslim women from wearing [[Headscarf|headscarves]] in schools.\n\nThe official website of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] reported on March 23, 2015 that \"religious intolerance is escalating in Azerbaijan as law-enforcement authorities impose heavy fines on Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and imprison them.\" It added: \"Authorities are criminally prosecuting the Witnesses for meeting together for worship and for talking to others about their beliefs.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/by-region/azerbaijan/religious-intolerance/ | title=Azerbaijan's Religious Intolerance Against Jehovah's Witnesses}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=July 2017}}\n\nPress reports indicated that the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] enjoyed a special status in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region. The largely Muslim, ethnic Azerbaijani population in Nagorno-Karabakh and the seven occupied territories had fled the region during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|conflict with Armenia in the 1990s]] and remained unable to return to these areas.\n\nDuring the reporting period, there were several incidents of police arresting Wahhabis and sometimes confiscating weapons and literature, particularly in the northern regions of Guba, Khachmaz, Gax, and [[Zaqatala (city)|Zaqatala]], according to local contacts and the press. In April 2007, for example, police detained 16 alleged radical Salafists in Khachmaz.\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\n[[Antisemitism]] is one of the forms of national intolerance, expressed in a hostile attitude towards [[Jewish people|Jews]] as an ethnic or religious group. [[Antisemitism]] is not observed in Azerbaijan. Over the centuries, different [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[Language family|linguistic groups]] of Jews lived on the territory of Azerbaijan: [[Mountain Jews]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]], [[Krymchaks]], [[Kurds in Azerbaijan|Kurdish Jews]], and [[History of the Jews in Georgia|Georgian Jews]]. In the 19th century majority of the Jewish population of Azerbaijan were mountain Jews, in the 20th century the majority were Ashkenazi.\nThe main Jewish center was the city of [[Quba|Guba]], where in 1835 were 5492 Jews (of whom 2718 people concentrated in the Jewish quarter); In 1866 in the city lived 6282 Jews. Comparatively large communities of Mountain Jews were also present in the villages of Vartashen and Mudji. In 1864, in the village of Vartashen (since 1990 - Oguz), the majority of the population were Jews. In 1886 there lived 1400 Jews, there were three prayer houses, two Talmud-Huns with 40 pupils. It is known that the total number of literate who can read the Torah, was 70 people, among them there were five Jews who were called rabbis. In 1917 the weekly \"Kavkazer Vochenblat\" (in [[Yiddish]]) was published in Baku, in 1917-1918 - the weekly \"[[Jewish Herald-Voice|Caucasian Jewish Herald]]\" with the application \"[[Palestine]]\". In 1919 the newspaper \"Tobushi sabhi\" (in the Hebrew-Tatar language) was issued for some time. With the final establishment of Soviet power (April 1920), the independent Jewish press ceased to exist. Since 1922, the newspaper Korsokh was published in the capital of [[Azerbaijan]] in the Hebrew-Tatar language - the organ of the Caucasian Committee of the Jewish Communist Party and its youth organization. In the 1990s, there were two synagogues in Baku (mountain Jews and Ashkenazi), as well as synagogues of mountain Jews in Guba and Oguz and a synagogue of gays in Privolnoye. In September 1993, a seminar of rabbis of Azerbaijan, Georgia and [[Dagestan]] was held in Baku. In 1994, a yeshiva was opened there. In 1997, a synagogue of Georgian Jews was opened in Baku. In the early 2000s. In the suburbs of [[Quba|Guba]], the Red Sloboda, there were three synagogues of Mountain Jews, and the yeshiva operated. Since 1999, a religious Jewish high school has been working in Baku. According to 1994 data, Hebrew was taught at the university and in two high schools in the capital. Hebrew courses were conducted in [[Baku]], Guba and Oguz. Representatives of the Jewish Agency and teachers from Israel provided great assistance in organizing classes; Among the students of the courses there were also non-Jews. In front of the audience were a Jewish ensemble of [[Chamber music|chamber music]], a children's choir, a [[Dance ensemble|dance ensemble]]. Local radio and television regularly broadcast records of [[Music of Israel|Israeli pop music]].\nThe leadership of Azerbaijan seeks to establish political and economic ties with Israel. Diplomatic relations were established in 1993. On 11 May 1994, the [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] of the State of Israel in Azerbaijan, Eliezer Yotvat, presented his credentials to President [[Heydar Aliyev]]. In August 1999, the Israeli parliamentary delegation paid an official visit to Azerbaijan. The volume of exports from Israel to Azerbaijan in 1993 amounted to 545 thousand dollars, imports - twelve thousand; In 1994, exports and imports increased significantly.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/azerbaijan-virtual-jewish-history-tour | title=Azerbaijan Virtual Jewish History Tour}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.day.az/society/81646.html | title=\u041c\u0435\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043d \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044f\u043b\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0435 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439| date=June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===\nSome religious groups in the country reported improvements in their ability to function freely. Several churches indicated that they received or expected to receive their registration, were able to import religious literature, and met without government interference.\n\nThe Government promotes interfaith understanding. The [[The State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan|SCWRA]] convened leaders of various religious communities on several occasions to resolve disputes in private and provided forums for visiting officials to discuss religious issues with religious figures. The [[SCWRA]] organizes several seminars, conferences, and regional meetings on religious freedom and tolerance regularly.<ref name=\":1\" /> On 26\u201327 April 2007 Azerbaijan hosted the international conference on the \u201cRole of Media in Development of Tolerance and Mutual Understanding\" as a member of the [[Organization of Islamic Conference]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Islamic World in the New Century: The Organisation of the Islamic Conference|last=Ihsanoglu|first=Ekmeleddin|publisher=Hurst Publishers|year=2010|isbn=9781849040631|location=|pages=164}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007 construction began on a new Jewish educational complex. Authorities also reserved one wing of a Baku school for secular and religious classes for 200 Jewish students.\n\nAzerbaijani Government allocates financial support to different religious groups continuously.

Therefore, Catholicos of all Armenians [[Karekin II]] visited [[Baku]] to take part at the World religious Leaders Summit. He has also been to Armenian Church in the center of Baku during his visit.<ref name=\":2\" /> This event has a historic significance, as it was the first time an Armenian religious leader visited Baku after territories of [[Azerbaijan]] was occupied.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[World Summit of Religious Leaders|Summit of World Religious Leaders]] was held in [[Baku]] on June 1, 2010 initiated by the Board of Caucasus Muslims and organized by Inter-Religious Council of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]].

There was popular prejudice against Muslims who convert to other faiths and hostility toward groups that proselytize, particularly [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] and other missionary groups. This was accentuated by the unresolved conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nHostility between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, intensified by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, remained strong. In those areas of the country controlled by Armenians, all ethnic [[Azerbaijanis]] have fled, and the mosques that had not been destroyed remained inactive. Animosity toward ethnic Armenians elsewhere in the country forced most of them to flee between 1988 and 1990, and all Armenian churches, many of which were damaged in [[List of ethnic riots|ethnic riots]] that took place more than a decade ago, remained closed. As a consequence, the estimated 10,000 to 30,000 ethnic Armenians who briefly remained were unable to attend services in their traditional [[Place of worship|places of worship]] and had to hide their identity. Due to the lack of physical safety, almost all of the remaining Armenians also later fled.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in Baku reported being unable to use a building they had rented for the purpose of religious meetings since signing a rental agreement in September 2006. According to Jehovah's Witnesses, local residents hired private [[Security guard|security guards]] to prevent their access to the property on September 21, 2006, and local police informed the group on September 24 that they would not be able to hold meetings in the space due to residents' complaints. On April 17, 2007, four men reportedly broke into the building and attacked two Jehovah's Witnesses and property inside. The group reported that local police refused to investigate the incident despite the attackers being identified.\n\nAs in previous reporting periods, newspapers and television broadcasts depicted \"nontraditional\" religious groups as threats to the identity of the nation and as undermining the country's traditions of interfaith harmony, which led to local harassment.\n\nDuring the reporting period, articles critical of Wahhabism and of Christian missionaries appeared in newspapers, and one television channel aired \"exposes\" of Christian church services.\n\nHostility also existed toward foreign (mostly Iranian and Wahhabi) Muslim missionary activity, which many viewed as attempts to spread political Islam, and therefore as a threat to stability and peace. The media targeted some Muslim communities that the Government claimed were involved in illegal activities.\n\nOn April 11, 2007, unidentified individuals threw a burning object through the window of a newly constructed Roman Catholic church in Baku. The church's priest publicly stated that the incident was almost certainly criminal and thanked [[Local government|local authorities]] for investigating the matter.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Religion in Azerbaijan]]\n*[[Human rights in Azerbaijan]]\n*[[State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations (Azerbaijan)|State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of Azerbaijan Republic]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.
