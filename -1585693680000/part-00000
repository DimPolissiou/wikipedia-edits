{"title_page": "Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text_new": "{{short description|Amendment guaranteeing rights related to trials and due process}}\n{{US Constitution article series}}\nThe '''Fifth Amendment'''  ('''Amendment V''') to the [[United States Constitution]] addresses [[United States constitutional criminal procedure|criminal procedure]] and other aspects of the Constitution. It was ratified in 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. The Fifth Amendment applies to every level of the government, including the federal, state, and local levels, as well as any corporation, private enterprise, group, or individual, or any foreign government in regard to a US citizen or resident of the US. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] furthered the protections of this amendment through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\nOne provision of the Fifth Amendment requires that [[felony|felonies]] be tried only upon [[indictment#United States|indictment]] by a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]]. Another provision, the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]], provides the right of defendants to be tried only once in federal court for the same offense. The self-incrimination clause provides various protections against self-incrimination, including the right of an individual to not serve as a witness in a criminal case in which they are the defendant. \"Pleading the Fifth\" is a colloquial term often used to invoke the self-incrimination clause when witnesses decline to answer questions where the answers might incriminate them. In the 1966 case of ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', the Supreme Court held that the self-incrimination clause requires the police to issue a [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]] to criminal suspects interrogated while under police custody. The Fifth Amendment also contains the Takings Clause, which allows the federal government to [[eminent domain|take private property for public use]] if the government provides \"just compensation.\"\n\nLike the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment includes a due process clause stating that no person shall \"be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The Fifth Amendment's due process clause applies to the federal government, while the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause applies to state governments. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause as providing two main protections: [[procedural due process]], which requires government officials to follow fair procedures before depriving a person of life, liberty, or property, and [[substantive due process]], which protects certain [[fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental rights]] from government interference. The Supreme Court has also held that the Due Process Clause contains a [[Vagueness doctrine|prohibition against vague laws]] and an implied equal protection requirement similar to the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]].\n\n==Text==\nThe amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows:\n{{quote|No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.}}\n{{wide image|Amendment_5.jpg|1999px|The hand-written copy of the proposed Bill of Rights, 1789, cropped to just show the text that would later be ratified as the Fifth Amendment}}\n\n==Background before adoption==\n[[File:James Madison(cropped)(c).jpg|thumb|James Madison, drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]]] On June 8, 1789, Congressman [[James Madison]] introduced several proposed constitutional amendments during a speech to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name=speech>[https://www.archives.gov/legislative/resources/education/bill-of-rights/images/handout-2.pdf \"James Madison's Proposed Amendments to the Constitution\"], ''[[Congressional Record|Annals of Congress]]'' (June 8, 1789).</ref> His draft language that later became the Fifth Amendment was as follows:<ref>Obrien, David.  [http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2581&context=ndlr \"Fifth Amendment: Fox Hunters, Old Women, Hermits, and the Burger Court\"], ''[[Notre Dame Law Review]]'', Vol. 54, p. 30 (1978).</ref><ref name=speech />\n\n<blockquote>No person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment or trial for the same offense; nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor be obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation....[E]xcept in cases of impeachments, and cases arising in the land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service, in time of war or public danger...in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member, presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary....</blockquote>\n\nThis draft was edited by Congress; all the material before the first ellipsis was placed at the end, and some of the wording was modified.  After approval by Congress, the amendment was ratified by the states on December 15, 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].  Every one of the five clauses in the final amendment appeared in Madison's draft, and in their final order those clauses are the [[Grand juries in the United States#Grand Jury Clause|Grand Jury Clause]] (which Madison had placed last), the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]], the [[Self-incrimination#United States law|Self Incrimination Clause]], the [[Due Process Clause]], and then the [[Takings Clause]].\n\n==Grand jury==\n{{further|Grand juries in the United States}}\nThe [[grand jury]] is a pre-constitutional common law institution, and a constitutional fixture in its own right exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states to the extent that the states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. \"Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the grand jury is similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [p688] majority of the States.\" Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. [[Grand jury|Grand juries]], which return [[indictment]]s in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given [[Jury instructions|specific instructions regarding the law]] by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the [[exclusionary rule]] does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], Fifth or [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth amendments]] cannot be introduced in court.<ref>''[[United States v. Calandra]]'', {{ussc|414|338|1974}}</ref> Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present in the grand jury room during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave the grand jury room to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.\n\n[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb| The Bill of Rights in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]\nCurrently, federal law permits the trial of [[misdemeanor]]s without indictments.<ref>''[[Duke v. United States]]'', {{ussc|301|492|1937}}</ref> Additionally, in trials of non-capital felonies, the prosecution may proceed without indictments if the defendants waive their Fifth Amendment right.\n\nGrand jury indictments may be amended by the prosecution only in limited circumstances. In ''[[Ex Parte Bain]]'', {{ussc|121|1|1887}}, the Supreme Court held that the indictment could not be changed at all by the prosecution. ''United States v. Miller'', {{ussc|471|130|1985}} partly reversed ''Ex parte Bain''; now, an indictment's scope may be narrowed by the prosecution. Thus, lesser included charges may be dropped, but new charges may not be added.\n\nThe Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not protect those serving in the armed forces, whether during wartime or peacetime. Members of the state militia called up to serve with federal forces are not protected under the clause either. In ''[[O'Callahan v. Parker]]'', {{ussc|395|258|1969}}, the Supreme Court held that only charges relating to service may be brought against members of the militia without indictments. That decision was overturned in 1987, when the Court held that members of the militia in actual service may be tried for any offense without indictments.<ref>''[[Solorio v. United States]]'', {{ussc|483|435|1987}}</ref>\n\nThe grand jury indictment clause of the Fifth Amendment has not been [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>''[[Hurtado v. California]]'', {{ussc|110|517|1884}}</ref> This means that the grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states ''do'' employ grand juries, no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish grand juries, and many (though not all) have replaced them with [[preliminary hearing]].\n\n===Infamous crime===\nWhether a crime is \"infamous\", for purposes of the Grand Jury Clause, is determined by the nature of the punishment that may be imposed, not the punishment that is actually imposed;<ref>''[[Ex parte Wilson]]'', {{ussc|114|417|1885}}</ref> however, crimes punishable by [[Capital punishment in the United States|death]] must be tried upon [[indictment]]s. The historical origin of \"infamous crime\" comes from the ''[[infamia]]'', a punishment under Roman law by which a citizen was deprived of his citizenship.<ref>United States v. Cox, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4202544690014107094&q=infamia&hl=en&as_sdt=2006#r%5B38%5D 342 F.2d 167, 187 fn.7] (5th Cir. 1965) ([[John Minor Wisdom|Wisdom]], J., specially concurring) citing Greenidge, 37.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Greenidge|first1=Abel Hendy Jones|authorlink=Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge|title=Infamia: Its Place in Roman Public and Private Law|date=1894|publisher=Claredon Press|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924021131531|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  In ''[[United States v. Moreland]]'', {{ussc|258|433|1922}}, the Supreme Court held that incarceration in a prison or penitentiary, as opposed to a correction or reformation house, attaches infamy to a crime. In ''[[s:Mackin v. United States|Mackin v. United States]]'', {{ussc|117|348|1886}}, the Supreme Court judged that \"'Infamous crimes' are thus, in the most explicit words, defined to be those 'punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.'\", while it later in ''[[s:Green v. United States (356 U.S. 165)|Green v. United States]]'' {{ussc|356|165|1957}}, stated that \"imprisonment in a penitentiary can be imposed only if a crime is subject to imprisonment exceeding one year\". Therefore, an infamous crime is one that is punished by imprisonment for over one year. Susan Brown, a former defense attorney and Professor of Law at the [[University of Dayton School of Law]], concluded: \"Since this is essentially the definition of a [[felony]], infamous crimes translate as felonies.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Susan|title=Federal Grand Jury - \"Infamous crimes\"--part 1|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/~grandjur/feedback/feedba10.htm|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Double jeopardy==\n{{main|Double Jeopardy Clause}}\n: ...nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb...<ref name = \"fifth amendment double jeopardy\">{{cite book | last = Harper | first = Timothy | title = The Complete Idiot's Guide to the U.S. Constitution | publisher = Penguin Group | date = October 2, 2007 | page = 109 | isbn = 978-1-59257-627-2 |quote= \"However, the Fifth Amendment contains several other important provisions for protecting your rights.

Pearce]], 395 U.S. 711 (1969).</ref> Jeopardy applies when the jury is empaneled in a jury trial, when the first witness is sworn in during a bench trial, or when a plea is rendered.<ref>[[Crist v. Bretz]], 437 U.S. 28 (1978).</ref>\n\n===Prosecution after acquittal===\nThe government is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a [[directed verdict]] before the case is submitted to the jury,<ref>[[Fong Foo v. United States]], 369 U.S. 141 (1962); [[Sanabria v. United States]],  437 U.S. 54 (1978).</ref> a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury,<ref>[[United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.]], 430 U.S. 564 (1977).</ref> an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court),<ref>[[Burks v. United States]], 437 U.S. 1 (1978).</ref> or an \"implied acquittal\" via conviction of a lesser included offense.<ref>[[Green v. United States]], 355 U.S. 184 (1957).</ref> In addition, the government is barred by [[collateral estoppel]] from re-litigating against the same defense, a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal,<ref>[[Ashe v. Swenson]],  397 U.S. 436 (1970).</ref> even if the jury hung on other counts.<ref>[[Yeager v. United States]], 557 U.S. 110 (2009).</ref>\n\nThis principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss<ref>[[Serfass v. United States]], 420 U.S. 377 (1973).</ref> or other non-merits dismissal,<ref>[[United States v. Scott]], 437 U.S. 82 (1978).</ref> or a directed verdict after a jury conviction,<ref>[[Wilson v. United States]], 420 U.S. 332 (1975).</ref>  nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute.<ref>[[Smith v. Massachusetts]], 543 U.S. 462 (2005).</ref> Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency,<ref>[[Ball v. United States]], 163 U.S. 662 (1896).</ref> including habeas,<ref>[[United States v. Tateo]], 377 U.S. 463 (1964).</ref> or \"thirteenth juror\" appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency<ref>[[Tibbs v.

Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County]], 138 F.3d 302  (7th Cir. 1998).</ref>\n\n===Multiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction===\nIn ''[[Blockburger v. United States]]'' (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try to punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not.<ref>[[Blockburger v. United States]], 284 U.S. 299 (1932). ''See, e.g.'', [[Brown v. Ohio]], 432 U.S. 161 (1977).</ref> ''Blockburger'' is the default rule, unless the legislature intends to depart; for example, [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise]] (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates,<ref>[[Garrett v. United States]],  471 U.S. 773 (1985); [[Rutledge v. United States]], 517 U.S. 292 (1996).</ref> as can conspiracy.<ref>[[United States v. Felix]], 503 U.S. 378 (1992).</ref>\n\nThe ''Blockburger'' test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction.<ref>[[Missouri v. Hunter]], 459 U.S. 359 (1983).</ref> In ''[[Grady v. Corbin]]'' (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the ''Blockburger'' test was not satisfied,<ref>[[Grady v. Corbin]], 495 U.S. 508 (1990).</ref> but ''Grady'' was overruled in ''[[United States v. Dixon]]'' (1993).<ref>[[United States v. Dixon]], 509 U.S. 688 (1993).</ref>\n\n===Prosecution after mistrial===\nThe rule for [[mistrial]]s depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in \"bad faith\", i.e., goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial.<ref>''[[Oregon v. Kennedy]]'', 456 U.S. 667 (1982).</ref> If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds \"manifest necessity\" for granting the mistrial.<ref>''[[Arizona v. Washington]]'', 434 U.S. 497 (1978).</ref> The same standard governs mistrials granted ''[[sua sponte]]''.\n\n===Prosecution in different States===\n\nIn [[Heath v. Alabama]] (1985), the Supreme Court held, that the Fifth Amendment rule against double jeopardy does not prohibit two different states from separately prosecuting and convicting the same individual for the same illegal act.\n\n==Self-incrimination==\n{{redirect|Plead the Fifth|the album by the band Taproot|Plead the Fifth (album)}}\n\nThe Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being forced to [[self-incrimination|incriminate themselves]]. Incriminating oneself is defined as exposing oneself (or another person) to \"an accusation or charge of crime,\" or as involving oneself (or another person) \"in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof.\"<ref>''Black's Law Dictionary'', p. 690 (5th ed. 1979).</ref> The ''privilege'' against compelled self-incrimination is defined as \"the constitutional right of a person to refuse to answer questions or otherwise give testimony against himself.&nbsp;... \"<ref>From \"Self-Incrimination, Privilege Against,\" ''Barrons Law Dictionary'', p. 434 (2d ed. 1984).</ref> To \"plead the Fifth\" is to refuse to answer any question because \"the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked\" lead a claimant to possess a \"reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer\", believing that \"a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\"<ref>''Ohio v. Reiner'', {{ussc|532|17|2001}}, citing ''Hoffman v. U.S.'', {{ussc|351|479|1951}}; cf. ''Counselman v. Hitchcock'', {{ussc|142|547|1892}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the legal protection against compelled self-incrimination was directly related to the question of torture for extracting information and confessions.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bill of Rights |last=Amar |first=Akhil Reed |authorlink=Akhil Reed Amar |year=1998 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-08277-0 |page=84 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=America's Constitution |last=Amar |first=Akhil Reed |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=1-4000-6262-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/americasconstitu00amar_0/page/329 329] |url=https://archive.org/details/americasconstitu00amar_0 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe legal shift away from widespread use of torture and forced confession dates to turmoil of the late 16th and early 17th century in [[England]].<ref name=\"[[ex-officio-mero]]\">{{cite book |last=Greaves |first=Richard L. |title=Society and religion in Elizabethan England |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |year=1981 |isbn=0-8166-1030-4 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ULHy6AZPd_wC&pg=PA64 |accessdate=19 July 2009 |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |oclc=7278140 |pages=649, 681 |chapter=Legal Problems |quote=This situation worsened in the 1580s and 1590s when the machinery of&nbsp;... the High Commission, was turned against Puritans&nbsp;... in which a key weapon was the oath ''ex officio mero'', with its capacity for self incrimination&nbsp;... Refusal to take this oath usually was regarded as proof of guilt.}}</ref> Anyone refusing to take the oath ''ex officio mero'' (confessions or swearing of innocence, usually before hearing any charges) was considered guilty.<ref name=\"[[ex-officio-mero]]\" /> Suspected [[Puritans]] were pressed to take the oath and then reveal names of other Puritans. Coercion and torture were commonly used to compel \"cooperation.\" Puritans, who were at the time fleeing to the [[New World]], began a practice of refusing to cooperate with interrogations. In the most famous case [[John Lilburne]] refused to take the oath in 1637. His case and his call for \"[[freeborn]] rights\" were rallying points for reforms against forced oaths, forced self-incrimination, and other kinds of coercion. [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s revolution overturned the practice and incorporated protections, in response to a popular group of English citizens known as the [[Levellers]]. The Levellers presented ''The Humble Petition of Many Thousands'' to [[Parliament]] in 1647 with 13 demands, the third of which was the right against self-incrimination in criminal cases. These protections were brought to America by Puritans, and were later incorporated into the United States Constitution through the Bill of Rights.\n\nProtection against compelled self-incrimination is implicit in the [[Miranda rights]] statement, which protects the \"right to remain silent.\" This amendment is also similar to [[Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries like [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the right to silence of the accused both during questioning and at trial is regarded as an important right inherited from common law, and is protected in the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]] and in Australia through various federal and state acts and codes governing the criminal justice system.\n\nIn [[South Africa]]n law the right to silence originating from English common law has been entrenched in Section 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"a witness may have a reasonable fear of prosecution and yet be innocent of any wrongdoing. The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\"<ref>''Ohio v. Reiner'', {{ussc|532|17|2001}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, Professor James Duane of the [[Regent University]] School of Law argues that the Supreme Court, in a 5\u20134 decision in ''Salinas v. Texas'',<ref> {{ussc|570|12-246|2013}}.</ref> significantly weakened the privilege, saying \"our choice to use the Fifth Amendment privilege can be used against you at trial depending exactly how and where you do it.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/law-professor-police-interrogation-law-constitution-survival |title=A Law Professor Explains Why You Should Never Talk to Police |publisher=Vice.com |year=2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Salinas'' case, justices Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy held that \"the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to defendants who simply decide to remain mute during questioning. Long-standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self-incrimination must explicitly claim that protection.\"\n\nJustice Thomas, siding with Alito, Roberts and Kennedy, in a separate opinion, held that, \"Salinas' Fifth Amendment privilege would not have been applicable even if invoked because the prosecutor's testimony regarding his silence did not compel Salinas to give self-incriminating testimony.\" Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas' opinion.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/us/supreme-court-hands-down-three-decisions-that-are-5-to-4.html\n|title=A 5-4 Ruling, One of Three, Limits Silence\u2019s Protection |work=New York Times |year=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Legal proceedings and congressional hearings===\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination applies when an individual is called to testify in a legal proceeding.<ref>See, e.g., Rule 608(b), Federal Rules of Evidence, as amended through Dec. 1, 2012.</ref> The Supreme Court ruled that the privilege applies whether the witness is in a federal court or, under the [[incorporation doctrine]] of the Fourteenth Amendment, in a state court,<ref>Michael J. Z. Mannheimer, \"Ripeness of Self-Incrimination Clause Disputes,\" ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', Vol. 95, No. 4, p. 1261, footnote 1 (Northwestern Univ. School of Law 2005), citing ''[[Malloy v. Hogan]]'', {{Ussc|378|1|1964}}).</ref> and whether the proceeding itself is criminal or civil.<ref>''[[McCarthy v. Arndstein]]'', 266 U.S. 34 (1924)).</ref>\n\nThe right to remain silent was asserted at grand jury or [[Congress of the United States|congressional]] hearings in the 1950s, when witnesses testifying before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] or the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] claimed the right in response to questions concerning their alleged membership in the [[Communist Party]]. Under the [[Red Scare]] hysteria at the time of [[McCarthyism]], witnesses who refused to answer the questions were accused as \"fifth amendment communists\". They lost jobs or positions in unions and other political organizations, and suffered other repercussions after \"taking the Fifth.\"\n\nSenator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wisc.) asked, \"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party,\" while he was chairman of the Senate Government Operations Committee Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Admitting to a previous Communist Party membership was not sufficient. Witnesses were also required to \"name names,\" to implicate others they knew to be Communists or who had been Communists in the past. [[Academy Award]] winning director [[Elia Kazan]] testified before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] that he had belonged to the Communist Party briefly in his youth. He also \"named names,\" which incurred enmity of many in Hollywood. Other entertainers such as [[Zero Mostel]] found themselves on a [[Hollywood blacklist]] after taking the Fifth, and were unable to find work for a while in show business. Pleading the Fifth in response to such questions was held inapplicable,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} since being a Communist itself was not a crime.\n\nThe amendment has also been used by defendants and witnesses in criminal cases involving the [[American Mafia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Statements made to non-governmental entities===\nThe privilege against self-incrimination does not protect an individual from being suspended from membership in a non-governmental, [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO), such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), where the individual refuses to answer questions posed by the SRO. An SRO itself is not a court of law, and cannot send a person to jail. SROs, such as the NYSE and the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]] (NASD), are generally not considered to be state actors. See ''United States v. Solomon'',<ref>509 F. 2d 863 (2d Cir. 1975).</ref> ''D. L. Cromwell Invs., Inc. v. NASD Regulation, Inc.'',<ref>132 F. Supp. 2d 248, 251-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), ''aff'd'', 279 F.3d 155, 162 (2d Cir. 2002), ''cert. denied'', 537 U.S. 1028 (2002).</ref> and ''Marchiano v. NASD''.<ref>134 F. Supp. 2d 90, 95 (D.D.C. 2001).</ref> SROs also lack subpoena powers. They rely heavily on requiring testimony from individuals by wielding the threat of loss of membership or a bar from the industry (permanent, if decided by the NASD) when the individual asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. If a person chooses to provide statements in testimony to the SRO, the SRO may provide information about those statements to law enforcement agencies, who may then use the statements in a prosecution of the individual.\n\n===Custodial interrogation===\nThe Fifth Amendment limits the use of evidence obtained illegally by law enforcement officers. Originally, at [[common law]], even a confession obtained by [[torture]] was admissible. However, by the eighteenth century, common law in England provided that coerced confessions were inadmissible. The common law rule was incorporated into American law by the courts. The Supreme Court has repeatedly overruled convictions based on such confessions, in cases such as ''[[Brown v. Mississippi]]'', {{ussc|297|278|1936}}.\n\nLaw enforcement responded by switching to more subtle techniques, but the courts held that such techniques, even if they do not involve physical torture, may render a confession involuntary and inadmissible. In ''[[Chambers v. Florida]]'' (1940) the Court held a confession obtained after five days of prolonged questioning, during which time the defendant was held incommunicado, to be coerced. In ''[[Ashcraft v. Tennessee (1944)|Ashcraft v. Tennessee]]'' (1944), the suspect had been interrogated continuously for thirty-six hours under electric lights. In ''Haynes v. Washington'',<ref>373 U.S. 503 (1963).</ref> the Court held that an \"unfair and inherently coercive context\" including a prolonged interrogation rendered a confession inadmissible.\n\n''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' (1966) was a landmark case involving confessions. [[Ernesto Miranda]] had signed a statement confessing to the crime, but the Supreme Court held that the confession was inadmissible because the defendant had not been advised of his rights.\n\nThe Court held \"the prosecution may not use statements&nbsp;... stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. Custodial interrogation is initiated by law enforcement after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of movement before being questioned as to the specifics of the crime.\n\nAs for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required. Before any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\" The warning to which Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] referred is now called the [[Miranda warning]], and it is customarily delivered by the police to an individual before questioning.\n\n''Miranda'' has been clarified by several further Supreme Court rulings. For the warning to be necessary, the questioning must be conducted under \"custodial\" circumstances. A person detained in jail or under arrest is, of course, deemed to be in police custody. Alternatively, a person who is under the ''reasonable belief'' that he may not freely leave from the restraint of law enforcement is also deemed to be in \"custody.\" That determination of \"reasonableness\" is based on a totality of the objective circumstances. A mere presence at a police station may not be sufficient, but neither is such a presence required. Traffic stops are not deemed custodial. The Court has ruled that age can be an objective factor. In ''[[Yarborough v. Alvarado]]'' (2004), the Court held that \"a state-court decision that failed to mention a 17-year-old's age as part of the Miranda custody analysis was not objectively unreasonable\".<ref name=jdb>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-11121.pdf ''J.D.B. v. North Carolina''], \"United States Supreme Court\", June 16, 2011, accessed June 20th, 2011.</ref> In her concurring opinion [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] wrote that a suspect's age may indeed \"be relevant to the 'custody' inquiry\";<ref name=alvarado>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1684.ZC.html ''Yarborough v. Alvarado''], \"United States Supreme Court\", June 1, 2004, accessed June 20th, 2011.</ref> the Court did not find it relevant in the specific case of ''Alvarado''. The Court affirmed that age could be a relevant and objective factor in ''[[J.D.B. v. North Carolina]]'' where they ruled that \"so long as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test\".<ref name=jdb />\n\nThe questioning does not have to be explicit to trigger Miranda rights. For example, two police officers engaging in a conversation designed to elicit an incriminating statement from a suspect would constitute questioning. A person may choose to waive his Miranda rights, but the prosecution has the burden of showing that such a waiver was actually made.\n\nA confession not preceded by a Miranda warning where one was necessary cannot be admitted as evidence against the confessing party in a judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court, however, has held that if a defendant voluntarily testifies at the trial that he did not commit the crime, his confession may be introduced to challenge his credibility, to \"impeach\" the witness, even if it had been obtained without the warning.\n\nIn ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that being required to identify oneself to police under states' [[stop and identify statutes]] is not an unreasonable search or seizure, and is not necessarily self-incrimination.\n\n==== Explicit invocation ====\n\nIn June 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' that a criminal suspect must now invoke the right to remain silent unambiguously.<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice Kennedy |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1470.ZO.html |title=Berghuis v. Thompkins |work=Law.cornell.edu |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}</ref> Unless and until the suspect actually states that he is relying on that right, police may continue to interact with (or question) him, and any voluntary statement he makes can be used in court. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked those rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply, even after lengthy silence, can be construed as implying a waiver. The new rule will defer to police in cases where the suspect fails to  assert the right to remain silent. This standard was extended in ''[[w:Berghuis v. Thompkins#Subsequent ruling in Salinas v. Texas|Salinas v. Texas]]'' in 2013 to cases where individuals not in custody who volunteer to answer officers' questions and who are not told their Miranda rights. The Court stated that there was no \"ritualistic formula\" necessary to assert this right, but that a person could not do so \"by simply standing mute.\"<ref>See ''Salinas v.

See ''[[United States v. Hubbell]]''. In ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'',<ref>116 U.S. 616 (1886).</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"It is equivalent to a compulsory production of papers to make the nonproduction of them a confession of the allegations which it is pretended they will prove\".\n\n====By corporations====\nCorporations may also be compelled to maintain and turn over records; the Supreme Court has held that the Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination extend only to \"natural persons.\"<ref>''U.S. v. Kordel'', {{ussc|397|1|1970}}.</ref>  The Court has also held that a corporation's custodian of records can be forced to produce corporate documents ''even'' if the act of production would incriminate him personally.<ref>''Braswell v. U.S.'', {{ussc|487|99|1988}}.</ref>  The only limitation on this rule is that the jury cannot be told that the custodian personally produced those documents in any subsequent prosecution of him, but the jury is still allowed to draw adverse inferences from the content of the documents combined with the position of the custodian in the corporation.\n\n===Refusal to testify in a criminal case===\nIn ''[[Griffin v. California]]'' (1965), the Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's [[right to silence|refusal to testify]] in his own defense. The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.<ref>{{Ussc|380|609|1965}}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to testify in a civil case===\nWhile defendants are entitled to assert the right against compelled self-incrimination in a civil court case, there are consequences to the assertion of the right in such an action.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.\" ''Baxter v. Palmigiano'',<ref>425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976).</ref> \"[A]s Mr. Justice Brandeis declared, speaking for a unanimous court in the ''Tod'' case, 'Silence is often evidence of the most persuasive character.'\"<ref>Id. at 319 (quoting ''United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod'', 263 U.S. 149, 153\u2013154 (1923)).</ref> \"'Failure to contest an assertion&nbsp;... is considered evidence of acquiescence&nbsp;... if it would have been natural under the circumstances to object to the assertion in question.'\"<ref>Id. (quoting ''United States v. Hale'', 422 U.S. 171, 176 (1975)).</ref>\n\nIn ''Baxter'', the state was entitled to an adverse inference against Palmigiano because of the evidence against him and his assertion of the Fifth Amendment right.\n\nSome civil cases are considered \"criminal cases\" for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"A proceeding to forfeit a person's goods for an offence against the laws, though civil in form, and whether in rem or in personam, is a \"criminal case\" within the meaning of that part of the Fifth Amendment which declares that no person \"shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/116/616/case.html|title=Boyd v.

In ''United States v. Sullivan'',<ref>{{Ussc|274|259|1927}}.</ref> the United States Supreme Court ruled that a taxpayer could not invoke the Fifth Amendment's protections as the basis for refusing to file a required federal income tax return. The Court stated: \"If the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was protected from making[,] he could have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all. We are not called on to decide what, if anything, he might have withheld.\"<ref>''United States v. Sullivan'', 274 U.S. 259 (1927).</ref>\n\nIn ''Garner v. United States'',<ref>{{Ussc|424|648|1976}}.</ref> the defendant was convicted of crimes involving a conspiracy to \"fix\" sporting contests and to transmit illegal bets. During the trial the prosecutor introduced, as evidence, the taxpayer's federal income tax returns for various years. In one return the taxpayer had showed his occupation to be \"professional gambler.\" In various returns the taxpayer had reported income from \"gambling\" or \"wagering.\" The prosecution used this to help contradict the taxpayer's argument that his involvement was innocent. The taxpayer tried unsuccessfully to keep the prosecutor from introducing the tax returns as evidence, arguing that since the taxpayer was legally required to report the illegal income on the returns, he was being compelled to be a witness against himself. The Supreme Court agreed that he was legally required to report the [[Taxation of illegal income in the United States|illegal income]] on the returns, but ruled that the right against self-incrimination still did not apply. The Court stated that \"if a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the right, the Government has not 'compelled' him to incriminate himself.\"<ref>''Garner v. United States'', 424 U.S. 648 (1976).</ref>\n\n''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'' are viewed as standing, in tandem, for the proposition that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer would probably have to report the amount of the illegal income, but might validly claim the right by labeling the item \"Fifth Amendment\" (instead of \"illegal gambling income,\" \"illegal drug sales,\" etc.)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miniter |first1=Frank |title=Saving the Bill of Rights: Exposing the Left's Campaign to Destroy American Exceptionalism |publisher=Regnery Publishing |year=2011 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781596981508/page/204 204] |isbn=978-1-59698-150-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781596981508/page/204 }}</ref> The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has stated: \"Although the source of income might be privileged, the amount must be reported.\"<ref>''United States v. Pilcher'', 672 F.2d 875 (11th Cir.), ''cert. denied'', 459 U.S. 973 (1982).</ref> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stated: \".&nbsp;... the ''amount'' of a taxpayer's income is not privileged even though the ''source'' of income may be, and Fifth Amendment rights can be exercised in compliance with the tax laws \"by simply listing his alleged ill-gotten gains in the space provided for 'miscellaneous' income on his tax form.\"<ref>''United States v. Wade'', 585 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1978), ''cert. denied'', 440 U.S. 928 (1979) (italics in original).</ref> In another case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: \"While the ''source'' of some of [the defendant] Johnson's income may have been privileged, assuming that the jury believed his uncorroborated testimony that he had illegal dealings in gold in 1970 and 1971, the ''amount'' of his income was not privileged and he was required to pay taxes on it.\"<ref>''United States v. Johnson'', 577 F.2d 1304 (5th Cir. 1978) (italics in original).</ref> In 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated: \"A careful reading of ''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'', therefore, is that the self-incrimination privilege can be employed to protect the taxpayer from revealing the information as to an illegal source of income, but does not protect him from disclosing the amount of his income.\"<ref>''United States v. Brown'', 600 F.2d 248 (10th Cir. 1979).</ref>\n\n===Grants of immunity===\nIf the government gives an individual immunity, then that individual may be compelled to testify. Immunity may be \"transactional immunity\" or \"use immunity\"; in the former, the witness is immune from prosecution for offenses related to the testimony; in the latter, the witness may be prosecuted, but his testimony may not be used against him. In ''[[Kastigar v. United States]]'',<ref>{{ussc|406|441|1972}}.</ref> the Supreme Court held that the government need only grant use immunity to compel testimony. The use immunity, however, must extend not only to the testimony made by the witness, but also to all evidence derived therefrom. This scenario most commonly arises in cases related to [[organized crime]].\n\n===Record keeping===\nA statutorily required record-keeping system may go too far such that it implicates a record-keeper's right against self-incrimination. A three part test laid out by ''[[Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board]]'',<ref>382 U.S. 70 (1965).</ref> is used to determine this: 1. the law targets a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities; 2. the activities sought to be regulated are already permeated with criminal statutes as opposed to essentially being non-criminal and largely regulatory; and 3. the disclosure compelled creates a likelihood of prosecution and is used against the record-keeper.  In this case, the Supreme Court struck down an order by the [[Subversive Activities Control Board]] requiring members of the [[Communist Party of the United States|Communist Party]] to register with the government and upheld an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, on the grounds that statute under which the order had been issued was \"directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.\"\n\nIn ''[[Leary v. United States]]'',<ref>395 U.S. 6 (1969).</ref> the court struck down the [[Marijuana Tax Act]] because its record keeping statute required [[self-incrimination]].\n\nIn ''[[Haynes v. United States]]'',<ref>390 U.S. 85 (1968).</ref> the Supreme Court ruled that, because convicted felons are prohibited from owning firearms, requiring felons to register any firearms they owned constituted a form of [[self-incrimination]] and was therefore unconstitutional.\n\n===Combinations and passwords===\nWhile no such case has yet arisen, the Supreme Court has indicated that a respondent cannot be compelled to turn over \"the contents of his own mind\", e.g. he cannot be compelled to reveal the password to a bank account if doing so would prove the existence of the bank account under his control.<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice Blackmun |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/201#writing-type-1-BLACKMUN |title=John Doe v.

In ''Boucher'', production of the unencrypted drive was deemed not to be a self-incriminating act, as the government already had sufficient evidence to tie the encrypted data to the defendant.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=[[In re Boucher|In re Grand Jury Subpoena to Sebastien Boucher]] |vol= |reporter= |opinion=No. 2:06-mj-91, 2009 WL 424718 |pinpoint= |court=D.

This provision of the Fifth Amendment originally applied only to the federal government, but the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1897 case ''[[Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago|Chicago, B. & Q. Railroad Co. v. Chicago]]'' that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extended the effects of that provision to the states. The federal courts, however, have shown much deference to the determinations of Congress, and even more so to the determinations of the state legislatures, of what constitutes \"public use\". The property need not actually be used by the public; rather, it must be used or disposed of in such a manner as to benefit the public welfare or public interest. One exception that restrains the federal government is that the property must be used in exercise of a government's enumerated powers.\n\nThe owner of the property that is taken by the government must be justly compensated. When determining the amount that must be paid, the government does not need to take into account any speculative schemes in which the owner claims the property was intended to be used. Normally, the [[fair market value]] of the property determines \"just compensation\". If the property is taken before the payment is made, interest accrues (though the courts have refrained from using the term \"interest\"). \n\nProperty under the Fifth Amend includes [[Contract|contractual rights]] stemming from contracts between the United States, a [[U.S. state]] or any of its subdivisions and the other contract partner(s), because contractual rights are property rights for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>{{cite web |author=Timothy Stoltzfus Jost (Professor of Law at the Washington and Lee University School of \nLaw)|title=The Operation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Risk Corridor Program, p. 5 and 6 with reference to the United States Supreme case ''Lynch v.

The court stated said:\"''The Fifth Amendment commands that property be not taken without making just compensation.  Valid contracts are property, whether the obligor be a private individual, a municipality, a state, or the United States.

This was upheld on June 23, 2005, when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]].'' This 5\u20134 decision remains controversial. The majority opinion, by [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], found that it was appropriate to defer to the city's decision that the development plan had a public purpose, saying that \"the city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue.\" Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion observed that in this particular case the development plan was not \"of primary benefit to&nbsp;... the developer\" and that if that was the case the plan might have been impermissible. In the dissent, Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] argued that this decision would allow the rich to benefit at the expense of the poor, asserting that \"Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.\" She argued that the decision eliminates \"any distinction between private and [[public use]] of property\u2014and thereby effectively delete[s] the words 'for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\". A number of states, in response to ''Kelo'', have passed laws and/or state constitutional amendments which make it more difficult for state governments to seize private land. Takings that are not \"for public use\" are not directly covered by the doctrine,<ref>''See'' [[Berman v. Parker]].</ref> however such a taking might violate [[Due process in the United States|due process]] rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendment]], or other applicable law.\n\nThe exercise of the police power of the state resulting in a taking of private property was long held to be an exception to the requirement of government paying just compensation. However the growing trend under the various state constitution's taking clauses is to compensate innocent third parties whose property was destroyed or \"taken\" as a result of police action.<ref>''Wegner v.Milwaukee Mutual, City of Minneapolis'' 479 N.W.2d 38 (Minn. 1991) and ''Steele v.

In ''[[United States v. 50 Acres of Land]] (1984)'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] wrote that \"The Court has repeatedly held that just compensation normally is to be measured by \"the market value of the property at the time of the taking contemporaneously paid in money.\" ''[[Olson v. United States]]'', 292 U.S. 246 (1934) &nbsp;...

It was ratified in 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. The Fifth Amendment applies to every level of the government, including the federal, state, and local levels, as well as any corporation, private enterprise, group, or individual, or any foreign government in regard to a US citizen or resident of the US. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] furthered the protections of this amendment through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\nOne provision of the Fifth Amendment requires that [[felony|felonies]] be tried only upon [[indictment#United States|indictment]] by a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]]. Another provision, the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]], provides the right of defendants to be tried only once in federal court for the same offense. The self-incrimination clause provides various protections against self-incrimination, including the right of an individual to not serve as a witness in a criminal case in which they are the defendant. \"Pleading the Fifth\" is a colloquial term often used to invoke the self-incrimination clause when witnesses decline to answer questions where the answers might incriminate them. In the 1966 case of ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', the Supreme Court held that the self-incrimination clause requires the police to issue a [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]] to criminal suspects interrogated while under police custody. The Fifth Amendment also contains the Takings Clause, which allows the federal government to [[eminent domain|take private property for public use]] if the government provides \"just compensation.\"\n\nLike the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment includes a due process clause stating that no person shall \"be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The Fifth Amendment's due process clause applies to the federal government, while the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause applies to state governments. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause as providing two main protections: [[procedural due process]], which requires government officials to follow fair procedures before depriving a person of life, liberty, or property, and [[substantive due process]], which protects certain [[fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental rights]] from government interference. The Supreme Court has also held that the Due Process Clause contains a [[Vagueness doctrine|prohibition against vague laws]] and an implied equal protection requirement similar to the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]].\n\n==Text==\nThe amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows:\n{{quote|No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.}}\n{{wide image|Amendment_5.jpg|1999px|The hand-written copy of the proposed Bill of Rights, 1789, cropped to just show the text that would later be ratified as the Fifth Amendment}}\n\n==Background before adoption==\n[[File:James Madison(cropped)(c).jpg|thumb|James Madison, drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]]] On June 8, 1789, Congressman [[James Madison]] introduced several proposed constitutional amendments during a speech to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name=speech>[https://www.archives.gov/legislative/resources/education/bill-of-rights/images/handout-2.pdf \"James Madison's Proposed Amendments to the Constitution\"], ''[[Congressional Record|Annals of Congress]]'' (June 8, 1789).</ref> His draft language that later became the Fifth Amendment was as follows:<ref>Obrien, David.  [http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2581&context=ndlr \"Fifth Amendment: Fox Hunters, Old Women, Hermits, and the Burger Court\"], ''[[Notre Dame Law Review]]'', Vol. 54, p. 30 (1978).</ref><ref name=speech />\n\n<blockquote>No person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment or trial for the same offense; nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor be obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation....[E]xcept in cases of impeachments, and cases arising in the land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service, in time of war or public danger...in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member, presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary....</blockquote>\n\nThis draft was edited by Congress; all the material before the first ellipsis was placed at the end, and some of the wording was modified.  After approval by Congress, the amendment was ratified by the states on December 15, 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].  Every one of the five clauses in the final amendment appeared in Madison's draft, and in their final order those clauses are the [[Grand juries in the United States#Grand Jury Clause|Grand Jury Clause]] (which Madison had placed last), the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]], the [[Self-incrimination#United States law|Self Incrimination Clause]], the [[Due Process Clause]], and then the [[Takings Clause]].\n\n==Grand jury==\n{{further|Grand juries in the United States}}\nThe [[grand jury]] is a pre-constitutional common law institution, and a constitutional fixture in its own right exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states to the extent that the states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. \"Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the grand jury is similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [p688] majority of the States.\" Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. [[Grand jury|Grand juries]], which return [[indictment]]s in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given [[Jury instructions|specific instructions regarding the law]] by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the [[exclusionary rule]] does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], Fifth or [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth amendments]] cannot be introduced in court.<ref>''[[United States v. Calandra]]'', {{ussc|414|338|1974}}</ref> Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present in the grand jury room during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave the grand jury room to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.\n\n[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb| The Bill of Rights in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]\nCurrently, federal law permits the trial of [[misdemeanor]]s without indictments.<ref>''[[Duke v. United States]]'', {{ussc|301|492|1937}}</ref> Additionally, in trials of non-capital felonies, the prosecution may proceed without indictments if the defendants waive their Fifth Amendment right.\n\nGrand jury indictments may be amended by the prosecution only in limited circumstances. In ''[[Ex Parte Bain]]'', {{ussc|121|1|1887}}, the Supreme Court held that the indictment could not be changed at all by the prosecution. ''United States v. Miller'', {{ussc|471|130|1985}} partly reversed ''Ex parte Bain''; now, an indictment's scope may be narrowed by the prosecution. Thus, lesser included charges may be dropped, but new charges may not be added.\n\nThe Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not protect those serving in the armed forces, whether during wartime or peacetime. Members of the state militia called up to serve with federal forces are not protected under the clause either. In ''[[O'Callahan v. Parker]]'', {{ussc|395|258|1969}}, the Supreme Court held that only charges relating to service may be brought against members of the militia without indictments. That decision was overturned in 1987, when the Court held that members of the militia in actual service may be tried for any offense without indictments.<ref>''[[Solorio v. United States]]'', {{ussc|483|435|1987}}</ref>\n\nThe grand jury indictment clause of the Fifth Amendment has not been [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>''[[Hurtado v. California]]'', {{ussc|110|517|1884}}</ref> This means that the grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states ''do'' employ grand juries, no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish grand juries, and many (though not all) have replaced them with [[preliminary hearing]].\n\n===Infamous crime===\nWhether a crime is \"infamous\", for purposes of the Grand Jury Clause, is determined by the nature of the punishment that may be imposed, not the punishment that is actually imposed;<ref>''[[Ex parte Wilson]]'', {{ussc|114|417|1885}}</ref> however, crimes punishable by [[Capital punishment in the United States|death]] must be tried upon [[indictment]]s. The historical origin of \"infamous crime\" comes from the ''[[infamia]]'', a punishment under Roman law by which a citizen was deprived of his citizenship.<ref>United States v.

Moreland]]'', {{ussc|258|433|1922}}, the Supreme Court held that incarceration in a prison or penitentiary, as opposed to a correction or reformation house, attaches infamy to a crime. In ''[[s:Mackin v. United States|Mackin v. United States]]'', {{ussc|117|348|1886}}, the Supreme Court judged that \"'Infamous crimes' are thus, in the most explicit words, defined to be those 'punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.'\", while it later in ''[[s:Green v. United States (356 U.S. 165)|Green v. United States]]'' {{ussc|356|165|1957}}, stated that \"imprisonment in a penitentiary can be imposed only if a crime is subject to imprisonment exceeding one year\". Therefore, an infamous crime is one that is punished by imprisonment for over one year. Susan Brown, a former defense attorney and Professor of Law at the [[University of Dayton School of Law]], concluded: \"Since this is essentially the definition of a [[felony]], infamous crimes translate as felonies.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Susan|title=Federal Grand Jury - \"Infamous crimes\"--part 1|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/~grandjur/feedback/feedba10.htm|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Double jeopardy==\n{{main|Double Jeopardy Clause}}\n: ...nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb...<ref name = \"fifth amendment double jeopardy\">{{cite book | last = Harper | first = Timothy | title = The Complete Idiot's Guide to the U.S. Constitution | publisher = Penguin Group | date = October 2, 2007 | page = 109 | isbn = 978-1-59257-627-2 |quote= \"However, the Fifth Amendment contains several other important provisions for protecting your rights.

Refusal to take this oath usually was regarded as proof of guilt.}}</ref> Anyone refusing to take the oath ''ex officio mero'' (confessions or swearing of innocence, usually before hearing any charges) was considered guilty.<ref name=\"[[ex-officio-mero]]\" /> Suspected [[Puritans]] were pressed to take the oath and then reveal names of other Puritans. Coercion and torture were commonly used to compel \"cooperation.\" Puritans, who were at the time fleeing to the [[New World]], began a practice of refusing to cooperate with interrogations. In the most famous case [[John Lilburne]] refused to take the oath in 1637. His case and his call for \"[[freeborn]] rights\" were rallying points for reforms against forced oaths, forced self-incrimination, and other kinds of coercion. [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s revolution overturned the practice and incorporated protections, in response to a popular group of English citizens known as the [[Levellers]]. The Levellers presented ''The Humble Petition of Many Thousands'' to [[Parliament]] in 1647 with 13 demands, the third of which was the right against self-incrimination in criminal cases. These protections were brought to America by Puritans, and were later incorporated into the United States Constitution through the Bill of Rights.\n\nProtection against compelled self-incrimination is implicit in the [[Miranda rights]] statement, which protects the \"right to remain silent.\" This amendment is also similar to [[Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries like [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the right to silence of the accused both during questioning and at trial is regarded as an important right inherited from common law, and is protected in the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]] and in Australia through various federal and state acts and codes governing the criminal justice system.\n\nIn [[South Africa]]n law the right to silence originating from English common law has been entrenched in Section 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"a witness may have a reasonable fear of prosecution and yet be innocent of any wrongdoing. The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\"<ref>''Ohio v. Reiner'', {{ussc|532|17|2001}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, Professor James Duane of the [[Regent University]] School of Law argues that the Supreme Court, in a 5\u20134 decision in ''Salinas v. Texas'',<ref> {{ussc|570|12-246|2013}}.</ref> significantly weakened the privilege, saying \"our choice to use the Fifth Amendment privilege can be used against you at trial depending exactly how and where you do it.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/law-professor-police-interrogation-law-constitution-survival |title=A Law Professor Explains Why You Should Never Talk to Police |publisher=Vice.com |year=2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Salinas'' case, justices Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy held that \"the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to defendants who simply decide to remain mute during questioning. Long-standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self-incrimination must explicitly claim that protection.\"\n\nJustice Thomas, siding with Alito, Roberts and Kennedy, in a separate opinion, held that, \"Salinas' Fifth Amendment privilege would not have been applicable even if invoked because the prosecutor's testimony regarding his silence did not compel Salinas to give self-incriminating testimony.\" Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas' opinion.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/us/supreme-court-hands-down-three-decisions-that-are-5-to-4.html\n|title=A 5-4 Ruling, One of Three, Limits Silence\u2019s Protection |work=New York Times |year=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Legal proceedings and congressional hearings===\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination applies when an individual is called to testify in a legal proceeding.<ref>See, e.g., Rule 608(b), Federal Rules of Evidence, as amended through Dec. 1, 2012.</ref> The Supreme Court ruled that the privilege applies whether the witness is in a federal court or, under the [[incorporation doctrine]] of the Fourteenth Amendment, in a state court,<ref>Michael J. Z. Mannheimer, \"Ripeness of Self-Incrimination Clause Disputes,\" ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', Vol. 95, No. 4, p. 1261, footnote 1 (Northwestern Univ. School of Law 2005), citing ''[[Malloy v. Hogan]]'', {{Ussc|378|1|1964}}).</ref> and whether the proceeding itself is criminal or civil.<ref>''[[McCarthy v. Arndstein]]'', 266 U.S. 34 (1924)).</ref>\n\nThe right to remain silent was asserted at grand jury or [[Congress of the United States|congressional]] hearings in the 1950s, when witnesses testifying before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] or the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] claimed the right in response to questions concerning their alleged membership in the [[Communist Party]]. Under the [[Red Scare]] hysteria at the time of [[McCarthyism]], witnesses who refused to answer the questions were accused as \"fifth amendment communists\". They lost jobs or positions in unions and other political organizations, and suffered other repercussions after \"taking the Fifth.\"\n\nSenator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wisc.) asked, \"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party,\" while he was chairman of the Senate Government Operations Committee Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Admitting to a previous Communist Party membership was not sufficient. Witnesses were also required to \"name names,\" to implicate others they knew to be Communists or who had been Communists in the past. [[Academy Award]] winning director [[Elia Kazan]] testified before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] that he had belonged to the Communist Party briefly in his youth. He also \"named names,\" which incurred enmity of many in Hollywood. Other entertainers such as [[Zero Mostel]] found themselves on a [[Hollywood blacklist]] after taking the Fifth, and were unable to find work for a while in show business. Pleading the Fifth in response to such questions was held inapplicable,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} since being a Communist itself was not a crime.\n\nThe amendment has also been used by defendants and witnesses in criminal cases involving the [[American Mafia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Statements made to non-governmental entities===\nThe privilege against self-incrimination does not protect an individual from being suspended from membership in a non-governmental, [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO), such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), where the individual refuses to answer questions posed by the SRO. An SRO itself is not a court of law, and cannot send a person to jail. SROs, such as the NYSE and the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]] (NASD), are generally not considered to be state actors. See ''United States v. Solomon'',<ref>509 F. 2d 863 (2d Cir. 1975).</ref> ''D. L. Cromwell Invs., Inc. v. NASD Regulation, Inc.'',<ref>132 F. Supp. 2d 248, 251-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), ''aff'd'', 279 F.3d 155, 162 (2d Cir. 2002), ''cert. denied'', 537 U.S. 1028 (2002).</ref> and ''Marchiano v. NASD''.<ref>134 F. Supp. 2d 90, 95 (D.D.C. 2001).</ref> SROs also lack subpoena powers. They rely heavily on requiring testimony from individuals by wielding the threat of loss of membership or a bar from the industry (permanent, if decided by the NASD) when the individual asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. If a person chooses to provide statements in testimony to the SRO, the SRO may provide information about those statements to law enforcement agencies, who may then use the statements in a prosecution of the individual.\n\n===Custodial interrogation===\nThe Fifth Amendment limits the use of evidence obtained illegally by law enforcement officers. Originally, at [[common law]], even a confession obtained by [[torture]] was admissible. However, by the eighteenth century, common law in England provided that coerced confessions were inadmissible. The common law rule was incorporated into American law by the courts. The Supreme Court has repeatedly overruled convictions based on such confessions, in cases such as ''[[Brown v. Mississippi]]'', {{ussc|297|278|1936}}.\n\nLaw enforcement responded by switching to more subtle techniques, but the courts held that such techniques, even if they do not involve physical torture, may render a confession involuntary and inadmissible. In ''[[Chambers v. Florida]]'' (1940) the Court held a confession obtained after five days of prolonged questioning, during which time the defendant was held incommunicado, to be coerced. In ''[[Ashcraft v. Tennessee (1944)|Ashcraft v. Tennessee]]'' (1944), the suspect had been interrogated continuously for thirty-six hours under electric lights. In ''Haynes v. Washington'',<ref>373 U.S. 503 (1963).</ref> the Court held that an \"unfair and inherently coercive context\" including a prolonged interrogation rendered a confession inadmissible.\n\n''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' (1966) was a landmark case involving confessions. [[Ernesto Miranda]] had signed a statement confessing to the crime, but the Supreme Court held that the confession was inadmissible because the defendant had not been advised of his rights.\n\nThe Court held \"the prosecution may not use statements&nbsp;... stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. Custodial interrogation is initiated by law enforcement after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of movement before being questioned as to the specifics of the crime.\n\nAs for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required. Before any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\" The warning to which Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] referred is now called the [[Miranda warning]], and it is customarily delivered by the police to an individual before questioning.\n\n''Miranda'' has been clarified by several further Supreme Court rulings. For the warning to be necessary, the questioning must be conducted under \"custodial\" circumstances. A person detained in jail or under arrest is, of course, deemed to be in police custody. Alternatively, a person who is under the ''reasonable belief'' that he may not freely leave from the restraint of law enforcement is also deemed to be in \"custody.\" That determination of \"reasonableness\" is based on a totality of the objective circumstances. A mere presence at a police station may not be sufficient, but neither is such a presence required. Traffic stops are not deemed custodial. The Court has ruled that age can be an objective factor. In ''[[Yarborough v. Alvarado]]'' (2004), the Court held that \"a state-court decision that failed to mention a 17-year-old's age as part of the Miranda custody analysis was not objectively unreasonable\".<ref name=jdb>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-11121.pdf ''J.D.B. v. North Carolina''], \"United States Supreme Court\", June 16, 2011, accessed June 20th, 2011.</ref> In her concurring opinion [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] wrote that a suspect's age may indeed \"be relevant to the 'custody' inquiry\";<ref name=alvarado>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1684.ZC.html ''Yarborough v. Alvarado''], \"United States Supreme Court\", June 1, 2004, accessed June 20th, 2011.</ref> the Court did not find it relevant in the specific case of ''Alvarado''. The Court affirmed that age could be a relevant and objective factor in ''[[J.D.B. v. North Carolina]]'' where they ruled that \"so long as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test\".<ref name=jdb />\n\nThe questioning does not have to be explicit to trigger Miranda rights. For example, two police officers engaging in a conversation designed to elicit an incriminating statement from a suspect would constitute questioning. A person may choose to waive his Miranda rights, but the prosecution has the burden of showing that such a waiver was actually made.\n\nA confession not preceded by a Miranda warning where one was necessary cannot be admitted as evidence against the confessing party in a judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court, however, has held that if a defendant voluntarily testifies at the trial that he did not commit the crime, his confession may be introduced to challenge his credibility, to \"impeach\" the witness, even if it had been obtained without the warning.\n\nIn ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that being required to identify oneself to police under states' [[stop and identify statutes]] is not an unreasonable search or seizure, and is not necessarily self-incrimination.\n\n==== Explicit invocation ====\n\nIn June 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' that a criminal suspect must now invoke the right to remain silent unambiguously.<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice Kennedy |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1470.ZO.html |title=Berghuis v. Thompkins |work=Law.cornell.edu |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}</ref> Unless and until the suspect actually states that he is relying on that right, police may continue to interact with (or question) him, and any voluntary statement he makes can be used in court. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked those rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply, even after lengthy silence, can be construed as implying a waiver. The new rule will defer to police in cases where the suspect fails to  assert the right to remain silent. This standard was extended in ''[[w:Berghuis v. Thompkins#Subsequent ruling in Salinas v. Texas|Salinas v. Texas]]'' in 2013 to cases where individuals not in custody who volunteer to answer officers' questions and who are not told their Miranda rights. The Court stated that there was no \"ritualistic formula\" necessary to assert this right, but that a person could not do so \"by simply standing mute.\"<ref>See ''Salinas v.

See ''[[United States v. Hubbell]]''. In ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'',<ref>116 U.S. 616 (1886).</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"It is equivalent to a compulsory production of papers to make the nonproduction of them a confession of the allegations which it is pretended they will prove\".\n\n====By corporations====\nCorporations may also be compelled to maintain and turn over records; the Supreme Court has held that the Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination extend only to \"natural persons.\"<ref>''U.S. v. Kordel'', {{ussc|397|1|1970}}.</ref>  The Court has also held that a corporation's custodian of records can be forced to produce corporate documents ''even'' if the act of production would incriminate him personally.<ref>''Braswell v. U.S.'', {{ussc|487|99|1988}}.</ref>  The only limitation on this rule is that the jury cannot be told that the custodian personally produced those documents in any subsequent prosecution of him, but the jury is still allowed to draw adverse inferences from the content of the documents combined with the position of the custodian in the corporation.\n\n===Refusal to testify in a criminal case===\nIn ''[[Griffin v. California]]'' (1965), the Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's [[right to silence|refusal to testify]] in his own defense. The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.<ref>{{Ussc|380|609|1965}}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to testify in a civil case===\nWhile defendants are entitled to assert the right against compelled self-incrimination in a civil court case, there are consequences to the assertion of the right in such an action.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.\" ''Baxter v. Palmigiano'',<ref>425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976).</ref> \"[A]s Mr. Justice Brandeis declared, speaking for a unanimous court in the ''Tod'' case, 'Silence is often evidence of the most persuasive character.'\"<ref>Id. at 319 (quoting ''United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod'', 263 U.S. 149, 153\u2013154 (1923)).</ref> \"'Failure to contest an assertion&nbsp;... is considered evidence of acquiescence&nbsp;... if it would have been natural under the circumstances to object to the assertion in question.'\"<ref>Id.

In ''[[Boyd v.

In ''United States v. Sullivan'',<ref>{{Ussc|274|259|1927}}.</ref> the United States Supreme Court ruled that a taxpayer could not invoke the Fifth Amendment's protections as the basis for refusing to file a required federal income tax return. The Court stated: \"If the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was protected from making[,] he could have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all. We are not called on to decide what, if anything, he might have withheld.\"<ref>''United States v. Sullivan'', 274 U.S. 259 (1927).</ref>\n\nIn ''Garner v. United States'',<ref>{{Ussc|424|648|1976}}.</ref> the defendant was convicted of crimes involving a conspiracy to \"fix\" sporting contests and to transmit illegal bets. During the trial the prosecutor introduced, as evidence, the taxpayer's federal income tax returns for various years. In one return the taxpayer had showed his occupation to be \"professional gambler.\" In various returns the taxpayer had reported income from \"gambling\" or \"wagering.\" The prosecution used this to help contradict the taxpayer's argument that his involvement was innocent. The taxpayer tried unsuccessfully to keep the prosecutor from introducing the tax returns as evidence, arguing that since the taxpayer was legally required to report the illegal income on the returns, he was being compelled to be a witness against himself. The Supreme Court agreed that he was legally required to report the [[Taxation of illegal income in the United States|illegal income]] on the returns, but ruled that the right against self-incrimination still did not apply. The Court stated that \"if a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the right, the Government has not 'compelled' him to incriminate himself.\"<ref>''Garner v. United States'', 424 U.S. 648 (1976).</ref>\n\n''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'' are viewed as standing, in tandem, for the proposition that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer would probably have to report the amount of the illegal income, but might validly claim the right by labeling the item \"Fifth Amendment\" (instead of \"illegal gambling income,\" \"illegal drug sales,\" etc.)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miniter |first1=Frank |title=Saving the Bill of Rights: Exposing the Left's Campaign to Destroy American Exceptionalism |publisher=Regnery Publishing |year=2011 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781596981508/page/204 204] |isbn=978-1-59698-150-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781596981508/page/204 }}</ref> The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has stated: \"Although the source of income might be privileged, the amount must be reported.\"<ref>''United States v.

Wade'', 585 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1978), ''cert. denied'', 440 U.S. 928 (1979) (italics in original).</ref> In another case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: \"While the ''source'' of some of [the defendant] Johnson's income may have been privileged, assuming that the jury believed his uncorroborated testimony that he had illegal dealings in gold in 1970 and 1971, the ''amount'' of his income was not privileged and he was required to pay taxes on it.\"<ref>''United States v. Johnson'', 577 F.2d 1304 (5th Cir. 1978) (italics in original).</ref> In 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated: \"A careful reading of ''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'', therefore, is that the self-incrimination privilege can be employed to protect the taxpayer from revealing the information as to an illegal source of income, but does not protect him from disclosing the amount of his income.\"<ref>''United States v. Brown'', 600 F.2d 248 (10th Cir. 1979).</ref>\n\n===Grants of immunity===\nIf the government gives an individual immunity, then that individual may be compelled to testify. Immunity may be \"transactional immunity\" or \"use immunity\"; in the former, the witness is immune from prosecution for offenses related to the testimony; in the latter, the witness may be prosecuted, but his testimony may not be used against him. In ''[[Kastigar v. United States]]'',<ref>{{ussc|406|441|1972}}.</ref> the Supreme Court held that the government need only grant use immunity to compel testimony. The use immunity, however, must extend not only to the testimony made by the witness, but also to all evidence derived therefrom. This scenario most commonly arises in cases related to [[organized crime]].\n\n===Record keeping===\nA statutorily required record-keeping system may go too far such that it implicates a record-keeper's right against self-incrimination. A three part test laid out by ''[[Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board]]'',<ref>382 U.S. 70 (1965).</ref> is used to determine this: 1. the law targets a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities; 2. the activities sought to be regulated are already permeated with criminal statutes as opposed to essentially being non-criminal and largely regulatory; and 3. the disclosure compelled creates a likelihood of prosecution and is used against the record-keeper.  In this case, the Supreme Court struck down an order by the [[Subversive Activities Control Board]] requiring members of the [[Communist Party of the United States|Communist Party]] to register with the government and upheld an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, on the grounds that statute under which the order had been issued was \"directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.\"\n\nIn ''[[Leary v. United States]]'',<ref>395 U.S. 6 (1969).</ref> the court struck down the [[Marijuana Tax Act]] because its record keeping statute required [[self-incrimination]].\n\nIn ''[[Haynes v. United States]]'',<ref>390 U.S. 85 (1968).</ref> the Supreme Court ruled that, because convicted felons are prohibited from owning firearms, requiring felons to register any firearms they owned constituted a form of [[self-incrimination]] and was therefore unconstitutional.\n\n===Combinations and passwords===\nWhile no such case has yet arisen, the Supreme Court has indicated that a respondent cannot be compelled to turn over \"the contents of his own mind\", e.g. he cannot be compelled to reveal the password to a bank account if doing so would prove the existence of the bank account under his control.<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice Blackmun |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/201#writing-type-1-BLACKMUN |title=John Doe v.

This provision of the Fifth Amendment originally applied only to the federal government, but the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1897 case ''[[Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago|Chicago, B. & Q. Railroad Co. v. Chicago]]'' that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extended the effects of that provision to the states. The federal courts, however, have shown much deference to the determinations of Congress, and even more so to the determinations of the state legislatures, of what constitutes \"public use\". The property need not actually be used by the public; rather, it must be used or disposed of in such a manner as to benefit the public welfare or public interest. One exception that restrains the federal government is that the property must be used in exercise of a government's enumerated powers.\n\nThe owner of the property that is taken by the government must be justly compensated. When determining the amount that must be paid, the government does not need to take into account any speculative schemes in which the owner claims the property was intended to be used. Normally, the [[fair market value]] of the property determines \"just compensation\". If the property is taken before the payment is made, interest accrues (though the courts have refrained from using the term \"interest\"). \n\nProperty under the Fifth Amend includes [[Contract|contractual rights]] stemming from contracts between the United States, a [[U.S. state]] or any of its subdivisions and its contract partners, because contractual rights are property rights for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.<ref>{{cite web |author=Timothy Stoltzfus Jost (Professor of Law at the Washington and Lee University School of \nLaw)|title=The Operation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Risk Corridor Program, p. 5 and 6 with reference to the United States Supreme case ''Lynch v.

The court stated said:\"''The Fifth Amendment commands that property be not taken without making just compensation.  Valid contracts are property, whether the obligor be a private individual, a municipality, a state, or the United States. Rights against the United States arising out of a contract with it are protected by the Fifth Amendment. United States v. Central Pacific R. Co., 118 U. S. 235, 118 U. S. 238; United States v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 256 U. S. 51, 256 U. S. 64, 256 U. S. 67.

This was upheld on June 23, 2005, when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]].'' This 5\u20134 decision remains controversial. The majority opinion, by [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], found that it was appropriate to defer to the city's decision that the development plan had a public purpose, saying that \"the city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue.\" Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion observed that in this particular case the development plan was not \"of primary benefit to&nbsp;... the developer\" and that if that was the case the plan might have been impermissible. In the dissent, Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] argued that this decision would allow the rich to benefit at the expense of the poor, asserting that \"Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.\" She argued that the decision eliminates \"any distinction between private and [[public use]] of property\u2014and thereby effectively delete[s] the words 'for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\". A number of states, in response to ''Kelo'', have passed laws and/or state constitutional amendments which make it more difficult for state governments to seize private land. Takings that are not \"for public use\" are not directly covered by the doctrine,<ref>''See'' [[Berman v. Parker]].</ref> however such a taking might violate [[Due process in the United States|due process]] rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendment]], or other applicable law.\n\nThe exercise of the police power of the state resulting in a taking of private property was long held to be an exception to the requirement of government paying just compensation. However the growing trend under the various state constitution's taking clauses is to compensate innocent third parties whose property was destroyed or \"taken\" as a result of police action.<ref>''Wegner v.Milwaukee Mutual, City of Minneapolis'' 479 N.W.2d 38 (Minn. 1991) and ''Steele v. City of Houston'' 603 S.W.2d 786 (1980)</ref>\n\n===\"Just compensation\"===\nThe last two words of the amendment promise \"just compensation\" for takings by the government. In ''[[United States v. 50 Acres of Land]] (1984)'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] wrote that \"The Court has repeatedly held that just compensation normally is to be measured by \"the market value of the property at the time of the taking contemporaneously paid in money.\" ''[[Olson v. United States]]'', 292 U.S. 246 (1934) &nbsp;...

Aguadilla is spread over 15 wards and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of [[Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nAccording to sources, a [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] settlement called Amam\u00f3n was located close to the [[Culebrinas River]].<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107001412/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html |date=November 7, 2012 }} on Proyecto Salon Hogar</ref>\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]. In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official.

In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the [[Strategic Air Command]] [[72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy]] equipped with [[B-52]]s, an important strategic facility during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the [[Rafael Hernandez International Airport]]. The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel.

Ramey is also the site of the new Ramey Skating Park and a new \"mariposario\" (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.\n\nThere is still an active part of the base that hosts the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other, characteristics of a small town. Also, as a characteristic of a town, has a flag and an emblem. The creation of the flag and emblem was done by Roberto Rom\u00e1n Acevedo.\n\n===Tragedy on election day in 1944===\n[[File:Sign for former train station, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Sign for former train station, Aguadilla]]\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the most violent railroad accident in its history in Aguadilla.<ref name=\"endi\">''La Tragedia del 7 de noviembre de 1944'' (The Tragedy of November 7, 1944) by Haydee E.

founded in 1775 by Luis de C\u00f3rdova, is a city and [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] located in the northwestern tip of [[Puerto Rico]], bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, north of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]], and [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] and west of [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]]. Aguadilla is spread over 15 wards and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of [[Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nAccording to sources, a [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] settlement called Amam\u00f3n was located close to the [[Culebrinas River]].<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107001412/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html |date=November 7, 2012 }} on Proyecto Salon Hogar</ref>\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]. In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Hig\u00fcey wards.<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\">[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 Aguadilla: Fundaci\u00f3n e historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161941/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 |date=2013-03-15 }} on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico</ref> This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the [[Strategic Air Command]] [[72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy]] equipped with [[B-52]]s, an important strategic facility during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the [[Rafael Hernandez International Airport]]. The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel.

Ramey is also the site of the new Ramey Skating Park and a new \"mariposario\" (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.\n\nThere is still an active part of the base that hosts the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people.
