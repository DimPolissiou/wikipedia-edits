But that record was broken again in January when Manchester United paid \u00a36&nbsp;million for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Andy Cole]], in a deal which also saw \u00a31&nbsp;million-rated [[Keith Gillespie]] move to Newcastle. Other significant transfers before and during the 1994\u201395 season included: [[Vinny Samways]] (Tottenham to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], \u00a32&nbsp;million), [[David Rocastle]] ([[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to Chelsea, \u00a31.25&nbsp;million), [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] ([[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], \u00a32&nbsp;million), [[John Scales]] ([[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], \u00a33&nbsp;million) and [[Paul Kitson]] ([[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] to Newcastle United, \u00a32.2&nbsp;million).\n\n===Summary===\nThe title race was won by Blackburn Rovers, whose last title success was in 1914, and also was Blackburn's first major trophy in 67 years (last [[1927\u201328 FA Cup]]).<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/blackburn-rovers/11607118/Blackburn-Rovers-winning-the-Premier-League-might-never-be-surpassed.html |title=Blackburn Rovers winning the Premier League might never be surpassed|date=|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\t\n[[Kenny Dalglish]]'s side secured the championship on the last day of the season despite losing 2\u20131 at his former club Liverpool, as Manchester United could only manage a 1\u20131 draw at West Ham.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/2015 |title=Liverpool 2 Blackburn 1|date=|work=LFC History|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\t\nThis meant that Blackburn Rovers qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time in their history, while Manchester United finished second earning a [[UEFA Cup]] place. A single point separated the two sides, who for more than half of the season enjoyed a wide gap in terms of point between themselves and the rest of the league, despite the likes of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] briefly topping the league during the first three months of the season.\n\nAlso qualifying for the UEFA Cup were Nottingham Forest (who finished third in their first season back in the Premier League), Liverpool (who finished fourth and won their fifth [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in the club's first full season following the appointment of [[Roy Evans]]) and fifth placed [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].\n\nThe number of teams in the league for the following year would be reduced to 20. This was to be achieved by increasing the number of teams facing relegation to four, and reducing the number of teams being promoted from Division 1 to two.\n\n===Controversial incidents===\nIn January 1995, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s 28-year-old French [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Eric Cantona]] (then holder of the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] award) assaulted a Crystal Palace fan in his team's 1\u20131 draw at [[Selhurst Park]]. Cantona was banned from [[association football|football]] for eight months, fined \u00a320,000 and sentenced to 14 days in prison. The prison sentence was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal.\n\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] [[midfielder]] [[Dennis Wise]] was convicted of criminal damage and assault, relating to a fight with a [[taxicab|taxi]] driver in London. He was given a three-month prison sentence but the conviction and prison sentence were quickly overturned on appeal.\n\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] midfielder [[Paul Merson]] admitted in November 1994 that he was an alcoholic and was also addicted to [[cocaine]] and gambling. He underwent a three-month [[drug rehabilitation]] programme before being allowed to resume his playing career.\n\nCrystal Palace striker [[Chris Armstrong (footballer, born 1971)|Chris Armstrong]] failed a drugs test in February 1995 but admitted that he had done wrong and returned to action after just four weeks undergoing rehabilitation. Armstrong was Palace's leading goalscorer in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], helping them reach the semi finals of both domestic cup competitions, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] just one season after winning promotion.\n\nArsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was sacked in February 1995 after nearly nine years in charge, when it was revealed that he had accepted an illegal payment of \u00a3425,000 from Norwegian agent [[Rune Hauge]] relating to the purchases of Norwegian and Danish players [[P\u00e5l Lydersen]] and [[John Jensen]] three years earlier. Graham was later banned from football for one year by the [[The Football Association|FA]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty-two teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1993\u201394 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (both teams returning to the top flight after a season's absence) and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (returning after a top flight absence of seven years). This was also Leicester City's first season in the Premier League. They replaced [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], ending their top flight spells of four, three and one year respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 1994\u201395 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England

sponsorship reasons) was the third season of the [[Premier League]], the top division of professional [[association football|football]] in England.\n\n==Overview==\n===Transfers===\nJust before the start of the 1994\u201395 season, the English transfer record was broken when [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] paid \u00a35&nbsp;million for 21-year-old [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] striker [[Chris Sutton]]. But that record was broken again in January when Manchester United paid \u00a36&nbsp;million for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Andy Cole]], in a deal which also saw \u00a31&nbsp;million-rated [[Keith Gillespie]] move to Newcastle. Other significant transfers before and during the 1994\u201395 season included: [[Vinny Samways]] (Tottenham to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], \u00a32&nbsp;million), [[David Rocastle]] ([[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] to Chelsea, \u00a31.25&nbsp;million), [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] ([[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], \u00a32&nbsp;million), [[John Scales]] ([[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], \u00a33&nbsp;million) and [[Paul Kitson]] ([[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] to Newcastle United, \u00a32.2&nbsp;million).\n\n===Summary===\nThe title race was won by Blackburn Rovers, whose last title success was in 1914, and also was Blackburn's first major trophy in 67 years (last [[1927\u201328 FA Cup]]).<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/blackburn-rovers/11607118/Blackburn-Rovers-winning-the-Premier-League-might-never-be-surpassed.html |title=Blackburn Rovers winning the Premier League might never be surpassed|date=|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\t\n[[Kenny Dalglish]]'s side secured the championship on the last day of the season despite losing 2\u20131 at his former club Liverpool, as Manchester United could only manage a 1\u20131 draw at West Ham.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/2015 |title=Liverpool 2 Blackburn 1|date=|work=LFC History|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>\t\nThis meant that Blackburn Rovers qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time in their history, while Manchester United finished second earning a [[UEFA Cup]] place. A single point separated the two sides, who for more than half of the season enjoyed a wide gap in terms of point between themselves and the rest of the league, despite the likes of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] briefly topping the league during the first three months of the season.\n\nAlso qualifying for the UEFA Cup were Nottingham Forest (who finished third in their first season back in the Premier League), Liverpool (who finished fourth and won their fifth [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in the club's first full season following the appointment of [[Roy Evans]]) and fifth placed [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].\n\nThe number of teams in the league for the following year would be reduced to 20. This was to be achieved by increasing the number of teams facing relegation to four, and reducing the number of teams being promoted from Division 1 to two.\n\n===Controversial incidents===\nIn January 1995, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s 28-year-old French [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Eric Cantona]] (then holder of the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] award) assaulted a Crystal Palace fan in his team's 1\u20131 draw at [[Selhurst Park]]. Cantona was banned from [[association football|football]] for eight months, fined \u00a320,000 and sentenced to 14 days in prison. The prison sentence was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal.\n\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] [[midfielder]] [[Dennis Wise]] was convicted of criminal damage and assault, relating to a fight with a [[taxicab|taxi]] driver in London. He was given a three-month prison sentence but the conviction and prison sentence were quickly overturned on appeal.\n\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] midfielder [[Paul Merson]] admitted in November 1994 that he was an alcoholic and was also addicted to [[cocaine]] and gambling. He underwent a three-month [[drug rehabilitation]] programme before being allowed to resume his playing career.\n\nCrystal Palace striker [[Chris Armstrong (footballer, born 1971)|Chris Armstrong]] failed a drugs test in February 1995 but admitted that he had done wrong and returned to action after just four weeks undergoing rehabilitation. Armstrong was Palace's leading goalscorer in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], helping them reach the semi finals of both domestic cup competitions, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] just one season after winning promotion.\n\nArsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was sacked in February 1995 after nearly nine years in charge, when it was revealed that he had accepted an illegal payment of \u00a3425,000 from Norwegian agent [[Rune Hauge]] relating to the purchases of Norwegian and Danish players [[P\u00e5l Lydersen]] and [[John Jensen]] three years earlier. Graham was later banned from football for one year by the [[The Football Association|FA]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty-two teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1993\u201394 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (both teams returning to the top flight after a season's absence) and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (returning after a top flight absence of seven years). This was also Leicester City's first season in the Premier League. They replaced [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], ending their top flight spells of four, three and one year respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 1994\u201395 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England

Dhyan Chand had two brothers \u2013 Mool Singh and Roop Singh. Because of his father's numerous army transfers, the family had to move to different cities and as such Chand had to terminate his education after only six years of schooling. The family finally settled in [[Jhansi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. \n\nDhyanchand graduated from Victoria College, Gwalior in 1932. Being in the military, his father got a small piece of land for a house.\n\nYoung Chand had no serious inclination towards sports, though he loved wrestling. He stated that he did not remember whether he played any hockey worth mentioning before he joined the Army, though he said that he occasionally indulged in casual games in [[Jhansi]] with his friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveindia.com/sports/hockey/players/dhyan-chand.html|title=Dhyan Chand Profile \u2013 Indian Hockey Player Dhyan Chand Biography \u2013 Information on Dhyan Chand|website=www.iloveindia.com|access-date=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hindi]] word ''Chand'' literally means the moon. Since Dhyan Singh used to practice a lot during the night after his duty hours, he used to wait for the moon to come out so that the visibility in the field (during his era there were no [[flood lights]]) improved. He was hence called \"Chand\", by his fellow players, as his practice sessions at night invariably coincided with the coming out of the moon.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n== Early career ==\n\nOn 29 August 1922 - his 17th birthday - Chand enlisted in the [[1st Brahmans]] of the British Indian Army as a ''[[sepoy]]'' (private).<ref name=\"legend_Dhyan_Chand\">{{cite news|url=https://sportstar.thehindu.com/hockey/the-legend-of-dhyan-chand/article19580161.ece|title=The Legend of Dhyan Chand  |date=29 August 2017|accessdate=27 January 2019|newspaper=The Hindu|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Indian_Army_List_41\">{{cite book|pages=835|title=Indian Army List for April 1941 (Part I)|first= |last=|publisher=Government of India Press|year=1941|ISBN=|subject=}}</ref> A reorganisation of the army that year resulted in the 1st Brahmans becoming the 1/[[1st Punjab Regiment]]. Between 1922 and 1926, Chand exclusively played army hockey tournaments and regimental games. Chand was ultimately selected for the [[Indian Army]] team which was to tour New Zealand.<ref>{{cite newspaper|title=Indian Army Hockey team|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19260324-1.2.101.3?ST|accessdate=10 February 2018|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=24 March 1926|page=15}}</ref> The team won 18 matches, drew 2 and lost only 1, receiving praise from all spectators. Following this, in the two Test matches against the New Zealand squad, the team won the first and narrowly lost the second. Returning to India, Chand was promoted to [[Lance Naik]] in 1927.<ref name=\"legend_Dhyan_Chand\"/>\n\nAfter successfully lobbying for [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|reintroducing field hockey in the Olympics]], the newly formed [[Indian Hockey Federation]] (IHF) made preparations to send its best possible team for the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. In 1925, an Inter-Provincial Tournament was held to select the team members. Five teams participated in the inaugural nationals&nbsp;\u2013 [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]] (UP), [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], [[Ajmer-Merwara|Rajputana]] and [[Central Provinces and Berar|Central Provinces]]. Chand got permission from the Army to play for the United Provinces team.\n\nIn its first game in the tournament, Dhyan Chand as the [[centre-forward]], and Marthins, their inside-right, performed very well together. Chand attracted much attention by his clever stick-work. His penetrating runs and judicious passes seemed to assure for him a position in the team that is to take part in the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] Games. Early in the game, it became evident that Chand was at his best. In combination with Marthins he took the ball away to the right and Marthins did well to give him a good pass. Quick as lightning, Dhyan Chand shot a goal. The ball struck one of the defenders' stick and went into the net, giving goalkeeper Collie no chance. A goal within 3 minutes of the start was more than what the most optimistic of the UP supporters could expect. At the interval, UP led by three goals to nil.\n\nOn their part, Rajputana put every ounce of their efforts to score. The UP goal had more than one narrow escape, but were the winners of a fine exhibition match (3\u20131).\n\nBuoyed by the success of the Tournament, it was decided that it would be held every two years. After two more trial matches between various hopefuls, the Olympic team (including Chand as center-forward) was announced and assembled in [[Bombay]]. Center-half [[Broome Pinniger|Broome Eric Pinniger]] was selected as the captain. The IHF was initially low on funds since the provinces of Bombay, Madras and Burma had turned a deaf ear to their financial appeal, but they managed to scrape enough money. The Olympic team then played a match against the Bombay XI, and amazingly lost 3\u20132, even though Singh scored both his team's goals. With a quiet send-off, the team left for England on 10 March, to play 11 matches against local sides as well in the London Folkestone Festival in 1927, winning all. It was also said that Great Britain did not send a team in 1928 to the Amsterdam Olympics after their national team was defeated by the Indian team at Folkestone.\nThis is best cited in Kapur's book ''Romance of Hockey'' where a despatch of H. Sutherland Stark, London representative of \"Sports\", a magazine of Lahore, tells the story better than any other comment : \"For reasons it is difficult to understand the English Hockey Association have taken up a very stiff attitude towards Indian Hockey in recent years and have repeatedly been twitted about it by even their own supporters. The Editor of a leading sports newspaper described them to me as an intensely conservative body, but there seems to be something more than conservative behind their unwillingness apparently ever to meet India in a full international encounter\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Kapur, Mohan Lal |title=Romance of Hockey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfCZUheieYEC|date=1968|publisher=M.L. Kapur|page=38}}</ref>\nFinally, on 24 April, the team arrived in Amsterdam to embark on a tour of the Low Countries. In all the pre-Olympic matches against local Dutch, German and Belgian teams, the Indian team won by large margins.\n\nIn the 1928 Amsterdam Summer Olympics, the Indian team was put in the division A table, with Austria, [[Belgium men's national field hockey team|Belgium]], Denmark and Switzerland . On 17 May the Indian national hockey team made its Olympic debut against Austria, winning 6\u20130, with Chand scoring 3 goals. The next day India defeated Belgium 9\u20130; however Chand only scored once. On 20 May, Denmark lost to India 5\u20130, with Chand netting 3. Two days later, he scored 4 goals when India defeated Switzerland 6\u20130 in the semi-finals.<ref name=sr/>\n\nThe final match took place on 26 May, with India facing the home team of the Netherlands. The Indian team's better players [[Feroze Khan (field hockey)|Feroze Khan]], [[Ali Shaukat]] and Kher Singh were on the sick list and Chand himself was ill. However, even with a skeletal side, India managed to defeat the hosts 3\u20130 (with Singh scoring 2), and the Indian team won its country's first Olympic gold medal. Chand was the top scorer of the tournament, with 14 goals in 5 matches. A newspaper report about India's triumph said,<ref>[https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/national+sports+day+2017+remembering+the+wizard+major+dhyan+chand+on+his+birthday-newsid-72464537 National Sports Day 2017: Remembering 'The Wizard' Major Dhyan Chand on his birthday].

His platoon refused. Chand received news that he had been selected by the IHF for the Olympic team without any formalities. The rest of his teammates however, had to prove their skills in the Inter-Provincial Tournament, which was won by Punjab. As such, seven players from Punjab were selected for the Olympic team. Apart from Chand, Broome Eric Pinnigar, [[Leslie Hammond]] and Richard Allen were the other 1928 Olympians retained in the team. Chand's brother Roop Singh was also included in the squad as a left-in. [[Lal Bokhari|Lal Shah Bokhari]] was selected as captain.\n\nThe Olympic team then played practice matches in India before heading for Colombo. In two matches in [[Ceylon]], the Olympic team beat the All Ceylon XI 20\u20130 and 10\u20130. Wrote one newspaper on the first match,<ref>[http://hockeygods.com/images/15275-Dhyan_Chand_Captain_of_the_Indian_Olympic_Field_hockey_Team_1936 Dhyan Chand Captain of the Indian Olympic Field hockey Team 1936].

For once, this was proved wrong for even the god of weather paid tribute to the genius of the Indian players. Rain clouds, which had threatened to ruin the game, vanished into the blue, and thousands of spectators spent a happy hour marveling at the incomparable artistry of the Indian team.\"\n\nThe India team set sail for San Francisco on 30 May, and arrived on 6 July. They reached [[Los Angeles]] three weeks before the opening ceremony of the [[1932 Summer Olympics|Olympics]], which took place on 30 July. On 4 August 1932, India played its first match against [[Japan men's national field hockey team|Japan]] and won 11\u20131. Chand, Roop Singh, Gurmit Singh each scored thrice, and Dickie Carr once. In the final on 11 August, India played against hosts [[United States men's national field hockey team|USA]]. India won 24\u20131, a world record at that time (until it was broken in 2003), and once again clinched the gold medal. Chand scored 8 times, Roop Singh 10, Gurmit Singh 5 and Pinniger once. In fact, Chand along with his brother Roop, scored 25 out of the 35 goals scored by India.<ref name=sr/> This led to them being dubbed the 'hockey twins'.\n\nOne Los Angeles newspaper wrote,<ref>[http://www.bharatiyahockey.org/granthalaya/legend/1932/page3.htm Typhoon from the East]. Bharatiyahockey.org.</ref> \"The All-India field hockey team which G. D. Sondhi brought to Los Angeles to defend their 1928 Olympic title, was like a typhoon out of the east. They trampled under their feet and all but shoved out of the Olympic stadium the eleven players representing the United States.\"\n\nThe team then embarked on a tour of the United States. They played a match on 20 August against a United States XI, almost the same team that they had faced in Los Angeles. Even after loaning its second keeper Arthur Hind, for a half, the team won 24\u20131.\n\nAfter setting sail from New York, the team arrived at England. The then embarked on a hectic tour, playing nine matches in various countries in a fortnight, commencing on 2 September.  They played four internationals-against the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]]. The team then reached [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]], playing a number of matches to pay for their expenses.  At the end of the tour, India had played 37 matches, winning 34, drawing 2, with one abandoned. Chand scored 133 of the 338 Indian goals.\n\nIn India he is often referred to as ''Hockey ka Jaadugar'' which translates to \"Magician of the game of Hockey\".\n\n===Captaincy and 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics===\n[[File:Dhyan Chand at Berlin Olympics.jpg|thumb|left|Indian hockey captain Dhyan Chand at 1936 Berlin Olympics]]\n\nIn 1933, Chand's home team, the [[Jhansi]] Heroes, he participated in and won the [[Beighton Cup]], which he considered the most prestigious of [[India men's national field hockey team|Indian hockey]] tournaments. Later, he would state,<ref>[https://www.slideshare.net/918007165995/major-dhyan-chand Major Dhyan Chand]. Slideshare.net.

Calcutta Customs was a great side those days; they had Shaukat Ali, Asad Ali, Claude Deefholts, Seaman, Mohsin, and many others who were then in the first flight of Indian hockey.\nI had a very young side. Besides my brother Roop Singh, and Ismail, who played for the Great Indian Peninsular Railway in Mumbai, I had no other really great player in the team. But I had a team which was determined to do or die.\nIt was a great match, full of thrills, and it was just opportunism that gave us the victory. Customs were pressing hard and our goal was at their mercy. Suddenly I broke through and from midfield gave a long through pass to Ismail, who ran with [[Jesse Owens]]' speed half the length of the ground. A misunderstanding occurred between the Customs left-half and the goalkeeper, and Ismail, taking every advantage of it, cut through and netted the only goal of the match. We felt very proud of our triumph.}}\n[[File:Dhyan Chand with the ball vs. France in the 1936 Olympic semi-finals.jpg|thumb|Dhyan Chand with the ball vs. France in the 1936 Olympic semi-finals]]\nIn Kolkata, the Heroes also won the Lakshmibilas Cup tournament, which was open only to Indian teams. In 1935, they successfully defended their Beighton Cup title, though lost the subsequent year.\n\nIn December 1934, the IHF decided to send a team to New Zealand in the new year. Chand and his brother were immediately selected. When the Nawab of [[Manavadar]] declined to play, Chand was appointed captain. In the subsequent tour, the team played a total of 48 matches on this tour, with 28 in New Zealand and the remainder in India, Ceylon and Australia. India won every match, scoring 584 goals and conceding only 40. Of these 48 matches, Chand played 23 and scored a total of 201 goals.\n\nUpon returning to India, Chand resumed his duties in the barracks. In December 1935, the IHF decided to stage the Inter-Provincial tournament to select the Olympic team. Chand was again denied permission to leave his platoon, though once again he was selected without formalities. The final team assembled in Delhi on 16 June and played against the Delhi Hockey XI. Incredibly, they lost 4\u20131. After this inauspicious start, the team went on a successful tour of the subcontinent, finally departing for [[Marseilles]] on 27 June. They arrived on 10 July, and after an uncomfortable journey in third-class compartments, reached Berlin on 13 July. On 17 July, the Indian team played a practice match against Germany and lost 4\u20131. As such, manager Pankaj Gupta informed the IHF that [[Ali Dara]] had to be sent immediately to replace the out of form [[Mirza Masood]].\n\nOn 5 August, India won its first match against Hungary 4\u20130. India won the rest of the group matches against USA (7\u20130, with Chand scoring 2 goals) and Japan (9\u20130, with Chand scoring 4). On 10 August, Ali Dara arrived. Their fourth match was the semi-final against France, whom they defeated 10\u20130, with Chand scoring 4 goals. Meanwhile, [[Germany men's national field hockey team|Germany]] had beaten Denmark 6\u20130, beaten Afghanistan 4\u20131 and in the play-offs, had defeated the Netherlands 3\u20130. Thus, India and Germany were to clash in the 1936 Berlin Olympics field hockey final on 19 August.<ref name=sr/>\n\n[[File:Dhyan Chand 1936 final.jpg|thumb|right|Dhyan Chand scoring a goal against Germany in the 1936 Olympics hockey final]]\n\nOn the morning of the final, the entire team was nervous since they had been defeated the last time they had faced Germany. In the locker room, Pankaj Gupta produced a [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] [[Flag of India|tricolour]]. Reverently the team saluted it, prayed and marched onto the field. The German team was successful in restricting the India side to a single goal until the first interval. After the interval, the Indian team launched an all-out attack, easily defeating Germany 8\u20131, incidentally the only goal scored against India in that Olympic tournament. Chand top-scored with 3 goals, Dara scored 2 and Roop Singh, [[Carlyle Tapsell|Tapsell]] and [[Sayed Jaffar (field hockey)|Jaffar]] one each. Describing the game, the Special Correspondent of [[The Hindu]] wrote,{{better source needed|date=August 2019}}\n{{cquote|Every member of the team was feeling the strain of the defeat to the Germans in the practice match, and no one was in his usual self. I never saw a hockey team from India, where the game is definitely of a superior standard compared to the rest of the world, being so obsessed on the eve of the match. The players were nervous as to what the result of the match would be, which was heightened by the feeling that the burden of the country's honour was on their shoulders.\n\nThe game was played at a fast pace and was packed with thrilling incidents. The Germans undercut and lifted the ball, but the Indian team countered with brilliant half-volleying and amazing long shots. Twice Dara attempted to score but was declared offside. Dhyan Chand discarded his spiked shoes and stockings and played with bare legs and rubber soles and became speedier in the second half.\n\nThe vigorous German attacks were brilliantly saved by Allen and Tapsell. The goal scored by Weiss of Germany was the only goal scored against the Indians throughout the tournament. The whole Indian team put up a splendid display. Dhyan Chand and Dara impressed by their combination, Tapsell by his reliability and Jaffar by his tremendous bursts of speed.}}\n\nThere have been many erroneous media reports over the years claiming that Dhyan Chand scored 6 goals in India's 8\u20131 victory over Germany in the 1936 Olympic final. In his autobiography ''Goal!'' Chand wrote:\n\n''\u201cWhen Germany was four goals down, a ball hit Allen's pad and rebounded. The Germans took full advantage of this and made a rush, netting the ball before we could stop it. That was the only goal Germany would score in the match against our eight, and incidentally the only goal scored against India in the entire Olympic tournament. India's goal-getters were Roop Singh, Tapsell and Jaffar with one each, Dara two and myself three.\u201d''\n\nThe [[International Hockey Federation]] records also attribute only 3 of the 8 goals to Dhyan Chand in the Berlin Olympic final. The final was included in the [[Leni Riefenstahl]] film on the 1936 Olympics, [[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]. Overall, in 3 Olympic tournaments, Chand had scored 33 goals in 12 matches.<ref name=sr/>\n\n===East African tour and final tournaments===\n\nAfter returning from Berlin, Chand joined his regiment. Between 1936 and the commencement of the War in 1939, he largely confined himself to army hockey, with one visit to Kolkata to take part in the Beighton Cup tournament in 1937. Before the beighton Cup, Chand spent four months in a military camp in [[Pachmarhi]] to attend military classes. On 16 March 1938, he was made a [[Viceroy's Commissioned Officer]] (VCO; the equivalent of the present-day [[junior commissioned officer]]) with the rank of ''[[jemadar]]'' (now termed [[naib subedar]]).<ref name=\"Indian_Army_List_41\"/> With the increasing need for qualified officers during wartime, he was promoted to acting ''[[subedar]]'' by July 1942 and to the war-substantive rank by early 1943.<ref>{{cite book|pages=1467|title=Indian Army List for July 1942|first= |last=|publisher=Government of India Press|year=1942|ISBN=|subject=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|pages=1615|title=Indian Army List for April 1943 (Parts I and II)|first= |last=|publisher=Government of India Press|year=1943|ISBN=|subject=}}</ref> On 9 April 1943, Chand received an emergency commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in the 14th Punjab Regiment, with the war-substantive rank of [[lieutenant]] from the same date.<ref>{{cite book|pages=764 A|title=Indian Army List August 1947 (Special Edition)|first= |last=|publisher=Government of India Press|year=1947|ISBN=|subject=}}</ref>\n\nTowards the closing phases of the war, Chand led an army hockey team which toured around the battlefields in Manipur, Burma, the Far East and Ceylon. When the war ended in 1945, Chand decided that the Indian hockey team needed new young players. In 1947, the IHF was requested by the Asian Sports Association (ASA) of East Africa to send a team to play a series of matches. The ASA made a condition that Chand should be included in the team. Once again, Chand was chosen as captain.\n\nThe team assembled in Bombay on 23 November 1947, and reached [[Mombasa]] on 15 December and played 9 matches in [[British East Africa]] winning all. Chand, though now in his forties, still managed to score 61 goals in 22 matches.\n\nAfter returning from the East African tour in early 1948, Chand decided to gradually phase out his involvement in 'serious hockey'. He played exhibition matches, leading a Rest of India side against state teams and the 1948 ''Olympic'' team which defeated Chand's side 2\u20131, even though an aging Chand scored his side's lone goal. Chand's last match was leading the Rest of India team against the Bengal side. The match ended in a draw after which the Bengal Hockey Association organized a public function to honor Chand's services to Indian hockey.\n\n==Final years==\nChand continued to hold his emergency commission in the Indian Army post-Independence, with the service number IEC 3526, but was apparently not granted a regular commission.<ref name=\"gazette\">{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Army Branch) |page=80  |date=30 March 1957 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref> In 1951 he was honored at India's National Stadium with the inaugural Dhyan Chand Tournament, which he attended to the admiration of the spectators. \n\nAfter 34 years of service, Chand retired from the Indian Army on 29 August 1956 as a lieutenant (acting [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]]).<ref name=\"gazette\"/>{{refn|Chand is generally stated to have held the rank of [[major]] at his retirement, but it is unclear when he was promoted to this rank.

His skills have been glorified in various apocryphal stories and anecdotes. A number of such these revolve around the fact that Singh had an extraordinary control over dribbling the ball. Chand's birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as [[National Sports Day]] in India. The [[President of India|President]] gives away sport-related awards such as the [[Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna]], [[Arjuna award|Arjuna Award]] and [[Dronacharya Award]] on this day at the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], India.\n\nThe 20th National Award 2012, the Gem of India, awarded by the Union Minister of India, was given to Dhyan Chand.

Dhyan Chand had two brothers \u2013 Mool Singh and Roop Singh. Because of his father's numerous army transfers, the family had to move to different cities and as such Chand had to terminate his education after only six years of schooling. The family finally settled in [[Jhansi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. \n\nDhyanchand graduated from Victoria College, Gwalior in 1932. Being in the military, his father got a small piece of land for a house.\n\nYoung Chand had no serious inclination towards sports, though he loved wrestling. He stated that he did not remember whether he played any hockey worth mentioning before he joined the Army, though he said that he occasionally indulged in casual games in [[Jhansi]] with his friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveindia.com/sports/hockey/players/dhyan-chand.html|title=Dhyan Chand Profile \u2013 Indian Hockey Player Dhyan Chand Biography \u2013 Information on Dhyan Chand|website=www.iloveindia.com|access-date=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hindi]] word ''Chand'' literally means the moon. Since Dhyan Singh used to practice a lot during the night after his duty hours, he used to wait for the moon to come out so that the visibility in the field (during his era there were no [[flood lights]]) improved. He was hence called \"Chand\", by his fellow players, as his practice sessions at night invariably coincided with the coming out of the moon.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n== Early career ==\n\nOn 29 August 1922 - his 17th birthday - Chand enlisted in the [[1st Brahmans]] of the British Indian Army as a ''[[sepoy]]'' (private).<ref name=\"legend_Dhyan_Chand\">{{cite news|url=https://sportstar.thehindu.com/hockey/the-legend-of-dhyan-chand/article19580161.ece|title=The Legend of Dhyan Chand  |date=29 August 2017|accessdate=27 January 2019|newspaper=The Hindu|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Indian_Army_List_41\">{{cite book|pages=835|title=Indian Army List for April 1941 (Part I)|first= |last=|publisher=Government of India Press|year=1941|ISBN=|subject=}}</ref> A reorganisation of the army that year resulted in the 1st Brahmans becoming the 1/[[1st Punjab Regiment]]. Between 1922 and 1926, Chand exclusively played army hockey tournaments and regimental games. Chand was ultimately selected for the [[Indian Army]] team which was to tour New Zealand.<ref>{{cite newspaper|title=Indian Army Hockey team|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19260324-1.2.101.3?ST|accessdate=10 February 2018|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=24 March 1926|page=15}}</ref> The team won 18 matches, drew 2 and lost only 1, receiving praise from all spectators. Following this, in the two Test matches against the New Zealand squad, the team won the first and narrowly lost the second. Returning to India, Chand was promoted to [[Lance Naik]] in 1927.<ref name=\"legend_Dhyan_Chand\"/>\n\nAfter successfully lobbying for [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|reintroducing field hockey in the Olympics]], the newly formed [[Indian Hockey Federation]] (IHF) made preparations to send its best possible team for the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics. In 1925, an Inter-Provincial Tournament was held to select the team members. Five teams participated in the inaugural nationals&nbsp;\u2013 [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]] (UP), [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], [[Ajmer-Merwara|Rajputana]] and [[Central Provinces and Berar|Central Provinces]]. Chand got permission from the Army to play for the United Provinces team.\n\nIn its first game in the tournament, Dhyan Chand as the [[centre-forward]], and Marthins, their inside-right, performed very well together. Chand attracted much attention by his clever stick-work. His penetrating runs and judicious passes seemed to assure for him a position in the team that is to take part in the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] Games. Early in the game, it became evident that Chand was at his best. In combination with Marthins he took the ball away to the right and Marthins did well to give him a good pass. Quick as lightning, Dhyan Chand shot a goal. The ball struck one of the defenders' stick and went into the net, giving goalkeeper Collie no chance. A goal within 3 minutes of the start was more than what the most optimistic of the UP supporters could expect. At the interval, UP led by three goals to nil.\n\nOn their part, Rajputana put every ounce of their efforts to score. The UP goal had more than one narrow escape, but were the winners of a fine exhibition match (3\u20131).\n\nBuoyed by the success of the Tournament, it was decided that it would be held every two years. After two more trial matches between various hopefuls, the Olympic team (including Chand as center-forward) was announced and assembled in [[Bombay]]. Center-half [[Broome Pinniger|Broome Eric Pinniger]] was selected as the captain. The IHF was initially low on funds since the provinces of Bombay, Madras and Burma had turned a deaf ear to their financial appeal, but they managed to scrape enough money. The Olympic team then played a match against the Bombay XI, and amazingly lost 3\u20132, even though Singh scored both his team's goals. With a quiet send-off, the team left for England on 10 March, to play 11 matches against local sides as well in the London Folkestone Festival in 1927, winning all. It was also said that Great Britain did not send a team in 1928 to the Amsterdam Olympics after their national team was defeated by the Indian team at Folkestone.\nThis is best cited in Kapur's book ''Romance of Hockey'' where a despatch of H. Sutherland Stark, London representative of \"Sports\", a magazine of Lahore, tells the story better than any other comment : \"For reasons it is difficult to understand the English Hockey Association have taken up a very stiff attitude towards Indian Hockey in recent years and have repeatedly been twitted about it by even their own supporters. The Editor of a leading sports newspaper described them to me as an intensely conservative body, but there seems to be something more than conservative behind their unwillingness apparently ever to meet India in a full international encounter\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Kapur, Mohan Lal |title=Romance of Hockey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfCZUheieYEC|date=1968|publisher=M.L. Kapur|page=38}}</ref>\nFinally, on 24 April, the team arrived in Amsterdam to embark on a tour of the Low Countries. In all the pre-Olympic matches against local Dutch, German and Belgian teams, the Indian team won by large margins.\n\nIn the 1928 Amsterdam Summer Olympics, the Indian team was put in the division A table, with Austria, [[Belgium men's national field hockey team|Belgium]], Denmark and Switzerland . On 17 May the Indian national hockey team made its Olympic debut against Austria, winning 6\u20130, with Chand scoring 3 goals. The next day India defeated Belgium 9\u20130; however Chand only scored once. On 20 May, Denmark lost to India 5\u20130, with Chand netting 3. Two days later, he scored 4 goals when India defeated Switzerland 6\u20130 in the semi-finals.<ref name=sr/>\n\nThe final match took place on 26 May, with India facing the home team of the Netherlands. The Indian team's better players [[Feroze Khan (field hockey)|Feroze Khan]], [[Ali Shaukat]] and Kher Singh were on the sick list and Chand himself was ill. However, even with a skeletal side, India managed to defeat the hosts 3\u20130 (with Singh scoring 2), and the Indian team won its country's first Olympic gold medal. Chand was the top scorer of the tournament, with 14 goals in 5 matches. A newspaper report about India's triumph said,<ref>[https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/national+sports+day+2017+remembering+the+wizard+major+dhyan+chand+on+his+birthday-newsid-72464537 National Sports Day 2017: Remembering 'The Wizard' Major Dhyan Chand on his birthday].

His platoon refused. Chand received news that he had been selected by the IHF for the Olympic team without any formalities. The rest of his teammates however, had to prove their skills in the Inter-Provincial Tournament, which was won by Punjab. As such, seven players from Punjab were selected for the Olympic team. Apart from Chand, Broome Eric Pinnigar, [[Leslie Hammond]] and Richard Allen were the other 1928 Olympians retained in the team. Chand's brother Roop Singh was also included in the squad as a left-in. [[Lal Bokhari|Lal Shah Bokhari]] was selected as captain.\n\nThe Olympic team then played practice matches in India before heading for Colombo. In two matches in [[Ceylon]], the Olympic team beat the All Ceylon XI 20\u20130 and 10\u20130. Wrote one newspaper on the first match,<ref>[http://hockeygods.com/images/15275-Dhyan_Chand_Captain_of_the_Indian_Olympic_Field_hockey_Team_1936 Dhyan Chand Captain of the Indian Olympic Field hockey Team 1936].

For once, this was proved wrong for even the god of weather paid tribute to the genius of the Indian players. Rain clouds, which had threatened to ruin the game, vanished into the blue, and thousands of spectators spent a happy hour marveling at the incomparable artistry of the Indian team.\"\n\nThe India team set sail for San Francisco on 30 May, and arrived on 6 July. They reached [[Los Angeles]] three weeks before the opening ceremony of the [[1932 Summer Olympics|Olympics]], which took place on 30 July. On 4 August 1932, India played its first match against [[Japan men's national field hockey team|Japan]] and won 11\u20131. Chand, Roop Singh, Gurmit Singh each scored thrice, and Dickie Carr once. In the final on 11 August, India played against hosts [[United States men's national field hockey team|USA]]. India won 24\u20131, a world record at that time (until it was broken in 2003), and once again clinched the gold medal. Chand scored 8 times, Roop Singh 10, Gurmit Singh 5 and Pinniger once. In fact, Chand along with his brother Roop, scored 25 out of the 35 goals scored by India.<ref name=sr/> This led to them being dubbed the 'hockey twins'.\n\nOne Los Angeles newspaper wrote,<ref>[http://www.bharatiyahockey.org/granthalaya/legend/1932/page3.htm Typhoon from the East]. Bharatiyahockey.org.</ref> \"The All-India field hockey team which G. D. Sondhi brought to Los Angeles to defend their 1928 Olympic title, was like a typhoon out of the east. They trampled under their feet and all but shoved out of the Olympic stadium the eleven players representing the United States.\"\n\nThe team then embarked on a tour of the United States. They played a match on 20 August against a United States XI, almost the same team that they had faced in Los Angeles. Even after loaning its second keeper Arthur Hind, for a half, the team won 24\u20131.\n\nAfter setting sail from New York, the team arrived at England. The then embarked on a hectic tour, playing nine matches in various countries in a fortnight, commencing on 2 September.  They played four internationals-against the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]]. The team then reached [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]], playing a number of matches to pay for their expenses.  At the end of the tour, India had played 37 matches, winning 34, drawing 2, with one abandoned. Chand scored 133 of the 338 Indian goals.\n\nIn India he is often referred to as ''Hockey ka Jaadugar'' which translates to \"Magician of the game of Hockey\".\n\n===Captaincy and 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics===\n[[File:Dhyan Chand at Berlin Olympics.jpg|thumb|left|Indian hockey captain Dhyan Chand at 1936 Berlin Olympics]]\n\nIn 1933, Chand's home team, the [[Jhansi]] Heroes, he participated in and won the [[Beighton Cup]], which he considered the most prestigious of [[India men's national field hockey team|Indian hockey]] tournaments. Later, he would state,<ref>[https://www.slideshare.net/918007165995/major-dhyan-chand Major Dhyan Chand]. Slideshare.net.

Besides my brother Roop Singh, and Ismail, who played for the Great Indian Peninsular Railway in Mumbai, I had no other really great player in the team. But I had a team which was determined to do or die.\nIt was a great match, full of thrills, and it was just opportunism that gave us the victory. Customs were pressing hard and our goal was at their mercy. Suddenly I broke through and from midfield gave a long through pass to Ismail, who ran with [[Jesse Owens]]' speed half the length of the ground. A misunderstanding occurred between the Customs left-half and the goalkeeper, and Ismail, taking every advantage of it, cut through and netted the only goal of the match. We felt very proud of our triumph.}}\n[[File:Dhyan Chand with the ball vs. France in the 1936 Olympic semi-finals.jpg|thumb|Dhyan Chand with the ball vs. France in the 1936 Olympic semi-finals]]\nIn Kolkata, the Heroes also won the Lakshmibilas Cup tournament, which was open only to Indian teams. In 1935, they successfully defended their Beighton Cup title, though lost the subsequent year.\n\nIn December 1934, the IHF decided to send a team to New Zealand in the new year. Chand and his brother were immediately selected. When the Nawab of [[Manavadar]] declined to play, Chand was appointed captain. In the subsequent tour, the team played a total of 48 matches on this tour, with 28 in New Zealand and the remainder in India, Ceylon and Australia. India won every match, scoring 584 goals and conceding only 40. Of these 48 matches, Chand played 23 and scored a total of 201 goals.\n\nUpon returning to India, Chand resumed his duties in the barracks. In December 1935, the IHF decided to stage the Inter-Provincial tournament to select the Olympic team. Chand was again denied permission to leave his platoon, though once again he was selected without formalities. The final team assembled in Delhi on 16 June and played against the Delhi Hockey XI. Incredibly, they lost 4\u20131. After this inauspicious start, the team went on a successful tour of the subcontinent, finally departing for [[Marseilles]] on 27 June. They arrived on 10 July, and after an uncomfortable journey in third-class compartments, reached Berlin on 13 July. On 17 July, the Indian team played a practice match against Germany and lost 4\u20131. As such, manager Pankaj Gupta informed the IHF that [[Ali Dara]] had to be sent immediately to replace the out of form [[Mirza Masood]].\n\nOn 5 August, India won its first match against Hungary 4\u20130. India won the rest of the group matches against USA (7\u20130, with Chand scoring 2 goals) and Japan (9\u20130, with Chand scoring 4). On 10 August, Ali Dara arrived. Their fourth match was the semi-final against France, whom they defeated 10\u20130, with Chand scoring 4 goals. Meanwhile, [[Germany men's national field hockey team|Germany]] had beaten Denmark 6\u20130, beaten Afghanistan 4\u20131 and in the play-offs, had defeated the Netherlands 3\u20130. Thus, India and Germany were to clash in the 1936 Berlin Olympics field hockey final on 19 August.<ref name=sr/>\n\n[[File:Dhyan Chand 1936 final.jpg|thumb|right|Dhyan Chand scoring a goal against Germany in the 1936 Olympics hockey final]]\n\nOn the morning of the final, the entire team was nervous since they had been defeated the last time they had faced Germany. In the locker room, Pankaj Gupta produced a [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] [[Flag of India|tricolour]]. Reverently the team saluted it, prayed and marched onto the field. The German team was successful in restricting the India side to a single goal until the first interval. After the interval, the Indian team launched an all-out attack, easily defeating Germany 8\u20131, incidentally the only goal scored against India in that Olympic tournament. Chand top-scored with 3 goals, Dara scored 2 and Roop Singh, [[Carlyle Tapsell|Tapsell]] and [[Sayed Jaffar (field hockey)|Jaffar]] one each. Describing the game, the Special Correspondent of [[The Hindu]] wrote,{{better source needed|date=August 2019}}\n{{cquote|Every member of the team was feeling the strain of the defeat to the Germans in the practice match, and no one was in his usual self. I never saw a hockey team from India, where the game is definitely of a superior standard compared to the rest of the world, being so obsessed on the eve of the match. The players were nervous as to what the result of the match would be, which was heightened by the feeling that the burden of the country's honour was on their shoulders.\n\nThe game was played at a fast pace and was packed with thrilling incidents. The Germans undercut and lifted the ball, but the Indian team countered with brilliant half-volleying and amazing long shots. Twice Dara attempted to score but was declared offside. Dhyan Chand discarded his spiked shoes and stockings and played with bare legs and rubber soles and became speedier in the second half.\n\nThe vigorous German attacks were brilliantly saved by Allen and Tapsell. The goal scored by Weiss of Germany was the only goal scored against the Indians throughout the tournament. The whole Indian team put up a splendid display. Dhyan Chand and Dara impressed by their combination, Tapsell by his reliability and Jaffar by his tremendous bursts of speed.}}\n\nThere have been many erroneous media reports over the years claiming that Dhyan Chand scored 6 goals in India's 8\u20131 victory over Germany in the 1936 Olympic final. In his autobiography ''Goal!'' Chand wrote:\n\n''\u201cWhen Germany was four goals down, a ball hit Allen's pad and rebounded. The Germans took full advantage of this and made a rush, netting the ball before we could stop it. That was the only goal Germany would score in the match against our eight, and incidentally the only goal scored against India in the entire Olympic tournament. India's goal-getters were Roop Singh, Tapsell and Jaffar with one each, Dara two and myself three.\u201d''\n\nThe [[International Hockey Federation]] records also attribute only 3 of the 8 goals to Dhyan Chand in the Berlin Olympic final. The final was included in the [[Leni Riefenstahl]] film on the 1936 Olympics, [[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]. Overall, in 3 Olympic tournaments, Chand had scored 33 goals in 12 matches.<ref name=sr/>\n\n===East African tour and final tournaments===\n\nAfter returning from Berlin, Chand joined his regiment. Between 1936 and the commencement of the War in 1939, he largely confined himself to army hockey, with one visit to Kolkata to take part in the Beighton Cup tournament in 1937. Before the beighton Cup, Chand spent four months in a military camp in [[Pachmarhi]] to attend military classes. On 16 March 1938, he was made a [[Viceroy's Commissioned Officer]] (VCO; the equivalent of the present-day [[junior commissioned officer]]) with the rank of ''[[jemadar]]'' (now termed [[naib subedar]]).<ref name=\"Indian_Army_List_41\"/> With the increasing need for qualified officers during wartime, he was promoted to acting ''[[subedar]]'' by July 1942 and to the war-substantive rank by early 1943.<ref>{{cite book|pages=1467|title=Indian Army List for July 1942|first= |last=|publisher=Government of India Press|year=1942|ISBN=|subject=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|pages=1615|title=Indian Army List for April 1943 (Parts I and II)|first= |last=|publisher=Government of India Press|year=1943|ISBN=|subject=}}</ref> On 9 April 1943, Chand received an emergency commission as a [[second lieutenant]] in the 14th Punjab Regiment, with the war-substantive rank of [[lieutenant]] from the same date.<ref>{{cite book|pages=764 A|title=Indian Army List August 1947 (Special Edition)|first= |last=|publisher=Government of India Press|year=1947|ISBN=|subject=}}</ref>\n\nTowards the closing phases of the war, Chand led an army hockey team which toured around the battlefields in Manipur, Burma, the Far East and Ceylon. When the war ended in 1945, Chand decided that the Indian hockey team needed new young players. In 1947, the IHF was requested by the Asian Sports Association (ASA) of East Africa to send a team to play a series of matches. The ASA made a condition that Chand should be included in the team. Once again, Chand was chosen as captain.\n\nThe team assembled in Bombay on 23 November 1947, and reached [[Mombasa]] on 15 December and played 9 matches in [[British East Africa]] winning all. Chand, though now in his forties, still managed to score 61 goals in 22 matches.\n\nAfter returning from the East African tour in early 1948, Chand decided to gradually phase out his involvement in 'serious hockey'. He played exhibition matches, leading a Rest of India side against state teams and the 1948 ''Olympic'' team which defeated Chand's side 2\u20131, even though an aging Chand scored his side's lone goal. Chand's last match was leading the Rest of India team against the Bengal side. The match ended in a draw after which the Bengal Hockey Association organized a public function to honor Chand's services to Indian hockey.\n\n==Final years==\nChand continued to hold his emergency commission in the Indian Army post-Independence, with the service number IEC 3526, but was apparently not granted a regular commission.<ref name=\"gazette\">{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Army Branch) |page=80  |date=30 March 1957 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref> In 1951 he was honored at India's National Stadium with the inaugural Dhyan Chand Tournament, which he attended to the admiration of the spectators. \n\nAfter 34 years of service, Chand retired from the Indian Army on 29 August 1956 as a lieutenant (acting [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]]).<ref name=\"gazette\"/>{{refn|Chand is generally stated to have held the rank of [[major]] at his retirement, but it is unclear when he was promoted to this rank.

His skills have been glorified in various apocryphal stories and anecdotes. A number of such these revolve around the fact that Singh had an extraordinary control over dribbling the ball. Chand's birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as [[National Sports Day]] in India. The [[President of India|President]] gives away sport-related awards such as the [[Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna]], [[Arjuna award|Arjuna Award]] and [[Dronacharya Award]] on this day at the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]], India.\n\nThe 20th National Award 2012, the Gem of India, awarded by the Union Minister of India, was given to Dhyan Chand. The award was received by Dhyan Chand\u2019s son, Ashok Dhyan Chand (a hockey Olympian in his own right) on behalf of his deceased father. The award was given by [[Journalist Association of India]] under the flagship of [[Journalists Federation of India]], [[Sirifort Auditorium]], [[New Delhi]], India, on 22 September 2012.\n\nIndia's highest award for lifetime achievement in sports is the [[Dhyan Chand Award]] which has been awarded annually from 2002 to sporting figures who not only contribute through their performance but also contribute to the sport after their retirement.

A western legend has it that Newcomb was badly wounded, and while he lay in the street, Rose Dunn is alleged to have run from the \"Pierce Hotel\" to him with two belts of ammunition and a [[Winchester rifle]]. She fired the rifle at the marshals while Newcomb reloaded his revolvers, and Newcomb was able to escape. However, that account has never been verified, and was never mentioned by the US Marshal official report, which indicated that Newcomb at best fired two shots then fled.\n\nThree deputy marshals were killed during the shootout.

On May 2, 1895, the Dunn Brothers shot and killed both Newcomb and Pierce as they dismounted in front of the Dunn house to visit Rose. The brothers collected the bounty, believed to have been $5,000 each.\n\n==Later life==\n\nAfter the killing of \"Bittercreek\" Newcomb, Rose Dunn was often accused of having set him up, revealing to her brothers where the outlaws were hiding. She denied this, and her brothers later defended her, stating that she had no knowledge of their intentions, nor did she reveal the hideout to them. She was never prosecuted for her involvement with the gang. Her short outlaw life launched her to the level of western legend. In 1898 she married local politician Charles Albert Noble, and sometime after 1900 (a census year), they left Oklahoma and all outlaw associations behind them.

Together with Newcomb and other members of the gang, Rose Dunn hid out for at least two months nursing the remaining gang members back to health.\n\nBy 1895, Newcomb had a $5,000 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] placed on him, [[Wanted poster|dead or alive]]. Newcomb and Charley Pierce hid out near [[Norman, Oklahoma]], both of them having been wounded in a gun battle with US marshals. On May 2, 1895, the Dunn Brothers shot and killed both Newcomb and Pierce as they dismounted in front of the Dunn house to visit Rose. The brothers collected the bounty, believed to have been $5,000 each.\n\n==Later life==\n\nAfter the killing of \"Bittercreek\" Newcomb, Rose Dunn was often accused of having set him up, revealing to her brothers where the outlaws were hiding. She denied this, and her brothers later defended her, stating that she had no knowledge of their intentions, nor did she reveal the hideout to them. She was never prosecuted for her involvement with the gang. Her short outlaw life launched her to the level of western legend. In 1898 she married local politician Charles Albert Noble, and sometime after 1900 (a census year), they left Oklahoma and all outlaw associations behind them. Charles Noble died in 1930 and she married Richard Fleming (whom she first met when 16)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://truewestmagazine.com/who-is-rose-of-cimarron/|title=Who is Rose of Cimarron?|date=2005-05-01|website=True West Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref> in 1946. \n\nShe died at the age of 77 in [[Salkum, Washington]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/31046893/rose-ella-fleming|title=Find a Grave}}</ref>\n\n== In pop culture ==\nThe name \"Rose of Cimarron\" (not that of Rose Dunn) first came to popular attention with the publication of [[Bill Tilghman]]'s booklet '''Oklahoma Outlaws'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://truewestmagazine.com/who-is-rose-of-cimarron/|title=Who is Rose of Cimarron?|date=2005-05-01|website=True West Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe film ''[[Rose of Cimarron (film)|Rose of Cimarron]]'' is very loosely inspired by Rose Dunn.

[[Anti-roll bar|Anti-roll bars]] are also installed at both axles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Wheels ===\nThe Lykan HyperSport is equipped with forged aluminum wheels with diameters of 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear. The tyres are Pirelli P Zeros with codes of 255/35 ZR 19 for the front and 335/30 ZR 20 for the rear.

There was a demonstration of the car by W Motors in 2013 in Dubai, in which they claim to have recorded the car's performance.\n\n==Movie Version==\nA Lykan HyperSport was featured in the [[Furious 7|''Furious 7'']] movie. The movie's car coordinator Dennis McCarthy explained in an interview<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/24/8282803/furious-7-car-coordinator-interview A Q&A with Dennis McCarthy, the man behind Furious 7's insane cast of cars]</ref> that the Lykan HyperSports used in that movie were not production models but purpose-build by W Motors for the movie. They were built using the same molds, but cheaper material (fiberglass instead of carbon fiber) and a simpler chassis.

The band's style ranges from [[symphonic]] to [[hard rock]].\n\n== History ==\nArena was founded in 1995 by [[Clive Nolan]] keyboardist of [[Pendragon (band)|Pendragon]] and [[Shadowland (band)|Shadowland]], and [[Mick Pointer]], the original drummer of [[Marillion]], his tenure lasting from 1979 until 1983. The other founding members of the band were guitarist Keith More, vocalist John Carson, and bassist Cliff Orsi. Orsi was replaced by [[John Jowitt]] (of [[IQ (band)|IQ]]) in the band's inaugural year, whilst Carson and More left the band in 1996 and 1997, and were replaced by Paul Wrightson and [[John Mitchell (musician)|John Mitchell]] (of [[Frost*]]) respectively. Both Jowitt and Wrightson left the band in 1998, to be replaced by Ian Salmon and Rob Sowden, creating the band's most stable lineup to date (from 1998 until 2010). This lineup came to an end with Paul Manzi replacing Sowden in 2010. In 2011, Jowitt rejoined the band to replace the departing Salmon, leaving again in 2014 and being replaced by Kylan Amos.\n\nMost of the band's lyrics are written by Nolan, though Pointer contributed lyrics to Sirens and other tracks on the first two albums.\n\nMusically the band's style ranges from symphonic to hard rock. Some of the band's recent albums have a similar sound to Nolan's earlier band, Shadowland.\n\n[[Allmusic]] called them one of the dominant [[neo-progressive rock|neo-prog]] groups of the 1990s. <ref>{{cite web |author= Geoff Orens|title= Arena Biography |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/arena-p37103/biography |publisher= [[Allmusic.com]]|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n===Members===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Current members\n* [[Clive Nolan]] -

The band's style ranges from [[symphonic]] to [[hard rock]].\n\n== History ==\nArena was founded in 1995 by [[Clive Nolan]] keyboardist of [[Pendragon (band)|Pendragon]] and [[Shadowland (band)|Shadowland]], and [[Mick Pointer]], the original drummer of [[Marillion]], his tenure lasting from 1979 until 1983. The other founding members of the band were guitarist Keith More, vocalist John Carson, and bassist Cliff Orsi. Orsi was replaced by [[John Jowitt]] (of [[IQ (band)|IQ]]) in the band's inaugural year, whilst Carson and More left the band in 1996 and 1997, and were replaced by Paul Wrightson and [[John Mitchell (musician)|John Mitchell]] (of [[Frost*]]) respectively. Both Jowitt and Wrightson left the band in 1998, to be replaced by Ian Salmon and Rob Sowden, creating the band's most stable lineup to date (from 1998 until 2010). This lineup came to an end with Paul Manzi replacing Sowden in 2010. In 2011, Jowitt rejoined the band to replace the departing Salmon, leaving again in 2014 and being replaced by Kylan Amos.\n\nMost of the band's lyrics are written by Nolan, though Pointer contributed lyrics to Sirens and other tracks on the first two albums.\n\nMusically the band's style ranges from symphonic to hard rock. Some of the band's recent albums have a similar sound to Nolan's earlier band, Shadowland.\n\n[[Allmusic]] called them one of the dominant [[neo-progressive rock|neo-prog]] groups of the 1990s. <ref>{{cite web |author= Geoff Orens|title= Arena Biography |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/arena-p37103/biography |publisher= [[Allmusic.com]]|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n===Members===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Current members\n* [[Clive Nolan]] -

His first appearance is in ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. Gordon Freeman is an [[United States|American]] man from [[Seattle]], who graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Theoretical Physics]]. He was an employee at the fictional [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. Controlled by the player, Gordon is often tasked with using a wide range of weapons and tools to fight alien creatures such as [[headcrabs]], as well as [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] machines and soldiers.\n\nGordon Freeman's character has been well received by critics and gamers, and various gaming websites often consider him to be one of the greatest video game characters of all time, including [[UGO]]<ref name=\":1\" /> and [[GameSpot]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Character design==\n[[File:Gordon Freeman concept art.png|thumb|left|150px|An early concept art of Gordon Freeman, wearing a bulkier HEV suit, helmet, and goggles.]]\n\n''Half-Life'' director [[Gabe Newell]] coined the name \"Gordon Freeman\" during a conversation with the game's writer [[Marc Laidlaw]] in his car. Laidlaw had originally named the character \"Dyson Poincar\u00e9\", combining the names of physicist and philosopher [[Freeman Dyson]] and mathematician [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]]. The texture for Gordon's head was \"too big of a job for just one person\", so Valve designers combined references from four people. An earlier model of Gordon, known as \"Ivan the Space Biker\", had a full beard that was subsequently trimmed. Other iterations of Gordon's concept featured different glasses, a ponytail, and a helmet.<ref name=\"raising the bar\">{{cite book|title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|last=Hodgson|first=David|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7615-4364-3|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pied-de-biche 01.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]], Freeman's most iconic weapon.]]\nGordon wears a special full-body [[hazmat suit]], known as the '''H'''azardous '''E'''n'''v'''ironment Suit (or HEV Suit). The suit is designed to protect the user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of hazardous materials. The suit's main feature is its \"high-impact [[reactive armor]]\", an electrically powered armor system that, when charged, absorbs two-thirds of the damage that Gordon would ordinarily suffer in ''Half-Life'' and 80% in ''Half-Life 2''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in [[flashlight]], a radio, various tracking devices, a [[compass]], and a [[Geiger counter]]. The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user's health and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the user's condition. It also projects a [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) which displays Gordon's health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a crosshair.\nAs a means of immersing the player in the role, Gordon [[Silent protagonist|never speaks]], and there are no cutscenes or mission briefings\u2014all action is viewed through Gordon's eyes, with the player retaining control of Gordon's actions at nearly all times. The images of Gordon are only seen on the game's cover and menu pages, and also in advertisements, making them marketing tools rather than pictures of what Gordon is \"really like\". [[Gabe Newell]] has stated that [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] sees no reason to give Gordon a voice.<ref name=\"no reason\">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=241221 |title=Gabe Newell: Next Half-Life won't change Gordon Freeman |first=Tim |last=Ingham |date=2010-04-04 |publisher=Computer and Video Games |accessdate=2012-12-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409061413/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=241221 |archivedate=2010-04-09 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Half-Life'', Gordon wears the ''Mark IV'' suit. Later in the game, the suit is equipped with an optional long-jump module so Gordon can leap great distances. It is charged using power modules throughout Black Mesa. In ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' Gordon receives the upgraded ''Mark V'' suit, which lacks the long-jump module but gains several new abilities. It features a visual [[Zoom lens|zoom]]ing capability, limited sprinting, an anti-venom injector, an optional ammo and health counter on the [[crosshair]], and the capability to use [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] power nodes to charge the suit.\n\nThe ''Mark V'' initially used a single power source for the flashlight, sprinting, and oxygen supply; in ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'' the flashlight was given a separate power source to improve gameplay. The symbol on Gordon's HEV suit is the lower case Greek letter [[Lambda]], \u03bb. This symbol is used by scientists to denote the [[decay constant]] of radioactive elements (related to the [[half-life]] of an element). As well as appearing on Gordon's suit, the symbol replaces the letter \"a\" in the game title (''H'''\u03bb'''lf-Life''), and is the name of the complex in the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] where teleportation experiments are conducted in the first game. The Lambda symbol is also seen in ''Half-Life 2'' as a marking of the human resistance, seen close to hidden supplies and on the arm bands of better equipped resistance fighters.\n\n==Fictional biography==\n===Background and skills===\n[[File:FreemanJobLetter.jpg|thumb|120px|Freeman's acceptance letter from Black Mesa.]]\n\nA [[Seattle]] native, Gordon exhibited an early interest in theoretical physics, especially [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]].

He takes up residence at Black Mesa, conducting [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[subatomic]] research in its Anomalous Materials department. Despite his education as a theoretical physicist, the work Freeman is involved with at Black Mesa is of a more [[experimental physicist|experimental nature]].\n\nThe games often make light of the fact that the tasks Gordon performs amount to little more than manual labor, despite his qualifications. Gordon's assigned job at the start of ''Half-Life'' consists of little more than pressing a button and pushing a cart. [[Barney Calhoun]] wryly notes this irony at the beginning of ''Half-Life 2'', when Freeman performs similar \"technical\" assistance by flipping a switch and returning a plug to its socket.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|level=Chapter 2: \"A Red Letter Day\"|quote='''Barney Calhoun''': Good job, Gordon. Throwing that switch and all. I can see your MIT education really pays for itself.}}</ref>\n\nA [[silent protagonist]], Gordon does not say a single word during the entire ''Half-Life'' saga. Although as proficient as the player with weapons and explosives, Freeman had not actually handled any weapons until some cursory training at the Black Mesa Research Facility's Hazard Course.<ref name=primesg_hl>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Joe Grant|title=Half-Life: Prima Official Strategy Guide|publisher=Prima Games|year=2000|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n===''Half-Life''===\nIn ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', Gordon Freeman is part of a research team performing an experiment that inadvertently creates an inter-dimensional rift in spacetime. Intelligent (and confused) alien lifeforms from the Xen dimension come pouring through multiple breaches inside the Black Mesa facility, attacking anyone in sight. As scientific, military and civilian personnel fall under the alien onslaught, Freeman finds himself targeted not only by the alien monsters, but also the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU), a U.S. Marine Corps military force sent to contain the situation.\n\nThe untrained theoretical physicist somehow manages to survive the chaos, impressing the few surviving scientists and security guards with his heroic acts, while quickly becoming the HECU's high-priority target. Freeman is eventually transported to Xen by a few surviving Lambda Sector scientists. After the successful elimination of the alien leader Nihilanth, Freeman meets the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]], who has been remotely observing Freeman throughout the entire Black Mesa Incident. He briefly teleports Freeman to several locations throughout Earth and Xen, ending on a train (much like how the game begins) where he offers Freeman a choice, either agree to work for him and his mysterious \"employers\" or be left to die on Xen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Heather|authorlink=|title=Half-Life instruction manual|url=|accessdate=|year=1998|publisher=Valve|location=|isbn=|page=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe two expansions for ''Half-Life'' feature different playable characters and take place during the events of the main game, and as such Gordon is seen at certain points of the games. In these appearances, Gordon maintains his silence, even though he is not the protagonist. In ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]'', [[Adrian Shephard]] only encounters Gordon once when he witnesses Gordon teleport to [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] in the Lambda Complex. Attempts to follow him through the same portal will result in a \"[[temporal paradox]]\" which sends Shephard falling through Xen's void and ends the game. Gordon is also seen three times by Barney Calhoun during the course of ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift]]''. Barney first sees Gordon passing by in a tram at the beginning of the game, later heading towards the HEV storage area through a surveillance camera, and lastly being dragged to a trash compactor by a pair of HECU troops.\n\n===''Half-Life 2'' and Episodes===\n''[[Half-Life 2]]'' begins as the G-Man speaks to Gordon in a dreamlike scene, after keeping him \"in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] far from Earth, thought, and time itself\" for nearly two decades, during which he did not physically age.<ref>[http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php Half-Life 2: Episode One story page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725080723/http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php |date=2008-07-25 }}.

He soon meets up with [[Barney Calhoun]] and [[Alyx Vance]], and joins the resistance against the Combine.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Gordon battles the forces of the Combine in order to free humanity from its grasp. Already famous for his role in the Black Mesa Incident, Gordon quickly develops a legendary reputation among Earth's surviving human populace, who begin to look up to him and refer to him by such messianic titles as \"the One Free Man\" or \"the Opener of the Way.\" After slaying scores of Combine soldiers and leading an assault against the Combine stronghold of Nova Prospekt, Gordon eventually sparks a full-scale rebellion, in which he becomes a combatant. Gordon infiltrates one of the Combine's footholds on Earth, City 17's Citadel, and destroys it by detonating its Dark Energy Reactor.\n\nIn doing so, he also prevents antagonist [[Wallace Breen|Dr. Wallace Breen]], the Combine's human representative on Earth and Gordon's former administrator at Black Mesa, from escaping via teleporter, thereby possibly killing him. Although caught in the reactor's explosion along with Alyx Vance, Gordon is rescued by the G-Man (apparently leaving Alyx Vance to face the explosion alone), who tells Freeman that he is impressed with his work and has received \"several tempting offers\" for his \"services.\" He deposits Freeman back in stasis, this time without giving him \"the illusion of free choice\".<ref>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2|developer=Valve|level=Chapter 14: Dark Energy|quote='''G-Man''': Time, ''Doctor'' Freeman?

''(smiles, then walks away)''}}</ref>\n\n''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' rejoins Gordon and Alyx Vance, who are separately removed from the G-Man's stasis by the [[Vortigaunt]]s and rescued a split second before the reactor explosion, greatly displeasing the G-Man. Gordon regains consciousness under a pile of rubble and is found by Alyx and Dog. Their proximity to the Citadel, coupled with its imminent explosion, which would level much of City 17, requires them to go back inside and stabilize the core, stalling the structure's destruction long enough for both themselves and much of the human population to escape. Gordon and Alyx succeed in doing so, but learn that the local Combine forces are attempting to send a distress message for off-world assistance, using the Citadel's destruction to power the transmission.\n\nThe Combine consider this a positive, as the subsequent explosion would destroy all of City 17 and much of the surrounding countryside, which has been all but lost to human resistance forces. With a copy of the distress message, Gordon and Alyx escape the Citadel and meet up with Barney and other survivors. The pair escape City 17 via an evacuation train as the Citadel core goes critical, sending out the Combine message.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2: Episode One |developer=Valve |publisher=Valve |date=2006-06-01 |platform=[[Personal computer|PC]] |quote= '''Alyx:''' Oh my god! The transmission is going out!}}</ref> The resulting shockwave derails their train.\n\nIn ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'', Gordon wakes up in the wrecked train and is freed by Alyx, who had earlier escaped the wreckage. A massive superportal is forming over what was once City 17, which will allow the Combine to send an invasion fleet once it is fully formed. The data they carry is the key to destroying it. Gordon and Alyx make their way to White Forest, an apparent Soviet-era missile base turned into a rebel stronghold, where the data can be sent to an orbiting satellite via a rocket, which will allow the resistance to collapse the portal. After Alyx is critically wounded by a Hunter, Gordon assists the Vortigaunts in saving her, their healing ritual giving the G-Man the opportunity to speak to Gordon. During this conversation, the G-Man reveals to Gordon that he saved Alyx from the Black Mesa incident. He also embeds a message in Alyx's brain for her father, Eli: \"prepare for unforeseen consequences.\"\n\nWhen the duo reaches White Forest, after a run-in with a Combine Advisor, they are reunited with Dr. Kleiner and Dr. Eli Vance, and are formally introduced to Dr. Arne Magnusson, who has taken control of the base. After Gordon seals the silo from a Combine attack, Gordon, Alyx, Dr. Kleiner, and Dr. Eli Vance watch the transmission from Dr. Mossman seen in ''Episode One'', acquired with the stolen Combine data. It reveals that she has located the ''Borealis'', an [[Aperture Science]] research vessel which contains something supposedly capable of causing \"another Black Mesa.\" The G-Man compels Alyx to deliver his message, and once Eli sends her away he reveals that he, too, knows of the G-Man, referring to him as \"our mutual friend.\" With the Combine now sending Striders to shoot the rocket down, Magnusson enlists Gordon's aid in stopping them through the use of his special explosive charges known as Magnusson Devices and Gordon's [[Gravity Gun]].\n\nAfter repelling the attack, the rocket is launched and the portal is destroyed. As Gordon and Alyx prepare to leave for the ''Borealis'' in an old helicopter, they are ambushed by Advisors, which kill Eli before Dog forces them to flee. The game ends with Alyx mourning over Eli's body.<ref name=orangebox_pgg>{{cite book|last1=Hodgson|first1=David|authorlink1=|last2=Stratton|first2=Stephen|last3=Miguel|first3=Miguel|title=The Orange Box: Prima Official Game Guide|url=|accessdate=|year=2007|publication-date=9 October 2007|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|location=|isbn=9780761556930|page=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=David|authorlink=|title=Half-Life 2: Prima Official Game Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/halflife2primaof0000hodg|accessdate=|year=2004|publisher=Prima Games|location=|isbn=0-7615-4362-7|page=|pages=|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===''Half-Life: Alyx''===\nUnlike previous games in the series, the player does not control Gordon and instead controls Alyx Vance. The game is set between the events of the original ''Half-Life'' and ''Half-Life 2,'' and Alyx is attempting to locate Gordon to help overthrow the Combine occupation of Earth. At the end of the game, she reaches a Combine prison that she believes to contain Gordon and she releases its occupant, only to discover it is the G-Man.\n\nThe G-Man shows Alyx the future, with her crying over Eli's body at the end of ''Episode 2.'' The G-Man gives her the opportunity to change the future by killing the Combine Advisor that kills her father. She does so, and the G-Man is impressed, saying that she would be more capable of completing his missions than \"a previous hire who was unable - or unwilling\" to do so. As he says this, he holds a crowbar, before standing to the side to reveal Gordon, who bends down to pick up his glasses, in the first appearance of the character in the series from a third-person perspective. The G-Man then forces Alyx into stasis, awaiting a mission to be assigned to her.\n\nAfter the end credits, the player now has control of Gordon at the end of ''Episode 2,'' albeit with the changed events caused by the G-Man. Eli is furious that Alyx has disappeared, and knows that it must be the G-Man that has taken her. The G-Man can in fact be seen watching events from a balcony at the side of the room, unbeknownst to Eli. Dog jumps in through the window behind him and holds out Gordon's crowbar in his hand. Eli takes it, hands it to Gordon and says \"we've got work to do.\"\n\n==Reception==\nGordon Freeman quickly became and then remained one of the most popular video game characters ever.

His first appearance is in ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. Gordon Freeman is an [[United States|American]] man from [[Seattle]], who graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Theoretical Physics]]. He was an employee at the fictional [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. Controlled by the player, Gordon is often tasked with using a wide range of weapons and tools to fight alien creatures such as [[headcrabs]], as well as [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] machines and soldiers.\n\nGordon Freeman's character has been well received by critics and gamers, and various gaming websites often consider him to be one of the greatest video game characters of all time, including [[UGO]]<ref name=\":1\" /> and [[GameSpot]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Character design==\n[[File:Gordon Freeman concept art.png|thumb|left|150px|An early concept art of Gordon Freeman, wearing a bulkier HEV suit, helmet, and goggles.]]\n\n''Half-Life'' director [[Gabe Newell]] coined the name \"Gordon Freeman\" during a conversation with the game's writer [[Marc Laidlaw]] in his car. Laidlaw had originally named the character \"Dyson Poincar\u00e9\", combining the names of physicist and philosopher [[Freeman Dyson]] and mathematician [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]]. The texture for Gordon's head was \"too big of a job for just one person\", so Valve designers combined references from four people. An earlier model of Gordon, known as \"Ivan the Space Biker\", had a full beard that was subsequently trimmed. Other iterations of Gordon's concept featured different glasses, a ponytail, and a helmet.<ref name=\"raising the bar\">{{cite book|title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|last=Hodgson|first=David|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7615-4364-3|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pied-de-biche 01.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]], Freeman's most iconic weapon.]]\nGordon wears a special full-body [[hazmat suit]], known as the '''H'''azardous '''E'''n'''v'''ironment Suit (or HEV Suit). The suit is designed to protect the user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of hazardous materials. The suit's main feature is its \"high-impact [[reactive armor]]\", an electrically powered armor system that, when charged, absorbs two-thirds of the damage that Gordon would ordinarily suffer in ''Half-Life'' and 80% in ''Half-Life 2''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in [[flashlight]], a radio, various tracking devices, a [[compass]], and a [[Geiger counter]]. The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user's health and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the user's condition. It also projects a [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) which displays Gordon's health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a crosshair.\nAs a means of immersing the player in the role, Gordon [[Silent protagonist|never speaks]], and there are no cutscenes or mission briefings\u2014all action is viewed through Gordon's eyes, with the player retaining control of Gordon's actions at nearly all times. The images of Gordon are only seen on the game's cover and menu pages, and also in advertisements, making them marketing tools rather than pictures of what Gordon is \"really like\". [[Gabe Newell]] has stated that [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] sees no reason to give Gordon a voice.<ref name=\"no reason\">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=241221 |title=Gabe Newell: Next Half-Life won't change Gordon Freeman |first=Tim |last=Ingham |date=2010-04-04 |publisher=Computer and Video Games |accessdate=2012-12-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409061413/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=241221 |archivedate=2010-04-09 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Half-Life'', Gordon wears the ''Mark IV'' suit. Later in the game, the suit is equipped with an optional long-jump module so Gordon can leap great distances. It is charged using power modules throughout Black Mesa. In ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' Gordon receives the upgraded ''Mark V'' suit, which lacks the long-jump module but gains several new abilities. It features a visual [[Zoom lens|zoom]]ing capability, limited sprinting, an anti-venom injector, an optional ammo and health counter on the [[crosshair]], and the capability to use [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] power nodes to charge the suit.\n\nThe ''Mark V'' initially used a single power source for the flashlight, sprinting, and oxygen supply; in ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'' the flashlight was given a separate power source to improve gameplay. The symbol on Gordon's HEV suit is the lower case Greek letter [[Lambda]], \u03bb. This symbol is used by scientists to denote the [[decay constant]] of radioactive elements (related to the [[half-life]] of an element). As well as appearing on Gordon's suit, the symbol replaces the letter \"a\" in the game title (''H'''\u03bb'''lf-Life''), and is the name of the complex in the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] where teleportation experiments are conducted in the first game. The Lambda symbol is also seen in ''Half-Life 2'' as a marking of the human resistance, seen close to hidden supplies and on the arm bands of better equipped resistance fighters.\n\n==Fictional biography==\n===Background and skills===\n[[File:FreemanJobLetter.jpg|thumb|120px|Freeman's acceptance letter from Black Mesa.]]\n\nA [[Seattle]] native, Gordon exhibited an early interest in theoretical physics, especially [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]].

He takes up residence at Black Mesa, conducting [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[subatomic]] research in its Anomalous Materials department. Despite his education as a theoretical physicist, the work Freeman is involved with at Black Mesa is of a more [[experimental physicist|experimental nature]].\n\nThe games often make light of the fact that the tasks Gordon performs amount to little more than manual labor, despite his qualifications. Gordon's assigned job at the start of ''Half-Life'' consists of little more than pressing a button and pushing a cart. [[Barney Calhoun]] wryly notes this irony at the beginning of ''Half-Life 2'', when Freeman performs similar \"technical\" assistance by flipping a switch and returning a plug to its socket.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|level=Chapter 2: \"A Red Letter Day\"|quote='''Barney Calhoun''': Good job, Gordon.

Although as proficient as the player with weapons and explosives, Freeman had not actually handled any weapons until some cursory training at the Black Mesa Research Facility's Hazard Course.<ref name=primesg_hl>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Joe Grant|title=Half-Life: Prima Official Strategy Guide|publisher=Prima Games|year=2000|isbn=}}</ref>\n\n===''Half-Life''===\nIn ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', Gordon Freeman is part of a research team performing an experiment that inadvertently creates an inter-dimensional rift in spacetime. Intelligent (and confused) alien lifeforms from the Xen dimension come pouring through multiple breaches inside the Black Mesa facility, attacking anyone in sight. As scientific, military and civilian personnel fall under the alien onslaught, Freeman finds himself targeted not only by the alien monsters, but also the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU), a U.S. Marine Corps military force sent to contain the situation.\n\nThe untrained theoretical physicist somehow manages to survive the chaos, impressing the few surviving scientists and security guards with his heroic acts, while quickly becoming the HECU's high-priority target. Freeman is eventually transported to Xen by a few surviving Lambda Sector scientists. After the successful elimination of the alien leader Nihilanth, Freeman meets the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]], who has been remotely observing Freeman throughout the entire Black Mesa Incident. He briefly teleports Freeman to several locations throughout Earth and Xen, ending on a train (much like how the game begins) where he offers Freeman a choice, either agree to work for him and his mysterious \"employers\" or be left to die on Xen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Heather|authorlink=|title=Half-Life instruction manual|url=|accessdate=|year=1998|publisher=Valve|location=|isbn=|page=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe two expansions for ''Half-Life'' feature different playable characters and take place during the events of the main game, and as such Gordon is seen at certain points of the games. In these appearances, Gordon maintains his silence, even though he is not the protagonist. In ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force]]'', [[Adrian Shephard]] only encounters Gordon once when he witnesses Gordon teleport to [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] in the Lambda Complex. Attempts to follow him through the same portal will result in a \"[[temporal paradox]]\" which sends Shephard falling through Xen's void and ends the game. Gordon is also seen three times by Barney Calhoun during the course of ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift]]''. Barney first sees Gordon passing by in a tram at the beginning of the game, later heading towards the HEV storage area through a surveillance camera, and lastly being dragged to a trash compactor by a pair of HECU troops.\n\n===''Half-Life 2'' and Episodes===\n''[[Half-Life 2]]'' begins as the G-Man speaks to Gordon in a dreamlike scene, after keeping him \"in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] far from Earth, thought, and time itself\" for nearly two decades, during which he did not physically age.<ref>[http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php Half-Life 2: Episode One story page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725080723/http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php |date=2008-07-25 }}.

He soon meets up with [[Barney Calhoun]] and [[Alyx Vance]], and joins the resistance against the Combine.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Gordon battles the forces of the Combine in order to free humanity from its grasp. Already famous for his role in the Black Mesa Incident, Gordon quickly develops a legendary reputation among Earth's surviving human populace, who begin to look up to him and refer to him by such messianic titles as \"the One Free Man\" or \"the Opener of the Way.\" After slaying scores of Combine soldiers and leading an assault against the Combine stronghold of Nova Prospekt, Gordon eventually sparks a full-scale rebellion, in which he becomes a combatant. Gordon infiltrates one of the Combine's footholds on Earth, City 17's Citadel, and destroys it by detonating its Dark Energy Reactor.\n\nIn doing so, he also prevents antagonist [[Wallace Breen|Dr. Wallace Breen]], the Combine's human representative on Earth and Gordon's former administrator at Black Mesa, from escaping via teleporter, thereby possibly killing him. Although caught in the reactor's explosion along with Alyx Vance, Gordon is rescued by the G-Man (apparently leaving Alyx Vance to face the explosion alone), who tells Freeman that he is impressed with his work and has received \"several tempting offers\" for his \"services.\" He deposits Freeman back in stasis, this time without giving him \"the illusion of free choice\".<ref>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2|developer=Valve|level=Chapter 14: Dark Energy|quote='''G-Man''': Time, ''Doctor'' Freeman?

''(smiles, then walks away)''}}</ref>\n\n''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' rejoins Gordon and Alyx Vance, who are separately removed from the G-Man's stasis by the [[Vortigaunt]]s and rescued a split second before the reactor explosion, greatly displeasing the G-Man. Gordon regains consciousness under a pile of rubble and is found by Alyx and Dog. Their proximity to the Citadel, coupled with its imminent explosion, which would level much of City 17, requires them to go back inside and stabilize the core, stalling the structure's destruction long enough for both themselves and much of the human population to escape. Gordon and Alyx succeed in doing so, but learn that the local Combine forces are attempting to send a distress message for off-world assistance, using the Citadel's destruction to power the transmission.\n\nThe Combine consider this a positive, as the subsequent explosion would destroy all of City 17 and much of the surrounding countryside, which has been all but lost to human resistance forces. With a copy of the distress message, Gordon and Alyx escape the Citadel and meet up with Barney and other survivors. The pair escape City 17 via an evacuation train as the Citadel core goes critical, sending out the Combine message.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2: Episode One |developer=Valve |publisher=Valve |date=2006-06-01 |platform=[[Personal computer|PC]] |quote= '''Alyx:''' Oh my god! The transmission is going out!}}</ref> The resulting shockwave derails their train.\n\nIn ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'', Gordon wakes up in the wrecked train and is freed by Alyx, who had earlier escaped the wreckage. A massive superportal is forming over what was once City 17, which will allow the Combine to send an invasion fleet once it is fully formed. The data they carry is the key to destroying it. Gordon and Alyx make their way to White Forest, an apparent Soviet-era missile base turned into a rebel stronghold, where the data can be sent to an orbiting satellite via a rocket, which will allow the resistance to collapse the portal. After Alyx is critically wounded by a Hunter, Gordon assists the Vortigaunts in saving her, their healing ritual giving the G-Man the opportunity to speak to Gordon. During this conversation, the G-Man reveals to Gordon that he saved Alyx from the Black Mesa incident. He also embeds a message in Alyx's brain for her father, Eli: \"prepare for unforeseen consequences.\"\n\nWhen the duo reaches White Forest, after a run-in with a Combine Advisor, they are reunited with Dr. Kleiner and Dr. Eli Vance, and are formally introduced to Dr. Arne Magnusson, who has taken control of the base. After Gordon seals the silo from a Combine attack, Gordon, Alyx, Dr. Kleiner, and Dr. Eli Vance watch the transmission from Dr. Mossman seen in ''Episode One'', acquired with the stolen Combine data. It reveals that she has located the ''Borealis'', an [[Aperture Science]] research vessel which contains something supposedly capable of causing \"another Black Mesa.\" The G-Man compels Alyx to deliver his message, and once Eli sends her away he reveals that he, too, knows of the G-Man, referring to him as \"our mutual friend.\" With the Combine now sending Striders to shoot the rocket down, Magnusson enlists Gordon's aid in stopping them through the use of his special explosive charges known as Magnusson Devices and Gordon's [[Gravity Gun]].\n\nAfter repelling the attack, the rocket is launched and the portal is destroyed. As Gordon and Alyx prepare to leave for the ''Borealis'' in an old helicopter, they are ambushed by Advisors, which kill Eli before Dog forces them to flee. The game ends with Alyx mourning over Eli's body.<ref name=orangebox_pgg>{{cite book|last1=Hodgson|first1=David|authorlink1=|last2=Stratton|first2=Stephen|last3=Miguel|first3=Miguel|title=The Orange Box: Prima Official Game Guide|url=|accessdate=|year=2007|publication-date=9 October 2007|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|location=|isbn=9780761556930|page=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=David|authorlink=|title=Half-Life 2: Prima Official Game Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/halflife2primaof0000hodg|accessdate=|year=2004|publisher=Prima Games|location=|isbn=0-7615-4362-7|page=|pages=|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===''Half-Life: Alyx''===\nUnlike previous games in the series, the player does not control Gordon and instead controls Alyx Vance. The game is set between the events of the original ''Half-Life'' and ''Half-Life 2,'' and Alyx is attempting to locate Gordon to help overthrow the Combine occupation of Earth. At the end of the game, she reaches a Combine prison that she believes to contain Gordon and she releases its occupant, only to discover it is the G-Man.\n\nThe G-Man shows Alyx the future, with her crying over Eli's body at the end of ''Episode 2.'' The G-Man gives her the opportunity to change the future by killing the Combine Advisor that kills her father. She does so, and the G-Man is impressed, saying that she would be more capable of completing his missions than \"a previous hire who was unable - or unwilling\" to do so. As he says this, he holds a crowbar, before standing to the side to reveal Gordon, who bends down to pick up his glasses, in the first appearance of the character in the series from a third-person perspective. The G-Man then forces Alyx into stasis, awaiting a mission to be assigned to her.\n\nAfter the end credits, the player now has control of Gordon at the end of ''Episode 2,'' albeit with the changed events caused by the G-Man. Eli is furious that Alyx has disappeared, and knows that it must be the G-Man that has taken her. The G-Man can in fact be seen watching events from a balcony at the side of the room, unbeknownst to Eli. Dog jumps in through the window behind him and holds out Gordon's crowbar in his hand. Eli takes it, hands it to Gordon and says \"we've got work to do.\"\n\n==Reception==\nGordon Freeman quickly became and then remained one of the most popular video game characters ever.
