He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=\"Guardian-2011-04-16\" />\n\nWhilst the allegations regarding the ''News of the World'' continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], culminating in an appearance on [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in July 2011.<ref name=\"guardian-2011-07-08\" />\n\nGrant said: \"It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world.

He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=\"Guardian-2011-04-16\" />\n\nWhilst the allegations regarding the ''News of the World'' continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], culminating in an appearance on [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in July 2011.<ref name=\"guardian-2011-07-08\" />\n\nGrant said: \"It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world.

Only Steven Groller is allowed to use this number.\n\n== Mathematics ==\nThere are several mathematical theories which include both infinite values and addition.\n\n* [[Cardinal number]]s are representations of sizes (cardinalities) of abstract sets, which may be [[infinite set|infinite]]. [[Cardinal addition|Addition of cardinal numbers]] is defined as the cardinality of the [[disjoint union]] of sets of given cardinalities.

Moreover, if one assumes the [[axiom of choice]], then \u03ba + \u03bb = max { \u03ba, \u03bb } if at least one of \u03ba or \u03bb is infinite.\n* [[Ordinal number]]s represent [[order type]]s of [[well-order]]ed sets.

The resulting system is an [[ordered field]] thanks to the [[transfer principle#Transfer principle for the hyperreals|transfer principle]], which states that any [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentence which is true for real numbers also holds for hyperreals.

Countries like the United States, do not offer any legal assistance in making the asylum claim, requiring the applicant to find and fund their own legal representation.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many applicants inside the United States do not get a lawyer during this process and represent themselves. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom offer legal aid, increasing the number of applicants who have access to legal advice and representation in applying for refugee status or asylum.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile many refugees share the same difficulties navigating the system, LGBTQ refugees face additional challenges due to the nature of their claim. Communities are built among LGBTQ refugees and asylum-seekers, leading to a network of advice about how to navigate the system.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> These networks help share success stories in navigating the system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Agencies funded by the government to resettle and assist refugees and asylum-seekers can offer further, more general assistance.

Bisexual claimants face an even greater challenge due to their dual sexuality. In bisexuality claims, claimants must demonstrate that they are at risk for persecution, even if their sexuality allows them to act in a heterosexual manner.\n\nLawyer S Chelvan reported to the Huffington post reported that the use of pornographic evidence\u2014individuals taping themselves having sex with same sex partners\u2014has risen due to challenges to credibility of queer claims. Furthermore, immigration officials have refused witnesses for the credibility of queer asylum claims if the witness did not have sex with applicant.

Outraged, he ordered his men to fortify the town and set fire to the church, killing 63 unarmed Huguenots and wounding over a hundred.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lindsay|first=Thomas M.|title=History of the Reformation Reformation in Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Scotland and England|page=189|year=2003|origyear=1906|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons; Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-6367-6|oclc=3960339|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjPtkNc7YDIC&pg=PA189|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n{{onesource|date=February 2017}}\nThe [[massacre]] provoked open hostilities between some followers of each religion, sparking the first war of a long series of [[French Wars of Religion]], which continued largely uninterrupted for more than a century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gonz\u00e1lez|first=Justo L.|title=The Story of Christianity: The Reformation to the present day|year=2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-06-185589-4|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apDhc1QpprMC&pg=PA128|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Bourbons, led by the [[Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Prince of Cond\u00e9]], and proclaiming that they were liberating the king and regent from \"evil\" councillors, organised a kind of protectorate over the Protestant churches and began to seize and garrison strategic towns along the [[Loire]]. Although the Huguenots had begun to mobilise for war before Vassy,<ref>Knecht, The French Civil Wars, p86</ref> [[Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]] used the massacre as evidence that the Edict had been broken, lending further weight to his campaign, and as hostilities broke out, the Edict was in fact revoked under pressure from the Guise faction.\n\nThe major engagements of the war occurred at [[Rouen]], [[Battle of Dreux|Dreux]] and Orl\u00e9ans. At the Siege of Rouen (May\u2013October 1562), the crown regained the city at the cost of [[Antoine de Bourbon, duc de Vend\u00f4me|Antoine de Navarre]], who died of his wounds. The Battle of Dreux (December 1562), saw the capture of [[Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]] by the Guises and [[Anne de Montmorency|Montmorency]], the governor general, by the Bourbons. \n\nIn February 1563, at the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, [[Francis, Duke of Guise]] was shot and killed by the Huguenot Poltrot de M\u00e9r\u00e9; the Guise considered this an [[assassination]] on the orders of the duke\u2019s enemy, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]], as it was outside of direct combat. The popular unrest caused by the 'assassination', coupled with the fact that [[Orl\u00e9ans]] was holding out in the siege, led [[Catherine de' Medici|Catherine]] to mediate a truce and the [[Edict of Amboise]] (1563).\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of massacres in France]]\n*[[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/the-protestant-museum-in-the-wassy-barn/ Virtual Museum of Protestantism: ''The protestant Museum in the Wassy barn'']\n\n{{coord missing|France}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Massacre Of Vassy}}\n[[Category:1562 in France]]\n[[Category:Anti-Protestantism]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1562]]\n[[Category:Massacres in France|Wassy]]\n[[Category:History of Haute-Marne]]\n[[Category:French Wars of Religion]]\n", "name_user": "186.168.155.153", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_Wassy"}
