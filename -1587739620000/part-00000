The ''Catechism'', using [[Libri Carolini|very traditional arguments]], posits that God gave permission for images that symbolize Christian salvation by leaving symbols such as the [[Nehushtan|bronze serpent]], and the [[cherubim]] on the [[Ark of the Covenant]].

At the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787, the [[ecumenical council]] determined that the veneration of icons and statues was not in violation of the commandment and stated \"whoever venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it.\"<ref name=\"schreck305\">Schreck, p. 305</ref>{{refn|The Catholic Church believes that it is continually guided by the [[Holy Spirit]] and is thus [[Infallibility of the Church|protected from making a doctrinal error]].<ref name=\"Schreck16\">Schreck, p. 16</ref>  The highest doctrinal authority of the Church rests in the decisions of the [[ecumenical council]]s, which are headed by the [[pope]].<ref name=\"schreck305\"/>|group=note}} At around the time of the controversy over Iconoclasm, the Western church began to use [[monumental sculpture]], which by the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]] became a major feature of Western Christian art, that has remained part of the Catholic tradition, in contrast to [[Eastern Christianity]], which avoids large religious sculpture. The ''Catechism'', using [[Libri Carolini|very traditional arguments]], posits that God gave permission for images that symbolize Christian salvation by leaving symbols such as the [[Nehushtan|bronze serpent]], and the [[cherubim]] on the [[Ark of the Covenant]].

Like heterosexual acts outside of marriage, [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|homosexual acts are considered sins]].

The ''Catechism'' addresses the concept of human stewardship of God's creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment.<ref name=\"Cat2401\"/>\n\n===Private property===\nAccording to the Church, people have a right to private property. However, ownership makes that person \"a steward\" who is expected to make it \"fruitful\" or profitable in a way that benefits others after that person has first taken care of their family.<ref name=\"Cat2401\"/><ref name=\"Kreeft260\">Kreeft, pp. 260\u2013261</ref> Private property and the common good are seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society.<ref name=\"Kreeft260\"/> The taking of another's private property \"in obvious and urgent necessity\" as \"the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing)\" is not considered by the Church to be stealing.<ref name=\"Cat2401\"/><ref name=\"Kreeft260\"/> The concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the Church, which classifies it as the stealing of a person's human rights.<ref name=\"Cat2401\"/><ref>Schreck, p. 317</ref>\n\n===Theft===\nAccording to the ''Catechism'', theft or stealing means \"usurping another's property against the reasonable will of the owner\" though exclusion exists for someone in great need to survive. \"Unjustly taking and keeping the property of others\" considered as theft, even if the act is outside the scope of civil law.<ref name=\"Cat2401\"/> Cardinal [[Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn]] gave example from the story of Saint [[Augustine]], written in his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', who took pears from neighbor's garden when he was young. Sch\u00f6nborn says that Augustine still has \"pangs of conscience over a childish theft\" even when he became grown person, indicating that human conscience is very aware of theft though the act perhaps not an offense against civil law.<ref>Sch\u00f6nborn (2001), p. 46</ref>\n\nFollowing acts are also considered as violation of the seventh commandment: price manipulation to get advantage on the harm of others, corruption, appropriation of the public goods for personal interests, work poorly carried out, tax avoidance, counterfeiting of checks or any means of payment, any forms of copyright infringement and piracy, and extravagance.<ref name=\"Cat2401\"/><ref>Sch\u00f6nborn (2011), Q. 428-429</ref>\n\n===Social justice===\nThe papal encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' discusses the relationships and mutual duties between labor and capital, as well as government and its citizens. Of primary concern was the need for some amelioration for \"the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class\".<ref>{{ws|[[s:Rerum novarum#3|Paragraph 3]], ''Rerum novarum''}}</ref> The encyclical supported the right to form [[labor unions|unions]], rejected [[socialism]], [[communism]] and unrestricted [[capitalism]], and affirmed the right to [[private property]].<ref>Bokenkotter, p. 337</ref>\n\nChurch interpretation of the seventh commandment teaches that business owners should balance a desire for profits that will ensure the future of the business with a responsibility toward the \"good of persons\".<ref name=\"Kreeft264\">Kreeft, pp. 263\u2013264</ref> Business owners are required to pay their workers a reasonable wage, honor contracts, and abstain from dishonest activity, including bribery of government officials. Workers are required to do their jobs conscientiously, as they have been hired to do them, and to avoid dishonesty in the workplace, such as using office goods for personal use without permission ([[embezzlement]]).\n\nThe Church teaches that a balance should exist between government regulation and the laws of the marketplace. It deems that sole reliance on the marketplace (pure capitalism) insufficiently addresses many human needs, while sole reliance on government regulation (pure socialism) \"perverts the basis of social bonds\".<ref name=\"Kreeft264\"/> The Church warns about the danger of either capitalism or socialism, as these systems tend to use excessive extremes that result in injustice to persons.<ref name=\"Kreeft264\"/><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.kofc.org/un/en/resources/cis/cis129.pdf |title=The Seventh and Tenth Commandments: Economic and Political Morality |others=Based on the Catechism of the Catholic Church by Peter Kreeft |editor=John A.

In 1581 he was busily employed in endeavouring to counteract the growing influence of [[Esme Stewart, lord of Aubign\u00e9]], over James VI. He witnessed the events which led to the [[raid of Ruthven]] and D'Aubign\u00e9's fall.
