She was the first woman to head a democratic government in a [[Muslim majority countries|Muslim majority]] nation. Ideologically a [[liberalism|liberal]] and a [[secularism|secularist]], she chaired or co-chaired the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) from the early 1980s until her [[Assassination of Benazir Bhutto|assassination in 2007]].\n\nOf mixed [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] and [[Kurds|Kurdish]] parentage, Bhutto was born in [[Karachi]] to a [[Bhutto family|politically important, wealthy aristocratic family]]. Her father, the PPP's founder and leader [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Zulfikar]], was elected Prime Minister on a [[socialism|socialist]] platform in 1973. Bhutto studied at [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Oxford]], where she was President of the [[Oxford Union]]. She returned to Pakistan in 1977, shortly before her father was [[Operation Fair Play|ousted in a military coup]] and executed. Bhutto and her mother [[Nusrat Bhutto|Nusrat]] took control of the PPP and led the country's [[Movement for the Restoration of Democracy]]; Bhutto was repeatedly imprisoned by [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s military government and then exiled to Britain in 1984. She returned in 1986 and\u2014influenced by [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] economics\u2014transformed the PPP's platform from a socialist to a liberal one, before leading it to victory in the [[1988 Pakistani general election|1988 election]]. As Prime Minister, her attempts at reform were stifled by [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservative]] and [[Islamism|Islamist]] forces, including President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and the powerful military. Her administration was accused of corruption and nepotism, and dismissed by Khan in 1990. Intelligence services rigged [[1990 Pakistani general election|that year's election]] to ensure a victory for the conservative [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islamic Democratic Alliance]] (IJI), after which Bhutto served as the [[Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan)|Leader of the Opposition]].\n\nAfter the IJI government of Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] was also dismissed on corruption charges, Bhutto led the PPP to victory in the [[1993 Pakistani general election|1993 elections]]. Her second term oversaw economic privatisation and attempts to advance [[women's rights]]. Her government was damaged by several controversies, including the assassination of her brother [[Murtaza Bhutto|Murtaza]], a [[1995 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|failed 1995 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and a further bribery scandal involving her and her husband [[Asif Ali Zardari]]; in response to the latter, the President again dismissed her government. The PPP lost the [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997 election]] and in 1998 she went into self-exile in [[Dubai]], leading her party mainly through proxies. A widening corruption inquiry culminated in a 2003 conviction in a Swiss court. Following United States-brokered negotiations with President [[Pervez Musharraf]], she returned to Pakistan in 2007 to compete in the [[2008 Pakistani general election|2008 elections]]; her platform emphasised civilian oversight of the military and opposition to growing Islamist violence. After a political rally in [[Rawalpindi]], she was assassinated. The [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadi]] group [[al-Qaeda]] claimed responsibility, although the involvement of the [[Pakistani Taliban]] and rogue elements of the intelligence services were widely suspected. She was buried at her [[Bhutto family mausoleum|family mausoleum]].\n\nBhutto was a controversial figure.

Soon economic progress became her top priority but her investment and industrialisation programs faced major setbacks due to conceptions formed by investors based upon her People's Party nationalisation program in the 1970s. By the 1990s, Khan and Bhutto's government had also ultimately lost the [[currency war]] with the Indian Rupee which beat the value of Pakistan rupee for the first time in the 1970s. Bhutto's denationalisation program also suffered from many political setbacks, as many of her government members were either directly or indirectly involved with the government corruption in major government-owned industries, and her appointed government members allegedly sabotaged her efforts to privatise the industries.<ref name=Routledge />\n\nOverall, the living standard for people in Pakistan declined as inflation and unemployment grew at an exponential rate particularly as UN sanctions began to take effect. During her first and second term, the difference between rich and poor visibly increased and the middle class in particular were the ones who bore the brunt of the economic inequality. According to a calculation completed by the [[Federal Bureau of Statistics]], the standard of living for the rich improved while the standard of living for the poor declined.<ref name=Routledge/> Benazir attributed this economic inequality to be a result of ongoing and continuous illegal [[Bangladeshis in Pakistan|Bangladeshi immigration]]. Bhutto ordered a crackdown on and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. Her action strained and created tensions in [[Bangladesh\u2013Pakistan relations]], as Bangladesh Prime Minister [[Khaleda Zia]] refused to accept the deportees and reportedly sent two planeloads back to Pakistan. Religious parties also criticised Bhutto and dubbed the crackdown as anti-Islamic.<ref name=Pakistandirectorate>{{cite web|last=Press Report |title=Indo-Pakistan-Bangladesh standoff |url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cpapers6%5Cpaper597.html |work=South Asia Analysis |publisher=Pakistan directorate |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218074625/http://southasiaanalysis.org/papers6/paper597.html |archivedate=18 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThis operation backfired and had devastating effects on Pakistan's economy.<ref name=Pakistandirectorate /> President Khan saw this as a major economic failure despite Khan's permission granted to Bhutto for the approval of her economic policies.

General Abdul Waheed was an uptight, strict, and a professional officer with a views of Westernized democracy. Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan]] as Chief of Naval Staff; General [[Abbas Khattak]] as Chief of Air Staff. Whilst, Air Chief Marshal [[Farooq Feroze Khan]] was appointed chairman Joint Chiefs who was the first (and to date only) Pakistani [[air officer]] to have reached to such [[4-star rank|4 star]] assignment. Benazir Bhutto enjoyed a strong relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and President who was hand-picked by her did not questioned her authority. She hand-picked officers and promoted them based on their pro-democracy views while the President gave constitutional authorisation for their promotion. The senior military leadership including [[Jehangir Karamat]], Musharraf, Kayani, [[Ali Kuli Khan]], Farooq Feroze Khan, Abbas Khattak and [[Fasih Bokhari]], had strong Western-democratic views, and were generally close to Bhutto as they had resisted Nawaz Sharif's conservatism. Unlike Nawaz Sharif's second democratic term, Benazir worked with the military on many issues where the military disagreement, solving many problems relating directly to civil\u2013military relations. Her tough and hardline policies on Afghanistan, Kashmir and India, which the military had backed Benazir Bhutto staunchly.<ref name=Mazhar />\n\nAfter the assassination was attempted, Benazir Bhutto's civilian security team headed under [[Rehman Malik]], was disbanded by the Pakistan Army whose [[X Corps (Pakistan)|X-Corps]]' [[111th Infantry Brigade (Pakistan)|111th ''Psychological'' Brigade]]\u2014 an army brigade tasked with countering the [[psychological warfare]]\u2014 took control of the security of Benazir Bhutto, that directly reported to Chief of Army Staff and the Prime Minister. Benazir Bhutto ordered General Abdul Waheed Kakar and the Lieutenant-General [[Javed Ashraf Qazi]] director-general of [[ISI (Pakistan)|ISI]], to start a sting and manhunt operation to hunt down the ringmaster, [[Ramzi Yousef]]. After few arrests and intensive manhunt search, the ''ISI'' finally captured Ramzi before he could flee the country. In matter of weeks, Ramzi was secretly extradited to the United States, while the ''ISI'' managed to kill or apprehend all the culprits behind the plot. In 1995, she personally appointed General [[Naseem Rana]] as the Director-General of the ''ISI'', who later commanded the Pakistan Army's assets in which came to known as \"[[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996\u20132001)|Pakistan's secret war in Afghanistan]]\". During this course, General Rana directly reported to the prime minister, and led the intelligence operations after which were approved by Benazir Bhutto. In 1995, Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Mansurul Haq]] as the Chief of Naval Staff, as the Admiral had personal contacts with the Benazir's family. However, it was the Admiral's large-scale corruption, sponsored by her husband [[Asif Zardari]], that shrunk the credibility of Benazir Bhutto by the end of 1996 that led to end of her government after all.<ref name=Mazhar />\n\n[[File:(Benazir Buttho) Rueda de prensa de Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez y la primera ministra de Paquist\u00e1n.

Islam in fact had been quite progressive towards women from its inception.\"{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=61}} Bhutto described her main role model as [[Fatimah]], the daughter of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], stating that she admired her piety, wisdom, and courage.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} She also described the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as a political inspiration.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Personality===\n\n[[File:Benazir bhutto 1988 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Bhutto photographed in 1988.

Ahmed]], who went to school with Bhutto, wrote that she was a \"pampered and precocious\" child.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} Bhatia claimed that at Oxford, where he first met her, Bhutto was spoilt, self-obsessed, and prone to throwing temper tantrums, although at the same time was humorous and generous, willing to pay for her friends' meals whenever at a restaurant.{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=3}} Allen suggested that Bhutto retained her \"characteristic ''[[wikt:de haut en bas#English|de haut en bas]]'' arrogance, a relic of her feudal upbringing\",{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=22}} arguing that her key character flaw had been \"a belief in the special, almost sacred destiny of herself and the Bhutto family\" and that accordingly, while she \"spoke like a democrat&nbsp;... she thought and felt as a dynast\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=152}} In later life, Bhutto was accused of being addicted to power, although Allen thought it more accurate to state that she was \"addicted to adulation\",{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=79}} suggesting that this stemmed from a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] element to Bhutto's personality.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Familial charisma is rare, but in Benazir's case the Bhutto name matters, in that her father's charisma easily transferred to her. She had her own charisma when she emerged in the 1980s as a young, articulate, well-educated and well-spoken woman. Her chief assets were her intelligence, her confidence, and the fact that she could talk to people of various backgrounds with empathy. She had the rare quality of humour, which she never lost in spite of leading an uncertain and challenging life. Above all, she could use the media effectively. Her faults as a political leader were many. Too many stories of corruption stuck to her. She was not a good administrator. She was too inclined to listen to her small kitchen cabinet, which very often consisted of people who would say what they thought she wanted to hear. She became prime minister at a particularly young age and had no prior political or other cabinet experience.\n|source=\u2014 Islamic studies scholar Akbar S.

(magazine)|Hello!]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=20}} She read a number of self-help books, telling a friend that \"for all the lows in my life, those self-help books helped me survive, I can tell you\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=21}} Her father had also encouraged her to read the writings of various prominent political figures, among them [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], and [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=101}} She had a love of French and Italian cuisine,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=5}} and was a great fan of the music of American singer [[Neil Diamond]].{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=104}}\n\nIn a 2002 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Bhutto described her allegiance to the [[Sufism|Sufi]] branch of Sunni Islam.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Allen thought her to have \"some genuine, if unorthodox, religious belief, mixed up with superstition\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Bhargava stated that Bhutto was \"dedicated and devout in her religious principles but modern and emancipated in her behaviour and outlook\".{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=38}}  In conversation, she often used the phrase \"[[inshallah]]\", and insisted that the [[Quran]] supported the equality of the sexes.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Bhutto was [[anti-abortion]] and spoke forcefully against abortion, most notably at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in Cairo, where she accused the West of \"seeking to impose adultery, abortion, intercourse education and other such matters on individuals, societies and religions which have their own social ethos\".<ref>Turner, Brian S.

According to Allen, she would have been aware that a divorce or a public separation would have resulted in the end of her political career in Pakistan due to social stigma around the subject.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=87}} In a 2007 interview, Bhutto said that she and her husband were living apart because of his medical requirements, adding that she visited him every month in New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/434530 |title=Destiny's daughter |work=HuffPost}}</ref> Regarding the rumours of separation, in 2008 Bhutto's friend [[Victoria Schofield]] said that the marriage should not be judged by ordinary standards.

2016{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=149}}\n| align = right\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nMu\u00f1oz described Bhutto as \"one of Pakistan's most important political figures, a respected world leader, and the leading stateswoman in the Islamic world\".{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}} Allen suggested that although Bhutto's record in office was that of a \"corrupt, compromised politician\", Bhutto displayed admirable qualities, especially valour in the face of opposition.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}} Within the Islamic world, Bhutto was often regarded as \"a genuine Muslim political leader\" and recognised as the head of Pakistan's most popular political party.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} Bhargava expressed the view that at the time of her initial election, Bhutto's \"personal popularity\" was \"tremendous\", larger than any that her father had previously achieved.{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=13}}\n\nAt the same time there were many Pakistanis who despised her, disliking her popularity, her ties to Western nations, and her modernising agenda.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}} Extremist Sunni Islamist elements opposed her because of  their belief female leaders are un-Islamic, and because they thought she was a Shia Muslim.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=168}} They maintained that her participation in politics meant associating with men to whom she was not related and that this compromised the modesty required by Islam.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=20}} Conservative clerical opponents also claimed that by being prime minister, Bhutto was to fulfilling her religious duty to focus her energies on having as many children as possible.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=19}}\n\nAhmed stated that Bhutto was one of very few political leaders who had been able to \"assume the iconic status of a political martyr in the West while simultaneously evoking strong sentiments in the Muslim world\".{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} He therefore contrasted her with contemporaries like Iraq's [[Saddam Hussein]] who were popular domestically but hated in the West, and those like Egypt's [[Hosni Mubarak]] who curried favour with Western governments while alienating their domestic audience.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} Bhutto gained popularity in Western nations in part because she could present herself as being \"part of their world\", speaking a high standard of English and having been educated at Harvard and Oxford.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} While her Western supporters sometimes had doubts about her ability to govern, they generally viewed her as a progressive figure who could advance democracy and counter-terrorism in Pakistan.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}}\n\n[[File:Benazir Bhutto memorial coin obverse.JPG|thumb|left|Benazir Bhutto memorial coin, commemorative coin of Pakistan]]\n\nAllen commented that although \"the cards might have been stacked in Bhutto's favor\u2014she was rich, educated, aristocratic, the favoured daughter of a very powerful father\u2014nevertheless, her achievement was a remarkable one\" given the male-dominated environment of late-20th century Pakistani society.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}} Mushtaq Ahmed similarly believed that \"for a woman to win an election in a male-dominated society was an achievement\",{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=i}} and that \"her victory over the forces of reaction and persecution was an unprecedented accomplishment in political history.\"{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=21}} Ahmed thought that the election of a female Prime Minister in a Muslim-majority country served as \"a proclamation that Islam was a forward-thinking religion\".{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=i}} He added that as a pioneering female leader, Bhutto had \"barely half a dozen\" parallels, among them Indira Gandhi, Thatcher, [[Golda Meir]], [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]], and [[Corazon Aquino]].{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=21}} Comparisons with Aquino were often made \u2014 and welcomed by Bhutto \u2014 because both women had fought against a military dictatorship and spent time in exile.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhargava|1y=1990|1p=43|2a1=Lamb|2y=1991|2p=46|3a1=Ahmed|3y=2005|3p=21}}\nShe became a global icon for women's rights,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=4}} and inspired many

[[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] from 1988 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 1996. She was the first woman to head a democratic government in a [[Muslim majority countries|Muslim majority]] nation. Ideologically a [[liberalism|liberal]] and a [[secularism|secularist]], she chaired or co-chaired the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) from the early 1980s until her [[Assassination of Benazir Bhutto|assassination in 2007]].\n\nOf mixed [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] and [[Kurds|Kurdish]] parentage, Bhutto was born in [[Karachi]] to a [[Bhutto family|politically important, wealthy aristocratic family]]. Her father, the PPP's founder and leader [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Zulfikar]], was elected Prime Minister on a [[socialism|socialist]] platform in 1973. Bhutto studied at [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Oxford]], where she was President of the [[Oxford Union]]. She returned to Pakistan in 1977, shortly before her father was [[Operation Fair Play|ousted in a military coup]] and executed. Bhutto and her mother [[Nusrat Bhutto|Nusrat]] took control of the PPP and led the country's [[Movement for the Restoration of Democracy]]; Bhutto was repeatedly imprisoned by [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s military government and then exiled to Britain in 1984. She returned in 1986 and\u2014influenced by [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] economics\u2014transformed the PPP's platform from a socialist to a liberal one, before leading it to victory in the [[1988 Pakistani general election|1988 election]]. As Prime Minister, her attempts at reform were stifled by [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservative]] and [[Islamism|Islamist]] forces, including President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and the powerful military. Her administration was accused of corruption and nepotism, and dismissed by Khan in 1990. Intelligence services rigged [[1990 Pakistani general election|that year's election]] to ensure a victory for the conservative [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islamic Democratic Alliance]] (IJI), after which Bhutto served as the [[Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan)|Leader of the Opposition]].\n\nAfter the IJI government of Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] was also dismissed on corruption charges, Bhutto led the PPP to victory in the [[1993 Pakistani general election|1993 elections]]. Her second term oversaw economic privatisation and attempts to advance [[women's rights]]. Her government was damaged by several controversies, including the assassination of her brother [[Murtaza Bhutto|Murtaza]], a [[1995 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|failed 1995 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and a further bribery scandal involving her and her husband [[Asif Ali Zardari]]; in response to the latter, the President again dismissed her government. The PPP lost the [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997 election]] and in 1998 she went into self-exile in [[Dubai]], leading her party mainly through proxies. A widening corruption inquiry culminated in a 2003 conviction in a Swiss court. Following United States-brokered negotiations with President [[Pervez Musharraf]], she returned to Pakistan in 2007 to compete in the [[2008 Pakistani general election|2008 elections]]; her platform emphasised civilian oversight of the military and opposition to growing Islamist violence. After a political rally in [[Rawalpindi]], she was assassinated. The [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadi]] group [[al-Qaeda]] claimed responsibility, although the involvement of the [[Pakistani Taliban]] and rogue elements of the intelligence services were widely suspected. She was buried at her [[Bhutto family mausoleum|family mausoleum]].\n\nBhutto was a controversial figure. She was often criticised as being politically inexperienced and [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|corrupt]], and faced much opposition from Pakistan's Islamist lobby for her secularist and modernising agenda. In the early years of her career she was nevertheless domestically popular and also attracted support from Western nations, for whom she was a champion of democracy.

Soon economic progress became her top priority but her investment and industrialisation programs faced major setbacks due to conceptions formed by investors based upon her People's Party nationalisation program in the 1970s. By the 1990s, Khan and Bhutto's government had also ultimately lost the [[currency war]] with the Indian Rupee which beat the value of Pakistan rupee for the first time in the 1970s. Bhutto's denationalisation program also suffered from many political setbacks, as many of her government members were either directly or indirectly involved with the government corruption in major government-owned industries, and her appointed government members allegedly sabotaged her efforts to privatise the industries.<ref name=Routledge />\n\nOverall, the living standard for people in Pakistan declined as inflation and unemployment grew at an exponential rate particularly as UN sanctions began to take effect. During her first and second term, the difference between rich and poor visibly increased and the middle class in particular were the ones who bore the brunt of the economic inequality. According to a calculation completed by the [[Federal Bureau of Statistics]], the standard of living for the rich improved while the standard of living for the poor declined.<ref name=Routledge/> Benazir attributed this economic inequality to be a result of ongoing and continuous illegal [[Bangladeshis in Pakistan|Bangladeshi immigration]]. Bhutto ordered a crackdown on and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. Her action strained and created tensions in [[Bangladesh\u2013Pakistan relations]], as Bangladesh Prime Minister [[Khaleda Zia]] refused to accept the deportees and reportedly sent two planeloads back to Pakistan. Religious parties also criticised Bhutto and dubbed the crackdown as anti-Islamic.<ref name=Pakistandirectorate>{{cite web|last=Press Report |title=Indo-Pakistan-Bangladesh standoff |url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cpapers6%5Cpaper597.html |work=South Asia Analysis |publisher=Pakistan directorate |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218074625/http://southasiaanalysis.org/papers6/paper597.html |archivedate=18 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThis operation backfired and had devastating effects on Pakistan's economy.<ref name=Pakistandirectorate /> President Khan saw this as a major economic failure despite Khan's permission granted to Bhutto for the approval of her economic policies.

General Abdul Waheed was an uptight, strict, and a professional officer with a views of Westernized democracy. Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan]] as Chief of Naval Staff; General [[Abbas Khattak]] as Chief of Air Staff. Whilst, Air Chief Marshal [[Farooq Feroze Khan]] was appointed chairman Joint Chiefs who was the first (and to date only) Pakistani [[air officer]] to have reached to such [[4-star rank|4 star]] assignment. Benazir Bhutto enjoyed a strong relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and President who was hand-picked by her did not questioned her authority. She hand-picked officers and promoted them based on their pro-democracy views while the President gave constitutional authorisation for their promotion. The senior military leadership including [[Jehangir Karamat]], Musharraf, Kayani, [[Ali Kuli Khan]], Farooq Feroze Khan, Abbas Khattak and [[Fasih Bokhari]], had strong Western-democratic views, and were generally close to Bhutto as they had resisted Nawaz Sharif's conservatism. Unlike Nawaz Sharif's second democratic term, Benazir worked with the military on many issues where the military disagreement, solving many problems relating directly to civil\u2013military relations. Her tough and hardline policies on Afghanistan, Kashmir and India, which the military had backed Benazir Bhutto staunchly.<ref name=Mazhar />\n\nAfter the assassination was attempted, Benazir Bhutto's civilian security team headed under [[Rehman Malik]], was disbanded by the Pakistan Army whose [[X Corps (Pakistan)|X-Corps]]' [[111th Infantry Brigade (Pakistan)|111th ''Psychological'' Brigade]]\u2014 an army brigade tasked with countering the [[psychological warfare]]\u2014 took control of the security of Benazir Bhutto, that directly reported to Chief of Army Staff and the Prime Minister. Benazir Bhutto ordered General Abdul Waheed Kakar and the Lieutenant-General [[Javed Ashraf Qazi]] director-general of [[ISI (Pakistan)|ISI]], to start a sting and manhunt operation to hunt down the ringmaster, [[Ramzi Yousef]]. After few arrests and intensive manhunt search, the ''ISI'' finally captured Ramzi before he could flee the country. In matter of weeks, Ramzi was secretly extradited to the United States, while the ''ISI'' managed to kill or apprehend all the culprits behind the plot. In 1995, she personally appointed General [[Naseem Rana]] as the Director-General of the ''ISI'', who later commanded the Pakistan Army's assets in which came to known as \"[[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996\u20132001)|Pakistan's secret war in Afghanistan]]\". During this course, General Rana directly reported to the prime minister, and led the intelligence operations after which were approved by Benazir Bhutto. In 1995, Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Mansurul Haq]] as the Chief of Naval Staff, as the Admiral had personal contacts with the Benazir's family. However, it was the Admiral's large-scale corruption, sponsored by her husband [[Asif Zardari]], that shrunk the credibility of Benazir Bhutto by the end of 1996 that led to end of her government after all.<ref name=Mazhar />\n\n[[File:(Benazir Buttho) Rueda de prensa de Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez y la primera ministra de Paquist\u00e1n.

Islam in fact had been quite progressive towards women from its inception.\"{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=61}} Bhutto described her main role model as [[Fatimah]], the daughter of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], stating that she admired her piety, wisdom, and courage.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} She also described the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as a political inspiration.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Personality===\n\n[[File:Benazir bhutto 1988 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Bhutto photographed in 1988.

Ahmed]], who went to school with Bhutto, wrote that she was a \"pampered and precocious\" child.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} Bhatia claimed that at Oxford, where he first met her, Bhutto was spoilt, self-obsessed, and prone to throwing temper tantrums, although at the same time was humorous and generous, willing to pay for her friends' meals whenever at a restaurant.{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=3}} Allen suggested that Bhutto retained her \"characteristic ''[[wikt:de haut en bas#English|de haut en bas]]'' arrogance, a relic of her feudal upbringing\",{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=22}} arguing that her key character flaw had been \"a belief in the special, almost sacred destiny of herself and the Bhutto family\" and that accordingly, while she \"spoke like a democrat&nbsp;... she thought and felt as a dynast\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=152}} In later life, Bhutto was accused of being addicted to power, although Allen thought it more accurate to state that she was \"addicted to adulation\",{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=79}} suggesting that this stemmed from a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] element to Bhutto's personality.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Familial charisma is rare, but in Benazir's case the Bhutto name matters, in that her father's charisma easily transferred to her. She had her own charisma when she emerged in the 1980s as a young, articulate, well-educated and well-spoken woman. Her chief assets were her intelligence, her confidence, and the fact that she could talk to people of various backgrounds with empathy. She had the rare quality of humour, which she never lost in spite of leading an uncertain and challenging life. Above all, she could use the media effectively. Her faults as a political leader were many. Too many stories of corruption stuck to her. She was not a good administrator. She was too inclined to listen to her small kitchen cabinet, which very often consisted of people who would say what they thought she wanted to hear. She became prime minister at a particularly young age and had no prior political or other cabinet experience.\n|source=\u2014 Islamic studies scholar Akbar S.

(magazine)|Hello!]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=20}} She read a number of self-help books, telling a friend that \"for all the lows in my life, those self-help books helped me survive, I can tell you\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=21}} Her father had also encouraged her to read the writings of various prominent political figures, among them [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], and [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=101}} She had a love of French and Italian cuisine,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=5}} and was a great fan of the music of American singer [[Neil Diamond]].{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=104}}\n\nIn a 2002 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Bhutto described her allegiance to the [[Sufism|Sufi]] branch of Sunni Islam.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Allen thought her to have \"some genuine, if unorthodox, religious belief, mixed up with superstition\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Bhargava stated that Bhutto was \"dedicated and devout in her religious principles but modern and emancipated in her behaviour and outlook\".{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=38}}  In conversation, she often used the phrase \"[[inshallah]]\", and insisted that the [[Quran]] supported the equality of the sexes.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Bhutto was [[anti-abortion]] and spoke forcefully against abortion, most notably at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in Cairo, where she accused the West of \"seeking to impose adultery, abortion, intercourse education and other such matters on individuals, societies and religions which have their own social ethos\".<ref>Turner, Brian S.

According to Allen, she would have been aware that a divorce or a public separation would have resulted in the end of her political career in Pakistan due to social stigma around the subject.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=87}} In a 2007 interview, Bhutto said that she and her husband were living apart because of his medical requirements, adding that she visited him every month in New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/434530 |title=Destiny's daughter |work=HuffPost}}</ref> Regarding the rumours of separation, in 2008 Bhutto's friend [[Victoria Schofield]] said that the marriage should not be judged by ordinary standards.

2016{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=149}}\n| align = right\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nMu\u00f1oz described Bhutto as \"one of Pakistan's most important political figures, a respected world leader, and the leading stateswoman in the Islamic world\".{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}} Allen suggested that although Bhutto's record in office was that of a \"corrupt, compromised politician\", Bhutto displayed admirable qualities, especially valour in the face of opposition.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}} Within the Islamic world, Bhutto was often regarded as \"a genuine Muslim political leader\" and recognised as the head of Pakistan's most popular political party.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} Bhargava expressed the view that at the time of her initial election, Bhutto's \"personal popularity\" was \"tremendous\", larger than any that her father had previously achieved.{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=13}}\n\nAt the same time there were many Pakistanis who despised her, disliking her popularity, her ties to Western nations, and her modernising agenda.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}} Extremist Sunni Islamist elements opposed her because of  their belief female leaders are un-Islamic, and because they thought she was a Shia Muslim.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=168}} They maintained that her participation in politics meant associating with men to whom she was not related and that this compromised the modesty required by Islam.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=20}} Conservative clerical opponents also claimed that by being prime minister, Bhutto was to fulfilling her religious duty to focus her energies on having as many children as possible.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=19}}\n\nAhmed stated that Bhutto was one of very few political leaders who had been able to \"assume the iconic status of a political martyr in the West while simultaneously evoking strong sentiments in the Muslim world\".{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} He therefore contrasted her with contemporaries like Iraq's [[Saddam Hussein]] who were popular domestically but hated in the West, and those like Egypt's [[Hosni Mubarak]] who curried favour with Western governments while alienating their domestic audience.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} Bhutto gained popularity in Western nations in part because she could present herself as being \"part of their world\", speaking a high standard of English and having been educated at Harvard and Oxford.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} While her Western supporters sometimes had doubts about her ability to govern, they generally viewed her as a progressive figure who could advance democracy and counter-terrorism in Pakistan.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}}\n\n[[File:Benazir Bhutto memorial coin obverse.JPG|thumb|left|Benazir Bhutto memorial coin, commemorative coin of Pakistan]]\n\nAllen commented that although \"the cards might have been stacked in Bhutto's favor\u2014she was rich, educated, aristocratic, the favoured daughter of a very powerful father\u2014nevertheless, her achievement was a remarkable one\" given the male-dominated environment of late-20th century Pakistani society.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}} Mushtaq Ahmed similarly believed that \"for a woman to win an election in a male-dominated society was an achievement\",{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=i}} and that \"her victory over the forces of reaction and persecution was an unprecedented accomplishment in political history.\"{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=21}} Ahmed thought that the election of a female Prime Minister in a Muslim-majority country served as \"a proclamation that Islam was a forward-thinking religion\".{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=i}} He added that as a pioneering female leader, Bhutto had \"barely half a dozen\" parallels, among them Indira Gandhi, Thatcher, [[Golda Meir]], [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]], and [[Corazon Aquino]].{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=21}} Comparisons with Aquino were often made \u2014 and welcomed by Bhutto \u2014 because both women had fought against a military dictatorship and spent time in exile.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhargava|1y=1990|1p=43|2a1=Lamb|2y=1991|2p=46|3a1=Ahmed|3y=2005|3p=21}}\nShe became a global icon for women's rights,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=4}} and inspired many

Along with the [[Presidency armies]], later the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], and from 1932 the [[Indian Air Force]], it was one of the Armed Forces of British India.\n\nFrom its origins in 1612 as the '''East India Company's Marine''', the Navy underwent various changes, including changes to its name. Over time it was named the '''Bombay Marine''' (1686), the '''Bombay Marine Corps''' (1829), the '''Indian Navy''' (1830), '''Her Majesty's Indian Navy''' (1858), the '''Bombay and Bengal Marine''' (1863), the '''Indian Defence Force''' (1871), '''Her Majesty's Indian Marine''' (1877) and the '''Royal Indian Marine''' (1892). It was finally named the '''Royal Indian Navy''' in 1934. However, it remained a relatively small force until the [[World War II|Second World War]], when it was greatly expanded.\n\nAfter the [[partition of India]] into two independent states in 1947, the Navy was split between Pakistan and India.  One-third of the assets and personnel were assigned to [[Royal Pakistan Navy]]. Approximately two thirds of the fleet remained with the Union of India, as did all land assets within its territory.   This force, still under the name of \"Royal Indian Navy\", became the navy of the Dominion of India until the country became a republic on 26 January 1950. It was then renamed the [[Indian Navy]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Indian Navy}}\n\n===East India Company===\n====1612\u20131830, the Bombay Marine====\n{{see|East India Company|Company rule in India}}\nThe [[East India Company]] was established in 1599, and it began to create a fleet of fighting ships in 1612, soon after Captain Thomas Best defeated the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] at the [[Battle of Swally]]. This led the Company to build a port and to establish a small navy based at [[Suvali]], in [[Surat]], [[Gujarat]], to protect its trade routes. The Company named the force the 'Honourable East India Company's Marine', and the first fighting ships arrived on 5 September 1612.<ref name=bhatia15>Harbans Singh Bhatia, ''Military History of British India, 1607-1947'' (1977), p. 15</ref>\n\nThis force protected [[merchant shipping]] off the [[Gulf of Cambay]] and the rivers [[River Tapti|Tapti]] and [[River Narmada|Narmada]].

Bentley & Son, 1877)</ref> During the 17th century, the small naval fleet consisted of a few English warships and a large number of locally built gunboats of two types, ''[[Grab (ship)|ghurabs]]'' and ''[[Gallivat (boat)|gallivats]]'', crewed by local fishermen. The larger ''ghurabs'' were heavy, shallow-draft gunboats of 300 tons ([[Builder's Old Measurement|bm]]) each, and carried six 9 to 12-pounder guns; the smaller ''gallivats'' were about 70 tons (bm) each and carried six 2 to 4-pounder guns.<ref name=ensigns36>Rear Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM, ''Under Two Ensigns: The Indian Navy 1945-1950'' (1986), p. 36</ref> In 1635, the East India Company established a shipyard at [[Surat]], where they built four pinnaces and a few larger vessels to supplement their fleet.<ref>Singh 1986, p. 40</ref>\n\nIn 1686, with most of the English commerce moving to [[Bombay]], the force was renamed the \"Bombay Marine\".<ref name=bhatia15/> This force fought the [[Maratha]]s and the Sidis and took part in the [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]]. While it recruited Indian sailors extensively, it had no Indian commissioned officers.<ref name=low/>\n\n[[Sir William James, 1st Baronet|Commodore William James]] was appointed to command the Marine in 1751. On 2 April 1755, commanding the Bombay Marine's ship ''Protector'', he attacked the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] fortress of [[Tulaji Angre]] at [[Suvarnadurg|Severndroog]] between [[Bombay]] and [[Goa]]. James had instructions only to blockade the stronghold, but he was able to get close enough to bombard and destroy it.<ref name=low/>\n\nIn February 1756, the Marine supported the capture of Gheriah ([[Vijaydurg Fort]]) by [[Robert Clive]] and Admiral Watson, and was active in skirmishes against the French, helping to consolidate the British position in India.<ref name=low/> In 1809, a fleet of 12 ships of the Marine bombarded the city of [[Ras al-Khaimah]], a pirate stronghold, in an unsuccessful attempt to quell Arab piracy. A subsequent mission in 1819 with 11 vessels proved successful in blockading the city for four days, after which the tribal chieftain surrendered. In 1829, the \"Bombay Marine\" received the additional name of \"Corps\", and also received its first steam-powered vessel in that year, the SS ''Hugh Lindsay'' of 411 tons. Steaming from Bombay on 20 March 1830, ''Hugh Lindsay'' reached Suez after 21 days under steam, at an average speed of six knots.<ref name=\"Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM 1986 p. 40-41\">Rear Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM, ''Under Two Ensigns: The Indian Navy 1945-1950'' (1986), p. 40-41</ref>\n\n====1830\u20131858====\n[[File:Indian Navy 1857.JPG|thumb|250px|Sailors of the Indian Navy breaching the Delhi gates during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].]]\nIn 1830, the Bombay Marine was renamed the \"Indian Navy\".

Along with the [[Presidency armies]], later the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], and from 1932 the [[Indian Air Force]], it was one of the Armed Forces of British India.\n\nFrom its origins in 1612 as the '''East India Company's Marine''', the Navy underwent various changes, including changes to its name. Over time it was named the '''Bombay Marine''' (1686), the '''Bombay Marine Corps''' (1829), the '''Indian Navy''' (1830), '''Her Majesty's Indian Navy''' (1858), the '''Bombay and Bengal Marine''' (1863), the '''Indian Defence Force''' (1871), '''Her Majesty's Indian Marine''' (1877) and the '''Royal Indian Marine''' (1892). It was finally named the '''Royal Indian Navy''' in 1934. However, it remained a relatively small force until the [[World War II|Second World War]], when it was greatly expanded.\n\nAfter the [[partition of India]] into two independent states in 1947, the Navy was split between Pakistan and India.  One-third of the assets and personnel were assigned to [[Royal Pakistan Navy]]. Approximately two thirds of the fleet remained with the Union of India, as did all land assets within its territory.   This force, still under the name of \"Royal Indian Navy\", became the navy of the Dominion of India until the country became a republic on 26 January 1950. It was then renamed the [[Indian Navy]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Indian Navy}}\n\n===East India Company===\n====1612\u20131830, the Bombay Marine====\n{{see|East India Company|Company rule in India}}\nThe [[East India Company]] was established in 1599, and it began to create a fleet of fighting ships in 1612, soon after Captain Thomas Best defeated the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] at the [[Battle of Swally]]. This led the Company to build a port and to establish a small navy based at [[Suvali]], in [[Surat]], [[Gujarat]], to protect its trade routes. The Company named the force the 'Honourable East India Company's Marine', and the first fighting ships arrived on 5 September 1612.<ref name=bhatia15>Harbans Singh Bhatia, ''Military History of British India, 1607-1947'' (1977), p. 15</ref>\n\nThis force protected [[merchant shipping]] off the [[Gulf of Cambay]] and the rivers [[River Tapti|Tapti]] and [[River Narmada|Narmada]].  The ships also helped map the coastlines of India, Persia and Arabia.<ref name=low>Charles Rathbone Low, ''History of the Indian Navy: (1613-1863)'' (R. Bentley & Son, 1877)</ref> During the 17th century, the small naval fleet consisted of a few English warships and a large number of locally built gunboats of two types, ''[[Grab (ship)|ghurabs]]'' and ''[[Gallivat (boat)|gallivats]]'', crewed by local fishermen. The larger ''ghurabs'' were heavy, shallow-draft gunboats of 300 tons ([[Builder's Old Measurement|bm]]) each, and carried six 9 to 12-pounder guns; the smaller ''gallivats'' were about 70 tons (bm) each and carried six 2 to 4-pounder guns.<ref name=ensigns36>Rear Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM, ''Under Two Ensigns: The Indian Navy 1945-1950'' (1986), p. 36</ref> In 1635, the East India Company established a shipyard at [[Surat]], where they built four pinnaces and a few larger vessels to supplement their fleet.<ref>Singh 1986, p. 40</ref>\n\nIn 1686, with most of the English commerce moving to [[Bombay]], the force was renamed the \"Bombay Marine\".<ref name=bhatia15/> This force fought the [[Maratha]]s and the Sidis and took part in the [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]]. While it recruited Indian sailors extensively, it had no Indian commissioned officers.<ref name=low/>\n\n[[Sir William James, 1st Baronet|Commodore William James]] was appointed to command the Marine in 1751. On 2 April 1755, commanding the Bombay Marine's ship ''Protector'', he attacked the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] fortress of [[Tulaji Angre]] at [[Suvarnadurg|Severndroog]] between [[Bombay]] and [[Goa]]. James had instructions only to blockade the stronghold, but he was able to get close enough to bombard and destroy it.<ref name=low/>\n\nIn February 1756, the Marine supported the capture of Gheriah ([[Vijaydurg Fort]]) by [[Robert Clive]] and Admiral Watson, and was active in skirmishes against the French, helping to consolidate the British position in India.<ref name=low/> In 1809, a fleet of 12 ships of the Marine bombarded the city of [[Ras al-Khaimah]], a pirate stronghold, in an unsuccessful attempt to quell Arab piracy. A subsequent mission in 1819 with 11 vessels proved successful in blockading the city for four days, after which the tribal chieftain surrendered. In 1829, the \"Bombay Marine\" received the additional name of \"Corps\", and also received its first steam-powered vessel in that year, the SS ''Hugh Lindsay'' of 411 tons. Steaming from Bombay on 20 March 1830, ''Hugh Lindsay'' reached Suez after 21 days under steam, at an average speed of six knots.<ref name=\"Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM 1986 p. 40-41\">Rear Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM, ''Under Two Ensigns: The Indian Navy 1945-1950'' (1986), p. 40-41</ref>\n\n====1830\u20131858====\n[[File:Indian Navy 1857.JPG|thumb|250px|Sailors of the Indian Navy breaching the Delhi gates during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].]]\nIn 1830, the Bombay Marine was renamed the \"Indian Navy\".

The Marine then had two divisions; an Eastern Division at [[Calcutta]] and a Western Division at Bombay.\n\nIn recognition of its fighting services, HMIM was given the title of \"Royal Indian Marine\" in 1892. By this time it consisted of over fifty vessels.<ref>[http://indiannavy.nic.in/genesis.htm Genesis] at indiannavy.nic.in {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111202914/http://indiannavy.nic.in/genesis.htm |date=January 11, 2011 }}</ref> In 1905, the service was described as having \"Government vessels engaged in troop-ship, surveying, police or revenue duties in the East Indies\".<ref>Archibald Greig Cowie, ''The sea services of the empire as fields for employment'' (1905), p. 246</ref>\n\nWhen mines were detected off the coasts of Bombay and Aden, during the [[World War I|First World War]], the Royal Indian Marine went into action with a fleet of [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], patrol vessels and troop carriers. Besides patrolling, the Marine ferried troops and carried war stores from India to [[Mesopotamia]] (now [[Iraq]]), [[Egypt]] and [[East Africa]].\n\nThe first Indian to be granted a commission was Engineer Sub-Lieutenant D.

During the War, the Women's Royal Indian Naval Service was established, for the first time giving women a role in the navy, although they did not serve on board its ships.<ref name=bhatia28/>\n\nThe [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] {{ship|HMIS|Sutlej|U95|6}} and {{HMIS|Jumna|U21|6}} played a role in [[Operation Husky]], the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]].<ref>[http://www.wewerethere.mod.uk/wewerethere_old/inmed.html Inmed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124112038/http://www.wewerethere.mod.uk/wewerethere_old/inmed.html |date=24 January 2008 }}</ref>\n\n====Mutiny of 1946====\n{{Main|Royal Indian Navy Mutiny}}\nIn February 1946, Indian sailors launched the [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny]] on board more than fifty ships and in shore establishments, protesting about alleged discrimination against Indian sailors and officers by the British during the war.<ref>Christopher M. Bell, Bruce A. Elleman, ''Naval mutinies of the twentieth century: an international perspective'' (2003), p. 6: \"The first navy to experience a major mutiny after the Second World War was the Royal Indian Navy. For five days in February 1946, Indian sailors rose up against their predominantly British officer corps: approximately 56 ships...\"</ref> The mutiny found widespread support and spread all over India, including elements in the Army and the Air Force. A total of seventy-eight ships, twenty shore establishments and 20,000 sailors were involved in this mutiny.\n\n===Independence and Partition of India, 1947===\n\n{{Main|Partition of India}}\n\nOn 1 March 1947, the designation of \"Flag Officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy\" was replaced with that of \"Commander-in-Chief, Royal Indian Navy.\"<ref name=\"RIN_designation\"/> Following India's independence in 1947 and the ensuing partition, the Royal Indian Navy was divided between the newly independent [[Dominion of India]] and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], and the Armed Forces Reconstitution Committee divided the ships and men of the Royal Indian Navy between India and Pakistan. The division of the ships was on the basis of two-thirds of the fleet to India, one third to Pakistan.<ref>Bhatia (1977), p. 28: \"Consequent on the partition of the country on 15 August 1947, two thirds of the undivided fleet and associated assets came to India.\"</ref>\n\nThe committee allocated to the [[Royal Pakistan Navy]] (RPN) three of the seven active [[sloop]]s, {{ship|HMIS|Godavari|U52|6}}, {{ship|HMIS|Hindustan|L80|6}} and {{ship|HMIS|Narbada|U40|6}}, four of the ten serviceable [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], two [[frigate]]s, two [[naval trawler]]s, four harbour launches and a number of [[Harbour Defence Motor Launch]]es. 358 personnel, and 180 officers, most of whom were Muslims or Europeans, volunteered to transfer to the RPN. India retained the remainder of the RIN's assets and personnel, and many British officers opted to continue serving in the RIN.<ref name=bhatia28/> On 1 March 1948, the additional designation of \"Chief of the Naval Staff\" was added before that of \"Commander-in-Chief, Royal Indian Navy.\"<ref name=\"communique\">{{cite web|title=Press Communique|url=http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/DEFENCE/1948-JAN-JUNE-DEFENCE/PDF/DEF-1948-02-28_119.pdf|website=Press Information Bureau of India - Archive|date=28 February 1948|accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> \n\nOn 26 January 1950, when India adopted its current [[constitution of India|constitution]] and became a [[republic]], the Royal Indian Navy was renamed the [[Indian Navy]].
