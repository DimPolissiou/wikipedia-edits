He often [[Auto-Tune]]s his vocals. Others who has he impersonated multiple times include [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. His music tends to make use of his several satirical alter egos similar to Detroit rapper [[Eminem]].\n\nHe has multiple alter egos, such as DJ Not Nice (Asian), Seymour Schwartz (Jewish) and Toby Queef (white American [[redneck]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Some critics have labeled Ali as a racist as a reaction to his songs, although his humour seems heavily influenced by mainstream comedy television shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.<ref name=current/> His videos and YouTube channels are frequently removed (since he started creating music videos he has had 17<ref>http://ruckasworld.com/</ref> YouTube channels deleted for terms of service violations), but are [[Streisand effect|reuploaded by his fans]], who call themselves \"Rucka's Nuckas\".\n\nOne of his most infamous parodies was \"[[Ima Korean]]\", which was a parody of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' \"[[I Gotta Feeling]]\" which makes fun of [[Kim Jong-il]] and North Koreans. He later released a sequel called \"My Korea's Over I Think\" which is a parody of \"[[International Love]]\", taking place after Kim Jong-il's death in 2011, when his son [[Kim Jong-un]] took over as the leader of [[North Korea]].

He often [[Auto-Tune]]s his vocals. Others who has he impersonated multiple times include [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. His music tends to make use of his several satirical alter egos similar to Detroit rapper [[Eminem]].\n\nHe has multiple alter egos, such as DJ Not Nice (Asian), Seymour Schwartz (Jewish) and Toby Queef (white American [[redneck]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Some critics have labeled Ali as a racist as a reaction to his songs, although his humour seems heavily influenced by mainstream comedy television shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.<ref name=current/> His videos and YouTube channels are frequently removed (since he started creating music videos he has had 17<ref>http://ruckasworld.com/</ref> YouTube channels deleted for terms of service violations), but are [[Streisand effect|reuploaded by his fans]], who call themselves \"Rucka's Nuckas\".\n\nOne of his most infamous parodies was \"[[Ima Korean]]\", which was a parody of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' \"[[I Gotta Feeling]]\" which makes fun of [[Kim Jong-il]] and North Koreans. He later released a sequel called \"My Korea's Over I Think\" which is a parody of \"[[International Love]]\", taking place after Kim Jong-il's death in 2011, when his son [[Kim Jong-un]] took over as the leader of [[North Korea]].

To the north and west was [[Gadap Town]], and to the south lie the towns of [[Gulberg Town, Karachi|Gulberg Town]] and [[North Nazimabad Town]]. The population of New Karachi Town was estimated to be more than 680,000 at the 1998 census. [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]] constitute an overwhelming majority of the population.\n\n==History==\nThe federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]] in 2001, and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including New Karachi Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced. In 2015, New Karachi Town was re-organized as part of [[District of Central Karachi|Karachi Central]] district.\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\nFatima Jinnah Colony is named after [[Fatima Jinnah]], the sister of the founder of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. The neighbourhood of Hakim Ahsan is named after the mayor of Karachi who met [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] at Karachi airport in 1947. Shah Nawaz Bhutto Colony is named after the father of the former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and grandfather of the later Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]]. [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]] was the last Prime Minister of the [[princely state]] of [[Junagadh]] and was instrumental in the accession of the state to Pakistan in 1947.

To the north and west was [[Gadap Town]], and to the south lie the towns of [[Gulberg Town, Karachi|Gulberg Town]] and [[North Nazimabad Town]]. The population of New Karachi Town was estimated to be more than 680,000 at the 1998 census. [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]] constitute an overwhelming majority of the population.\n\n==History==\nThe federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]] in 2001, and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including New Karachi Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced. In 2015, New Karachi Town was re-organized as part of [[District of Central Karachi|Karachi Central]] district.\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\nFatima Jinnah Colony is named after [[Fatima Jinnah]], the sister of the founder of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. The neighbourhood of Hakim Ahsan is named after the mayor of Karachi who met [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] at Karachi airport in 1947. Shah Nawaz Bhutto Colony is named after the father of the former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and grandfather of the later Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]]. [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]] was the last Prime Minister of the [[princely state]] of [[Junagadh]] and was instrumental in the accession of the state to Pakistan in 1947.
