Their current home The Creek used to be the site of the Port of Bristol Authority Sports & Social Club but when they moved to new premises 1965, Manor Farm took it over. The pitch at the Creek was once notorious for its sloping surface but work has been undertaken in recent years to eliminate the slope. With seating and floodlights added since 1980, the club now boasts excellent facilities alongside a spacious clubhouse.\n \nHaving a permanent base enabled the club to apply successfully to join the Somerset Senior League where they were to progress rapidly through the divisions before deciding to advance further to the Western League in 1977.\n \nThe club joined the First Division for the 1977/78 season and remained there until the 1982/83 season when they won the First Division championship and gained promotion to the Premier Division. They remained there until relegation under Pete McCall's management team in 2001/02 but regained their Premier status just two seasons later in 2003/04 under Shaun Bond and Nicky Johns. In 1983/84 they reached the final of the G.F.A. Challenge Trophy where they lost to then Hellenic League side [[Shortwood United]]. The trophy did make its way to the Creek in 1987/88 and has been won on a further three occasions by the club.\n \n \nMain stand at The Creek.\nThe 2011/12 season saw the club win its first double when they took both the GFA Challenge Trophy and the Toolstation League Les Phillips League Cup back to Sea Mills.\n \nLee Lashenko become the new manager at the start of the 2013/14 season and quickly made an impact in the [[FA Cup]], overcoming [[Oldland Abbotonians F.C.|Oldland Abootonians]], [[Lymington Town F.C.|Lymington Town]] and [[Corsham Town]] to reach the Second Qualifying Round, equaling their best ever performance in the competition. Unfortunately, they were unable to go one better and lost to [[Bridgwater Town]] 1-2 in a replay at Fairfax Park. The club continued to fight for top spot in the league and applied for promotion. The club finished second but were unsuccessful in their promotion bid when [[Larkhall Athletic F.C.|Larkhall Athletic]] were accepted into the Southern League. The second-placed finish was the best in the club's history. It also saw the team break the club records for the most goals scored in a season and the fewest goals conceded.\n \nThe 2015/16 season left the club with mixed feelings as on one hand they managed to get to the Quarter-Final of the [[FA Vase]] narrowly going out away to eventual winners [[Morpeth Town]]. On the other hand, whilst they finished 3rd in the Western League, again they just missed out on promotion to the Southern League by one place. They did, however, win the GFA County Challenge Trophy for the second time in succession and the fourth time overall with a record 9-2 win over [[Lydney Town F.C.|Lydney Town]].\n \nIn the 2016/17 season, Bristol Manor Farm were finally successful in gaining promotion to the Southern League, winning the Western League by quite a distance. They also had another successful run in the FA Vase where they went out in the Fifth Round Proper to Semi-Finalists [[Bromsgrove Sporting F.C.|Bromsgrove Sporting]].\n \nThe Farm finished their first season in the eighth tier with a very respectable 9th-place finish, falling away towards the end after troubling the top six places all season.\n\n== Staff ==\n \n*'''First team manager''': Lee Lashenko\n*'''Assistant manager''': Iain Harvey\n*'''Physio''': Stephen Carter\n*'''Coach(s)''': Chris Bailes, Terry Buffrey, [[Mike Mahoney (footballer)|Mike Mahoney]]\n\n== Club rivals ==\nBristol Manor Farm's main rivals are considered to be [[Yate Town F.C.|Yate Town]] and [[Mangotsfield United F.C.|Mangotsfield United]], both from the northern outskirts of Bristol.

(2004). The decade of health information technology. HHS Report, July, 21.</ref>  [[Technology]] is a broad concept that deals with a species' usage and knowledge of tools and crafts, and how it affects a species' ability to control and adapt to its environment.  However, a strict definition is elusive; \"technology\" can refer to material objects of use to humanity, such as machines, hardware or utensils, but can also encompass broader themes, including systems, methods of organization, and techniques.  For HIT, technology represents computers and communications attributes that can be networked to build systems for moving health information.  Informatics is yet another integral aspect of [[MEDHOST|HIT]].\n\n[[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] refers to the science of [[information]], the practice of [[information processing]], and the engineering of [[information systems]].  Informatics underlies the academic investigation and practitioner application of computing and communications technology to healthcare, health education, and biomedical research.  [[Health informatics]] refers to the intersection of information science, computer science, and health care.  Health informatics describes the use and sharing of information within the healthcare industry with contributions from computer science, mathematics, and psychology.  It deals with the resources, devices, and methods required for optimizing the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in health and biomedicine.  [[Health informatics tools]] include not only computers but also clinical guidelines, formal medical terminologies, and information and communication systems.  [[Medical informatics]], [[nursing informatics]], [[public health informatics]], [[pharmacy informatics]], and [[translational bioinformatics]] are subdisciplines that inform health informatics from different disciplinary perspectives.<ref>{{cite web|title=When Healthcare and Computer Science Collide|url=http://healthinformatics.uic.edu/infographics/when-healthcare-and-computer-science-collide/|website=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref> The processes and people of concern or study are the main variables.\n\n==Implementation==\nThe Institute of Medicine's (2001) call for the use of electronic prescribing systems in all healthcare organizations by 2010 heightened the urgency to accelerate United States hospitals' adoption of CPOE systems.  In 2004, President Bush signed an  Executive Order titled the President's Health Information Technology Plan, which established a ten-year plan to develop and implement electronic medical record systems across the US to improve the efficiency and safety of care.  According to a study by [[RAND Health]], the US healthcare system could save more than $81 billion annually, reduce adverse healthcare events and improve the quality of care if it were to widely adopt [[Health informatics|health information technology]].<ref>RAND Healthcare: [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9136/index1.html Health Information Technology: Can HIT Lower Costs and Improve Quality?] Retrieved on July 8, 2006</ref>\n\nThe [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]], signed into law in 2009 under the Obama Administration, has provided approximately $19 billion in incentives for hospitals to shift from paper to electronic medical records.  Meaningful Use, as a part of the 2009 [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] (HITECH) was the incentive that included over $20 billion for the implementation of HIT alone, and provided further indication of the growing consensus regarding the potential salutary effect of HIT. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has set aside $2 billion which will go towards programs developed by the National Coordinator and Secretary to help healthcare providers implement HIT and provide technical assistance through various regional centers.  The other $17 billion in incentives comes from [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] funding for those who adopt HIT before 2015.  Healthcare providers who implement electronic records can receive up to $44,000 over four years in Medicare funding and $63,750 over six years in Medicaid funding.  The sooner that healthcare providers adopt the system, the more funding they receive.  Those who do not adopt electronic health record systems before 2015 do not receive any federal funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|url=https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/index.html?redirect=/EHRIncentivePrograms/}}</ref>\n\nWhile electronic health records have potentially many advantages in terms of providing efficient and safe care, recent reports have brought to light some challenges with implementing electronic health records.  The most immediate barriers for widespread adoption of this technology have been the high initial cost of implementing the new technology and the time required for doctors to train and adapt to the new system.  There have also been suspected cases of [[Medicare fraud|fraudulent billing]], where hospitals inflate their billings to Medicare.  Given that healthcare providers have not reached the deadline (2015) for adopting electronic health records, it is unclear what effects this policy will have long term.<ref>{{cite news|last=Freudenheim|first=Milt|title=The Ups and Downs of Electronic Medical Records|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/health/the-ups-and-downs-of-electronic-medical-records-the-digital-doctor.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=2012-10-08}}</ref>\n\nOne approach to reducing the costs and promoting wider use is to develop open standards related to EHRs.

An important change to the revenue cycle is the international classification of diseases (ICD) codes from 9 to 10. ICD-9 codes are set up to use three to five alphanumeric codes that represent 4,000 different types of procedures, while ICD-10 uses three to seven alphanumeric codes increasing procedural codes to 70,000. ICD-9 was outdated because there were more codes than procedures available, and to document for procedures without an ICD-9 code, unspecified codes were utilized which did not fully capture the procedures or the work involved in turn affecting reimbursement. Hence, ICD-10 was introduced to simplify the procedures with unknown codes and unify the standards closer to world standards (ICD-11). One of the main parts of Revenue Cycle HIT is charge capture, it utilizes codes to capture costs for reimbursements from different payers, such as CMS.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Future of Revenue Cycle: Preparing for Near-Term Change|url=http://himss.files.cms-plus.com/HIMSSorg/content/files/FutureofRevenueCycleWhitePaper-EDITED5-24NV.pdf|website=HIMSS Revenue Cycle Improvement Task Force|accessdate=18 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214000714/http://himss.files.cms-plus.com/HIMSSorg/content/files/FutureofRevenueCycleWhitePaper-EDITED5-24NV.pdf|archivedate=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==International comparisons through HIT==\nInternational health system performance comparisons are important for understanding health system complexities and finding better opportunities, which can be done through health information technology.

(2004). The decade of health information technology. HHS Report, July, 21.</ref>  [[Technology]] is a broad concept that deals with a species' usage and knowledge of tools and crafts, and how it affects a species' ability to control and adapt to its environment.  However, a strict definition is elusive; \"technology\" can refer to material objects of use to humanity, such as machines, hardware or utensils, but can also encompass broader themes, including systems, methods of organization, and techniques.  For HIT, technology represents computers and communications attributes that can be networked to build systems for moving health information.  Informatics is yet another integral aspect of [[MEDHOST|HIT]].\n\n[[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] refers to the science of [[information]], the practice of [[information processing]], and the engineering of [[information systems]].  Informatics underlies the academic investigation and practitioner application of computing and communications technology to healthcare, health education, and biomedical research.  [[Health informatics]] refers to the intersection of information science, computer science, and health care.  Health informatics describes the use and sharing of information within the healthcare industry with contributions from computer science, mathematics, and psychology.  It deals with the resources, devices, and methods required for optimizing the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in health and biomedicine.  [[Health informatics tools]] include not only computers but also clinical guidelines, formal medical terminologies, and information and communication systems.  [[Medical informatics]], [[nursing informatics]], [[public health informatics]], [[pharmacy informatics]], and [[translational bioinformatics]] are subdisciplines that inform health informatics from different disciplinary perspectives.<ref>{{cite web|title=When Healthcare and Computer Science Collide|url=http://healthinformatics.uic.edu/infographics/when-healthcare-and-computer-science-collide/|website=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref> The processes and people of concern or study are the main variables.\n\n==Implementation==\nThe Institute of Medicine's (2001) call for the use of electronic prescribing systems in all healthcare organizations by 2010 heightened the urgency to accelerate United States hospitals' adoption of CPOE systems.  In 2004, President Bush signed an  Executive Order titled the President's Health Information Technology Plan, which established a ten-year plan to develop and implement electronic medical record systems across the US to improve the efficiency and safety of care.  According to a study by [[RAND Health]], the US healthcare system could save more than $81 billion annually, reduce adverse healthcare events and improve the quality of care if it were to widely adopt [[Health informatics|health information technology]].<ref>RAND Healthcare: [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9136/index1.html Health Information Technology: Can HIT Lower Costs and Improve Quality?] Retrieved on July 8, 2006</ref>\n\nThe [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]], signed into law in 2009 under the Obama Administration, has provided approximately $19 billion in incentives for hospitals to shift from paper to electronic medical records.  Meaningful Use, as a part of the 2009 [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] (HITECH) was the incentive that included over $20 billion for the implementation of HIT alone, and provided further indication of the growing consensus regarding the potential salutary effect of HIT. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has set aside $2 billion which will go towards programs developed by the National Coordinator and Secretary to help healthcare providers implement HIT and provide technical assistance through various regional centers.  The other $17 billion in incentives comes from [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] funding for those who adopt HIT before 2015.  Healthcare providers who implement electronic records can receive up to $44,000 over four years in Medicare funding and $63,750 over six years in Medicaid funding.  The sooner that healthcare providers adopt the system, the more funding they receive.  Those who do not adopt electronic health record systems before 2015 do not receive any federal funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|url=https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/index.html?redirect=/EHRIncentivePrograms/}}</ref>\n\nWhile electronic health records have potentially many advantages in terms of providing efficient and safe care, recent reports have brought to light some challenges with implementing electronic health records.  The most immediate barriers for widespread adoption of this technology have been the high initial cost of implementing the new technology and the time required for doctors to train and adapt to the new system.  There have also been suspected cases of [[Medicare fraud|fraudulent billing]], where hospitals inflate their billings to Medicare.  Given that healthcare providers have not reached the deadline (2015) for adopting electronic health records, it is unclear what effects this policy will have long term.<ref>{{cite news|last=Freudenheim|first=Milt|title=The Ups and Downs of Electronic Medical Records|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/health/the-ups-and-downs-of-electronic-medical-records-the-digital-doctor.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=2012-10-08}}</ref>\n\nOne approach to reducing the costs and promoting wider use is to develop open standards related to EHRs.

An important change to the revenue cycle is the international classification of diseases (ICD) codes from 9 to 10. ICD-9 codes are set up to use three to five alphanumeric codes that represent 4,000 different types of procedures, while ICD-10 uses three to seven alphanumeric codes increasing procedural codes to 70,000. ICD-9 was outdated because there were more codes than procedures available, and to document for procedures without an ICD-9 code, unspecified codes were utilized which did not fully capture the procedures or the work involved in turn affecting reimbursement. Hence, ICD-10 was introduced to simplify the procedures with unknown codes and unify the standards closer to world standards (ICD-11). One of the main parts of Revenue Cycle HIT is charge capture, it utilizes codes to capture costs for reimbursements from different payers, such as CMS.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Future of Revenue Cycle: Preparing for Near-Term Change|url=http://himss.files.cms-plus.com/HIMSSorg/content/files/FutureofRevenueCycleWhitePaper-EDITED5-24NV.pdf|website=HIMSS Revenue Cycle Improvement Task Force|accessdate=18 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214000714/http://himss.files.cms-plus.com/HIMSSorg/content/files/FutureofRevenueCycleWhitePaper-EDITED5-24NV.pdf|archivedate=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==International comparisons through HIT==\nInternational health system performance comparisons are important for understanding health system complexities and finding better opportunities, which can be done through health information technology.

Before meeting with Joseph Smith, Caswall was already aware of the psalter's contents and intended to use the request as a means of exposing Joseph as a fraud.\n\n== History ==\nHenry Caswall wrote a book titled ''Three Days in Nauvoo'' (also called ''The City of the Mormons'') in which he gives an account of presenting Joseph Smith with an old Greek psalter to translate. Caswall was aware of Smith's claims about the translation of [[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]] from [[Reformed Egyptian]] and the [[Book of Abraham]] from Egyptian Papyri and wanted to test the truthfulness of these works. The Greek psalter's contents were well established prior to the meeting and contained a common [[Greek language|Greek]] translation of the [[Psalms]]. After looking the manuscript over, Joseph Smith identified the manuscript as being a Dictionary of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian Hieroglyphics]] and pointed to the capitalized letters saying that they were hieroglyphics followed by their meanings in Reformed Egyptian. Caswall went on to claim that this was evidence of Smith's position as a fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/BOMP/id/3750|title=Open Facsimile 1|website=contentdm.lib.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1840s/1842Cas1.htm|title=Smith History Vault: 1842 Henry Caswall booklet|website=www.olivercowdery.com|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mormonthink.com/greekweb.htm|title=Joseph Smith's Greek Psalter Translation|website=www.mormonthink.com|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Craig|date=1995|title=Henry Caswall: Anti-Mormon Extraordinaire|url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/byusq/vol35/iss4/8/|journal=BYU Studies Quarterly|volume=35|pages=|via=BYU Scholar Archives}}</ref> A local newspaper, ''The Warsaw Message'', also mentioned the event and stated that multiple supporters of Smith were also present during the event. Smith was originally reluctant to look over the manuscript but after he claimed its connection to Egyptian hieroglyphics the room was in \"great astonish\".

Before meeting with Joseph Smith, Caswall was already aware of the psalter's contents and intended to use the request as a means of exposing Joseph as a fraud.\n\n== History ==\nHenry Caswall wrote a book titled ''Three Days in Nauvoo'' (also called ''The City of the Mormons'') in which he gives an account of presenting Joseph Smith with an old Greek psalter to translate. Caswall was aware of Smith's claims about the translation of [[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]] from [[Reformed Egyptian]] and the [[Book of Abraham]] from Egyptian Papyri and wanted to test the truthfulness of these works. The Greek psalter's contents were well established prior to the meeting and contained a common [[Greek language|Greek]] translation of the [[Psalms]]. After looking the manuscript over, Joseph Smith identified the manuscript as being a Dictionary of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian Hieroglyphics]] and pointed to the capitalized letters saying that they were Hieroglyphics followed by their meanings in Reformed Egyptian. Caswall went on to claim that this was evidence of Smith's position as a fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/BOMP/id/3750|title=Open Facsimile 1|website=contentdm.lib.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1840s/1842Cas1.htm|title=Smith History Vault: 1842 Henry Caswall booklet|website=www.olivercowdery.com|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mormonthink.com/greekweb.htm|title=Joseph Smith's Greek Psalter Translation|website=www.mormonthink.com|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Craig|date=1995|title=Henry Caswall: Anti-Mormon Extraordinaire|url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/byusq/vol35/iss4/8/|journal=BYU Studies Quarterly|volume=35|pages=|via=BYU Scholar Archives}}</ref> A local newspaper, The Warsaw Message, also mentioned the event and stated that multiple supporters of Smith were also present during the event.
