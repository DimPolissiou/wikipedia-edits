A major figure in the development of post-Independence New York City and State, Varick became the [[List of mayors of New York City|45th Mayor of New York City]] in 1789 and served eleven concurrent one-year terms until 1801.<ref name=\"dlib\">{{cite web|title=Guide to the Papers of Richard Varick 1743-1871 (Bulk 1775-1830)  MS 655|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/varick/|website=dlib.nyu.edu|publisher=[[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nPrevious to his terms as mayor, Varick served as the [[Recorder of New York City|14th Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life & family==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> Both Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

The resulting 44 letterbooks contain copies of all documents dating from May, 1775 to June, 1785.

Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Recorder & Attorney General of New York (1784 - 1789)===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City (1789 - 1801)===\n[[File:Richard varick 1805 john trumbull.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick (c.1805) by [[John Trumbull]] which still hangs today in [[New York City Hall]]]]\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nVarick would peak politically as the Mayor of New York City for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801. <ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he would continue his establishment of the technocratic structure that would ensure New York City\u2019s place as the commercial capital of the United States, despite the political capital moving to Philadelphia, then Washington D.C. At this time in history, there was no precedent of commercial and political leadership between split between two cities. \n\nIn 1791, the major financial crisis would hit the United States in New York due to a scheme to manipulate the financial markets, which had no formal structure of any kind. Varick would have to increase officers to protect the guilty parties from mobs gathering outside the prison. This would lead to a group of merchants making the \"Buttonwood Agreement\u201d in 1792 which was the seed of the New York Stock Exchange. \n\nIn the summer of 1793 a yellow fever epidemic sent New Yorkers \"fleeing north\" to nearby healthful Greenwich Village. This epidemic would lead to the creation of what would become the New York City Department of Health. Which was timely as there were further epidemics in 1795, 1796, 1798, 1799, and 1800. \n\nIn 1794, public anger at Federalist political ideals spilled into the streets with Varick\u2019s support of the [[Jay Treaty]]. An angry mob would almost physically run him out of the city. \n\nVarick ran int moe trouble when he tried to pressure the city\u2019s 1,000 or so licensed workers \u2014 tavern keepers, grocers, butchers and cartmen, all of whom had licenses to work for the city \u2014 to vote for Federalist candidates. \u201cThis went completely contrary to the egalitarian sentiment of the time,\u201d Dr. Hodges said. \nVarick\u2019s heavy-handed ways, Dr. Hodges said, pushed many of the workers away from the Federalists, represented by Alexander Hamilton, and into the opposing Democratic-Republican faction, represented by Thomas Jefferson. In 1797, after losing his seat representing New York State in the U.S. Senate, Aaron Burr took control of Tammany Hall and used it to assail Varick for his use of marketing and tax-licensing fees. Burr would win the state's electoral vote in the 1800 presidential election leading to a wide sweeping rout of [[Federalist]] politicians across New York, including Varick in 1801.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Sewell|title=Third Term No Charm, Historians Say|date=2008|publisher=[[New York Times]]|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/third-term-no-charm-historians-say/|accessdate=16 April 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Prospect hall richard varick residence jersey city 1812.png|thumb|left|Prospect Hall in 1812]]\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life & family==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> Both Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Recorder & Attorney General of New York (1784 - 1789)===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789.

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City (1789 - 1801)===\n[[File:Richard varick 1805 john trumbull.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick (c.1805) by [[John Trumbull]] which still hangs today in [[New York City Hall]]]]\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nVarick would peak politically as the Mayor of New York City for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801. <ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he would continue his establishment of the technocratic structure that would ensure New York City\u2019s place as the commercial capital of the United States, despite the political capital moving to Philadelphia, then Washington D.C. At this time in history, there was no precedent of commercial and political leadership between split between two cities. \n\nIn 1791, the major financial crisis would hit the United States in New York due to a scheme to manipulate the financial markets, which had no formal structure of any kind. Varick would have to increase officers to protect the guilty parties from mobs gathering outside the prison. This would lead to a group of merchants making the \"Buttonwood Agreement\u201d in 1792 which was the seed of the New York Stock Exchange. \n\nIn the summer of 1793 a yellow fever epidemic sent New Yorkers \"fleeing north\" to nearby healthful Greenwich Village. This epidemic would lead to the creation of what would become the New York City Department of Health. Which was timely as there were further epidemics in 1795, 1796, 1798, 1799, and 1800. \n\nIn 1794, public anger at Federalist political ideals spilled into the streets with Varick\u2019s support of the [[Jay Treaty]]. An angry mob would almost physically run him out of the city. \n\nVarick ran int moe trouble when he tried to pressure the city\u2019s 1,000 or so licensed workers \u2014 tavern keepers, grocers, butchers and cartmen, all of whom had licenses to work for the city \u2014 to vote for Federalist candidates. \u201cThis went completely contrary to the egalitarian sentiment of the time,\u201d Dr. Hodges said. \nVarick\u2019s heavy-handed ways, Dr. Hodges said, pushed many of the workers away from the Federalists, represented by Alexander Hamilton, and into the opposing Democratic-Republican faction, represented by Thomas Jefferson. In 1797, after losing his seat representing New York State in the U.S. Senate, Aaron Burr took control of Tammany Hall and used it to assail Varick for his use of marketing and tax-licensing fees. Burr would win the state's electoral vote in the 1800 presidential election leading to a wide sweeping rout of [[Federalist]] politicians across New York, including Varick in 1801.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Sewell|title=Third Term No Charm, Historians Say|date=2008|publisher=[[New York Times]]|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/third-term-no-charm-historians-say/|accessdate=16 April 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development.

Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818.

The battle was fought between elements of the British [[Channel Fleet]] and the French Atlantic Fleet, which were cruising in the region on separate missions. The British fleet, commanded by Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]], was covering an [[Invasion of France (1795)|invasion convoy]] carrying a [[\u00c9migr\u00e9 armies of the French Revolutionary Wars|French Royalist]] army to invade [[Quiberon]], while the French under Vice-amiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] had sailed a week earlier to rescue a French convoy from attack by a British squadron. The French fleet had driven off the British squadron in a battle on 17 June known as [[Cornwallis's Retreat]], and were attempting to return to their base at [[Brest, France|Brest]] when Bridport's force of 14 [[ships of the line]] appeared on 22 June.\n\nVillaret, believing that the stronger British fleet would destroy his own 12 ships of the line, ordered his force to fall back to the inshore anchorage off Groix, hoping to take shelter in protected coastal waters. Several of his ships were too slow, falling behind so that early in the morning of 23 June the rearmost ships of his fleet were caught by the British vanguard, overhauled one by one and brought to battle. Although Villaret fought a determined rearguard action, three French ships were captured, all with very heavy casualties, and the remainder of the French fleet was left scattered across miles of coastline. In this position they were highly vulnerable to continued British attack, but after only a few hours' engagement, concerned that his ships might be wrecked on the rocky coastline, Bridport called off the action and allowed Villaret to regroup inshore and retreat to [[Lorient]].\n\nAlthough the battle was a British victory, there was criticism of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that a unique opportunity to destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The [[Invasion of France (1795)|invasion at Quiberon]] ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline for the remainder of the year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] had seen the French Atlantic Fleet, based principally at the [[Brittany|Breton]] harbour of [[Brest, France|Brest]], suffer a series of setbacks. The tense atmosphere in France following the [[French Revolution]] was reflected in the fleet, which suffered a mutiny in September 1793 followed by [[Reign of Terror|a purge]] of suspected anti-republicans which resulted in the death or imprisonment of a number of experienced commanders.<ref name=\"WJ59\">James, p. 59</ref><ref name=\"SW34\">Willis, p. 34</ref> In [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794|May 1794]], the French fleet sallied into the Atlantic to protect an incoming grain convoy from the [[United States]] and was attacked by the British [[Channel Fleet]] at the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], losing seven ships, although the convoy was saved. In the winter of 1794\u20131795, five more French ships were lost in a disastrous sortie in the middle of the Atlantic winter storm season known as the ''[[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]]''. By the spring of 1795, the British Channel Fleet was in the ascendancy, enforcing a distant [[blockade]] of the French fleet in Brest.<ref name=\"RG16\">Gardiner, ''Fleet Battle and Blockade'' p. 16</ref>\n\nIn May 1795, with much of the winter's damage repaired, the French commander [[Vice-amiral]] [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] sent a squadron of three [[ships of the line]] and several [[frigates]] under [[Contre-amiral]] [[Jean Gaspard Vence]] to [[Bordeaux]] with orders to escort a convoy of merchant ships carrying wine and brandy to Brest.<ref name=\"WLC255\">Clowes, p. 255</ref> On 8 June, as Vence's convoy passed the fortified island of [[Belle \u00cele]] on the southern Breton coast they were discovered by a British battle squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates under Vice-Admiral [[William Cornwallis]].<ref name=\"WLC256\">Clowes, p. 256</ref> Vence ordered his outnumbered ships to shelter under the batteries of Belle \u00cele, and after a brief skirmish Cornwallis withdrew his forces with eight captured merchant ships. While Cornwallis was escorting his prizes to the mouth of the Channel, Vence sailed out of the Belle \u00cele anchorage and discovered on 15 June that the main force of the Atlantic fleet had sailed to rescue him, a mission ordered by government over the objections of the fleet's officers that Vence would be able to easily extricate himself from the anchorage due to the proximity of the port of [[Lorient]].<ref name=\"WJ237-238\">James, pp. 237\u2013238</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 16 June Cornwallis returned to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on the morning of 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard.<ref name=\"WJ240\">James, p. 240</ref> Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship [[HMS Mars (1794)|HMS ''Mars'']], until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect ''Mars'', Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|HMS ''Royal Sovereign'']] between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the French back.<ref name=\"WLC257\">Clowes, p. 257</ref> At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as [[Cornwallis's Retreat]].<ref name=\"WJ241\">James, p. 241</ref>\n\nUnbeknownst to either Villaret or Cornwallis, the British Channel Fleet was also at sea, having sailed from [[Spithead]] on 12 June with 14 ships of the line and 11 smaller vessels under the command of Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport]]. Bridport had been tasked with ensuring the safety of a convoy of transports, commanded by Commodore [[Sir John Borlase Warren]], which carried a [[\u00c9migr\u00e9 armies of the French Revolutionary Wars|French Royalist]] army to [[Quiberon]] with the intention of triggering a counter-revolution in Brittany.<ref name=\"RG48\">Gardiner, ''Fleet Battle and Blockade'' p. 48</ref> This force consisted of an additional three ships of the line, six frigates and more than 50 transports containing 2,500 French Royalists. The voyage across the English Channel and around the [[Ushant]] headland took seven days, the combined fleet and expeditionary force arriving off Belle \u00cele on 19 June.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> Bridport had ordered Warren to take his convoy on to Quiberon while the main body of the Channel Fleet stood further out to sea to intercept any attack by the French Atlantic Fleet, which Bridport assumed would advance southwards from Brest. What the British admiral did not know was that not only had the French fleet sailed a week earlier, they were still at sea \u2013 Villaret's ships having been blown southwards by a severe gale on 18 June and forced to take shelter in the anchorage off Belle \u00cele.<ref name=\"WJ243\">James, p. 243</ref>\n\n==Engagement off Groix==\n{{See also|Order of Battle in the Biscay campaign of June 1795}}\n\n===Villaret's retreat===\n[[File:Battle of Groix locator.png|Villaret retreated to near the island of Groix, indicated by the red dot, off the coast of France southeast of Brest.|thumb|alt=The island of Groix is near the French coast southeast of Brest.]]\nIt was one of Warren's ships, the frigate [[HMS Arethusa (1793)|HMS ''Arethusa'']], which first discovered the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on ''Arethusa'' miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships of the line and ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to turn away from the French.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have gauged its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having taken aboard only enough for 15 days in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier.<ref name=\"WJ238\">James, p. 238</ref> On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet in the face of the supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast against the wind, seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.<ref name=\"WJ245\">James, p. 245</ref>\n\nThe adverse southeasterly winds frustrated both fleets, and it was not until 03:30 on 22 June that lookouts on Bridport's scouting frigates [[HMS Nymphe (1780)|HMS ''Nymphe'']] and [[HMS Astrea (1781)|HMS ''Astrea'']] finally discovered the French in the distance to the southeast,<ref name=\"LG1\"/> the British approximately {{convert|42|nmi|km}} from the French coast.<ref name=\"WLC261\">Clowes, p. 261</ref> On seeing the larger British fleet, to which Warren's detached ships had still not joined, Villaret ordered his fleet to turn back towards the land and Bridport followed, seeing that the French admiral did not intend to offer battle.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/> To maximise his chances of catching the French, Bridport specifically ordered his \"best-sailing\" ships [[HMS Sans Pareil (1794)|HMS ''Sans Pareil'']], [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Colossus (1787)|HMS ''Colossus'']], [[HMS Irresistible (1782)|HMS ''Irresistible'']], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS ''Valiant'']] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], to break from the formation and lead the pursuit at 06:30.<ref name=\"WLC261\"/><ref name=\"EPB231\">Brenton, p. 231</ref> Bridport followed in his 100-gun [[first rate]] flagship [[HMS Royal George (1788)|HMS ''Royal George'']], accompanied by the remainder of the fleet, which included another 100-gun ship [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] and seven 98-gun [[second rate]] ships.<ref name=\"WLC260\">Clowes, p. 260</ref>\n\nAll day the chase continued: at 12:00 the French fleet were approximately {{convert|12|nmi|km}} distant, and all through the afternoon the British ships slowly gained on their opponents, both sides hampered by long periods of calm weather.<ref name=\"WLC261\"/> To ensure that his fleet was in a position to intercept the French whichever [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] they took, Bridport split his fleet across a wide front, clustered in two trailing groups. At 19:00, Bridport signaled for his ships to attack the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to attack French ships as and when they overhauled them, taking up mutually supportive positions.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/><ref name=\"EPB231\"/> At 22:30 a calm fell, arresting both fleets until 03:00 on 23 June, when a light breeze from the south-west was enough to allow Bridport's fleet to push onwards so that as dawn rose the French were dead ahead. The main body of the French fleet was sailing in a loose cluster with three or four ships trailing behind and one ship, [[HMS Alexander (1778)|''Alexandre'']] under Captain [[Fran\u00e7ois Charles Guillemet]] far to the rear and only {{convert|3|nmi|km}} from the British vanguard.<ref name=\"WJ245-246\">James, pp. 245\u2013246</ref> ''Alexandre'' had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been captured in a [[Action of 6 November 1794|sharp engagement]] with a French squadron in which the ship had been badly damaged.<ref name=\"WLC262\">Clowes, p. 262</ref> The ship was a poor sailer, and its position was worsened by poor handling by Guillemet who did not follow Villaret's orders to form a [[line of battle]] rapidly enough.<ref name=\"CR210\">Rouvier, p. 210</ref>\n\nAgainst expectation, Bridport's leading ship was ''Queen Charlotte'', which had attained an unusually fast speed for a first rate through the carefully planned sailing of Captain [[Sir Andrew Snape Douglas]]. Immediately behind Douglas was Captain [[Richard Grindall]] in ''Irresistible'', with ''Orion'', ''Colossus'', ''Sans Pareil'' and ''Russell'' a short distance behind the leaders and the rest of the fleet substantially to the rear.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/> At 04:00, the island of Groix lay approximately {{convert|8|nmi|km}} to the east of ''Queen Charlotte'', the French coastline behind it. It was to this region that Villaret was retreating, hoping Bridport would be reluctant to follow him into the confined waters around the well-fortified island, which lies on the entrance to the port of Lorient. The southern Breton coast was a notoriously dangerous region, where Atlantic gales could push ships towards poorly charted reefs and rocky outcrops.<ref name=\"RG101\">Gardiner, ''Campaign of Trafalgar'' p. 101</ref>\n\n===23 June===\n[[File:Bridport's action 1795.jpg|thumb|''\"An exact Representation of the Capture of three Ships of the Line, and total defeat of the French Fleet, by a Squadron under Command of Admiral Lord Bridport, on the 23 of June, 1795\"'' E.

Just under an hour later, Douglas brought ''Queen Charlotte'' within range, Guillemet firing his [[Chase gun|stern-chasers]] at his three-decked opponent.<ref name=\"WJ246\">James, p. 246</ref> Douglas responded with his bow-chasers, gradually bringing his main battery into range and joined by Captain [[Sir James Saumarez]] in ''Orion'', which opened fire shortly after 06:00. The frigate captain, aware that his ship was powerless against two such opponents, abandoned the tow and sped ahead to rejoin the French fleet. Villaret's force had once more divided, with [[HMS Belleisle (1795)|''Formidable'']] under Captain [[Charles Linois]] a little way ahead of ''Alexandre'' and Villaret in his 120-gun flagship [[French ship Oc\u00e9an (1790)|''Peuple'']] ahead of ''Formidable''. With the French admiral were [[French ship Redoutable (1791)|''Redoutable'']], [[French ship Orion (1787)|''Mucius'']], [[French ship Wattignies (1794)|''Wattignies'']], [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']] and Vence's flagship [[French ship Nestor (1793)|''Nestor'']], while the remainder of the fleet had pushed on ahead and were now substantially advanced.<ref name=\"WLC262\"/> Villaret sent signals to form a tight line of battle, and all French ships repeated the signal, but none executed the manoeuvre.<ref name=\"FC240\">Chasseriau, p. 240</ref>\n\nAt 06:15, ''Queen Charlotte'' passed ''Alexandre'' and began firing on ''Formidable'', Linois returning fire against his much larger enemy for fifteen minutes before a fire broke out on the [[poop deck]].<ref name=\"JA184\">Allen, p. 184</ref> As the French crew scrambled to extinguish it, ''Sans Pareil'', flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Lord Hugh Seymour]], reached the ship and fired a broadside in passing, causing ''Formidable'' to lose speed and fall further back from the main body of the French. The fire from ''Queen Charlotte'' had reduced Linois's ship to a wreck, with the rigging torn and more than 320 men killed or wounded from a crew of 717.<ref name=\"WJ246-248\">James, pp. 246\u2013248</ref> As ''Sans Pareil'' passed ahead of the battered ship, the mizzenmast on ''Formidable'' collapsed over the side and Linois, seeing the rest of the British fleet rapidly approaching, [[striking the colours|struck his colours]] and surrendered.<ref name=\"EPB232\">Brenton, p. 232</ref> As ''Sans Pareil'' and ''Queen Charlotte'' battled ''Formidable'', ''Colossus'' and ''Russell'', joined by the second rates [[HMS London (1766)|HMS ''London'']] and [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']], pushed on to the French centre where Villaret's ships were awaiting them, the French admiral repeatedly attempting to form his ships into a line of battle to receive the British attack, without success.<ref name=\"CR212\">Rouvier, p. 212</ref>\n\nAt 07:00, four British ships and six French fought a confused melee while the French vanguard continued eastwards without pause and the slower portions of the British fleet struggled to come up in the light winds.<ref name=\"WJ246\"/> The entire combat was slowly pulling closer to the fortified rocky island of Groix, close to which Villaret intended to shelter his fleet. Douglas in ''Queen Charlotte'' had been forced out of the engagement due to severe damage to his rigging and sails which made his ship unmanageable. At 07:14, he drifted past the shattered hull of ''Alexandre''; Captain Guillemet opened fire briefly before surrendering as Douglas returned it with devastating effect.<ref name=\"WLC262-263\">Clowes, pp. 262\u2013263</ref> Even as his ship fell back, Douglas continued to engage the French at long range, turning the guns on ''Peuple'' and ''Tigre'', joined by ''Sans Pareil'' which attacked ''Tigre'' under Captain [[Jacques Bedout]] and forced it out of the French formation with severe damage. Villaret again attempted to gather his forces in support of ''Tigre'', and even positioned his frigate ahead of his own fleeing ships in hope of cutting off their retreat and forcing them to imitate his own manoeuvres, but in vain; \"they would have passed over my very body had not {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Nicolas Topsent|fr|3=Jean-Nicolas Topsent|lt=representant Topsent}} taken command and prevented a collision\", he wrote in his report.<ref name=\"FC242\">Chasseriau, p. 242</ref> As ''Tigre'' fell out of line, ''Queen'' and ''London'' joined the attack on the isolated ship, and Bedout was forced to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds.<ref name=\"WJ247\">James, p. 247</ref> The French ship had been severely damaged, with {{convert|8|ft|m}} of water in the hold, the masts and rigging badly torn and more than 130 men killed or wounded, including Bedout, who had been hit three times.<ref name=\"CR213\">Rouvier, p. 213</ref>\n\nAt 07:57, Bridport's ''Royal George'' reached the combat, Douglas falling in behind his ship in anticipation of a renewed attack, the crew of ''Queen Charlotte'' having conducted enough hasty repairs to regain control of their ship. At 08:15 Bridport signaled ''Colossus'' under Captain [[John Monkton]], the leading British ship more than {{convert|1.5|nmi|km}} ahead of the flagship, to return to the fleet. He repeated the order to Seymour in ''Sans Pareil'' who was almost as far advanced in combat with the retreating ''Peuple'',<ref name=\"WJ247\"/> on which Villaret's flag captain [[Jacques Angot]] had been killed in action.<ref name=\"D1051\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=h9BIAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA190&lpg=RA1-PA190&dq=%22Jacques+Angot%22+capitaine&source=bl&ots=jDn2dVgIrC&sig=tG0PetfteQ-XHhWvcQWjChHVAQw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qIaWT-OrO-ax0AWyrsCVDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Jacques%20Angot%22%20capitaine&f=false D\u00e9cret no 1051 de la Convention nationale], ''Collection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des d\u00e9crets rendus par la Convention Nationale, Volume 51'', Retrieved 28 April 2012</ref> Bridport then pulled ahead in the pursuit, catching the badly damaged ''Peuple'' approximately {{convert|0.5|nmi|km}} west of Groix and firing one broadside at the French flagship and another at ''Tigre'', which Bridport was not aware had already surrendered. At 08:37, ignoring the nearby ''Peuple'' and the remainder of the French fleet scattered between Groix and the [[River La\u00efta]], Bridport turned away to the south-west followed by the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ247\"/><ref name=\"WLC263\">Clowes, p. 263</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nBridport gave instructions as he withdrew for ''Alexandre'', ''Formidable'' and ''Tigre'' to be taken under tow by [[HMS Prince (1788)|HMS ''Prince'']], [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] and [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] respectively.<ref name=\"WLC263\"/> The British fleet was in good condition: five ships had seen no action at all and of those that had fought, only ''Queen Charlotte'' had suffered any significant damage, principally to her rigging. The British fleet had lost 31 men killed and 113 wounded; ''Queen Charlotte'' and ''Colossus'' had the heaviest casualties of 36 and 35 respectively.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> Bridport placed prize crews on the captured vessels and sent them back to Britain while turning the fleet back eastwards once it had reached a safe distance from the coast, in order to provide support for Warren's expedition to Quiberon. Warren landed the French Royalist forces at [[Carnac]] on 27 June, but the invasion ended in disaster a month later, the surviving Royalists driven back to the coast and collected by Warren.<ref name=\"WLC266\">Clowes, p. 266</ref> Bridport had remained off Quiberon to ensure that Villaret did not return to harass the expeditionary force, returning to Britain on 20 September but leaving the bulk of the blockade fleet off the Breton coast under Rear-Admiral [[Henry Harvey]]. The 68-year-old Bridport was forcibly retired in October after an unrelated argument with [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]], but was reinstated in 1796 and continued to serve in command of the Channel Fleet until 1800.<ref name=\"ODNB Hood\">{{Cite ODNB|id=13671|title=Hood, Alexander}}</ref><ref name=\"WLC267\">Clowes, p. 267</ref>\n\nVillaret meanwhile gathered his scattered ships and called a council of his senior officers on the frigate [[HMS Amelia (1796)|''Prosperine'']] to discuss their next course of action. The French admiral believed Bridport had only temporarily withdrawn and would be soon returning to continue the engagement. He therefore proposed to anchor off the Breton coast in a strong defensive position and await Bridport's attack. This scheme was vociferously opposed by Contre-amirals [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen de Tr\u00e9marec|Kerguelen]] and [[\u00c9tienne Eustache Bruix]] who argued that in such a position the British would be able to use the [[weather gage]] to bombard the French at will and attack them with [[fireships]].<ref name=\"WJ249\">James, p. 249</ref> Following their advice, Villaret decided to shelter the fleet in the nearby port of Lorient to seek supplies and repairs before returning to Brest. But he found that, having sailed without sufficient provisions, Lorient was not equipped for a fleet of such size and Villaret was forced to discharge the majority of sailors as he was unable to feed them. It was not until December and the winter storm season that a number of the ships were able to travel quietly up the coast to Brest, while others were sent southwards to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]].<ref name=\"WJ253\">James, p. 253</ref> French casualties had been heavy, although they have not been reported other than on the captured vessels, which totaled 670 killed and wounded.<ref name=\"WJ248\">James, p. 248</ref> In the aftermath of the action, Villaret wrote a letter condemning the behaviour of a number of his officers, stating \"''Soit ignorance, soit ineptie, soit insubordination, malgr\u00e9 nos signaux r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9s, des ordres transmis par porte-voix, rien ne fut fait. Nos boulets atterissaient dans l'eau, le patriotisme \u00e0 lui seul ne peut manoeuvrer un navire''\" (\"Be it ignorance, ineptitude or insubordination, in spite of our repeated signals, nothing was done. Our shots landed in water, patriotism alone cannot manoeuvre a ship\").<ref name=\"HG214\">Granier, p. 98</ref> Several French captains were [[court-martial]]led: [[Jean-Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Aved-Magnac|Jean Magnac]] of [[French ship Z\u00e9l\u00e9 (1764)|''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'']], already blamed for the failure at Cornwallis's Retreat, was dismissed from the Navy, as was Captain Giot-Labri\u00e8re of [[French ship Fougueux (1785)|''Fougueux'']]. Captain Larr\u00e9guy of ''Mucius'' was censured for not adequately supporting ''Tigre'', and three other captains were tried but acquitted.<ref name=\"CR214\">Rouvier, p. 214</ref>\n\nIn common with the battle of the Glorious First of June the previous year,<ref name=\"WJ181\">James, p. 181</ref> rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail; the only officer commended was Bridport's own flag captain [[William Domett]], whose ship had joined the action only in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Sir Alan Gardner]] of ''Queen''. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral [[John Colpoys]] of ''London'', whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's.<ref name=\"WLC265\">Clowes, p. 265</ref><ref name=\"LG1\"/> Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] noting that Douglas and ''Queen Charlotte'' were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral [[Sir Roger Curtis]], was ashore at the court-martial of Captain [[Anthony James Pye Molloy|Anthony Molloy]] and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ249\"/>\n\nAll three captured ships were taken into the Royal Navy. The name of ''Alexandre'' reverted to the former ''Alexander'', and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by ''Alexander''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s presence in the line at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798 under Captain [[Alexander Ball]].<ref name=\"Win\">Winfield, p. 51</ref> ''Tigre'' retained her French name, while ''Formidable'', as there was already a ship by that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS ''Belleisle'', apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle \u00cele in the aftermath of the battle.<ref name=\"WJ250\">James, p. 250</ref> ''Belleisle'' had a long and successful career, fighting at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805 under Captain [[William Hargood]].<ref name=\"ODNB Hargood\">{{Cite ODNB|id=12312|title=Hargood, Sir William}}</ref>\n\nMore controversial than the distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision to withdraw from the battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach. In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that \"If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have every reason to believe that a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed\", going on note that \"When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries [on Groix], and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [Lorient].<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13790|pages=673\u2013674|date=27 June 1795}}</ref> His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, ''\"S'ils avaient bien manouevr\u00e9, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire p\u00e9rir \u00e0 la c\u00f4te\"'' (If [the English] had manoeuvred successfully they could have taken all our vessels, or made them perish on the coast).<ref name=\"WJ249\"/> Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage,<ref name=\"WJ247\"/> while [[William Laird Clowes]] wrote in 1901 that \"We may be pretty sure that had a [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]], a [[Edward Hawke|Hawke]] or even a [[Edward Boscawen|Boscawen]] commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated.\"<ref name=\"WLC266\"/> Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and [[Richard Woodman]] have compared Groix with the battles of [[Battle of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Naval Battle of Hy\u00e8res Islands|Hy\u00e8res]] fought during the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.<ref name=\"NM164\">Mostert, p. 164</ref><ref name=\"RW61\">Woodman, p. 61</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Allen\n | first = Joseph\n | authorlink =\n | year = 1905\n | origyear= 1842\n | chapter =\n | title = Battles of the British Navy\n | edition = 9th\n | publisher = Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co\n | location = London\n | id =\n | oclc = 85994488\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Brenton\n | first = Edward Pelham\n | authorlink = Edward Pelham Brenton\n | year = 1837\n | origyear = 1825\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Vol. I\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_LCRy8AHxwrYC\n | quote = edward pelham brenton.\n | publisher = C.

The battle was fought between elements of the British [[Channel Fleet]] and the French Atlantic Fleet, which were cruising in the region on separate missions. The British fleet, commanded by Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Lord Bridport]], was covering an [[Invasion of France (1795)|invasion convoy]] carrying a [[\u00c9migr\u00e9 armies of the French Revolutionary Wars|French Royalist]] army to invade [[Quiberon]], while the French under Vice-amiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] had sailed a week earlier to rescue a French convoy from attack by a British squadron. The French fleet had driven off the British squadron in a battle on 17 June known as [[Cornwallis's Retreat]], and were attempting to return to their base at [[Brest, France|Brest]] when Bridport's force of 14 [[ships of the line]] appeared on 22 June.\n\nVillaret, believing that the stronger British fleet would destroy his own 12 ships of the line, ordered his force to fall back to the inshore anchorage off Groix, hoping to take shelter in protected coastal waters. Several of his ships were too slow, falling behind so that early in the morning of 23 June the rearmost ships of his fleet were caught by the British vanguard, overhauled one by one and brought to battle. Although Villaret fought a determined rearguard action, three French ships were captured, all with very heavy casualties, and the remainder of the French fleet was left scattered across miles of coastline. In this position they were highly vulnerable to continued British attack, but after only a few hours' engagement, concerned that his ships might be wrecked on the rocky coastline, Bridport called off the action and allowed Villaret to regroup inshore and retreat to [[Lorient]].\n\nAlthough the battle was a British victory, there was criticism of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that a unique opportunity to destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The [[Invasion of France (1795)|invasion at Quiberon]] ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline for the remainder of the year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] had seen the French Atlantic Fleet, based principally at the [[Brittany|Breton]] harbour of [[Brest, France|Brest]], suffer a series of setbacks. The tense atmosphere in France following the [[French Revolution]] was reflected in the fleet, which suffered a mutiny in September 1793 followed by [[Reign of Terror|a purge]] of suspected anti-republicans which resulted in the death or imprisonment of a number of experienced commanders.<ref name=\"WJ59\">James, p. 59</ref><ref name=\"SW34\">Willis, p. 34</ref> In [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794|May 1794]], the French fleet sallied into the Atlantic to protect an incoming grain convoy from the [[United States]] and was attacked by the British [[Channel Fleet]] at the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], losing seven ships, although the convoy was saved. In the winter of 1794\u20131795, five more French ships were lost in a disastrous sortie in the middle of the Atlantic winter storm season known as the ''[[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]]''. By the spring of 1795, the British Channel Fleet was in the ascendancy, enforcing a distant [[blockade]] of the French fleet in Brest.<ref name=\"RG16\">Gardiner, ''Fleet Battle and Blockade'' p. 16</ref>\n\nIn May 1795, with much of the winter's damage repaired, the French commander [[Vice-amiral]] [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] sent a squadron of three [[ships of the line]] and several [[frigates]] under [[Contre-amiral]] [[Jean Gaspard Vence]] to [[Bordeaux]] with orders to escort a convoy of merchant ships carrying wine and brandy to Brest.<ref name=\"WLC255\">Clowes, p. 255</ref> On 8 June, as Vence's convoy passed the fortified island of [[Belle \u00cele]] on the southern Breton coast they were discovered by a British battle squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates under Vice-Admiral [[William Cornwallis]].<ref name=\"WLC256\">Clowes, p. 256</ref> Vence ordered his outnumbered ships to shelter under the batteries of Belle \u00cele, and after a brief skirmish Cornwallis withdrew his forces with eight captured merchant ships. While Cornwallis was escorting his prizes to the mouth of the Channel, Vence sailed out of the Belle \u00cele anchorage and discovered on 15 June that the main force of the Atlantic fleet had sailed to rescue him, a mission ordered by government over the objections of the fleet's officers that Vence would be able to easily extricate himself from the anchorage due to the proximity of the port of [[Lorient]].<ref name=\"WJ237-238\">James, pp. 237\u2013238</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 16 June Cornwallis returned to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on the morning of 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard.<ref name=\"WJ240\">James, p. 240</ref> Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship [[HMS Mars (1794)|HMS ''Mars'']], until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect ''Mars'', Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|HMS ''Royal Sovereign'']] between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the French back.<ref name=\"WLC257\">Clowes, p. 257</ref> At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as [[Cornwallis's Retreat]].<ref name=\"WJ241\">James, p. 241</ref>\n\nUnbeknownst to either Villaret or Cornwallis, the British Channel Fleet was also at sea, having sailed from [[Spithead]] on 12 June with 14 ships of the line and 11 smaller vessels under the command of Admiral [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport]]. Bridport had been tasked with ensuring the safety of a convoy of transports, commanded by Commodore [[Sir John Borlase Warren]], which carried a [[\u00c9migr\u00e9 armies of the French Revolutionary Wars|French Royalist]] army to [[Quiberon]] with the intention of triggering a counter-revolution in Brittany.<ref name=\"RG48\">Gardiner, ''Fleet Battle and Blockade'' p. 48</ref> This force consisted of an additional three ships of the line, six frigates and more than 50 transports containing 2,500 French Royalists. The voyage across the English Channel and around the [[Ushant]] headland took seven days, the combined fleet and expeditionary force arriving off Belle \u00cele on 19 June.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> Bridport had ordered Warren to take his convoy on to Quiberon while the main body of the Channel Fleet stood further out to sea to intercept any attack by the French Atlantic Fleet, which Bridport assumed would advance southwards from Brest. What the British admiral did not know was that not only had the French fleet sailed a week earlier, they were still at sea \u2013 Villaret's ships having been blown southwards by a severe gale on 18 June and forced to take shelter in the anchorage off Belle \u00cele.<ref name=\"WJ243\">James, p. 243</ref>\n\n==Engagement off Groix==\n{{See also|Order of Battle in the Biscay campaign of June 1795}}\n\n===Villaret's retreat===\n[[File:Battle of Groix locator.png|Villaret retreated to near the island of Groix, indicated by the red dot, off the coast of France southeast of Brest.|thumb|alt=The island of Groix is near the French coast southeast of Brest.]]\nIt was one of Warren's ships, the frigate [[HMS Arethusa (1793)|HMS ''Arethusa'']], which first discovered the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on ''Arethusa'' miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships of the line and ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to turn away from the French.<ref name=\"WJ244\">James, p. 244</ref> Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have gauged its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having taken aboard only enough for 15 days in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier.<ref name=\"WJ238\">James, p. 238</ref> On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet in the face of the supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast against the wind, seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.<ref name=\"WJ245\">James, p. 245</ref>\n\nThe adverse southeasterly winds frustrated both fleets, and it was not until 03:30 on 22 June that lookouts on Bridport's scouting frigates [[HMS Nymphe (1780)|HMS ''Nymphe'']] and [[HMS Astrea (1781)|HMS ''Astrea'']] finally discovered the French in the distance to the southeast,<ref name=\"LG1\"/> the British approximately {{convert|42|nmi|km}} from the French coast.<ref name=\"WLC261\">Clowes, p. 261</ref> On seeing the larger British fleet, to which Warren's detached ships had still not joined, Villaret ordered his fleet to turn back towards the land and Bridport followed, seeing that the French admiral did not intend to offer battle.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/> To maximise his chances of catching the French, Bridport specifically ordered his \"best-sailing\" ships [[HMS Sans Pareil (1794)|HMS ''Sans Pareil'']], [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Colossus (1787)|HMS ''Colossus'']], [[HMS Irresistible (1782)|HMS ''Irresistible'']], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS ''Valiant'']] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], to break from the formation and lead the pursuit at 06:30.<ref name=\"WLC261\"/><ref name=\"EPB231\">Brenton, p. 231</ref> Bridport followed in his 100-gun [[first rate]] flagship [[HMS Royal George (1788)|HMS ''Royal George'']], accompanied by the remainder of the fleet, which included another 100-gun ship [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] and seven 98-gun [[second rate]] ships.<ref name=\"WLC260\">Clowes, p. 260</ref>\n\nAll day the chase continued: at 12:00 the French fleet were approximately {{convert|12|nmi|km}} distant, and all through the afternoon the British ships slowly gained on their opponents, both sides hampered by long periods of calm weather.<ref name=\"WLC261\"/> To ensure that his fleet was in a position to intercept the French whichever [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] they took, Bridport split his fleet across a wide front, clustered in two trailing groups. At 19:00, Bridport signaled for his ships to attack the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to attack French ships as and when they overhauled them, taking up mutually supportive positions.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/><ref name=\"EPB231\"/> At 22:30 a calm fell, arresting both fleets until 03:00 on 23 June, when a light breeze from the south-west was enough to allow Bridport's fleet to push onwards so that as dawn rose the French were dead ahead. The main body of the French fleet was sailing in a loose cluster with three or four ships trailing behind and one ship, [[HMS Alexander (1778)|''Alexandre'']] under Captain [[Fran\u00e7ois Charles Guillemet]] far to the rear and only {{convert|3|nmi|km}} from the British vanguard.<ref name=\"WJ245-246\">James, pp. 245\u2013246</ref> ''Alexandre'' had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been captured in a [[Action of 6 November 1794|sharp engagement]] with a French squadron in which the ship had been badly damaged.<ref name=\"WLC262\">Clowes, p. 262</ref> The ship was a poor sailer, and its position was worsened by poor handling by Guillemet who did not follow Villaret's orders to form a [[line of battle]] rapidly enough.<ref name=\"CR210\">Rouvier, p. 210</ref>\n\nAgainst expectation, Bridport's leading ship was ''Queen Charlotte'', which had attained an unusually fast speed for a first rate through the carefully planned sailing of Captain [[Sir Andrew Snape Douglas]]. Immediately behind Douglas was Captain [[Richard Grindall]] in ''Irresistible'', with ''Orion'', ''Colossus'', ''Sans Pareil'' and ''Russell'' a short distance behind the leaders and the rest of the fleet substantially to the rear.<ref name=\"WJ245\"/> At 04:00, the island of Groix lay approximately {{convert|8|nmi|km}} to the east of ''Queen Charlotte'', the French coastline behind it. It was to this region that Villaret was retreating, hoping Bridport would be reluctant to follow him into the confined waters around the well-fortified island, which lies on the entrance to the port of Lorient. The southern Breton coast was a notoriously dangerous region, where Atlantic gales could push ships towards poorly charted reefs and rocky outcrops.<ref name=\"RG101\">Gardiner, ''Campaign of Trafalgar'' p. 101</ref>\n\n===23 June===\n[[File:Bridport's action 1795.jpg|thumb|''\"An exact Representation of the Capture of three Ships of the Line, and total defeat of the French Fleet, by a Squadron under Command of Admiral Lord Bridport, on the 23 of June, 1795\"'' E.

Just under an hour later, Douglas brought ''Queen Charlotte'' within range, Guillemet firing his [[Chase gun|stern-chasers]] at his three-decked opponent.<ref name=\"WJ246\">James, p. 246</ref> Douglas responded with his bow-chasers, gradually bringing his main battery into range and joined by Captain [[Sir James Saumarez]] in ''Orion'', which opened fire shortly after 06:00. The frigate captain, aware that his ship was powerless against two such opponents, abandoned the tow and sped ahead to rejoin the French fleet. Villaret's force had once more divided, with [[HMS Belleisle (1795)|''Formidable'']] under Captain [[Charles Linois]] a little way ahead of ''Alexandre'' and Villaret in his 120-gun flagship [[French ship Oc\u00e9an (1790)|''Peuple'']] ahead of ''Formidable''. With the French admiral were [[French ship Redoutable (1791)|''Redoutable'']], [[French ship Orion (1787)|''Mucius'']], [[French ship Wattignies (1794)|''Wattignies'']], [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']] and Vence's flagship [[French ship Nestor (1793)|''Nestor'']], while the remainder of the fleet had pushed on ahead and were now substantially advanced.<ref name=\"WLC262\"/> Villaret sent signals to form a tight line of battle, and all French ships repeated the signal, but none executed the manoeuvre.<ref name=\"FC240\">Chasseriau, p. 240</ref>\n\nAt 06:15, ''Queen Charlotte'' passed ''Alexandre'' and began firing on ''Formidable'', Linois returning fire against his much larger enemy for fifteen minutes before a fire broke out on the [[poop deck]].<ref name=\"JA184\">Allen, p. 184</ref> As the French crew scrambled to extinguish it, ''Sans Pareil'', flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Lord Hugh Seymour]], reached the ship and fired a broadside in passing, causing ''Formidable'' to lose speed and fall further back from the main body of the French. The fire from ''Queen Charlotte'' had reduced Linois's ship to a wreck, with the rigging torn and more than 320 men killed or wounded from a crew of 717.<ref name=\"WJ246-248\">James, pp. 246\u2013248</ref> As ''Sans Pareil'' passed ahead of the battered ship, the mizzenmast on ''Formidable'' collapsed over the side and Linois, seeing the rest of the British fleet rapidly approaching, [[striking the colours|struck his colours]] and surrendered.<ref name=\"EPB232\">Brenton, p. 232</ref> As ''Sans Pareil'' and ''Queen Charlotte'' battled ''Formidable'', ''Colossus'' and ''Russell'', joined by the second rates [[HMS London (1766)|HMS ''London'']] and [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']], pushed on to the French centre where Villaret's ships were awaiting them, the French admiral repeatedly attempting to form his ships into a line of battle to receive the British attack, without success.<ref name=\"CR212\">Rouvier, p. 212</ref>\n\nAt 07:00, four British ships and six French fought a confused melee while the French vanguard continued eastwards without pause and the slower portions of the British fleet struggled to come up in the light winds.<ref name=\"WJ246\"/> The entire combat was slowly pulling closer to the fortified rocky island of Groix, close to which Villaret intended to shelter his fleet. Douglas in ''Queen Charlotte'' had been forced out of the engagement due to severe damage to his rigging and sails which made his ship unmanageable. At 07:14, he drifted past the shattered hull of ''Alexandre''; Captain Guillemet opened fire briefly before surrendering as Douglas returned it with devastating effect.<ref name=\"WLC262-263\">Clowes, pp. 262\u2013263</ref> Even as his ship fell back, Douglas continued to engage the French at long range, turning the guns on ''Peuple'' and ''Tigre'', joined by ''Sans Pareil'' which attacked ''Tigre'' under Captain [[Jacques Bedout]] and forced it out of the French formation with severe damage. Villaret again attempted to gather his forces in support of ''Tigre'', and even positioned his frigate ahead of his own fleeing ships in hope of cutting off their retreat and forcing them to imitate his own manoeuvres, but in vain; \"they would have passed over my very body had not {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Nicolas Topsent|fr|3=Jean-Nicolas Topsent|lt=representant Topsent}} taken command and prevented a collision\", he wrote in his report.<ref name=\"FC242\">Chasseriau, p. 242</ref> As ''Tigre'' fell out of line, ''Queen'' and ''London'' joined the attack on the isolated ship, and Bedout was forced to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds.<ref name=\"WJ247\">James, p. 247</ref> The French ship had been severely damaged, with {{convert|8|ft|m}} of water in the hold, the masts and rigging badly torn and more than 130 men killed or wounded, including Bedout, who had been hit three times.<ref name=\"CR213\">Rouvier, p. 213</ref>\n\nAt 07:57, Bridport's ''Royal George'' reached the combat, Douglas falling in behind his ship in anticipation of a renewed attack, the crew of ''Queen Charlotte'' having conducted enough hasty repairs to regain control of their ship. At 08:15 Bridport signaled ''Colossus'' under Captain [[John Monkton]], the leading British ship more than {{convert|1.5|nmi|km}} ahead of the flagship, to return to the fleet. He repeated the order to Seymour in ''Sans Pareil'' who was almost as far advanced in combat with the retreating ''Peuple'',<ref name=\"WJ247\"/> on which Villaret's flag captain [[Jacques Angot]] had been killed in action.<ref name=\"D1051\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=h9BIAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA190&lpg=RA1-PA190&dq=%22Jacques+Angot%22+capitaine&source=bl&ots=jDn2dVgIrC&sig=tG0PetfteQ-XHhWvcQWjChHVAQw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qIaWT-OrO-ax0AWyrsCVDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Jacques%20Angot%22%20capitaine&f=false D\u00e9cret no 1051 de la Convention nationale], ''Collection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des d\u00e9crets rendus par la Convention Nationale, Volume 51'', Retrieved 28 April 2012</ref> Bridport then pulled ahead in the pursuit, catching the badly damaged ''Peuple'' approximately {{convert|0.5|nmi|km}} west of Groix and firing one broadside at the French flagship and another at ''Tigre'', which Bridport was not aware had already surrendered. At 08:37, ignoring the nearby ''Peuple'' and the remainder of the French fleet scattered between Groix and the [[River La\u00efta]], Bridport turned away to the south-west followed by the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ247\"/><ref name=\"WLC263\">Clowes, p. 263</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nBridport gave instructions as he withdrew for ''Alexandre'', ''Formidable'' and ''Tigre'' to be taken under tow by [[HMS Prince (1788)|HMS ''Prince'']], [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] and [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] respectively.<ref name=\"WLC263\"/> The British fleet was in good condition: five ships had seen no action at all and of those that had fought, only ''Queen Charlotte'' had suffered any significant damage, principally to her rigging. The British fleet had lost 31 men killed and 113 wounded; ''Queen Charlotte'' and ''Colossus'' had the heaviest casualties of 36 and 35 respectively.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> Bridport placed prize crews on the captured vessels and sent them back to Britain while turning the fleet back eastwards once it had reached a safe distance from the coast, in order to provide support for Warren's expedition to Quiberon. Warren landed the French Royalist forces at [[Carnac]] on 27 June, but the invasion ended in disaster a month later, the surviving Royalists driven back to the coast and collected by Warren.<ref name=\"WLC266\">Clowes, p. 266</ref> Bridport had remained off Quiberon to ensure that Villaret did not return to harass the expeditionary force, returning to Britain on 20 September but leaving the bulk of the blockade fleet off the Breton coast under Rear-Admiral [[Henry Harvey]]. The 68-year-old Bridport was forcibly retired in October after an unrelated argument with [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]], but was reinstated in 1796 and continued to serve in command of the Channel Fleet until 1800.<ref name=\"ODNB Hood\">{{Cite ODNB|id=13671|title=Hood, Alexander}}</ref><ref name=\"WLC267\">Clowes, p. 267</ref>\n\nVillaret meanwhile gathered his scattered ships and called a council of his senior officers on the frigate [[HMS Amelia (1796)|''Prosperine'']] to discuss their next course of action. The French admiral believed Bridport had only temporarily withdrawn and would be soon returning to continue the engagement. He therefore proposed to anchor off the Breton coast in a strong defensive position and await Bridport's attack. This scheme was vociferously opposed by Contre-amirals [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen de Tr\u00e9marec|Kerguelen]] and [[\u00c9tienne Eustache Bruix]] who argued that in such a position the British would be able to use the [[weather gage]] to bombard the French at will and attack them with [[fireships]].<ref name=\"WJ249\">James, p. 249</ref> Following their advice, Villaret decided to shelter the fleet in the nearby port of Lorient to seek supplies and repairs before returning to Brest. But he found that, having sailed without sufficient provisions, Lorient was not equipped for a fleet of such size and Villaret was forced to discharge the majority of sailors as he was unable to feed them. It was not until December and the winter storm season that a number of the ships were able to travel quietly up the coast to Brest, while others were sent southwards to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]].<ref name=\"WJ253\">James, p. 253</ref> French casualties had been heavy, although they have not been reported other than on the captured vessels, which totaled 670 killed and wounded.<ref name=\"WJ248\">James, p. 248</ref> In the aftermath of the action, Villaret wrote a letter condemning the behaviour of a number of his officers, stating \"''Soit ignorance, soit ineptie, soit insubordination, malgr\u00e9 nos signaux r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9s, des ordres transmis par porte-voix, rien ne fut fait. Nos boulets atterissaient dans l'eau, le patriotisme \u00e0 lui seul ne peut manoeuvrer un navire''\" (\"Be it ignorance, ineptitude or insubordination, in spite of our repeated signals, nothing was done. Our shots landed in water, patriotism alone cannot manoeuvre a ship\").<ref name=\"HG214\">Granier, p. 98</ref> Several French captains were [[court-martial]]led: [[Jean-Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Aved-Magnac|Jean Magnac]] of [[French ship Z\u00e9l\u00e9 (1764)|''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'']], already blamed for the failure at Cornwallis's Retreat, was dismissed from the Navy, as was Captain Giot-Labri\u00e8re of [[French ship Fougueux (1785)|''Fougueux'']]. Captain Larr\u00e9guy of ''Mucius'' was censured for not adequately supporting ''Tigre'', and three other captains were tried but acquitted.<ref name=\"CR214\">Rouvier, p. 214</ref>\n\nIn common with the battle of the Glorious First of June the previous year,<ref name=\"WJ181\">James, p. 181</ref> rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail; the only officer commended was Bridport's own flag captain [[William Domett]], whose ship had joined the action only in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Sir Alan Gardner]] of ''Queen''. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral [[John Colpoys]] of ''London'', whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's.<ref name=\"WLC265\">Clowes, p. 265</ref><ref name=\"LG1\"/> Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] noting that Douglas and ''Queen Charlotte'' were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral [[Sir Roger Curtis]], was ashore at the court-martial of Captain [[Anthony James Pye Molloy|Anthony Molloy]] and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ249\"/>\n\nAll three captured ships were taken into the Royal Navy. The name of ''Alexandre'' reverted to the former ''Alexander'', and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by ''Alexander''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s presence in the line at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798 under Captain [[Alexander Ball]].<ref name=\"Win\">Winfield, p. 51</ref> ''Tigre'' retained her French name, while ''Formidable'', as there was already a ship by that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS ''Belleisle'', apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle \u00cele in the aftermath of the battle.<ref name=\"WJ250\">James, p. 250</ref> ''Belleisle'' had a long and successful career, fighting at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805 under Captain [[William Hargood]].<ref name=\"ODNB Hargood\">{{Cite ODNB|id=12312|title=Hargood, Sir William}}</ref>\n\nMore controversial than the distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision to withdraw from the battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach. In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that \"If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have every reason to believe that a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed\", going on note that \"When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries [on Groix], and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [Lorient].<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13790|pages=673\u2013674|date=27 June 1795}}</ref> His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, ''\"S'ils avaient bien manouevr\u00e9, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire p\u00e9rir \u00e0 la c\u00f4te\"'' (If [the English] had manoeuvred successfully they could have taken all our vessels, or made them perish on the coast).<ref name=\"WJ249\"/> Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage,<ref name=\"WJ247\"/> while [[William Laird Clowes]] wrote in 1901 that \"We may be pretty sure that had a [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]], a [[Edward Hawke|Hawke]] or even a [[Edward Boscawen|Boscawen]] commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated.\"<ref name=\"WLC266\"/> Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and [[Richard Woodman]] have compared Groix with the battles of [[Battle of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Naval Battle of Hy\u00e8res Islands|Hy\u00e8res]] fought during the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.<ref name=\"NM164\">Mostert, p. 164</ref><ref name=\"RW61\">Woodman, p. 61</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Allen\n | first = Joseph\n | authorlink =\n | year = 1905\n | origyear= 1842\n | chapter =\n | title = Battles of the British Navy\n | edition = 9th\n | publisher = Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co\n | location = London\n | id =\n | oclc = 85994488\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Brenton\n | first = Edward Pelham\n | authorlink = Edward Pelham Brenton\n | year = 1837\n | origyear = 1825\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Vol. I\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_LCRy8AHxwrYC\n | quote = edward pelham brenton.\n | publisher = C.
