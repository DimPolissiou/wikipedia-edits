He laid founding work in identifying [[amino acid]]s, the fundamental building blocks of [[protein]]s.  He did this through recognizing the first of them, [[asparagine]], in 1806, in the industry's adoption of industrial dyes, with the identification of [[alizarin]] in 1826, and in the emergence of modern medications, through the identification of [[codeine]] in 1832, a drug of widespread use with [[analgesic]] and antidiarrheal properties.\n\nRobiquet was born in [[Rennes]]. He was at first a pharmacist in the French armies during the [[French Revolution]] years and became a professor at the \u00c9cole de pharmacie in Paris, where he died. (For biography details refer to the French Wikipedia article)\n\nNotable scientific achievements were among other things his isolation and characterization of properties of [[asparagine]] (the first [[amino acid]] to be identified, from [[asparagus]], achieved.  In 1806, with [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]]), [[cantharidin]] (1810), the [[Sigma-1 receptor]] [[agonist]] [[noscapine]] (1817), [[caffeine]] (1821), [[alizarin]] (later on moved to mass industrial production by [[Carl Gr\u00e4be]] and [[Carl Theodore Liebermann]] in Germany, and by [[William Henry Perkin]] in Great Britain) and [[1,2,4-Trihydroxyanthraquinone|purpurin]] (1826), [[Orcin]] (1829), [[amygdalin]] (1830), as well as [[codeine]] (1832). Some of these discoveries were made in collaboration with other scientists.\n\n== Academic titles and distinctions ==\nRegistered Pharmacist (1808), lecturer in chemistry at the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] (1811), Deputy Professor in History of pharmaceutical matters (1811) then Professor (1814) then Administrator-Treasurer (1824) at the [[:fr:Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie de Paris|Ecole de Pharmacie]] now the [[:fr:Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie|Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie]] see [3], member then Secretary General (1817) and President (1826) of the [[:fr:Acad\u00e9mie nationale de pharmacie|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pharmacie]] later on known as [[:fr:Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de Pharmacie|Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de Pharmacie]] see [8], member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie de M\u00e9decine]] (1820), member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] (1833), one of the founders and first President of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00e9voyance des Pharmaciens]] see [6](1820).\n\nDistinguished with the order of the [[L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] (1830).\n\n== Discovery of [[asparagine]], the first [[amino acid]] ever identified ==\nIn the fall of 1805, Robiquet, then a young help working in the laboratory of Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, started analyses, with what rudimentary methods were then available, with asparagus juice. After a number of operations he obtained a crystallized white matter, which he and Vauquelin tried to characterize in 1806 as day by day their attempts found it to be some kind of new \"chemical principle\" with hitherto unknown properties, nothing like well known mineral salts classically obtained in the 18th century. Duly convinced this is something completely new, they call this matter \"[[asparagine|asparagin]]\", after the asparagus plant they extracted it from.\nAsparagine will turn out to be one of the 22 amino acids that build-up all living matter on earth, the first ever identified and understood as belonging to a new class of molecules.\nProgress in isolating the other amino acids will be very slow, with less than a handful in total during the whole 19th century.\n\n== Discovery of various dyes ==\nEven until the middle of 19th century, all dyes used for colouring cloth were natural substances, many of which were expensive and labour-intensive to extract. Furthermore, many lacked stability through washing or exposure to sunlight, or fastness.\n\nFor instance, the colour purple, which had been a mark of aristocracy and prestige since ancient times in Rome, the Middle East and Egypt, was especially expensive and difficult to produce\u2014the dye used, known as [[Tyrian purple]], was made from the glandular mucus of certain molluscs. Its extraction was variable and complicated, and dependent on the availability of the very specific type of shell (actually two types, now known the one as [[Bolinus brandaris]], and the other as [[Hexaplex trunculus]], nowadays classified within two different genders) from which it was extracted.\n\nAnother type of natural red dye used from times immemorial was obtained from [[Rose madder|madder]] root in Central Asia and [[Egypt]], where it was grown as early as 1500 BC. Cloth dyed with madder root pigment was found in the tomb of the [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] and in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and ancient [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]]. In the Middle Ages, [[Charlemagne]] encouraged madder cultivation. It grew well in the sandy soils of the [[Netherlands]] and became an important part of the local economy. By 1804, the English dye maker [[George Field (chemist)|George Field]] had introduced new techniques known as ''[[Lake pigment|lake]]'' madder, that extended the use of the tincture to paints.\n\nRobiquet obtained from madder root two distinct molecules with dye properties, the one producing a magnificent red, that he called [[alizarin]], which proved as well extremely stable, and another, of less stable properties, that he called [[1,2,4-Trihydroxyanthraquinone|purpurin]].\n\nSome 30 years later in April 1856, [[William Henry Perkin]], then a mere youngster working as assistant at the Royal College of Chemistry in London within a team intent on research over the synthesis of quinine, a potent drug, discovered a process that obtained a purple dye (which he called [[mauveine]]) from [[aniline]], which in turn could be easily obtained from [[coal tar]]; over the next ten years Perkin set up the first industrial model of molecules obtained through synthesis from coal tar and his success had prompted intense research from numerous teams all over Europe on coal tar by-products, while he himself pursued such a work on top of his industrial activity.\n\nThus it came that in 1868, in turn alizarin was proved to be obtainable from [[anthracene]], in parallel by Perkin and by [[Carl Gr\u00e4be]] and [[Carl Theodore Liebermann]], both working in Germany for the BASF company; unfortunately Perkin missed the patent priority by one single day, alizarin's extraordinary properties made it become the first really mass industry-produced dye and enabled the rise of BASF to first rank in the chemistry industry world.\n\n== Discovery and industrialization of codeine==\n[[Codeine]] is probably Robiquet's most important contribution, that prevails still today with a very strong presence and impact on daily life; in effect, until the beginning of the 19th century, raw [[opium]] was used in diverse preparations known as [[laudanum]] (see [[Thomas de Quincey]]'s \"[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]\"), [[paregoric]] elixirs (a number of them, very popular in England since the beginning of the 18th century), and health or even death hazards to users from improper preparation or improper use were frequent.\n\nThe isolation of codeine by Robiquet from opium's several active components while working on refined [[morphine]] extraction processes, opened the path to the elaboration of a new generation of specific antitussive and antidiarrheal potions of much safer use, based on codeine only, which became immediately extremely popular.\n\nCodeine is nowadays by far the most widely used opiate in the world and very likely even the most commonly used drug overall according to numerous reports over the years by organizations such as the [[World Health Organization]] and its [[League of Nations]] predecessor agency and others. It is one of the most effective orally-administered opioid analgesics and has a wide safety margin. It is from 8 to 12 percent of the strength of morphine in most people; differences in metabolism can change this figure as can other medications, depending on its route of administration.\n\nWhile codeine can still be directly extracted from opium, its original source, most codeine is nowadays synthesized from [[morphine]] through the process of O-[[methylation]].\n\n== Sundry researches in pharmacology; missing by a hair's breadth the identification of the benzoyl radical in 1830 ==\nRobiquet has analysed the chemical byproducts that could be obtained from a variety of plants: asparagus, madder root, as already mentioned, with the important associated discoveries, and also others, which mostly helped in consolidating the existence of some molecules in a wide range of plants. Thus, in 1809, Robiquet extracts from [[liquorice]] root a sweetish matter which he dubs [[glycyrrhizine]], from [[Glycirrhiza]], the denomination of the genus to which belongs liquorice. He also obtained an oily fraction (0.8%), small quantities of a matter with properties of a gum, albuminic substances, [[tannin]]s, [[starch]], a yellowish dye, a fraction with bitter taste, and, as from asparagi, a fraction that can be crystallized and seemingly close to [[asparagin]], which it will be indeed proven to be in 1828 by [[Auguste-Arthur Plisson|Plisson]].<ref>http://www.ibiblio.org/herbmed/eclectic/kings/glycyrrhiza.html</ref>\n\nRobiquet likewise analysed a variety of animal tissues. Thus in 1810, he isolated from ''[[Lytta vesicatoria]]'', an insect, a molecule that he calls [[cantharidin]], which he proves is the cause of the severe irritations and blisters provoked by that insect, and is present in a variety of unrelated species that use the molecule as a protection of their eggs from predation [1] (Two families of insects belonging to the order of [[Coleoptera]] synthetise that molecule : [[Meloidae]] and [[Oedemeridae]]. The first family, to the which [[Lytta vesicatoria]] belongs in the Lytta genus, is rich of several thousands of species)\n\nIn fact, even back into the days of the early classical period civilizations of the western Mediterrean, some types of flies from Spain had a reputation for inducing aphrodisiac effects when used in preparations after having been desiccated. Cantharidin has never been proven to provide such collateral benefits, whereas Robiquet demonstrated it had very definite toxic and poisonous properties comparable in degree to that of the most violent poisons known in the 19th century, such as [[strychnine]].<ref>''Exp\u00e9riences sur les cantharides'', Robiquet, Annales de Chimie, 1810, vol. 76, pp.&nbsp;302\u2013322.</ref>\n\nThis particular study, that demonstrated, as early as in 1810, the possibility to separate, using \"energetic\" methods, a simple \"principle\" that was the actual effective fraction of a traditional natural compound obtained by \"soft\" methods has been exemplary for the burgeoning community of chemists in the early 19th century, and will prompt very rapidly a flurry of similar attempts that will yield within a few decades an incredible number of molecules from an ever growing number of research groups throughout Europe, and soon in the trail, in the US.\nIn the frame of that same investigation, Robiquet in addition evidences the presence of [[uric acid]] within insects feeding on plant tissues.\n\nOver a period of some fifteen years, Pierre Robiquet will also conduct a series of investigations on [[bitter almonds]] oil, a complex substance obtained from [[Prunus dulcis]]. In 1816, together with Jean-Jacques Colin,<ref>Recherches sur la nature de la mati\u00e8re huileuse des chimistes hollandais'', Robiquet, Colin, Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 1816, vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;337\u201345</ref> they obtain a new component which they call \"\u00e9ther hydrochlorique\", ([[1,2-Dichloroethane]]), which they will try to promote as a reinvigorating medicine.\nIn 1830, together with [[:fr:Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Boutron Charlard|Antoine Boutron-Charlard]], Robiquet obtains a new molecule which he calls [[amygdalin]]; this component presented strange properties and was actually the first [[glycoside]] ever to be evidenced.

He laid founding work in identifying [[amino acid]]s, the fundamental building blocks of [[protein]]s.  He did this through recognizing the first of them, [[asparagine]], in 1806, in the industry's adoption of industrial dyes, with the identification of [[alizarin]] in 1826, and in the emergence of modern medications, through the identification of [[codeine]] in 1832, a drug of widespread use with [[analgesic]] and antidiarrheal properties.\n\nRobiquet was born in [[Rennes]]. He was at first a pharmacist in the French armies during the [[French Revolution]] years and became a professor at the \u00c9cole de pharmacie in Paris, where he died. (For biography details refer to the French Wikipedia article)\n\nNotable scientific achievements were among other things his isolation and characterization of properties of [[asparagine]] (the first [[amino acid]] to be identified, from [[asparagus]], achieved.  In 1806, with [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]]), [[cantharidin]] (1810), the [[Sigma-1 receptor]] [[agonist]] [[noscapine]] (1817), [[caffeine]] (1821), [[alizarin]] (later on moved to mass industrial production by [[Carl Gr\u00e4be]] and [[Carl Theodore Liebermann]] in Germany, and by [[William Henry Perkin]] in Great Britain) and [[1,2,4-Trihydroxyanthraquinone|purpurin]] (1826), [[Orcin]] (1829), [[amygdalin]] (1830), as well as [[codeine]] (1832). Some of these discoveries were made in collaboration with other scientists.\n\n== Academic titles and distinctions ==\nRegistered Pharmacist (1808), lecturer in chemistry at the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] (1811), Deputy Professor in History of pharmaceutical matters (1811) then Professor (1814) then Administrator-Treasurer (1824) at the [[:fr:Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie de Paris|Ecole de Pharmacie]] now the [[:fr:Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie|Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie]] see [3], member then Secretary General (1817) and President (1826) of the [[:fr:Acad\u00e9mie nationale de pharmacie|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pharmacie]] later on known as [[:fr:Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de Pharmacie|Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de Pharmacie]] see [8], member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie de M\u00e9decine]] (1820), member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] (1833), one of the founders and first President of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00e9voyance des Pharmaciens]] see [6](1820).\n\nDistinguished with the order of the [[L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] (1830).\n\n== Discovery of [[asparagine]], the first [[amino acid]] ever identified ==\nIn the fall of 1805, Robiquet, then a young help working in the laboratory of Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, started analyses, with what rudimentary methods were then available, with asparagus juice. After a number of operations he obtained a crystallized white matter, which he and Vauquelin tried to characterize in 1806 as day by day their attempts found it to be some kind of new \"chemical principle\" with hitherto unknown properties, nothing like well known mineral salts classically obtained in the 18th century. Duly convinced this is something completely new, they call this matter \"[[asparagine|asparagin]]\", after the asparagus plant they extracted it from.\nAsparagine will turn out to be one of the 22 amino acids that build-up all living matter on earth, the first ever identified and understood as belonging to a new class of molecules.\nProgress in isolating the other amino acids will be very slow, with less than a handful in total during the whole 19th century.\n\n== Discovery of various dyes ==\nEven until the middle of 19th century, all dyes used for colouring cloth were natural substances, many of which were expensive and labour-intensive to extract. Furthermore, many lacked stability through washing or exposure to sunlight, or fastness.\n\nFor instance, the colour purple, which had been a mark of aristocracy and prestige since ancient times in Rome, the Middle East and Egypt, was especially expensive and difficult to produce\u2014the dye used, known as [[Tyrian purple]], was made from the glandular mucus of certain molluscs. Its extraction was variable and complicated, and dependent on the availability of the very specific type of shell (actually two types, now known the one as [[Bolinus brandaris]], and the other as [[Hexaplex trunculus]], nowadays classified within two different genders) from which it was extracted.\n\nAnother type of natural red dye used from times immemorial was obtained from [[Rose madder|madder]] root in Central Asia and [[Egypt]], where it was grown as early as 1500 BC. Cloth dyed with madder root pigment was found in the tomb of the [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] and in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and ancient [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]]. In the Middle Ages, [[Charlemagne]] encouraged madder cultivation. It grew well in the sandy soils of the [[Netherlands]] and became an important part of the local economy. By 1804, the English dye maker [[George Field (chemist)|George Field]] had introduced new techniques known as ''[[Lake pigment|lake]]'' madder, that extended the use of the tincture to paints.\n\nRobiquet obtained from madder root two distinct molecules with dye properties, the one producing a magnificent red, that he called [[alizarin]], which proved as well extremely stable, and another, of less stable properties, that he called [[1,2,4-Trihydroxyanthraquinone|purpurin]].\n\nSome 30 years later in April 1856, [[William Henry Perkin]], then a mere youngster working as assistant at the Royal College of Chemistry in London within a team intent on research over the synthesis of quinine, a potent drug, discovered a process that obtained a purple dye (which he called [[mauveine]]) from [[aniline]], which in turn could be easily obtained from [[coal tar]]; over the next ten years Perkin set up the first industrial model of molecules obtained through synthesis from coal tar and his success had prompted intense research from numerous teams all over Europe on coal tar by-products, while he himself pursued such a work on top of his industrial activity.\n\nThus it came that in 1868, in turn alizarin was proved to be obtainable from [[anthracene]], in parallel by Perkin and by [[Carl Gr\u00e4be]] and [[Carl Theodore Liebermann]], both working in Germany for the BASF company; unfortunately Perkin missed the patent priority by one single day, alizarin's extraordinary properties made it become the first really mass industry-produced dye and enabled the rise of BASF to first rank in the chemistry industry world.\n\n== Discovery and industrialization of codeine==\n[[Codeine]] is probably Robiquet's most important contribution, that prevails still today with a very strong presence and impact on daily life; in effect, until the beginning of the 19th century, raw [[opium]] was used in diverse preparations known as [[laudanum]] (see [[Thomas de Quincey]]'s \"[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]\"), [[paregoric]] elixirs (a number of them, very popular in England since the beginning of the 18th century), and health or even death hazards to users from improper preparation or improper use were frequent.\n\nThe isolation of codeine by Robiquet from opium's several active components while working on refined [[morphine]] extraction processes, opened the path to the elaboration of a new generation of specific antitussive and antidiarrheal potions of much safer use, based on codeine only, which became immediately extremely popular.\n\nCodeine is nowadays by far the most widely used opiate in the world and very likely even the most commonly used drug overall according to numerous reports over the years by organizations such as the [[World Health Organization]] and its [[League of Nations]] predecessor agency and others. It is one of the most effective orally-administered opioid analgesics and has a wide safety margin. It is from 8 to 12 percent of the strength of morphine in most people; differences in metabolism can change this figure as can other medications, depending on its route of administration.\n\nWhile codeine can still be directly extracted from opium, its original source, most codeine is nowadays synthesized from [[morphine]] through the process of O-[[methylation]].\n\n== Sundry researches in pharmacology; missing by a hair's breadth the identification of the benzoyl radical in 1830 ==\nRobiquet has analysed the chemical byproducts that could be obtained from a variety of plants: asparagus, madder root, as already mentioned, with the important associated discoveries, and also others, which mostly helped in consolidating the existence of some molecules in a wide range of plants. Thus, in 1809, Robiquet extracts from [[liquorice]] root a sweetish matter which he dubs [[glycyrrhizine]], from [[Glycirrhiza]], the denomination of the genus to which belongs liquorice. He also obtained an oily fraction (0.8%), small quantities of a matter with properties of a gum, albuminic substances, [[tannin]]s, [[starch]], a yellowish dye, a fraction with bitter taste, and, as from asparagi, a fraction that can be crystallized and seemingly close to [[asparagin]], which it will be indeed proven to be in 1828 by [[Auguste-Arthur Plisson|Plisson]].<ref>http://www.ibiblio.org/herbmed/eclectic/kings/glycyrrhiza.html</ref>\n\nRobiquet likewise analysed a variety of animal tissues. Thus in 1810, he isolated from ''[[Lytta vesicatoria]]'', an insect, a molecule that he calls [[cantharidin]], which he proves is the cause of the severe irritations and blisters provoked by that insect, and is present in a variety of unrelated species that use the molecule as a protection of their eggs from predation [1] (Two families of insects belonging to the order of [[Coleoptera]] synthetise that molecule : [[Meloidae]] and [[Oedemeridae]]. The first family, to the which [[Lytta vesicatoria]] belongs in the Lytta genus, is rich of several thousands of species)\n\nIn fact, even back into the days of the early classical period civilizations of the western Mediterrean, some types of flies from Spain had a reputation for inducing aphrodisiac effects when used in preparations after having been desiccated. Cantharidin has never been proven to provide such collateral benefits, whereas Robiquet demonstrated it had very definite toxic and poisonous properties comparable in degree to that of the most violent poisons known in the 19th century, such as [[strychnine]].<ref>''Exp\u00e9riences sur les cantharides'', Robiquet, Annales de Chimie, 1810, vol. 76, pp.&nbsp;302\u2013322.</ref>\n\nThis particular study, that demonstrated, as early as in 1810, the possibility to separate, using \"energetic\" methods, a simple \"principle\" that was the actual effective fraction of a traditional natural compound obtained by \"soft\" methods has been exemplary for the burgeoning community of chemists in the early 19th century, and will prompt very rapidly a flurry of similar attempts that will yield within a few decades an incredible number of molecules from an ever growing number of research groups throughout Europe, and soon in the trail, in the US.\nIn the frame of that same investigation, Robiquet in addition evidences the presence of [[uric acid]] within insects feeding on plant tissues.\n\nOver a period of some fifteen years, Pierre Robiquet will also conduct a series of investigations on [[bitter almonds]] oil, a complex substance obtained from [[Prunus dulcis]]. In 1816, together with Jean-Jacques Colin,<ref>Recherches sur la nature de la mati\u00e8re huileuse des chimistes hollandais'', Robiquet, Colin, Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 1816, vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;337\u201345</ref> they obtain a new component which they call \"\u00e9ther hydrochlorique\", ([[1,2-Dichloroethane]]), which they will try to promote as a reinvigorating medicine.\nIn 1830, together with [[:fr:Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Boutron Charlard|Antoine Boutron-Charlard]], Robiquet obtains a new molecule which he calls [[amygdalin]]; this component presented strange properties and was actually the first [[glycoside]] ever to be evidenced. This discovery was opening the door to the huge family of aromatic molecules, that are based on the cyclic 6 carbon benzenoic structure. In their various attempts at breaking down amygdalin in by-products, Robiquet and Boutron-Charlard obtained [[benzaldehyde]] but they failed in working out a proper interpretation of the structure of amygdalin that would account for it, and thus missed the identification of the [[benzoyl]] radical C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O.\nThis last step was achieved some few months later (1832) by [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] and [[Justus Liebig]], these two got somehow a bit unfairly all the credit for this breakthrough result that was opening an entirely new branch for the industry of chemicals with wide-ranging applications.\n\nAmygdalin and related molecules have been used throughout the 19th (promoted by [[Ernst T. Krebs]]) and 20th centuries as anti-cancer drugs, however with inconclusive results as to actual benefits, while it was demonstrated in 1972 in a study at the [[Sloan-Kettering]] Cancer Institute that [[amygdalin]] (often sold under the brand name of \"'''Laetrile'''\") could be toxic as it breaks down in the body to form cyanide.\n\n== Main published works ==\n* 1805 : ''Essai analytique des asperges'' Annales de chimie, 55 (1805), 152\u2013171\n* 1806 : ''La d\u00e9couverte d'un nouveau principe v\u00e9g\u00e9tal dans le suc des asperges'' L.N.Vauquelin et P.J.Robiquet, Annales de Chimie, 57, p88\u201393.\n* 1810 : ''Exp\u00e9riences sur les cantharides'', Robiquet, Annales de Chimie, 1810, vol. 76, pp.&nbsp;302\u2013322.\n* 1812 : ''Observations sur la nature du kerm\u00e8s'', Robiquet, Annales de Chimie, 81 (1812), 317\u2013331.\n* 1816 : ''Recherches sur la nature de la mati\u00e8re huileuse des chimistes hollandais'', Robiquet, Colin, Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 1816, vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;337\u201345.\n* 1817 : ''Observations sur le memoire de M.
