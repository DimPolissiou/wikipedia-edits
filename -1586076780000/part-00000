It is located in [[Kalaw Township]] which is part of [[Taunggyi District]]. \nIt lies on the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] road at an elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level. \n\nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to [[Yangon]], [[Mandalay]], [[Karen State|Kayin]] and [[Mon State|Mon]].\n\nThe single-line railway line was extended from [[Aungban|Aungpan]] to [[Shwenyaung]], in the 1920s  and [[Heho]], a small village of [[Danu people]] grew into a town. [[Heho]] was determined to be a convenient intermediate stop and transfer point.   Later an [[Heho Airport|airport]] was built, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the town.  The [[airport]] served as an airbase both for the Allies and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] and it was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].  Evidence of aircraft bunker revetments and bomb craters can still be seen on the southern end of the airfield, especially noticeable from the air.\n\n== Overview ==\n \nAs a trade hub in the region, more than half a dozen banks are being operated. As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]].\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named '''Mingalar Lake''' in '''Bahtoo Park'''. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]] and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through '''Aungpan''' is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument was completed and to be opened on March 27th, 2020. However, the opening ceremony was canceled due to the outbreak of '''Coronavirus disease 2019''' ('''COVID-19'''), an [[infectious disease]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] in the country on March 23rd, 2020 reported by MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SPORTS [https://www.mohs.gov.mm/]|.\nThe town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower at the [[Pindaya]] junction was removed as well.\nUpgrade will be finished by April 2020 and now the town gets a newer look. \nHowever, the common use of motorway for the town's own traffic and speedy expressway vehicles is likely to lead accidents unless proper traffic regulation and enforcement are practiced.\n\n== Climate ==\nAungpan has a Dry-winter humid [[subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cwa'').\n''Cwa'' is monsoonal influenced, having the classic dry winter \u2013 wet summer pattern associated with tropical monsoonal climates.\nThe weather is usually warm and temperate. When compared with winter, the summers have much more rainfall. \nThe average annual temperature in [[Aungban|Aungpan]] is 19.1 \u00b0C (66.3 \u00b0F). \nThe warmest month of the year is April, with an average temperature of 22.7 \u00b0C (72.9 \u00b0F). At 14.2 \u00b0C (57.6 \u00b0F) on average, January is the coldest month of the year.\nIn a year, the rainfall is 1654 mm (65.1 inches).\nThe difference in precipitation between the driest month and the wettest month is 290 mm (11 inches). \nThe variation in annual temperature is around 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Aungban|Aungpan]] (1982\u20132012)\n| single line  = Y\n| metric first = Y\n| width = auto\n\n| Jan low C = 6.8\n| Feb low C = 7.6\n| Mar low C = 11.9\n| Apr low C = 16.1\n| May low C = 17\n| Jun low C = 17.4\n| Jul low C = 17.4\n| Aug low C = 17.6\n| Sep low C = 17.1\n| Oct low C = 15.6\n| Nov low C = 11.7\n| Dec low C = 8.2\n| year low C = 13.7\n\n| Jan high C = 21.7\n| Feb high C = 23.3\n| Mar high C = 27.3\n| Apr high C = 29.3\n| May high C = 26.8\n| Jun high C = 24.7\n| Jul high C = 24.1\n| Aug high C = 24\n| Sep high C = 24.7\n| Oct high C = 24.3\n| Nov high C = 22.6\n| Dec high C = 20.9\n| year high C = 24.5\n\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 3\n| Feb rain mm = 5\n| Mar rain mm = 13\n| Apr rain mm = 50\n| May rain mm = 205\n| Jun rain mm = 244\n| Jul rain mm = 274\n| Aug rain mm = 293\n| Sep rain mm = 259\n| Oct rain mm = 209 \n| Nov rain mm = 84\n| Dec rain mm = 15\n| year rain mm = 137.8\n| source 1 = [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]]<ref name=\"metno\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008145507/http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | archivedate = 8 October 2018 | url = http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | title = Myanmar Climate Report | publisher = Norwegian Meteorological Institute | pages =23\u201336  | accessdate = 28 October 2018}}</ref> \n}}\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is home to:\n* Regional campus '''[[Yezin Agricultural University]] (YAU)''' \n\nEducation service centers are also getting common in the town for a decade ago.

The aim is to \"expose students to their specialized crop and do more research in order to become crop specialists\". The undergraduate students come to Aungpan branch to study and do research on maize and cereals.\nThe Seven-hundred bed military hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for Defence Service Medical Academy's house surgeons from [[Yangon]]. Therefore, several students of various age-levels can be seen in the town.\n\n== Health care ==\n\n=== Public Hospitals ===\n* Aungpan General Hospital\n* 700-bed military Hospital\n* Gayunar Yike Nyein Clinic ({{my|\u1000\u101b\u102f\u100f\u102c\u101b\u102d\u1015\u103a\u1004\u103c\u102d\u1019\u103a\u1006\u1031\u1038\u1001\u1014\u103a\u1038}})\n\n==Aungchanthar Pagoda==\n[[File:Aung Chan Thar Pagoda1.jpg|thumb|right|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n\nLocals in the town hope that an ongoing pagoda project of '''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' will change visitors\u2019 perceptions of their hometown and will become the landmark and symbol of the religion. \n'''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' is a 162-foot (48.5-meter) replica of [[Yangon]]'s [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the '''[[Myanmar]]''' calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as '''[[Inle Lake]]''' and '''[[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]]''', and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| native_name = {{my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}\n| official_name = Aungpan\n|pushpin_map = Burma\n|pushpin_map_caption = Location in Burma\n|image_skyline = Aungban.jpg\n|image_map = \n|subdivision_type = Country\n|subdivision_name = {{Flag|Myanmar}}\n|subdivision_type1 = [[Administrative divisions of Burma|State]]\n|subdivision_name1 = {{flag|Shan State}}\n|subdivision_type2 = [[Districts of Burma|Districts]]\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Taunggyi District]]\n|subdivision_type3 = Township\n|subdivision_name3 = [[Kalaw Township]]\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n|area_total_km2 = \n|population = \n|population_as_of = 2014\n\n|population_blank1            = [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Danu people|Danu]], [[Bamar]], [[Pa-O]], [[Taungyo]], [[Burmese Chinese]], [[Burmese Indians]], [[Burmese Gurkha|Gurkha]]\n|population_blank1_title     = Ethnicities\n|population_blank2 = [[Theravada Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]]\n|population_blank2_title = Religions\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_total = 30,313\n\n| map_caption                     = \n| pushpin_map                     = Myanmar#Asia\n| pushpin_label_position          = bottom\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location of Aungpan, Myanmar\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|20|40|0|N|96|38|0|E|type:town_region:MM|display=inline,title}}\n\n\n|leader_title = Mayor\n|established_date = 1913\n|established_title = Founded\n|elevation_ft = 4219\n|elevation_m =  1286\n|timezone = [[Time in Burma|MST]]\n|utc_offset               = +6.30\n|area_code                = 081\n|postal_code_type         = [[Postal code]] [http://www.myanmaposts.net.mm/]\n|postal_code              = 06022\n|registration_plate       = SHN\n|website                  =\n}}\n\n'''Aungpan''' ({{lang-my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}) is a town located in the '''Southern [[Shan State]].'''

Educated in [[Kentucky]] at the Louisville Normal School, she was in the first graduating class in the early 1870s and became a teacher, working in the public schools. After joining the Broadway Methodist Church in 1874, Watts joined a youth missionary society and founded a [[Sunday school]] class. In 1881, after applying to the Women's Board of Foreign Missions, she was accepted as the second woman from the United States to act as a foreign missionary and was the first woman to be sent to Brazil.\n\nArriving in the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1881, Watts' mission was to establish a school in [[Piracicaba]]. Within months, though she only had one student, Watts had opened the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'' and began by recruiting a French teacher, [[Marie Rennotte]], in 1882. At the time, most educational materials had been translated into French, as it was the [[universal language|universal language]] of education. The two women worked together to design an innovative [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] learning environment, which offered courses in languages, literature, mathematics, philosophy, and the natural and physical sciences. Though criticized by conservative sectors of society and the Catholic Church, Watts gained powerful supporters, including prominent progressive politicians, lawyers, [[Freemasonry|masons]], and [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]]. By the 1890s, the school method and curricula had gained wide support, the student body had grown substantially, and their methods were being implemented throughout the state.\n\nWatts remained at the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'' for 14 years and then established three other schools in the states of [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. Failing health led to her retirement in 1909 and a return to [[Louisville]], Kentucky, where she died at the end of that year. She is remembered in Brazil as the pioneer in bringing [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Methodist]] education to the country.  An annex of the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'' is named in her honor, as is the cultural center of Piracicaba, one of several facilities which bear her name or pay homage to her role in the development of a modern educational system.\n\n==Early life==\nMartha Hite Watts was born on February 13, 1848 in [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], Kentucky, to Elizabeth Curtis/Curtiss (n\u00e9e Pixley/Paxley){{sfn|''The Courier-Journal''|1909|p=2}}{{sfn|John|1899|p=19}}{{sfn|Pixley|Hanford|1900|p=38}} and Elijah Searcy Watts. The ninth of 12 children, she received her early education from her older siblings. Around the age of nine, she enrolled in the Bardstown Female Institute of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|''The Courier-Journal''|1909|p=2}}{{sfn|John|1899|p=19}} Her father was a well-known attorney and soon moved the family to [[Louisville]],{{sfn|''The Courier-Journal''|1909|p=2}} where Watts became engaged. Her fianc\u00e9 was killed in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]{{sfn|Sarat De Oliveira|2007|p=7}} and when the war ended she continued her studies at the Louisville Normal School.{{sfn|''The Courier-Journal''|1909|p=2}} The school opened in 1871{{sfn|Fridell|2001|p=658}} and Watts was in the first graduating class.{{sfn|''The Courier-Journal''|1909|p=2}}\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nWatts immediately began teaching in the public school system.{{sfn|''The Courier-Journal''|1909|p=2}} In 1874, she joined the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Methodist Church]] in Louisville and began regularly attending [[Sunday school]].{{sfn|John|1899|p=20}} By 1877, she had established a youth missionary society at the Broadway Methodist Church.{{sfn|Howell|1928|pp=54\u201355}} When asked by Mary Helm if she would be interested in [[missionary]] work in Brazil, Watts submitted an application to the Women's Board of Foreign Missions and was accepted in 1881,{{sfn|John|1899|p=20}} becoming the first woman to be sent to Brazil by the Women's Board{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=31}} and the second woman, after Lochie Rankin, who served in China from 1878, to be employed by the Women's Board.{{sfn|Howell|1928|p=68}} In May 1881, Watts arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in the company of James L. Kennedy, James W. Koger and his wife Frances (n\u00e9e Smith), and John James Ransom.{{sfn|John|1899|p=20}}{{sfn|Cachioni|1997|p=60}} Her mission was to establish a school in [[Piracicaba]] in the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]].{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=41}} While Koger and his wife were to found a church there, Kennedy and Ransom were to establish a church in Rio de Janeiro.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=44}} By July, Watts had founded a Sunday school{{sfn|Cachioni|1997|p=60}}{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|p=25}} and the church was organized by September 11.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=44}} Founding the school proved more difficult as Watts, who was not fluent in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], had to convince her neighbors to send their children to school. She also struggled to find a suitable property to rent.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=45}}\n\n===''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano''===\nOn September 13, 1881, Watts opened the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'', having rented a space capable of serving 18 students. Only one pupil, Maria Escobar, was in attendance,{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=46}}{{sfn|Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano|2016}} as parents were reluctant to move their children in the last quarter of the year. She was criticized for her haste in trying to open the school so quickly with three teachers for the sole student,{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=48}} but pressure to succeed when two previous attempts to establish a Methodist mission school had failed, caused Watts to forge ahead.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=49}} Watts did not speak French and neither teacher Mary Newman, nor Francis Joseph Christopher Schneider, who taught Portuguese, were prepared to teach classes in the French language,{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|pp=41, 53, 55, 57}} considered the [[universal language]] at that time. For students to study the classics in Brazil, they had to use French translations. This made securing a teacher who spoke French essential for the success of the school.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=51}} Watts and Rev. Ransom, wrote several letters to the Women's Board asking them to secure an American teacher who spoke French, without success.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|pp=51, 55-56}} On February 23, 1882, Ransom reported to the Board that he had found a \"French woman\" with teaching degrees who had accepted an offer of employment. Though the school term had already begun with 13 students,{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|pp=56-57}} [[Marie Rennotte]], a Belgian teacher, did not join the staff until early March.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=59}}\n\n[[File:Marie renotte.jpeg|thumb|[[Marie Rennotte]], circa 1892]]\nRennotte and Watts worked together to establish the educational vision of the school. Primarily Watts administrated the institution and Rennotte directed creation of the curricula and enhancing the reputation of the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'',{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|pp=73\u201375, 84}} becoming its spokeswoman owing to Watts' limited ability with Portuguese.{{sfn|De Luca|Assis De Luca|2003|p=706}}{{sfn|Belgian Club of Brazil|2018}} Watts' approach to education was founded on Methodist ideology, which promoted a separation of church and state, individual and religious freedom, exploration of science and technology and democratic reforms aimed at producing faithful Christian servants to the nation.{{sfn|Sarat De Oliveira|2007|pp=5\u20136}} Rennotte's method was based upon the European philosophy and pedagogical theories of scholars like [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Fr\u00f6bel]] and [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]].{{sfn|De Luca|Assis De Luca|2003|p=706}}{{sfn|Mott|2005|p=46}} Together, they sought to implement innovative principles for [[women's education]].

Educated in [[Kentucky]] at the Louisville Normal School, she was in the first graduating class in the early 1870s and became a teacher, working in the public schools. After joining the Broadway Methodist Church in 1874, Watts joined a youth missionary society and founded a [[Sunday school]] class. In 1881, after applying to the Women's Board of Foreign Missions, she was accepted as the second woman from the United States to act as a foreign missionary and was the first woman to be sent to Brazil.\n\nArriving in the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1881, Watts' mission was to establish a school in [[Piracicaba]]. Within months, though she only had one student, Watts had opened the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'' and began by recruiting a French teacher, [[Marie Rennotte]], in 1882. At the time, most educational materials had been translated into French, as it was the [[universal language|universal language]] of education. The two women worked together to design an innovative [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] learning environment, which offered courses in languages, literature, mathematics, philosophy, and the natural and physical sciences. Though criticized by conservative sectors of society and the Catholic Church, Watts gained powerful supporters, including prominent progressive politicians, lawyers, [[Freemasonry|masons]], and [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]]. By the 1890s, the school method and curricula had gained wide support, the student body had grown substantially, and their methods were being implemented throughout the state.\n\nWatts remained at the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'' for 14 years and then established three other schools in the states of [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. Failing health led to her retirement in 1909 and a return to [[Louisville]], Kentucky, where she died at the end of that year. She is remembered in Brazil as the pioneer in bringing [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Methodist]] education to the country.  An annex of the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'' is named in her honor, as is the cultural center of Piracicaba, one of several facilities which bear her name or pay homage to her role in the development of a modern educational system.\n\n==Early life==\nMartha Hite Watts was born on February 13, 1848 in [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], Kentucky, to Elizabeth Curtis/Curtiss (n\u00e9e Pixley/Paxley){{sfn|''The Courier-Journal''|1909|p=2}}{{sfn|John|1899|p=19}}{{sfn|Pixley|Hanford|1900|p=38}} and Elijah Searcy Watts.

Koger and his wife Frances (n\u00e9e Smith), and John James Ransom.{{sfn|John|1899|p=20}}{{sfn|Cachioni|1997|p=60}} Her mission was to establish a school in [[Piracicaba]] in the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]].{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=41}} While Koger and his wife were to found a church there, Kennedy and Ransom were to establish a church in Rio de Janeiro.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=44}} By July, Watts had founded a Sunday school{{sfn|Cachioni|1997|p=60}}{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|p=25}} and the church was organized by September 11.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=44}} Founding the school proved more difficult as Watts, who was not fluent in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], had to convince her neighbors to send their children to school. She also struggled to find a suitable property to rent.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=45}}\n\n===''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano''===\nOn September 13, 1881, Watts opened the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'', having rented a space capable of serving 18 students. Only one pupil, Maria Escobar, was in attendance,{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=46}}{{sfn|Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano|2016}} as parents were reluctant to move their children in the last quarter of the year. She was criticized for her haste in trying to open the school so quickly with three teachers for the sole student,{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=48}} but pressure to succeed when two previous attempts to establish a Methodist mission school had failed, caused Watts to forge ahead.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=49}} Watts did not speak French and neither teacher Mary Newman, nor Francis Joseph Christopher Schneider, who taught Portuguese, were prepared to teach classes in the French language,{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|pp=41, 53, 55, 57}} considered the [[universal language]] at that time. For students to study the classics in Brazil, they had to use French translations. This made securing a teacher who spoke French essential for the success of the school.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=51}} Watts and Rev. Ransom, wrote several letters to the Women's Board asking them to secure an American teacher who spoke French, without success.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|pp=51, 55-56}} On February 23, 1882, Ransom reported to the Board that he had found a \"French woman\" with teaching degrees who had accepted an offer of employment. Though the school term had already begun with 13 students,{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|pp=56-57}} [[Marie Rennotte]], a Belgian teacher, did not join the staff until early March.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|p=59}}\n\n[[File:Marie renotte.jpeg|thumb|[[Marie Rennotte]], circa 1892]]\nRennotte and Watts worked together to establish the educational vision of the school.

In her absence, the school was run by Mary Bruce,{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|p=323}} as Rennotte was also abroad gathering textbooks and class materials in Europe.{{sfn|Mott|2005|p=46}} Seizing the opportunity, in 1887 the Literary Inspector of Education, Ab\u00edlio Vianna, filed a report that the school's co-education and its failure to instruct on the Catholic religion were in violation of the Education Laws of 1851 and 1869, and demanded that boys over age 10 be removed from admittance and that a teacher be hired for Catholic instruction.{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|p=323}} Reaction was swift, with prominent local newspapers and the press in Rio de Janeiro, publishing denouncements of the inspector's actions.{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|pp=323\u2013324}} When Bruce was suppoenaed, she responded that she would not comply and would not reject students on the basis of their religion or sex.{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|p=324}} In the end, the state legislature called for Vianna's resignation, allowing the school to continue with their programs.{{sfn|Costa Ramires|2009|pp=80\u201381}}{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|p=325}} Watts returned after her year at home and resumed her post directing the school.{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|p=325}}\n\n$===Other schools in Brazil===\n[[File:Col\u00e9gio Izabela Hendrix circa 1928.png|thumb|Col\u00e9gio Izabela Hendrix, circa 1928]]\nAfter 14 years at the ''Col\u00e9gio Piracicabano'', in 1895, Watts was transferred to [[Petr\u00f3polis]] with instructions to build a new boarding school there.{{sfn|Mesquita|2002|p=104}} In effect, it meant starting her career over, building  the ''Col\u00e9gio Americano'' (American College) from scratch.{{sfn|Mesquita|2002|p=104}}{{sfn|Dawsey|Dawsey|1998|p=130}}{{sfn|Moura da Silva|2012|p=5}} The girls' [[boarding school]] began with three students and rapidly the enrollment expanded to 50{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|p=338}} from some of the most prominent families in the area.{{sfn|Dawsey|Dawsey|1998|p=130}} As the school was somewhat remote and in the mountains, it gave relief from the heat and epidemics that often occurred in Rio de Janeiro at the time, allowing diplomats and officials in the nearby capital to send their daughters there for safety.{{sfn|Kennedy|1928|p=338}} \n\nWatts remained at the school until 1900 and the following year took her pentennial leave, returning to the United States.{{sfn|Moura da Silva|2012|pp=5, 14}} Back in Brazil in 1902, she was assigned to ''Col\u00e9gio Mineiro'' (Miner's College) in [[Juiz de Fora]].{{sfn|Moura da Silva|2012|p=5}}{{sfn|Pfromm Netto|2013}} She remained at the temporary location for two years while a building was secured for a new Methodist school in [[Belo Horizonte]].{{sfn|Moura da Silva|2012|p=5}}{{sfn|Pfromm Netto|2013}} In 1904, she inaugurated the ''{{ill|Izabela Hendrix Methodist Institute|lt=Col\u00e9gio Izabela Hendrix|pt|Instituto Metodista Izabela Hendrix}}'' (Izabela Hendrix College) in the capital city of [[Minas Gerais]] with five students, but had over 60 enroll for the following year.

It was established on 1 July 1997, upon the establishment of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]], replacing the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as the highest judicial institution under Hong Kong law. As defined in the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]], the Court of Final Appeal is constitutionally allowed to exercise its judicial powers free from interference. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Rules set out the functions and procedures of the court.\n\nThe Court of Final Appeal has no [[original jurisdiction]]; an appeal has to originate from the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] (either from the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] or the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]]). Whether an appeal is allowed or not is determined by a panel of three Hong Kong judges, usually the Chief Justice and two other permanent judges. Should the Chief Justice or a permanent judge no be available, the other permanent judge or a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong may be called in. Non-permanent judges from other jurisdictions do not sit on such panels. \n\nAll appeal cases are heard by a bench of five judges consisting of the Chief Justice, three permanent judges and a non-permanent judge from another common law jurisdiction. If the Chief Justice does not sit in an appeal, a permanent judge is designated to sit in the Chief Justice's place, and a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong will sit on the court as well. Similarly, if a permanent judge is unable to sit, a non-permanent Hong Kong judge will sit in place of that permanent judge. Technically, should a non-permanent judge from outside Hong Kong be unable to attend due to extraordinary circumstances, two non-permanent Hong Kong judges may sit on the court.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Role of the Court ==\nFrom the 1840s to 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was a [[British Overseas Territory|British Dependent Territory]], and the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong was vested in the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. The [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|power to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong]] was transferred from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. Based on the [[one country, two systems]] principle, Hong Kong retains its a high degree of autonomy and maintains its own legal system. The Court of Final Appeal was established on 1 July 1997 in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong. Since then, it has served as the [[court of last resort]], thus administering the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong.\n\nUnder the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], the constitutional document of Hong Kong, the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] remains a [[common law]] jurisdiction. Judges from other common law jurisdictions can be recruited and serve in the judiciary as non-permanent judges according to Article 92 of the Basic Law. Judges appointed pursuant to Article 92 have served in the judiciaries of [[England and Wales]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Canada]].\n\nThe court has the power of final adjudication with respect to the law of Hong Kong as well as the power of final interpretation over local laws including the power to strike down local ordinances on the grounds of inconsistency with the Basic Law.<ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016060146/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf|date=16 October 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204031554/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf|date=4 December 2013}}</ref> \n\n== Article 158 Interpretation Controversy ==\nThe controversial power of final interpretation of national law including the Basic Law is vested in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China]] (NPCSC) by virtue of Article 158 of the Basic Law and by the Constitution of the PRC, however national laws which are not explicitly listed in Annex III of the Basic Law are not operative in Hong Kong.\n\nArticle 158 delegates such power to the courts of Hong Kong for interpretation while handling court cases. Although this arrangement has attracted criticism of \"undermining judicial independence\", an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect any court judgments already rendered. This practice is highly controversial as it contradicts the power of final adjudication; the first time an interpretation occurred in 1999, all five judges (including the Chief Justice, all three permanent justices and one non-permanent justice) involved in the case considered quitting the top court in protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/978391/all-citys-top-judges-considered-quitting|title=All city's top judges 'considered quitting'|last=|first=|date=|website=SCMP|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nInstances of Article 158 interpretations are as follows: \n\n* 1999: [[Right of abode in Hong Kong]]\n* 2004: Election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong\n* 2005: [[2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election]]\n* 2012: State immunity and the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts\n* 2016: [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]]\n\n== Building ==\nFrom its inception in July 1997 until September 2015, the court was located in the [[Former French Mission Building]], in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr95-96/english/fc/pwsc/papers/pw081158.htm |title = Finance Committee \u2013 Public Works Subcommittee (Papers) 8 Nov 95 |publisher = Government of Hong Kong |accessdate = 20 June 2015}}</ref> In September 2015 the court relocated to the former (until 2011) [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], which was originally the colonial [[Supreme Court (Hong Kong)|Supreme Court]] (1912\u20131985).\n\n* [[Former French Mission Building]] (1 July 1997 \u2013 6 September 2015)\n* [[Court of Final Appeal Building]] (7 September 2015 \u2013 Present)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Court of Final Appeal (HK).jpg|The Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong was housed in the [[Former French Mission Building]] until September 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal.jpg|Entrance of the [[Former French Mission Building]]\nFile:Legislative Council Building HK.jpg|The Court of Final Appeal building seen from [[Chater Road]] before its renovation\nFile:Legislative Council building.JPG|The Court of Final Appeal is currently housed in 8 Jackson Road, former home of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]], since 7 Sept 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal at night.jpg|Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal building at night from Prince's Building\nFile:Court of Final Appeal plaque.jpg|Plaque beside the entrance of the Court of Final Appeal\n</gallery>\n\n== List of Permanent Judges ==\n===[[Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal|Chief Justices]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!No.\n!Name\n!Chinese name\n!Took office\n!Left office \n!Tenure length\n!Silk\n|-\n|1\n|[[Andrew Li|Andrew Li Kwok-nang]], <small>GBM</small><br><small>(Born {{dts|format=dmy|12 December 1948}};

[[supreme court|final appellate court]] of Hong Kong. It was established on 1 July 1997, upon the establishment of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]], replacing the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as the highest judicial institution under Hong Kong law. As defined in the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]], the Court of Final Appeal is constitutionally allowed to exercise its judicial powers free from interference. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Rules set out the functions and procedures of the court.\n\nThe Court of Final Appeal has no [[original jurisdiction]]; an appeal has to originate from the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] (either from the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] or the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]]). Whether an appeal is allowed or not is determined by a panel of three Hong Kong judges, usually the Chief Justice and two other permanent judges. Should the Chief Justice or a permanent judge no be available, the other permanent judge or a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong may be called in. Non-permanent judges from other jurisdictions do not sit on such panels. \n\nAll appeal cases are heard by a bench of five judges consisting of the Chief Justice, three permanent judges and a non-permanent judge from another common law jurisdiction. If the Chief Justice does not sit in an appeal, a permanent judge is designated to sit in the Chief Justice's place, and a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong will sit on the court as well. Similarly, if a permanent judge is unable to sit, a non-permanent Hong Kong judge will sit in place of that permanent judge. Technically, should a non-permanent judge from outside Hong Kong be unable to attend due to extraordinary circumstances, two non-permanent Hong Kong judges may sit on the court.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Role of the Court ==\nFrom the 1840s to 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was a [[British Overseas Territory|British Dependent Territory]], and the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong was vested in the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. The [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|power to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong]] was transferred from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. Based on the [[one country, two systems]] principle, Hong Kong retains its a high degree of autonomy and maintains its own legal system. The Court of Final Appeal was established on 1 July 1997 in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong. Since then, it has served as the [[court of last resort]], thus administering the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong.\n\nUnder the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], the constitutional document of Hong Kong, the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] remains a [[common law]] jurisdiction. Judges from other common law jurisdictions can be recruited and serve in the judiciary as non-permanent judges according to Article 92 of the Basic Law. Judges appointed pursuant to Article 92 have served in the judiciaries of [[England and Wales]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Canada]].\n\nThe court has the power of final adjudication with respect to the law of Hong Kong as well as the power of final interpretation over local laws including the power to strike down local ordinances on the grounds of inconsistency with the Basic Law.<ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016060146/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf|date=16 October 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204031554/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf|date=4 December 2013}}</ref> \n\n== Article 158 Interpretation Controversy ==\nThe controversial power of final interpretation of national law including the Basic Law is vested in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China]] (NPCSC) by virtue of Article 158 of the Basic Law and by the Constitution of the PRC, however national laws which are not explicitly listed in Annex III of the Basic Law are not operative in Hong Kong.\n\nArticle 158 delegates such power to the courts of Hong Kong for interpretation while handling court cases. Although this arrangement has attracted criticism of \"undermining judicial independence\", an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect any court judgments already rendered. This practice is highly controversial as it contradicts the power of final adjudication; the first time an interpretation occurred in 1999, all five judges (including the Chief Justice, all three permanent justices and one non-permanent justice) involved in the case considered quitting the top court in protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/978391/all-citys-top-judges-considered-quitting|title=All city's top judges 'considered quitting'|last=|first=|date=|website=SCMP|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nInstances of Article 158 interpretations are as follows: \n\n* 1999: [[Right of abode in Hong Kong]]\n* 2004: Election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong\n* 2005: [[2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election]]\n* 2012: State immunity and the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts\n* 2016: [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]]\n\n== Building ==\nFrom its inception in July 1997 until September 2015, the court was located in the [[Former French Mission Building]], in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr95-96/english/fc/pwsc/papers/pw081158.htm |title = Finance Committee \u2013 Public Works Subcommittee (Papers) 8 Nov 95 |publisher = Government of Hong Kong |accessdate = 20 June 2015}}</ref> In September 2015 the court relocated to the former (until 2011) [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], which was originally the colonial [[Supreme Court (Hong Kong)|Supreme Court]] (1912\u20131985).\n\n* [[Former French Mission Building]] (1 July 1997 \u2013 6 September 2015)\n* [[Court of Final Appeal Building]] (7 September 2015 \u2013 Present)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Court of Final Appeal (HK).jpg|The Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong was housed in the [[Former French Mission Building]] until September 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal.jpg|Entrance of the [[Former French Mission Building]]\nFile:Legislative Council Building HK.jpg|The Court of Final Appeal building seen from [[Chater Road]] before its renovation\nFile:Legislative Council building.JPG|The Court of Final Appeal is currently housed in 8 Jackson Road, former home of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]], since 7 Sept 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal at night.jpg|Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal building at night from Prince's Building\nFile:Court of Final Appeal plaque.jpg|Plaque beside the entrance of the Court of Final Appeal\n</gallery>\n\n== List of Permanent Judges ==\n===[[Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal|Chief Justices]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!No.\n!Name\n!Chinese name\n!Took office\n!Left office \n!Tenure length\n!Silk\n|-\n|1\n|[[Andrew Li|Andrew Li Kwok-nang]], <small>GBM</small><br><small>(Born {{dts|format=dmy|12 December 1948}};

Waveguide over copper runs at millimeter frequencies (about 30 GHz to 1 THz) and is synergistic with 5G/6G wireless. A type of vectoring is applied to effective separate the many modes that can propagate within a telephone cable. Preliminary analyses project that waveguide over copper should support about the following per-home data rates:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Distance\n!

The fiber is almost pure [[cellulose]]. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.\n\nThe plant is a [[shrub]] native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India.

This aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several Germanic languages, such as German ''[[wikt:Baumwolle|Baumwolle]]'', which translates as \"tree wool\" (''Baum'' means \"tree\"; ''Wolle'' means \"wool\"). Noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep. [[John Mandeville]], writing in 1350, stated as fact that \"There grew there [India] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches.

Initially imported as a novelty side line, from its spice trading posts in Asia, the cheap colourful cloth proved popular and overtook the EIC's spice trade by value in the late 17th century. The EIC embraced the demand, particularly for [[Calico (textile)|calico]], by expanding its factories in Asia and producing and importing cloth in bulk, creating competition for domestic woollen and linen textile producers. The impacted weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers objected and the calico question became one of the major issues of National politics between the 1680s and the 1730s. Parliament began to see a decline in domestic textile sales, and an increase in imported textiles from places like [[China]] and [[India]]. Seeing the East India Company and their textile importation as a threat to domestic textile businesses, Parliament passed the 1700 Calico Act, blocking the importation of cotton cloth. As there was no punishment for continuing to sell cotton cloth, smuggling of the popular material became commonplace. In 1721, dissatisfied with the results of the first act, Parliament passed a stricter addition, this time prohibiting the sale of most cottons, imported and domestic (exempting only thread [[Fustian]] and raw cotton). The exemption of raw cotton from the prohibition initially saw 2 thousand bales of cotton imported annually, to become the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing [[Fustian]] for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new [[cotton mill]]s, which slowly expanded till by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they could easily compete with anything the EIC could import.\n\nThe acts were repealed in 1774, triggering a wave of investment in mill based cotton spinning and production, doubling the demand for raw cotton within a couple of years, and doubling it again every decade, into the 1840s<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Bishnupriya|title=COTTON TEXTILES AND THE GREAT DIVERGENCE: LANCASHIRE, INDIA AND SHIFTING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910075425/http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|archivedate=10 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIndian cotton textiles, particularly those from [[Bengal Subah|Bengal]], continued to maintain a competitive advantage up until the 19th century.

In 1738, [[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]], of [[Birmingham]], England, patented the roller spinning machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the [[James Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]] in 1764, [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[spinning frame]] in 1769 and [[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[spinning mule]] in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of [[Manchester]] acquired the nickname ''\"[[Cottonopolis]]\"'' due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade.\n\nProduction capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the modern [[cotton gin]] by the American [[Eli Whitney]] in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor,<ref name=r1>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hughs | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Valco | first2 = T. D. | first3 = J.

The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from [[Henry Odgen Holmes]], for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796.<ref name=r1/> Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from [[British Empire|colonial]] [[plantations]], processed into cotton cloth in the mills of [[Lancashire]], and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in [[British West Africa|West Africa]], [[British Raj|India]], and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).\n\nBy the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated Native American species, ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]'' and ''[[Gossypium barbadense]]''), encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from [[Plantations in the American South|plantations in the United States]] and [[plantations]] in the [[Caribbean]]. By the mid-19th century, \"[[King Cotton]]\" had become the backbone of the [[antebellum South|southern American]] economy. In the United States, cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], American cotton exports slumped due to a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[blockade]] on [[Confederate States of America|Southern]] [[port]]s, and also because of a strategic decision by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government to cut exports, hoping to force Britain to recognize the Confederacy or enter the war. This prompted the main purchasers of cotton, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]], to turn to [[Egypt]]ian cotton. British and French traders invested heavily in cotton plantations. The Egyptian government of [[Isma'il Pasha|Viceroy Isma'il]] took out substantial loans from European bankers and stock exchanges. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned [[Egyptian cotton]] and returned to cheap American exports,{{citation needed|reason=I've seen this the other way round with the South suffering because British interests in Egypt persisted and they liked the product better|date=September 2012}} sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring [[bankruptcy]] in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt's [[History of Egypt under the British|occupation by the British Empire in 1882]].\n\nDuring this time, cotton cultivation in the [[British Empire]], especially Australia and India, greatly increased to replace the lost production of the American South. Through tariffs and other restrictions, the British government discouraged the production of cotton cloth in India; rather, the raw fiber was sent to England for processing. The Indian [[Gandhi, Mohandas K.|Mahatma Gandhi]] described the process:\n\n#English people buy Indian cotton in the field, picked by Indian labor at seven cents a day, through an optional monopoly.\n#This cotton is shipped on British ships, a three-week journey across the Indian Ocean, down the Red Sea, across the Mediterranean, through Gibraltar, across the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic Ocean to London. One hundred per cent profit on this freight is regarded as small.\n#The cotton is turned into cloth in Lancashire. You pay shilling wages instead of Indian pennies to your workers. The English worker not only has the advantage of better wages, but the steel companies of England get the profit of building the factories and machines. Wages; profits; all these are spent in England.\n#The finished product is sent back to India at European shipping rates, once again on British ships. The captains, officers, sailors of these ships, whose wages must be paid, are English. The only Indians who profit are a few lascars who do the dirty work on the boats for a few cents a day.\n#The cloth is finally sold back to the kings and landlords of India who got the money to buy this expensive cloth out of the poor peasants of India who worked at seven cents a day.<ref>(Fisher 1932 pp 154\u2013156)</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Cotton production in the United States|Black Belt in the American South}}\nIn the United States, Southern cotton provided capital for the Wealth of the antebellum South, as well as raw material for Northern textile industries. Before 1865 the cotton was largely produced through the labor of enslaved African Americans. It enriched both the Southern landowners and the new textile industries of the Northeastern United States and northwestern Europe.  In 1860 the slogan \"[[King Cotton|Cotton is king]]\" characterized the fallacious attitude of Southern nationalists toward this [[monocrop]] in that Europe would support an independent [[Confederate states of America|Confederate States of America]] in 1861 in order to protect the supply of cotton and needed for its very large textile industry.<ref>Frank Lawrence Owsley, \"The Confederacy and King Cotton: A Study in Economic Coercion,\" ''North Carolina Historical Review'' 6#4 (1929), pp.&nbsp;371\u2013397 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23514836 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCotton remained a key crop in the Southern economy after slavery ended in 1865. Across the South, [[sharecropping]] evolved, in which landless farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves. Until mechanical [[cotton picker]]s were developed, cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton. Picking cotton was a source of income for families across the South. Rural and small town school systems had split vacations so children could work in the fields during \"cotton-picking.\"<ref>Rupert B.

In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are [[lepidoptera]]n larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed [[pyrethroid]] resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.\n\nBut Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests, however, such as [[plant bug]]s, [[Halyomorpha halys|stink bugs]], and [[aphid]]s; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Cornell University|date=25 July 2006|title=Seven-year glitch: Cornell warns that Chinese GM cotton farmers are losing money due to 'secondary' pests|author=Lang, Susan|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012044920/http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html|archivedate=12 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Lin | first2 = H. | last3 = Huang | first3 = J. | last4 = Hu | first4 = R. | last5 = Rozelle | first5 = S. | last6 = Pray | first6 = C. | doi = 10.1016/S1671-2927(09)60012-2 | title = Bt Cotton in China: Are Secondary Insect Infestations Offsetting the Benefits in Farmer Fields? | journal = Agricultural Sciences in China | volume = 8 | pages = 83\u201390 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm.

These are popular for baby clothes and [[diapers]]. Under most definitions, organic products do not use [[genetic engineering]]. All natural cotton products are known to be both sustainable and hypoallergenic.\n\nHistorically, in North America, one of the most economically destructive pests in cotton production has been the [[boll weevil]]. Due to the [[US Department of Agriculture]]'s highly successful [[Boll Weevil Eradication Program]] (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt]] cotton (which contains a [[bacteria]]l gene that codes for a plant-produced [[protein]] that is toxic to a number of pests such as [[cotton bollworm (American)|cotton bollworm]] and [[pink bollworm]]), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.\n\nOther significant global pests of cotton include the pink bollworm, ''[[Pectinophora gossypiella]]''; the chili thrips, ''[[Scirtothrips dorsalis]]''; the cotton seed bug, ''[[Oxycarenus hyalinipennis]]''; the tarnish plant bug, ''[[Lygus lineolaris]]''; and the fall armyworm, ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda]]'', ''[[Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum]]''.\n\n==Harvesting==\n[[File:Baumwoll-Erntemaschine.jpeg|thumb|Offloading freshly harvested cotton into a module builder in [[Texas]]; previously built modules can be seen in the background]]\n[[File:Cotton picking in India.jpg|thumb|Cotton being picked by hand in [[India]], 2005.]]\n\nMost cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is harvested mechanically, either by a [[cotton picker]], a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical [[defoliant]] or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.\n\nCotton continues to be picked by hand in [[developing country|developing countries]].<ref>[[Craig Murray|Murray, Craig]] (2006).

Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. [[Cellulose acetate|Acetate]] in fiber form was developed in 1924. [[Nylon]], the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]] in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's [[hosiery]] from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of [[polyester]] into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat.<ref>[http://www.teonline.com/fiber-history.html Fiber History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917085422/http://www.teonline.com/fiber-history.html |date=17 September 2008 }}.

Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including [[rayon]] and [[synthetic fiber]]s such as [[polyester]]. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with [[linen]] producing fabrics with the benefits of both materials. Linen-cotton blends are wrinkle resistant and retain heat more effectively than only linen, and are thinner, stronger and lighter than only cotton.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reference.com/home-garden/difference-between-cotton-linen-40242bc2265acaef |title=What is the difference between cotton and linen? |accessdate=September 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073804/https://www.reference.com/home-garden/difference-between-cotton-linen-40242bc2265acaef |archivedate=17 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the [[textile industry]], cotton is used in [[fishing net]]s, [[coffee filter]]s, [[tent]]s, explosives manufacture (see [[nitrocellulose]]), [[cotton paper]], and in [[bookbinding]].

This type of thread was first made in the city of Lisle, France (now [[Lille]]), hence its name.<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lisle Lisle Definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915000508/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lisle |date=15 September 2015 }} Retrieved 3 September 2015</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/completedictiona00coleiala |page=[https://archive.org/details/completedictiona00coleiala/page/244 244] |accessdate=3 September 2015 |title=A Complete Dictionary of Dry Goods and History of Silk, Cotton, Linen, Wool and Other Fibrous Substances: Including a Full Explanation of the Modern Processes of Spinning, Dyeing and Weaving, with an Appendix Containing a Treatise on Window Trimming, German Words and Phrases, with Their English Pronunciation and Signification, Together with Various Useful Tables |publisher=W.

The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1 billion. The total international trade is estimated to be $12 billion. Africa's share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders. Dunavant Enterprises, based in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], is the leading cotton broker in Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates [[cotton gin]]s in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods. [[Cargill]] also purchases cotton in Africa for export.\n\nThe 25,000 cotton growers in the United States are heavily [[subsidy|subsidized]] at the rate of $2 billion per year although China now provides the highest overall level of cotton sector support.<ref>[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Cotton/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-Cotton-sector \"Executive Brief Update 2013: Cotton sector\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224045221/http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Cotton/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-Cotton-sector |date=24 February 2014 }}. ''cta.int''.</ref> The future of these subsidies is uncertain and has led to anticipatory expansion of cotton brokers' operations in Africa. Dunavant expanded in Africa by buying out local operations. This is only possible in former British colonies and Mozambique; former French colonies continue to maintain tight monopolies, inherited from their former colonialist masters, on cotton purchases at low fixed prices.<ref>Zachary, G.

The consortium agreed to first sequence the D-genome wild relative of cultivated cotton (''G. raimondii'', a Central American species) because it is small and has few repetitive elements. It has nearly one-third of the bases of tetraploid cotton, and each chromosome occurs only once.{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} Then, the A genome of ''G. arboreum'' would be sequenced. Its genome is roughly twice that of ''G. raimondii''. Part of the difference in size is due the amplification of ''retrotransposons'' (GORGE). After both diploid genomes are assembled, they would be used as models for sequencing the genomes of tetraploid cultivated species. Without knowing the diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of AD genomes would co-assemble, and their repetitive elements would assemble independently into A and D sequences respectively. There would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.\n\nThe public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, the companies [[Monsanto]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of ''G. raimondii'' about 50x.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Monsanto and Illumina Reach Key Milestone in Cotton Genome Sequencing|url = http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|website = www.monsanto.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|last = APPDMZ\\gyoung|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042838/http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|archivedate = 1 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref> They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome.

The fiber is almost pure [[cellulose]]. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.\n\nThe plant is a [[shrub]] native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080625045134/http://www.ogtr.gov.au/pdf/ir/biologycotton08.pdf The Biology of ''Gossypium hirsutum'' L. and ''Gossypium barbadense'' L.

The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BC have been found in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], as well as fabric remnants dated back to 6000 BC in [[Peru]].\nAlthough cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the [[cotton gin]] that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used [[natural fiber]] cloth in clothing today.\n\nCurrent estimates for world production are about 25 million [[tonne]]s or 110 million bales annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world's arable land. India is the world's largest producer of cotton. The United States has been the largest exporter for many years.<ref>[http://www.naturalfibres2009.org/en/fibres/cotton.html \"Natural fibres: Cotton\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903094603/http://www.naturalfibres2009.org/en/fibres/cotton.html |date=3 September 2011 }}, International Year of Natural Fibres</ref> In the United States, cotton is usually measured in bales, which measure approximately {{convert|0.48|m3|ft3|abbr=off|sp=us}} and weigh {{convert|226.8|kg|lb|abbr=off}}.<ref>National Cotton Council of America, \"[http://www.cotton.org/tech/bale/bale-description.cfm U.S. Cotton Bale Dimensions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006041034/http://www.cotton.org/tech/bale/bale-description.cfm |date=6 October 2013 }}\" (accessed 5 October 2013).</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThere are four commercially grown species of cotton, all domesticated in antiquity:\n*''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]''&nbsp;\u2013 upland cotton, native to [[Central America]], Mexico, the Caribbean and southern Florida (90% of world production)\n*''[[Gossypium barbadense]]''&nbsp;\u2013 known as extra-long staple cotton, native to tropical South America (8% of world production)\n*''[[Gossypium arboreum]]''&nbsp;\u2013 tree cotton, native to India and Pakistan (less than 2%)\n*''[[Gossypium herbaceum]]''&nbsp;\u2013 Levant cotton, native to southern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (less than 2%)\n\nThe two New World cotton species account for the vast majority of modern cotton production, but the two Old World species were widely used before the 1900s.

Noting its similarities to wool, people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep.

Initially imported as a novelty side line, from its spice trading posts in Asia, the cheap colourful cloth proved popular and overtook the EIC's spice trade by value in the late 17th century. The EIC embraced the demand, particularly for [[Calico (textile)|calico]], by expanding its factories in Asia and producing and importing cloth in bulk, creating competition for domestic woollen and linen textile producers. The impacted weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds and farmers objected and the calico question became one of the major issues of National politics between the 1680s and the 1730s. Parliament began to see a decline in domestic textile sales, and an increase in imported textiles from places like [[China]] and [[India]]. Seeing the East India Company and their textile importation as a threat to domestic textile businesses, Parliament passed the 1700 Calico Act, blocking the importation of cotton cloth. As there was no punishment for continuing to sell cotton cloth, smuggling of the popular material became commonplace. In 1721, dissatisfied with the results of the first act, Parliament passed a stricter addition, this time prohibiting the sale of most cottons, imported and domestic (exempting only thread [[Fustian]] and raw cotton). The exemption of raw cotton from the prohibition initially saw 2 thousand bales of cotton imported annually, to become the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing [[Fustian]] for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material. This mechanised production was concentrated in new [[cotton mill]]s, which slowly expanded till by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they could easily compete with anything the EIC could import.\n\nThe acts were repealed in 1774, triggering a wave of investment in mill based cotton spinning and production, doubling the demand for raw cotton within a couple of years, and doubling it again every decade, into the 1840s<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Bishnupriya|title=COTTON TEXTILES AND THE GREAT DIVERGENCE: LANCASHIRE, INDIA AND SHIFTING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910075425/http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|archivedate=10 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIndian cotton textiles, particularly those from [[Bengal Subah|Bengal]], continued to maintain a competitive advantage up until the 19th century.

As the Artisan produced textiles were no longer competitive with those produced Industrially, and Europe preferring the cheaper slave produced, long staple American, and Egyptian cottons, for its own materials.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n====Industrial Revolution====\n{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}\n\nThe advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain provided a great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's leading export. In 1738, [[Lewis Paul]] and [[John Wyatt (inventor)|John Wyatt]], of [[Birmingham]], England, patented the roller spinning machine, as well as the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the [[James Hargreaves]]' [[spinning jenny]] in 1764, [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[spinning frame]] in 1769 and [[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[spinning mule]] in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of [[Manchester]] acquired the nickname ''\"[[Cottonopolis]]\"'' due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade.\n\nProduction capacity in Britain and the United States was improved by the invention of the modern [[cotton gin]] by the American [[Eli Whitney]] in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor,<ref name=r1>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hughs | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Valco | first2 = T. D. | first3 = J.

The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from [[Henry Odgen Holmes]], for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796.<ref name=r1/> Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from [[British Empire|colonial]] [[plantations]], processed into cotton cloth in the mills of [[Lancashire]], and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in [[British West Africa|West Africa]], [[British Raj|India]], and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).\n\nBy the 1840s, India was no longer capable of supplying the vast quantities of cotton fibers needed by mechanized British factories, while shipping bulky, low-price cotton from India to Britain was time-consuming and expensive. This, coupled with the emergence of American cotton as a superior type (due to the longer, stronger fibers of the two domesticated Native American species, ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]'' and ''[[Gossypium barbadense]]''), encouraged British traders to purchase cotton from [[Plantations in the American South|plantations in the United States]] and [[plantations]] in the [[Caribbean]]. By the mid-19th century, \"[[King Cotton]]\" had become the backbone of the [[antebellum South|southern American]] economy. In the United States, cultivating and harvesting cotton became the leading occupation of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], American cotton exports slumped due to a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[blockade]] on [[Confederate States of America|Southern]] [[port]]s, and also because of a strategic decision by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government to cut exports, hoping to force Britain to recognize the Confederacy or enter the war. This prompted the main purchasers of cotton, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]], to turn to [[Egypt]]ian cotton. British and French traders invested heavily in cotton plantations. The Egyptian government of [[Isma'il Pasha|Viceroy Isma'il]] took out substantial loans from European bankers and stock exchanges. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned [[Egyptian cotton]] and returned to cheap American exports,{{citation needed|reason=I've seen this the other way round with the South suffering because British interests in Egypt persisted and they liked the product better|date=September 2012}} sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring [[bankruptcy]] in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt's [[History of Egypt under the British|occupation by the British Empire in 1882]].\n\nDuring this time, cotton cultivation in the [[British Empire]], especially Australia and India, greatly increased to replace the lost production of the American South. Through tariffs and other restrictions, the British government discouraged the production of cotton cloth in India; rather, the raw fiber was sent to England for processing. The Indian [[Gandhi, Mohandas K.|Mahatma Gandhi]] described the process:\n\n#English people buy Indian cotton in the field, picked by Indian labor at seven cents a day, through an optional monopoly.\n#This cotton is shipped on British ships, a three-week journey across the Indian Ocean, down the Red Sea, across the Mediterranean, through Gibraltar, across the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic Ocean to London. One hundred per cent profit on this freight is regarded as small.\n#The cotton is turned into cloth in Lancashire. You pay shilling wages instead of Indian pennies to your workers. The English worker not only has the advantage of better wages, but the steel companies of England get the profit of building the factories and machines. Wages; profits; all these are spent in England.\n#The finished product is sent back to India at European shipping rates, once again on British ships. The captains, officers, sailors of these ships, whose wages must be paid, are English. The only Indians who profit are a few lascars who do the dirty work on the boats for a few cents a day.\n#The cloth is finally sold back to the kings and landlords of India who got the money to buy this expensive cloth out of the poor peasants of India who worked at seven cents a day.<ref>(Fisher 1932 pp 154\u2013156)</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Cotton production in the United States|Black Belt in the American South}}\nIn the United States, Southern cotton provided capital for the Wealth of the antebellum South, as well as raw material for Northern textile industries. Before 1865 the cotton was largely produced through the labor of enslaved African Americans. It enriched both the Southern landowners and the new textile industries of the Northeastern United States and northwestern Europe.  In 1860 the slogan \"[[King Cotton|Cotton is king]]\" characterized the fallacious attitude of Southern nationalists toward this [[monocrop]] in that Europe would support an independent [[Confederate states of America|Confederate States of America]] in 1861 in order to protect the supply of cotton and needed for its very large textile industry.<ref>Frank Lawrence Owsley, \"The Confederacy and King Cotton: A Study in Economic Coercion,\" ''North Carolina Historical Review'' 6#4 (1929), pp.&nbsp;371\u2013397 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23514836 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCotton remained a key crop in the Southern economy after slavery ended in 1865. Across the South, [[sharecropping]] evolved, in which landless farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves. Until mechanical [[cotton picker]]s were developed, cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton. Picking cotton was a source of income for families across the South. Rural and small town school systems had split vacations so children could work in the fields during \"cotton-picking.\"<ref>Rupert B.

In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are [[lepidoptera]]n larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed [[pyrethroid]] resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.\n\nBut Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests, however, such as [[plant bug]]s, [[Halyomorpha halys|stink bugs]], and [[aphid]]s; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Cornell University|date=25 July 2006|title=Seven-year glitch: Cornell warns that Chinese GM cotton farmers are losing money due to 'secondary' pests|author=Lang, Susan|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012044920/http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html|archivedate=12 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Lin | first2 = H. | last3 = Huang | first3 = J. | last4 = Hu | first4 = R. | last5 = Rozelle | first5 = S. | last6 = Pray | first6 = C. | doi = 10.1016/S1671-2927(09)60012-2 | title = Bt Cotton in China: Are Secondary Insect Infestations Offsetting the Benefits in Farmer Fields? | journal = Agricultural Sciences in China | volume = 8 | pages = 83\u201390 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm.

These are popular for baby clothes and [[diapers]]. Under most definitions, organic products do not use [[genetic engineering]]. All natural cotton products are known to be both sustainable and hypoallergenic.\n\nHistorically, in North America, one of the most economically destructive pests in cotton production has been the [[boll weevil]]. Due to the [[US Department of Agriculture]]'s highly successful [[Boll Weevil Eradication Program]] (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt]] cotton (which contains a [[bacteria]]l gene that codes for a plant-produced [[protein]] that is toxic to a number of pests such as [[cotton bollworm (American)|cotton bollworm]] and [[pink bollworm]]), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.\n\nOther significant global pests of cotton include the pink bollworm, ''[[Pectinophora gossypiella]]''; the chili thrips, ''[[Scirtothrips dorsalis]]''; the cotton seed bug, ''[[Oxycarenus hyalinipennis]]''; the tarnish plant bug, ''[[Lygus lineolaris]]''; and the fall armyworm, ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda]]'', ''[[Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum]]''.\n\n==Harvesting==\n[[File:Baumwoll-Erntemaschine.jpeg|thumb|Offloading freshly harvested cotton into a module builder in [[Texas]]; previously built modules can be seen in the background]]\n[[File:Cotton picking in India.jpg|thumb|Cotton being picked by hand in [[India]], 2005.]]\n\nMost cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is harvested mechanically, either by a [[cotton picker]], a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical [[defoliant]] or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.\n\nCotton continues to be picked by hand in [[developing country|developing countries]].<ref>[[Craig Murray|Murray, Craig]] (2006).

Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. [[Cellulose acetate|Acetate]] in fiber form was developed in 1924. [[Nylon]], the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]] in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's [[hosiery]] from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of [[polyester]] into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat.<ref>[http://www.teonline.com/fiber-history.html Fiber History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917085422/http://www.teonline.com/fiber-history.html |date=17 September 2008 }}.

[[Sock]]s, [[underwear]], and most [[T-shirt]]s are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in [[crochet]] and [[knitting]]. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including [[rayon]] and [[synthetic fiber]]s such as [[polyester]]. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a stretchier thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with [[linen]] producing fabrics with the benefits of both materials. Linen-cotton blends are wrinkle resistant and retain heat more effectively than only linen, and are thinner, stronger and lighter than only cotton.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reference.com/home-garden/difference-between-cotton-linen-40242bc2265acaef |title=What is the difference between cotton and linen? |accessdate=September 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073804/https://www.reference.com/home-garden/difference-between-cotton-linen-40242bc2265acaef |archivedate=17 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the [[textile industry]], cotton is used in [[fishing net]]s, [[coffee filter]]s, [[tent]]s, explosives manufacture (see [[nitrocellulose]]), [[cotton paper]], and in [[bookbinding]].

The [[cottonseed meal]] that is left generally is fed to [[ruminant]] livestock; the [[gossypol]] remaining in the meal is toxic to [[monogastric]] animals. Cottonseed hulls can be added to dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in [[folk remedies]] as an [[abortifacient]], that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found in all parts of the cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Resisting Reproduction: Reconsidering Slave Contraception in the Old South |author=Perrin, Liese M. |journal=Journal of American Studies |volume=35 |year=2001 |pages=255\u2013274|doi=10.1017/S0021875801006612 |jstor=27556967 |issue=2}}</ref>\n\nCotton linters are fine, silky fibers which adhere to the seeds of the cotton plant after ginning. These curly fibers typically are less than {{convert|1/8|in|mm}} long. The term also may apply to the longer textile fiber staple lint as well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species. Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of [[cellulose]]. In the UK, linters are referred to as \"cotton wool\".

The largest exporters of raw cotton are the United States, with sales of $4.9 billion, and Africa, with sales of $2.1 billion. The total international trade is estimated to be $12 billion. Africa's share of the cotton trade has doubled since 1980. Neither area has a significant domestic textile industry, textile manufacturing having moved to developing nations in Eastern and South Asia such as India and China. In Africa, cotton is grown by numerous small holders. Dunavant Enterprises, based in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], is the leading cotton broker in Africa, with hundreds of purchasing agents. It operates [[cotton gin]]s in Uganda, Mozambique, and Zambia. In Zambia, it often offers loans for seed and expenses to the 180,000 small farmers who grow cotton for it, as well as advice on farming methods. [[Cargill]] also purchases cotton in Africa for export.\n\nThe 25,000 cotton growers in the United States are heavily [[subsidy|subsidized]] at the rate of $2 billion per year although China now provides the highest overall level of cotton sector support.<ref>[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Cotton/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-Cotton-sector \"Executive Brief Update 2013: Cotton sector\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224045221/http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Cotton/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-Cotton-sector |date=24 February 2014 }}.

The consortium agreed to first sequence the D-genome wild relative of cultivated cotton (''G. raimondii'', a Central American species) because it is small and has few repetitive elements. It has nearly one-third of the bases of tetraploid cotton, and each chromosome occurs only once.{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} Then, the A genome of ''G. arboreum'' would be sequenced. Its genome is roughly twice that of ''G. raimondii''. Part of the difference in size is due the amplification of ''retrotransposons'' (GORGE). After both diploid genomes are assembled, they would be used as models for sequencing the genomes of tetraploid cultivated species. Without knowing the diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of AD genomes would co-assemble, and their repetitive elements would assemble independently into A and D sequences respectively. There would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.\n\nThe public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, the companies [[Monsanto]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of ''G. raimondii'' about 50x.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Monsanto and Illumina Reach Key Milestone in Cotton Genome Sequencing|url = http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|website = www.monsanto.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|last = APPDMZ\\gyoung|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042838/http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|archivedate = 1 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref> They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but much work remains.\n\nAs of 2014, at least one assembled cotton genome had been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.2987 |pmid=24836287|title=Genome sequence of the cultivated cotton ''Gossypium arboreum''|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=46|issue=6|pages=567\u2013572|year=2014|last1=Li|first1=Fuguang|last2=Fan|first2=Guangyi|last3=Wang|first3=Kunbo|last4=Sun|first4=Fengming|last5=Yuan|first5=Youlu|last6=Song|first6=Guoli|last7=Li|first7=Qin|last8=Ma|first8=Zhiying|last9=Lu|first9=Cairui|last10=Zou|first10=Changsong|last11=Chen|first11=Wenbin|last12=Liang|first12=Xinming|last13=Shang|first13=Haihong|last14=Liu|first14=Weiqing|last15=Shi|first15=Chengcheng|last16=Xiao|first16=Guanghui|last17=Gou|first17=Caiyun|last18=Ye|first18=Wuwei|last19=Xu|first19=Xun|last20=Zhang|first20=Xueyan|last21=Wei|first21=Hengling|last22=Li|first22=Zhifang|last23=Zhang|first23=Guiyin|last24=Wang|first24=Junyi|last25=Liu|first25=Kun|last26=Kohel|first26=Russell J.|last27=Percy|first27=Richard G.|last28=Yu|first28=John Z.|last29=Zhu|first29=Yu-Xian|last30=Wang|first30=Jun|displayauthors=29|url=http://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/123606183/Genome_sequence_of_the_cultivated_cotton_Gossypium_arboreum.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Carding|Cotton carding]]\n*[[Cotton gin]]\n*[[Cotton mill]]\n*[[Cotton recycling]]\n*[[Diplomacy of the American Civil War#Cotton and the British economy]]\n*[[Environmental impact of fashion]]\n*[[International Cotton Advisory Committee]]\n*[[Ceiba pentandra|Java cotton (kapok)]]\n*[[King Cotton]]\n*[[Madapollam]]\n*[[Mercerized cotton]]\n*[[Sea Island Cotton]]\n*[[The Cotton Museum]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Beckert, Sven.
