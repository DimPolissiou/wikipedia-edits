The ride was designed by [[Werner Stengel]] and manufactured by [[Bolliger & Mabillard]], and opened on May 1, 1999. It features a {{Convert|208|ft|m|adj=on}} first drop, a top speed of {{Convert|73|mph|km/h}}, and over {{Convert|5000|ft|m}} of track. It was the second Bolliger & Mabillard hyper coaster to open in the [[United States]], just a few months after [[Apollo's Chariot]] at [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]].\n\n==Description==\nRaging Bull is located in Southwest Territory, situated between [[Viper (Six Flags Great America)|Viper]] and the giant helix on [[American Eagle (roller coaster)|American Eagle]]. This space was formerly occupied by [[Alpine Bobsled|Rolling Thunder]], a [[bobsled roller coaster]] which arrived in 1990 from [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] as part of a ride rotation program, but was later relocated in 1996 to [[The Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom]] in [[Queensbury, New York]].\n\nRaging Bull's station is designed to have a run-down appearance. The track is painted orange, with unpainted rails and wine-colored supports. The coaster is named after a ferocious beast that terrorized the citizens of the old [[Southwest Territory]] until they fled the town and built the [[courtyard]] and [[Mission (station)|mission]] seen today.<ref>{{Cite RCDB|number=535|coaster-name=Raging Bull|location=Six Flags Great America|access-date=2016-06-15}}</ref> It was announced on June 15, 2016, that [[Virtual reality headset|Virtual Reality]] would be added to the ride later in the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sixflags.com//greatamerica/attractions/vr/overview|title=Virtual Reality Coaster - Raging Bull {{!}}|website=www.sixflags.com|access-date=2016-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==Ride experience==\nAs the train exits the station, it makes a left turn and a small dip before hitting the lift hill. At the {{convert|202|ft|m|adj=mid|peak}}, the track passes through a pre-drop. After a brief straight section off the pre-drop, the track makes a {{convert|208|ft|m|adj=mid|plunge}} into a tunnel, reaching speeds of up to {{convert|73|mph|abbr=on}}. The train then ascends {{convert|155|ft}} into a [[Roller coaster elements#Hammerhead turn|hammerhead turn]] to the right above Viper's queue line. After the turnaround is a {{convert|141|ft|m|adj=mid|-parabolic hill}}, with a trim brake on the uphill side.

The ride was designed by [[Werner Stengel]] and manufactured by [[Bolliger & Mabillard]], and opened on May 1, 1999. It features a {{Convert|208|ft|m|adj=on}} first drop, a top speed of {{Convert|73|mph|km/h}}, and over {{Convert|5000|ft|m}} of track. It was the second Bolliger & Mabillard hyper coaster to open in the [[United States]], just a few months after [[Apollo's Chariot]] at [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]].\n\n==Description==\nRaging Bull is located in Southwest Territory, situated between [[Viper (Six Flags Great America)|Viper]] and the giant helix on [[American Eagle (roller coaster)|American Eagle]]. This space was formerly occupied by [[Alpine Bobsled|Rolling Thunder]], a [[bobsled roller coaster]] which arrived in 1990 from [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] as part of a ride rotation program, but was later relocated in 1996 to [[The Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom]] in [[Queensbury, New York]].\n\nRaging Bull's station is designed to have a run-down appearance. The track is painted orange, with unpainted rails and wine-colored supports. The coaster is named after a ferocious beast that terrorized the citizens of the old [[Southwest Territory]] until they fled the town and built the [[courtyard]] and [[Mission (station)|mission]] seen today.<ref>{{Cite RCDB|number=535|coaster-name=Raging Bull|location=Six Flags Great America|access-date=2016-06-15}}</ref> It was announced on June 15, 2016, that [[Virtual reality headset|Virtual Reality]] would be added to the ride later in the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sixflags.com//greatamerica/attractions/vr/overview|title=Virtual Reality Coaster - Raging Bull {{!}}|website=www.sixflags.com|access-date=2016-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==Ride experience==\nAs the train exits the station, it makes a left turn and a small dip before hitting the lift hill. At the {{convert|202|ft|m|adj=mid|peak}}, the track passes through a pre-drop. After a brief straight section off the pre-drop, the track makes a {{convert|208|ft|m|adj=mid|plunge}} into a tunnel, reaching speeds of up to {{convert|73|mph|abbr=on}}. The train then ascends {{convert|155|ft}} into a [[Roller coaster elements#Hammerhead turn|hammerhead turn]] to the right above Viper's queue line. After the turnaround is a {{convert|141|ft|m|adj=mid|-parabolic hill}}, with a trim brake on the uphill side. This followed by a {{convert|128|ft|m|adj=mid|hill}} that banks left over the station area, followed by a dip under the lift hill and the 2nd hammerhead turn to the left, then a right hand uphill turn into a mid-course brake run.

Fish has collaborated with [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] founder [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] on his ''[[Still (Tony Banks album)|Still]]'' and ''[[Soundtracks (Tony Banks album)|Soundtracks]]'' albums, singing on the tracks \"Shortcut to Somewhere\", \"Angel Face\" and \"Another Murder of a Day\", co-writing the latter.\n\nFish appeared at World Bowl XI, 14 June 2003, Hampden Park, Glasgow. His performance included a rousing rendition of \"Caledonia\" before kick-off.\n\nOn 26 August 2007, Fish performed at the 'Hobble on The Cobbles' show at the Market Square in [[Aylesbury]]. He was accompanied on stage by his four former Marillion bandmates from the classic line-up ([[Mark Kelly (keyboardist)|Mark Kelly]], [[Steve Rothery]], [[Ian Mosley]] and [[Pete Trewavas]]) for one song: '[[Market Square Heroes]]'. This was the first time they had performed together in nearly two decades. In a press interview following the event, Fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, claiming that \"Hogarth does a great job with the band&nbsp;... We forged different paths over the 19 years.\"<ref name=\"Singer Fish and Marillion Reunite\">{{cite news |title=Singer Fish and Marillion Reunite |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6966603.stm |accessdate=6 June 2008 |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nHis album ''[[13th Star]]'' was released on 12 September 2007 as a specially-packaged pre-release version available to order from his website. A UK tour for this album commenced in March 2008, supported by [[Glyder (band)|Glyder]]. In February 2008, Fish was confirmed to be the Friday night headline act at [[NEARFest]] X. He also appeared with [[BBC Radio 2]]'s [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] on [[GMTV]] to promote [[ChildLine Concert|Childline Rocks]], a charity concert.\n\nIn 2008, Fish presented a Friday evening radio show, ''Fish on Friday'', for digital radio station [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]]. When the station was faced with closure, Malcolm Bluemel (with the help of Fish, [[Tony Iommi]], [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] and [[Gary Moore]]) helped save Planet Rock by buying the station.<ref name=\"Planet Rock Saved\">{{cite web|title=Fish \u2013 Planet Rock radio station saved |url=http://www.planetrock.co.uk/article.asp?id=731764 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330081715/http://www.planetrock.co.uk/article.asp?id=731764 |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 March 2019 |accessdate=6 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn 9 June 2008, Fish embarked on his first full North American tour in eleven years. At each stop, he hosted a pre-show meet-and-greet with his fans. Two days prior, he was interviewed by Vince Font of the progressive rock podcast Prog'opolis, which was aired a week later on The Dividing Line Broadcast Network (DLBN) as \"My Lunch With Fish\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedividingline.com/archives.html |title=Podcast interview \"My Lunch With Fish\" June 7, 2008 |publisher=Thedividingline.com |accessdate=20 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829062007/http://thedividingline.com/archives.html |archive-date=29 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Fish won a Celebrity Music edition of ''[[The Weakest Link]]'', beating Eggsy of [[Goldie Lookin Chain]] in the final round, sharing \u00a318,750 with Eggsy's charity and his own.\n\nOn 20 and 21 October 2012, Fish hosted Fish Convention 2012 in [[Leamington Spa]]. He performed two acoustic sets and two electric sets, including material from his upcoming release, ''Feast of Consequences''. He also performed \"Grendel\", a fan-favourite Marillion b-side, twice.\n\n==Musical style==\nFish has sometimes been compared to [[Peter Gabriel]], original lead singer of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] in the early 1970s, and his voice has even been described as \"uncannily close\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Borthwick |first=Stuart |title=Popular Music Genres: An Introduction |year=2004|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-1745-6}} \"Their vocalist Fish (Derek Dick) had a voice uncannily close to Peter Gabriel's\"</ref> Music journalist [[David Hepworth]] described his voice as a \"conflation of [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Peter Gabriel]]\".<ref name=\"Hepworth\"/> Fish has acknowledged Gabriel's influence on him and some vocal similarities, but has rejected accusations from some critics during his career that he does not have a unique voice of his own.<ref name=\"prasad\"/> [[Peter Hammill]] of [[Van der Graaf Generator]] was also a major influence on his songwriting and vocal delivery, which is especially notable on the first two Marillion albums.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n==Record labels==\nFollowing a legal dispute with [[EMI Records]] and an unsuccessful contract with [[Polydor]], Fish established the Dick Bros Record Company in [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] in 1993. The studio recorded ''In Amber'' by [[Dream Disciples]] (1994) and ''Man Dancin'' by [[Tam White]] in (1996). He released a number of \"official [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]\" albums to finance the company before selling it to [[Roadrunner Records]]. Another financially unsuccessful period followed before he re-established his own Chocolate Frog Records label in 2001. He signed with [[Snapper Music]] in 2005, but later returned to Chocolate Frog Records.\n\n==Awards==\nIn May 2008, Fish's Planet Rock show ''Fish on Friday'' won the Silver award in the Music Broadcaster of the Year category at the UK Sony Radio Academy Awards 2008.<ref name=\"Fish wins Silver in 2008 Sony Radio Academy Awards\">{{cite web |title=Fish wins Silver in 2008 Sony Radio Academy Awards |url=http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?category=The_Music_Broadcaster_of_the_Year&year=2008 |accessdate=6 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414000640/http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?category=The_Music_Broadcaster_of_the_Year&year=2008 |archive-date=14 April 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In June 2008, at the New York Festivals Radio Broadcasting Awards, he and [[Gary Moore]] jointly received the Gold World Medal in the Regularly Scheduled Music Programme category for their respective shows on Planet Rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkfestivals.com/res/pdf/2008WinnersBookletRB.pdf |title=Newyorkfestivals.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Acting==\nFish was offered and accepted a part in the 1986 film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' (for which Marillion were also offered the soundtrack) but he eventually had to turn it down, owing to his tour commitments with the band.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wall |first=Mick |title=Appetite for Destruction: Legendary Encounters with Mick Wall|year=2010|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-1-4091-2169-5}}</ref> Fish first appeared on terrestrial television as himself in the \"More Bad News\" episode of the series \"[[The Comic Strip Presents...]]\" in 1988.\n\nHis first acting role was as a guest star in an episode of \"[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]\" called \"The Newcomers\" (aired 10 February 1991) but a more prominent role was as the thug \"Ferguson\" alongside [[John Sessions]] in ''Jute City'', a four-part 1991 BBC drama based on a group of [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ruffians.\n\nIn 1994, he appeared in ''[[Chasing the Deer]]'', a film set during the [[1745 Jacobite rebellion]], as \"Angus Cameron\".

Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. However, he declined to actively campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live with his partner and her young son.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/fish-turns-down-yes-role-over-germany-move-1-3479476|title=Fish turns down Yes role over Germany

Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. However, he declined to actively campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live
