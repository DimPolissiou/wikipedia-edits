It was envisioned by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], a [[Kolkata]] lawyer, who prevised a school modelled on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], but conscious of Indian ambitions and desires. Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/old-boys-want-doon-to-stay-as-it-is/cid/473019|title=Old boys want Doon to stay as it is|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref> [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

'Mairants, Ivor' in ''Grove Music Online'' (2001)'']</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, he was a banjoist and guitarist for British dance bands led by [[Bert Firman]], [[Ambrose]], [[Roy Fox]], [[Lew Stone]], [[Geraldo]], and [[Ted Heath (bandleader)|Ted Heath]]. In the 1960s and 1970s his guitar playing was often heard on television, radio, film soundtracks, and many recordings with the [[Mantovani]] orchestra and with Manuel and his Music of the Mountains. His recording of the \"Adagio\" from [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s ''Concierto de Aranjuez'' with Manuel sold over one million copies. His guitar quintet broadcast regularly in the late 1950s on the [[BBC]]'s ''Guitar Club'' series.\n\nMairants devoted much time to writing music and instructional method books for guitar. He worked with American guitarist [[Josh White]] on ''The Josh White Guitar Method'' ([[Boosey & Hawkes]]) in 1956. British guitarist [[John Renbourn]] and American guitarist [[Stefan Grossman]] (who was living in the UK at the time) have cited it as an influence on their playing. The success ''The Josh White Guitar Method'' prompted Mairants to commission a Zenith \"Josh White\" signature guitar based on Josh's Martin 0021 from German guitar maker Oscar Teller. Scottish guitarist [[Bert Jansch]] owned one of these models in his early playing years. On the last page of ''Josh White Guitar Method'' (printed 1956) there is a photo of this Zenith Josh White signature guitar and some text about it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafire.com/?73l722l9a2951lw |title=Josh White Guitar|website=Mediafire.com|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, his book ''The Flamenco Guitar'' was published. It was written with the cooperation of [[Torroba]] (conductor), [[Sabicas]] ,and other guitarists.\n\nThe [[Guild Guitar Company]] in the US worked with Josh White on a signature model in 1965. Mark Dronge took Josh White to the Guild factory in 1965. A guitar made to Josh White's specifications was made and was meant to become a signature guitar for White, but it was never mass-produced. Dronge said, \"The scene was starting to change. The Beatles were so influential and all these bands came out and the electric music was getting bigger and the plans for Josh White model just kind of fell by the wayside, unfortunately.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigation/josh-white-guitar/ |title=History Detectives|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-tc.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/static/media/transcripts/2011-05-22/611_joshwhiteguitar.pdf|format=PDF|title=Transcription of History Detectives program|website=Tc.pbs.org|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMairants commissioned German guitar manufacturer [[Framus]] to make further Zenith Guitars, with Boosey & Hawkes the sole distributor and each guitar signed by him. These included the Zenith Model 17 acoustic which became [[Paul McCartney]]'s first guitar and on which he wrote most of his early songs.\n\nIn an interview McCartney relates how he was surprised to see a 'chit' in Abbey Road Studios that Mairants had signed as a session musician - \"...he was a God to us.\"<ref>''The Beatles Recording Sessions'' p. 9, Lewisohn</ref>\n\nIn 1950 Mairants established the Central School of Dance Music in London, which he ran for 10 years. All instruments were taught at this establishment, but emphasis was given to guitar. Among the teaching staff at the school were [[Johnny Dankworth]], [[Jack Brymer]], [[Kenny Baker (trumpeter)|Kenny Baker]], [[Bert Weedon]] and [[Ike Isaacs (guitarist)|Ike Isaacs]], as well as [[Eric Gilder]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-ivor-mairants-1147017.html Obituary, 'Ivor Mairants' in ''The Independent'', 26 February 1998]</ref> In 1960 Mairants handed the school over to Gilder, who renamed it as the Eric Gilder School of Music.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DGuvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=%22central+school+of+dance+music%22&source=bl&ots=0sn4VQxKtf&sig=ACfU3U1A4Iju8xPSIejucoiNs1pfsFVOfQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjzwey1-OrnAhVvShUIHX-gCAkQ6AEwAnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22central%20school%20of%20dance%20music%22&f=false Chiltern, John.

This was Britain's first [[guitar shop]], in the heart of the West End of London. He was often employed as a consultant for instrument makers and importers.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, Mairants was a columnist for ''[[Melody Maker]]'', ''[[BMG (magazine)|BMG]]'', and ''Classical Guitar''. In 1980, his biography ''My Fifty Fretting Years'' was published by Ashley Mark Publishing in the UK and, in 1995, his book ''The Great Jazz Guitarists'', a collection of note-for-note transcriptions of historic jazz [[guitar solo]]s, was published by [[Music Maker Publications]] in Cambridge, England.\n\nHe was a member of the Worshipful Society of Musicians, a British guild, and a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the City of London. In 1997 the Worshipful Society of Musicians inaugurated an annual competition for the Ivor Mairants Guitar Award.\n\nThe Ivor Mairants shop, in [[Rathbone Place]], finally closed its doors in December 2019 after 61 years, though the business is still running online.<ref>[https://www.ivormairants.co.uk/about-us Ivor Mairants Musiccentre: About Us]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Harper, Colin.

In the 1960s and 1970s his guitar playing was often heard on television, radio, film soundtracks, and many recordings with the [[Mantovani]] orchestra and with Manuel and his Music of the Mountains. His recording of the \"Adagio\" from [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s ''Concierto de Aranjuez'' with Manuel sold over one million copies. His guitar quintet broadcast regularly in the late 1950s on the [[BBC]]'s ''Guitar Club'' series.\n\nMairants devoted much time to writing music and instructional method books for guitar. He worked with American guitarist [[Josh White]] on ''The Josh White Guitar Method'' ([[Boosey & Hawkes]]) in 1956. British guitarist [[John Renbourn]] and American guitarist [[Stefan Grossman]] (who was living in the UK at the time) have cited it as an influence on their playing. The success ''The Josh White Guitar Method'' prompted Mairants to commission a Zenith \"Josh White\" signature guitar based on Josh's Martin 0021 from German guitar maker Oscar Teller. Scottish guitarist [[Bert Jansch]] owned one of these models in his early playing years. On the last page of ''Josh White Guitar Method'' (printed 1956) there is a photo of this Zenith Josh White signature guitar and some text about it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafire.com/?73l722l9a2951lw |title=Josh White Guitar|website=Mediafire.com|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, his book ''The Flamenco Guitar'' was published. It was written with the cooperation of [[Torroba]] (conductor), [[Sabicas]] ,and other guitarists.\n\nThe [[Guild Guitar Company]] in the US worked with Josh White on a signature model in 1965. Mark Dronge took Josh White to the Guild factory in 1965. A guitar made to Josh White's specifications was made and was meant to become a signature guitar for White, but it was never mass-produced. Dronge said, \"The scene was starting to change. The Beatles were so influential and all these bands came out and the electric music was getting bigger and the plans for Josh White model just kind of fell by the wayside, unfortunately.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigation/josh-white-guitar/ |title=History Detectives|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-tc.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/static/media/transcripts/2011-05-22/611_joshwhiteguitar.pdf|format=PDF|title=Transcription of History Detectives program|website=Tc.pbs.org|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMairants commissioned German guitar manufacturer [[Framus]] to make further Zenith Guitars, with Boosey & Hawkes the sole distributor and each guitar signed by him. These included the Zenith Model 17 acoustic which became [[Paul McCartney]]'s first guitar and on which he wrote most of his early songs.\n\nIn an interview McCartney relates how he was surprised to see a 'chit' in Abbey Road Studios that Mairants had signed as a session musician - \"...he was a God to us.\"<ref>''The Beatles Recording Sessions'' p. 9, Lewisohn</ref>\n\nIn 1950 Mairants established the Central School of Dance Music in London, which he ran for 10 years. All instruments were taught at this establishment, but emphasis was given to guitar. Among the teaching staff at the school were [[Johnny Dankworth]], [[Jack Brymer]], [[Kenny Baker (trumpeter)|Kenny Baker]], [[Bert Weedon]] and [[Ike Isaacs (guitarist)|Ike Isaacs]], as well as [[Eric Gilder]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-ivor-mairants-1147017.html Obituary, 'Ivor Mairants' in ''The Independent'', 26 February 1998]</ref> In 1960 Mairants handed the school over to Gilder, who renamed it as the Eric Gilder School of Music.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DGuvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=%22central+school+of+dance+music%22&source=bl&ots=0sn4VQxKtf&sig=ACfU3U1A4Iju8xPSIejucoiNs1pfsFVOfQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjzwey1-OrnAhVvShUIHX-gCAkQ6AEwAnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22central%20school%20of%20dance%20music%22&f=false Chiltern, John.

This was Britain's first [[guitar shop]], in the heart of the West End of London. He was often employed as a consultant for instrument makers and importers.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, Mairants was a columnist for ''[[Melody Maker]]'', ''[[BMG (magazine)|BMG]]'', and ''Classical Guitar''. In 1980, his biography ''My Fifty Fretting Years'' was published by Ashley Mark Publishing in the UK and, in 1995, his book ''The Great Jazz Guitarists'', a collection of note-for-note transcriptions of historic jazz [[guitar solo]]s, was published by [[Music Maker Publications]] in Cambridge, England.\n\nHe was a member of the Worshipful Society of Musicians, a British guild, and a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the City of London. In 1997 the Worshipful Society of Musicians inaugurated an annual competition for the Ivor Mairants Guitar Award.\n\nThe Ivor Mairants shop, in [[Rathbone Place]], finally closed its doors in December 2019 after 61 years, though the business is still running online.<ref><ref>[https://www.ivormairants.co.uk/about-us Ivor Mairants Musiccentre: About Us]</ref></ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Harper, Colin.

Although the disability rights movement itself began in the 1960s, advocacy for the rights of people with disabilities started much earlier and continues to the present.\n\n==Prior to the 1700s==\n* Ancient Greece - A [[Pharmakos|pharmak\u00f3s]] (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, plural pharmakoi) in Ancient Greek religion was the ritualistic sacrifice or exile of a human scapegoat or victim. A cripple, a slave or a criminal was chosen and expelled from the community at times of disaster (famine, invasion or plague) or at times of calendrical crisis. It was believed that this would bring about purification. On the first day of the [[Thargelia]], a festival of [[Apollo]] at Athens, two men, the ''Pharmakoi'', were led out as if to be sacrificed as an expiation. Some scholia state that ''pharmakoi'' were actually sacrificed (thrown from a cliff or burned), but many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the ''pharmakos'' (the iambic satirist [[Hipponax]]) shows the ''pharmakoi'' being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes not, depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance, a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n* 1200s - In the 13th century, England declared people with intellectual disabilities to be incapable of making decisions or managing their affairs.<ref name=Parnell>{{cite book|url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Re-So/Retardation.html|author=Wickham, Parnell|title=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society|accessdate=8 October 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928233511/http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Re-So/Retardation.html|archivedate=28 September 2010}}</ref>\n* 1324 -  The idea of insanity in English law dates from 1324, when the ''Statute de Praerogativa Regis'' allowed the King to take the lands of idiots and lunatics.\n\n==1700s==\n* 1714 - In English law, the Vagrancy Act 1714 allowed two Justices of the Peace to confine a dangerous lunatic. \n* 1729 - In 1729 punishment was recommended for people with physical disabilities, whether they were born with disabilities or acquired them later in life, who appeared in public.<ref name=\"TheUglyLaws\"/> These concepts were covered by what were colloquially known as unsightly beggar ordinances.\n* 1774 - The [[Madhouses Act 1774]] (14 Geo. 3 c.49) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which set out a legal framework for regulating \"madhouses\" ([[insane asylums]]).

The Lunacy Act's most important provision was a change in the status of [[mental illness|mentally ill]] people to [[patients]]. As well, the Lunacy Act created the [[Commissioners in Lunacy]] or Lunacy Commission, a [[UK]] [[public body]] established to oversee asylums and the welfare of [[mental illness|mentally ill]] people. It succeeded the [[Metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy]]. The Lunacy Act of 1845 was passed through Parliament simultaneously with the 1845 County Asylums Act. The two acts were dependent on each other. The Lunacy Act established the Lunacy Commission and the County Asylums Act set forth most of the provisions as to what was to be monitored within the asylums and helped establish the public network of the county asylums. Like the Lunacy Act, there had been several drafts of this act passed before 1845 and several afterward as well. The most notable of these were the 1808, and the 1853 County Asylum Acts. The Lunacy Act itself was amended several times after its conception. There was a new version written in both 1846 and 1847. Both of these versions were actually repealed by the 1853 County Asylums Act. The importance of these two acts together is that they consolidated Lunacy Law in England. However, no legislation has ever combined the entirety of Lunacy Law. Both of these acts were the basis for Lunacy Law in England until 1890 when both of them were repealed by the Lunacy Act of 1890.<ref>[http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/5S.htm The Lunacy Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624161914/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/5S.HTM |date=2007-06-24 }}</ref>\n* 1871 - The [[Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871]] was created to manage and protect the estate of \"lunatics\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusionireland.ie/content/page/replace-lunacy-act |title=Replace the Lunacy Act &#124; Inclusion Ireland |publisher=Inclusionireland.ie |date=2015-04-01 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}</ref> It was repealed by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013.<ref name=\"irishexaminer1\"/>\n* 1883 - The [[Trial of Lunatics Act 1883]] is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], allowing the jury to return a verdict that the defendant was guilty, but [[insane]] at the time, and should be kept in custody as a \"[[criminal lunatic]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crotty|first=Homer D.|title=The History of Insanity as a Defence to Crime in English Criminal Law|journal=[[California Law Review]]|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley School of Law]]|volume=12|issue=2|issn=0008-1221|date=1924|page=120}}</ref> This Act was passed at the request of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who, the target of frequent attacks by mentally ill individuals, demanded that the verdict be changed from \"not guilty\" so as to act as a deterrent to other lunatics; the phrasing of \"guilty of the act or omission charged, but insane so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his actions.\" remained in use until the [[Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=White|first=Stephen|title=The Insanity Defense in England and Wales Since 1843|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|publisher=[[American Academy of Political and Social Science]]|volume=477|issn=0002-7162|year=1985|page=45|doi=10.1177/0002716285477001005}}</ref> It was cited in 1991 in the case of ''[[R v Burgess]]'' regarding the [[automatism defence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/criminal-law-insanity-r-v-burgess|title=Criminal law; insanity -- R v Burgess|date=22 May 1991|publisher=Law Society Gazette|accessdate=2011-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318095422/http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/criminal-law-insanity-r-v-burgess|archive-date=18 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The form of special verdict provided for by this Act was commonly known as guilty but insane.

The elaborate interpretive commentary on the law was written by three dominant figures in the [[racial hygiene]] movement: [[Ernst R\u00fcdin]], [[Arthur G\u00fctt]] and the lawyer [[Falk Ruttke]]. The law itself was based on a 'model' American law developed by [[Harry H. Laughlin]]. There were three amendments by 1935, most making minor adjustments to how the statute operated or clarifying bureaucratic aspects (such as who paid for the operations). The most significant changes allowed the Higher Court to renounce a patient's right to appeal, and to fine physicians who did not report patients who they knew would qualify for sterilisation under the law.

The legal quota was: Governmental bodies - 2. 0% (Non-clerical - 1. 9%) Private enterprises - 1. 6% (Specialized juridical person - 1. 9%) The quota was changed in 1998 as follows: Governmental bodies - 2. 1% (Non-clerical - 1. 9%) Private enterprises - 1. 8% (Specialized juridical person - 2. 1%) This ratio does not include mentally ill persons.

This office may announce to the public the names of enterprises who fail to meet the quota and request them to draw up plan for employment of disabled persons to meet the quota. <br />\n(2) The Levy and Grant System: This system works by collecting levy from those enterprises that fail to achieve the quota of disabled workers.

[[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Lord Parker C.J.]] broadened the definition of \"abnormality of mind\" to include those lacking \"the ability to exercise will-power to control acts in accordance with [their] rational judgment\". \"Irresistible impulse\" can be pleaded only under the defense of [[diminished responsibility]], not under the defense of insanity.

It was regarding \"Marion\", a [[pseudonym]] for the 14-year-old girl at the centre of this case, who suffered from intellectual disabilities, severe deafness, epilepsy and other disorders. Her parents, a married couple from the [[Northern Territory]] sought an order from the [[Family Court of Australia]] authorising them to have Marion undergo a hysterectomy and an oophrectomy (removal of ovaries). The practical effect would be sterilisation and preventing Marion from being able to have children and many of the hormonal effects of adulthood. The [[High Court of Australia]] recognised the right of everyone to bodily integrity under national and international law, and made a distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic surgical procedures as well as the duty of surrogates to act in the best interests of the incompetent patient. In the case, the High Court ruled that while parents may consent to medical treatment for their children, the authority does not extend to treatment not in the child's best interests. Also, the Court held that if medical treatment has sterilisation as its principal objective, parents do not have the authority to consent on behalf of their child.\n* 1992 - The Disabled Persons Act, Act Number 5 of 1992 was adopted by Zimbabwe.

The Act had two main purposes: The first was to add a new criterion to the statutory tests applied by a sheriff or the Scottish Ministers when considering whether to order the discharge of a restricted patient. The sheriff and the Scottish Ministers must now refuse to order a discharge (either conditional or absolute) if satisfied that the patient has a mental disorder, the effect of which is that continuing detention in hospital is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. That is so whether or not the patient is to receive medical treatment for the mental disorder. The second is to introduce a right of appeal against a decision, notification or recommendation of a sheriff in relation to an appeal brought by a restricted patient in terms of Part VI of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. The right of appeal against the sheriff's decision, notification or recommendation is conferred on both the patient and the Scottish Ministers. The appeal is to the [[Court of Session]]. The Act also widens the term '[[mental disorder]]', which appears in earlier legislation, to include a [[personality disorder]].\n* 1999 - [[ADAPT \u2013 Able Disable All People Together]] established the National Resource Centre for Inclusion (NRCI), in [[Mumbai]], to include disabled children from special schools into non-special schools.<ref name=\"hindu2003\"/><ref name=\"internationalforum1\"/>\n\n==2000s==\n* 2000 - The Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours take place in Toronto, ON at the CAMH facility on Queen St West.

A cripple, a slave or a criminal was chosen and expelled from the community at times of disaster (famine, invasion or plague) or at times of calendrical crisis. It was believed that this would bring about purification. On the first day of the [[Thargelia]], a festival of [[Apollo]] at Athens, two men, the ''Pharmakoi'', were led out as if to be sacrificed as an expiation. Some scholia state that ''pharmakoi'' were actually sacrificed (thrown from a cliff or burned), but many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the ''pharmakos'' (the iambic satirist [[Hipponax]]) shows the ''pharmakoi'' being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes not, depending on the attitude of the victim.

The two acts were dependent on each other. The Lunacy Act established the Lunacy Commission and the County Asylums Act set forth most of the provisions as to what was to be monitored within the asylums and helped establish the public network of the county asylums. Like the Lunacy Act, there had been several drafts of this act passed before 1845 and several afterward as well. The most notable of these were the 1808, and the 1853 County Asylum Acts. The Lunacy Act itself was amended several times after its conception. There was a new version written in both 1846 and 1847. Both of these versions were actually repealed by the 1853 County Asylums Act. The importance of these two acts together is that they consolidated Lunacy Law in England. However, no legislation has ever combined the entirety of Lunacy Law. Both of these acts were the basis for Lunacy Law in England until 1890 when both of them were repealed by the Lunacy Act of 1890.<ref>[http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/5S.htm The Lunacy Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624161914/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/5S.HTM |date=2007-06-24 }}</ref>\n* 1871 - The [[Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871]] was created to manage and protect the estate of \"lunatics\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusionireland.ie/content/page/replace-lunacy-act |title=Replace the Lunacy Act &#124; Inclusion Ireland |publisher=Inclusionireland.ie |date=2015-04-01 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}</ref> It was repealed by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013.<ref name=\"irishexaminer1\"/>\n* 1883 - The [[Trial of Lunatics Act 1883]] is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], allowing the jury to return a verdict that the defendant was guilty, but [[insane]] at the time, and should be kept in custody as a \"[[criminal lunatic]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crotty|first=Homer D.|title=The History of Insanity as a Defence to Crime in English Criminal Law|journal=[[California Law Review]]|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley School of Law]]|volume=12|issue=2|issn=0008-1221|date=1924|page=120}}</ref> This Act was passed at the request of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who, the target of frequent attacks by mentally ill individuals, demanded that the verdict be changed from \"not guilty\" so as to act as a deterrent to other lunatics; the phrasing of \"guilty of the act or omission charged, but insane so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his actions.\" remained in use until the [[Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=White|first=Stephen|title=The Insanity Defense in England and Wales Since 1843|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|publisher=[[American Academy of Political and Social Science]]|volume=477|issn=0002-7162|year=1985|page=45|doi=10.1177/0002716285477001005}}</ref> It was cited in 1991 in the case of ''[[R v Burgess]]'' regarding the [[automatism defence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/criminal-law-insanity-r-v-burgess|title=Criminal law; insanity -- R v Burgess|date=22 May 1991|publisher=Law Society Gazette|accessdate=2011-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318095422/http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/criminal-law-insanity-r-v-burgess|archive-date=18 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The form of special verdict provided for by this Act was commonly known as guilty but insane.

By law, at least one of these had to be a [[woman]]. The Commissioners of the board went round the country seeing that those detained under the various mental and mental deficiency Acts were legally in custody and that care was proper and moneys and other properties owned by patients were not being misused or stolen.

The elaborate interpretive commentary on the law was written by three dominant figures in the [[racial hygiene]] movement: [[Ernst R\u00fcdin]], [[Arthur G\u00fctt]] and the lawyer [[Falk Ruttke]]. The law itself was based on a 'model' American law developed by [[Harry H. Laughlin]]. There were three amendments by 1935, most making minor adjustments to how the statute operated or clarifying bureaucratic aspects (such as who paid for the operations). The most significant changes allowed the Higher Court to renounce a patient's right to appeal, and to fine physicians who did not report patients who they knew would qualify for sterilisation under the law.

The legal quota was: Governmental bodies - 2. 0% (Non-clerical - 1. 9%) Private enterprises - 1. 6% (Specialized juridical person - 1. 9%) The quota was changed in 1998 as follows: Governmental bodies - 2. 1% (Non-clerical - 1. 9%) Private enterprises - 1. 8% (Specialized juridical person - 2. 1%) This ratio does not include mentally ill persons.

After Gr\u00fcnenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt; however, as part of the settlement, Gr\u00fcnenthal paid 100 million DM into a special foundation. The German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500-25,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100-450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation has run out of money).

It was regarding \"Marion\", a [[pseudonym]] for the 14-year-old girl at the centre of this case, who suffered from intellectual disabilities, severe deafness, epilepsy and other disorders. Her parents, a married couple from the [[Northern Territory]] sought an order from the [[Family Court of Australia]] authorising them to have Marion undergo a hysterectomy and an oophrectomy (removal of ovaries). The practical effect would be sterilisation and preventing Marion from being able to have children and many of the hormonal effects of adulthood. The [[High Court of Australia]] recognised the right of everyone to bodily integrity under national and international law, and made a distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic surgical procedures as well as the duty of surrogates to act in the best interests of the incompetent patient. In the case, the High Court ruled that while parents may consent to medical treatment for their children, the authority does not extend to treatment not in the child's best interests. Also, the Court held that if medical treatment has sterilisation as its principal objective, parents do not have the authority to consent on behalf of their child.\n* 1992 - The Disabled Persons Act, Act Number 5 of 1992 was adopted by Zimbabwe.

The Act had two main purposes: The first was to add a new criterion to the statutory tests applied by a sheriff or the Scottish Ministers when considering whether to order the discharge of a restricted patient. The sheriff and the Scottish Ministers must now refuse to order a discharge (either conditional or absolute) if satisfied that the patient has a mental disorder, the effect of which is that continuing detention in hospital is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. That is so whether or not the patient is to receive medical treatment for the mental disorder. The second is to introduce a right of appeal against a decision, notification or recommendation of a sheriff in relation to an appeal brought by a restricted patient in terms of Part VI of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. The right of appeal against the sheriff's decision, notification or recommendation is conferred on both the patient and the Scottish Ministers. The appeal is to the [[Court of Session]]. The Act also widens the term '[[mental disorder]]', which appears in earlier legislation, to include a [[personality disorder]].\n* 1999 - [[ADAPT \u2013 Able Disable All People Together]] established the National Resource Centre for Inclusion (NRCI), in [[Mumbai]], to include disabled children from special schools into non-special schools.<ref name=\"hindu2003\"/><ref name=\"internationalforum1\"/>\n\n==2000s==\n* 2000 - The Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours take place in Toronto, ON at the CAMH facility on Queen St West.
