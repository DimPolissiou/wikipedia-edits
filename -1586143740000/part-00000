He was, alongside [[Cadmus]] and [[Bellerophon]], the greatest [[Greek hero]] and slayer of monsters before the days of [[Heracles]].<ref>[[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi, Karl]], 1959. ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (London: Thames and Hudson) p. 75.</ref> He beheaded the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]] for [[Polydectes]] and saved [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. He was the son of [[Zeus]] and the mortal [[Dana\u00eb]], as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of Heracles.\n\n==Etymology==\nBecause of the obscurity of the name \"Perseus\" and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus' native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. In that regard [[Robert Graves]] has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''p\u00e9rthein'', \"to waste, ravage, sack, destroy\") some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]] (''Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin''), the ''\u2013eus'' suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the [[aorist]] stem, ''pers-''. ''Pers-eus'' therefore is a \"sacker of cities\", that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\nThe further origin of ''perth-'' is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root as ''*bher-'', from which Latin ''ferio'', \"strike\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=J. B. |title=Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Griechischen|language=de |location=Munich |publisher=R. Oldenbourg |year=1950 |isbn= }}</ref> This corresponds to [[Julius Pokorny]]\u2019s ''*bher-''(3), \"scrape, cut.\" Ordinarily ''*bh-'' descends to Greek as ''ph-''. This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the ''\u2013th\u2013'' in ''p\u00e9rthein'', which the Greeks would have preferred from a putative ''*ph\u00e9rthein''. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the ''perse-'' in [[Persephone]], goddess of death. [[John Chadwick]] in the second edition of ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'' speculates about the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] goddess  ''pe-re-*82'', attested on the [[Pylos|PY]] Tn&nbsp;316 tablet ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1f\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc5a}}) and tentatively reconstructed as ''*Preswa''.\n\nA Greek folk etymology connected \"Perseus\" to the name of the [[Persian people]], whom they called the ''P\u00e9rsai'' (from [[Old Persian]] ''P\u0101rsa'' \"Persia, a Persian\"). The native name of this people, however, has always had an ''-a-'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus, vii.61.</ref> recounts this story, devising a foreign son, [[Perses_(son_of_Andromeda_and_Perseus)|Perses]], from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently also the Persians<ref>Herodotus vii.150.</ref> knew the story, as [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] tried to use it to bribe the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===Origin at Buttos===\n\nPerseus was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], the daughter of [[Acrisius]], King of [[Argos]]. Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the [[Delphi|oracle at Delphi]], who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. In order to keep Dana\u00eb childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of his palace:<ref>\"Even thus endured Dana\u00eb in her beauty to change the light of day for brass-bound walls; and in that chamber, secret as the grave, she was held close\" ([[Sophocles]], ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''). In post-Renaissance paintings the setting is often a locked tower.</ref> This [[mytheme]] is also connected to [[Ares]], [[Oenopion]], [[Eurystheus]], and others. Zeus came to her in the form of a shower of gold, and impregnated her.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trzaskoma|first=Stephen|title=Anthology of classical myth: primary sources in translation|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis, IN|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87220-721-9|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Soon after, their child was born; Perseus\u2014\"Perseus Eurymedon,<ref>''Eurymedon'': \"far-ruling\"</ref> for his mother gave him this name as well\" (Apollonius of Rhodes, ''[[Argonautica]]'' IV).\n\nFearful for his future, but unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods by killing the offspring of Zeus and his daughter, Acrisius cast the two into the sea in a wooden chest.<ref>For the familiar motif of the [[Exposed Child]] in the account of [[Moses]] especially, see {{cite journal|last=Childs|first=Brevard S.|authorlink=Brevard S.

Perseus believed Polydectes was less than honourable, and protected his mother from him; then Polydectes plotted to send Perseus away in disgrace. He held a large banquet where each guest was expected to bring a gift.<ref group=\"note\">Such a banquet, to which each guest brings a gift, was an ''eranos''. The name of ''Polydectes'', \"receiver of many\", characterizes his role as intended host but is also a [[euphemism]] for the Lord of the Underworld, as in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Demeter 9, 17.</ref> Polydectes requested that the guests bring horses, under the pretense that he was collecting contributions for the hand of [[Hippodamia]], daughter of Oinomaos. Perseus had no horse to give, so he asked Polydectes to name the gift; he would not refuse it. Polydectes held Perseus to his rash promise and demanded the head of the only mortal [[Gorgon]],<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]].''

Zeus gave him an [[adamant]]ine sword (a [[Harpe]]) and Hades' [[Cap of invisibility|helm of darkness]] to hide. Hermes lent Perseus [[Talaria|winged sandals]] to fly, and Athena gave him a polished shield. Perseus then proceeded to the Gorgons' cave.\n\nIn the cave he came upon the sleeping [[Medusa]]. By viewing Medusa's reflection in his polished shield, he safely approached and cut off her head. From her neck sprang [[Pegasus]] (\"he who sprang\") and [[Chrysaor]] (\"sword of gold\"), the result of Poseidon and Medusa's mating. The other two Gorgons pursued Perseus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.  37\u201339.</ref> but, wearing his helm of darkness, he escaped. From here he proceeded to visit [[Atlas (mythology)|King Atlas]] who had refused him hospitality; in revenge Perseus turned him to stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage to Andromeda===\n\n[[File:Julius Troschel Perseus und Andromeda 1840-50.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Julius Troschel: ''Perseus und Andromeda'', c. 1845, [[Neue Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]]]\n\nOn the way back to Seriphos, Perseus stopped in the kingdom of [[Aethiopia]]. This mythical Ethiopia was ruled by King [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and Queen [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]].  Cassiopeia, having boasted that her daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] was equal in beauty to the [[Nereid]]s, drew the vengeance of [[Poseidon]], who sent an inundation on the land and a sea serpent, [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], which destroyed man and beast. The [[Siwa Oasis|oracle of Ammon]] announced that no relief would be found until the king exposed his daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] to the monster, and so she was fastened naked to a rock on the shore. Perseus slew the monster and, setting her free, claimed her in marriage.\n\n[[Image:Perseus and andromeda amphora.jpg|thumb|right|Perseus rescuing Andromeda from Cetus, depicted on an [[amphora]] in the [[Altes Museum]], Berlin]]\n\nPerseus married Andromeda in spite of [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]], to whom she had before been promised.

Their descendants also ruled Mycenae, from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom. Among the Perseids was the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].</ref> After her death she was placed by Athena among the constellations in the northern sky, near Perseus and Cassiopeia.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Catasterismi]]''.</ref> [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times [[Pierre Corneille]]) made the episode of Perseus and Andromeda the subject of tragedies, and its incidents were represented in many ancient works of art.\n\nAs Perseus was flying in his return above the sands of [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], according to [[Apollonius of Rhodes]],<ref>''[[Argonautica]]'', IV.</ref> the falling drops of Medusa's blood created a race of toxic serpents, one of whom was to kill the Argonaut [[Mopsus]]. On returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa's head, and made his brother Dictys, consort of Dana\u00eb, king.\n\n===Oracle fulfilled===\n\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - Perseus.jpeg|thumb|''The Doom Fulfilled'', 1888, [[Southampton City Art Gallery]], part of a series of paintings revolving around Perseus, created by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]]|left]]\n\nPerseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a [[votive gift]] to [[Athena]], who set it on [[Zeus]]' shield (which she carried), as the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' (see also: [[Aegis]]). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.2 2.16.2]</ref> he did not return to Argos, but went instead to [[Larissa]], where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the [[Quoits|quoit]] and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.\n\n[[File:If looks could kill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Burne-Jones]]: ''The Baleful Head'', 1885, [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].<br><small>This part of the series plays with the theme of the reflected gaze, as Perseus has Andromeda look at the Gorgon's head, but only as reflected in the well.</small>]]\n\nIn the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'',<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4].</ref> the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when Acrisius learned of his grandson's approach, mindful of the oracle he went into voluntary exile in [[Pelasgians|Pelasgiotis]] ([[Thessaly]]). There Teutamides, king of [[Larissa]], was holding [[funeral games]] for his father. Competing in the discus throw, Perseus' throw veered - and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly. In a third tradition,<ref>[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], 5.177</ref> Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother [[Proetus]]. Perseus turned the brother into stone with the Gorgon's head and restored Acrisius to the throne. Then, accused by Acrisius of lying about having slain Medusa, Perseus proves himself by showing Acrisius the Gorgon's head, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nHaving killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to [[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]] (\"great mourning\"), son of [[Proetus]], and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of [[Tiryns]]. The story is related in Pausanias,<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.3 2.16.3]</ref> who gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to have become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have proved a creative solution to a difficult problem.\n\n===King of Mycenae===\n\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Liberazione di Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Andromeda liberata da Perseo'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (c. 1515) \u2013 [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nThe two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus\u2014for he was an authentic historical figure to the Greeks\u2014 are Pausanias and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''. Pausanias<ref>2.15.4, 2.16.3\u20136, 2.18.1</ref> asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called ''Persea''. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel's underground cistern. He states also that [[Atreus]] stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why [[Heinrich Schliemann]] named the largest [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] tomb the [[Treasury of Atreus]].\n\nApart from these more historical references, the only accounts of him are from folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named ''myces'') at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named after the lady Mycene, daughter of [[Inachus]], mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]''.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''Megalai Ehoiai'' fr. 246.</ref> For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus ''fortified'' Mycenae according to Apollodorus<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4], ''pros-teichisas'', \"walling in\"</ref> along with [[Midea, Greece|Midea]], an action that implies that they both previously existed. It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing. Perseus took up official residence in Mycenae with Andromeda where he had a long, successful reign as king.\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=[[King of Argos]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Acrisius]]\n|\n after=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Tiryns]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Mycenae]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=''none''<br>(founder)\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Descendants==\n{{Main|Perseides}}\n\nPerseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]], and two daughters, [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]] and [[Autochthe]]. Perses was left in [[Aethiopia]] and was believed to have been an ancestor of the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included the great hero, [[Heracles]], stepson of [[Amphitryon]], son of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]]. The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.\n\nA statement by the Athenian orator, [[Isocrates]]<ref>4.07</ref> helps to date Perseus approximately. He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, [[Electryon]], [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], and [[Heracles]], who was a contemporary of [[Eurystheus]]. [[Atreus]] was one generation later, a total of five generations.<!--original research:Taking 1223 as the start of Atreus' reign and assuming an average generation of 25 years brings the date for the start of Perseus' reign to about 1373, which is approximately consistent with the archaeology.\n\nIt would have been Perseus after all who had the Cyclopean wall built ca. 1350. The Egyptian embassy of about 1380 might have been for the purpose of cementing diplomatic relations with the new dynasties in power. It is logical to assume that the first act of the Pelopids when they obtained the throne of Mycenae would be to strengthen the defenses, adding the extension to the north and the secret cistern about 1220.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA BEFORE THE TIME OF HERACLES TO THE AFTERMATH OF THE TROJAN WAR\n|- href=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\"\n| resource=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\" height width |''Children''\n|[[Perses (son of Perseus)|Perses]]\n| href=\"Southampton City Art Gallery\" |Alcaeus\n| href=\"Pre-Raphaelite\" |[[Sthenelus]]\n| href=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" |[[Heleus]]\n| Mestor\n| href=\"Hippodamia\" |[[Electryon]]\n| href=\"Gorgon\" |[[Cynurus]]\n|[[Gorgophone]]\n| href=\"Ovid\" |[[Autochthe]]\n|-\n|''Grandchildren''\n|''[[Achaemenid]] [[Persians]]''\n|[[Amphitryon]], [[Anaxo (daughter of Alcaeus)|Anaxo]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]]\n|[[Eurystheus]], [[Alcyone]], Medusa\n| \u2013\n|Hippothoe\n|[[Alcmene]], Stratobates, Anactor, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, [[Amphimachus of Mycenae|Amphimachus]], Lysinomus, Archelaus, Chirimachus, [[Licymnius]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Aphareus of Messenia|Aphareus]], [[Leucippus of Messenia|Leucippus]], [[Tyndareus]], [[Icarius of Sparta|Icarius]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Third Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|Melas, [[Argius]], [[Oeonus]]\n|[[Admete]], [[Perimedes]], [[Alexander]], Iphimedon, [[Eurybius]], [[Mentor]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Taphius]]\n|[[Heracles]], [[Iphicles]], [[Oeonus]], [[Melas (mythology)|Melas]], [[Argius]],\n| \u2013\n|[[Idas]], [[Lynceus of Messenia|Lynceus]], [[Peisus]]; [[Hilaeira]]; [[Castor and Pollux]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Clytemnestra]], [[Timandra (mythology)|Timandra]], [[Phoebe of Messenia|Phoebe]], Philonoe; [[Penelope]], Perileos, Thoas, Iphthime, Aletes, Imeusimus, Damasippus\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fourth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Iolaus]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Pterelaus (son of Taphius)|Pterelaus]]\n|[[Heracles#Children|Heraclides]], [[Iolaus]]\n|\n|[[Mnesileos]]; [[Anogon]]; [[Cleopatra Alcyone]]; [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]], [[Orestes]], [[Chrysothemis]], Laodice,<ref group=\"note\">Laodice may be the daughter of Agamemnon mentioned by Homer, who is generally equated with [[Electra]].</ref> [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]; [[Ladocus]]; [[Telemachus]], [[Poliporthes]], [[Acusilaus]], [[Italus]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fifth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Chromius]], Tyrannus, Antiochus, Mestor, Chersidamas, Eueres, Comaetho\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n|\n|Medon, Strophius; [[Tisamenus (son of Orestes)|Tisamenus]], [[Penthilus]]; Persepolis, [[Latinus]], [[Poliporthes]]\n| \u2013\n|}\n\n==On Pegasus==\nThe replacement of [[Bellerophon]] as the tamer and rider of [[Pegasus]] by the more familiar [[culture hero]] Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the [[Renaissance]].

He was, alongside [[Cadmus]] and [[Bellerophon]], the greatest [[Greek hero]] and slayer of monsters before the days of [[Heracles]].<ref>[[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi, Karl]], 1959. ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (London: Thames and Hudson) p. 75.</ref> He beheaded the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]] for [[Polydectes]] and saved [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. He was the son of [[Zeus]] and the mortal [[Dana\u00eb]], as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of Heracles.\n\n==Etymology==\nBecause of the obscurity of the name \"Perseus\" and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus' native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. In that regard [[Robert Graves]] has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''p\u00e9rthein'', \"to waste, ravage, sack, destroy\") some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]] (''Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin''), the ''\u2013eus'' suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the [[aorist]] stem, ''pers-''. ''Pers-eus'' therefore is a \"sacker of cities\", that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\nThe further origin of ''perth-'' is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root as ''*bher-'', from which Latin ''ferio'', \"strike\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=J. B. |title=Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Griechischen|language=de |location=Munich |publisher=R. Oldenbourg |year=1950 |isbn= }}</ref> This corresponds to [[Julius Pokorny]]\u2019s ''*bher-''(3), \"scrape, cut.\" Ordinarily ''*bh-'' descends to Greek as ''ph-''. This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the ''\u2013th\u2013'' in ''p\u00e9rthein'', which the Greeks would have preferred from a putative ''*ph\u00e9rthein''. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the ''perse-'' in [[Persephone]], goddess of death. [[John Chadwick]] in the second edition of ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'' speculates about the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] goddess  ''pe-re-*82'', attested on the [[Pylos|PY]] Tn&nbsp;316 tablet ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1f\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc5a}}) and tentatively reconstructed as ''*Preswa''.\n\nA Greek folk etymology connected \"Perseus\" to the name of the [[Persian people]], whom they called the ''P\u00e9rsai'' (from [[Old Persian]] ''P\u0101rsa'' \"Persia, a Persian\"). The native name of this people, however, has always had an ''-a-'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus, vii.61.</ref> recounts this story, devising a foreign son, [[Perses_(son_of_Andromeda_and_Perseus)|Perses]], from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently also the Persians<ref>Herodotus vii.150.</ref> knew the story, as [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] tried to use it to bribe the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===Origin at Argos===\n\nPerseus was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], the daughter of [[Acrisius]], King of [[Argos]]. Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the [[Delphi|oracle at Delphi]], who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. In order to keep Dana\u00eb childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of his palace:<ref>\"Even thus endured Dana\u00eb in her beauty to change the light of day for brass-bound walls; and in that chamber, secret as the grave, she was held close\" ([[Sophocles]], ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''). In post-Renaissance paintings the setting is often a locked tower.</ref> This [[mytheme]] is also connected to [[Ares]], [[Oenopion]], [[Eurystheus]], and others. Zeus came to her in the form of a shower of gold, and impregnated her.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trzaskoma|first=Stephen|title=Anthology of classical myth: primary sources in translation|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis, IN|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87220-721-9|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Soon after, their child was born; Perseus\u2014\"Perseus Eurymedon,<ref>''Eurymedon'': \"far-ruling\"</ref> for his mother gave him this name as well\" (Apollonius of Rhodes, ''[[Argonautica]]'' IV).\n\nFearful for his future, but unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods by killing the offspring of Zeus and his daughter, Acrisius cast the two into the sea in a wooden chest.<ref>For the familiar motif of the [[Exposed Child]] in the account of [[Moses]] especially, see {{cite journal|last=Childs|first=Brevard S.|authorlink=Brevard S.

He held a large banquet where each guest was expected to bring a gift.<ref group=\"note\">Such a banquet, to which each guest brings a gift, was an ''eranos''.

The [[Siwa Oasis|oracle of Ammon]] announced that no relief would be found until the king exposed his daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] to the monster, and so she was fastened naked to a rock on the shore.

Their descendants also ruled Mycenae, from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom. Among the Perseids was the great hero [[Heracles]].

On returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa's head, and made his brother Dictys, consort of Dana\u00eb, king.\n\n===Oracle fulfilled===\n\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - Perseus.jpeg|thumb|''The Doom Fulfilled'', 1888, [[Southampton City Art Gallery]], part of a series of paintings revolving around Perseus, created by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]]|left]]\n\nPerseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a [[votive gift]] to [[Athena]], who set it on [[Zeus]]' shield (which she carried), as the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' (see also: [[Aegis]]). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.2 2.16.2]</ref> he did not return to Argos, but went instead to [[Larissa]], where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the [[Quoits|quoit]] and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.\n\n[[File:If looks could kill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Burne-Jones]]: ''The Baleful Head'', 1885, [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].<br><small>This part of the series plays with the theme of the reflected gaze, as Perseus has Andromeda look at the Gorgon's head, but only as reflected in the well.</small>]]\n\nIn the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'',<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4].</ref> the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when Acrisius learned of his grandson's approach, mindful of the oracle he went into voluntary exile in [[Pelasgians|Pelasgiotis]] ([[Thessaly]]). There Teutamides, king of [[Larissa]], was holding [[funeral games]] for his father. Competing in the discus throw, Perseus' throw veered - and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly. In a third tradition,<ref>[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], 5.177</ref> Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother [[Proetus]]. Perseus turned the brother into stone with the Gorgon's head and restored Acrisius to the throne. Then, accused by Acrisius of lying about having slain Medusa, Perseus proves himself by showing Acrisius the Gorgon's head, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nHaving killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to [[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]] (\"great mourning\"), son of [[Proetus]], and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of [[Tiryns]]. The story is related in Pausanias,<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.3 2.16.3]</ref> who gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to have become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have proved a creative solution to a difficult problem.\n\n===King of Mycenae===\n\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Liberazione di Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Andromeda liberata da Perseo'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (c. 1515) \u2013 [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nThe two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus\u2014for he was an authentic historical figure to the Greeks\u2014 are Pausanias and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''. Pausanias<ref>2.15.4, 2.16.3\u20136, 2.18.1</ref> asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called ''Persea''. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel's underground cistern. He states also that [[Atreus]] stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why [[Heinrich Schliemann]] named the largest [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] tomb the [[Treasury of Atreus]].\n\nApart from these more historical references, the only accounts of him are from folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named ''myces'') at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named after the lady Mycene, daughter of [[Inachus]], mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]''.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''Megalai Ehoiai'' fr. 246.</ref> For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus ''fortified'' Mycenae according to Apollodorus<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4], ''pros-teichisas'', \"walling in\"</ref> along with [[Midea, Greece|Midea]], an action that implies that they both previously existed. It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing.

Perses was left in [[Aethiopia]] and was believed to have been an ancestor of the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included the great hero, [[Heracles]], stepson of [[Amphitryon]], son of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]]. The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.\n\nA statement by the Athenian orator, [[Isocrates]]<ref>4.07</ref> helps to date Perseus approximately. He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, [[Electryon]], [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], and [[Heracles]], who was a contemporary of [[Eurystheus]]. [[Atreus]] was one generation later, a total of five generations.<!--original research:Taking 1223 as the start of Atreus' reign and assuming an average generation of 25 years brings the date for the start of Perseus' reign to about 1373, which is approximately consistent with the archaeology.\n\nIt would have been Perseus after all who had the Cyclopean wall built ca. 1350. The Egyptian embassy of about 1380 might have been for the purpose of cementing diplomatic relations with the new dynasties in power. It is logical to assume that the first act of the Pelopids when they obtained the throne of Mycenae would be to strengthen the defenses, adding the extension to the north and the secret cistern about 1220.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA BEFORE THE TIME OF HERACLES TO THE AFTERMATH OF THE TROJAN WAR\n|- href=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\"\n| resource=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\" height width |''Children''\n|[[Perses (son of Perseus)|Perses]]\n| href=\"Southampton City Art Gallery\" |Alcaeus\n| href=\"Pre-Raphaelite\" |[[Sthenelus]]\n| href=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" |[[Heleus]]\n| Mestor\n| href=\"Hippodamia\" |[[Electryon]]\n| href=\"Gorgon\" |[[Cynurus]]\n|[[Gorgophone]]\n| href=\"Ovid\" |[[Autochthe]]\n|-\n|''Grandchildren''\n|''[[Achaemenid]] [[Persians]]''\n|[[Amphitryon]], [[Anaxo (daughter of Alcaeus)|Anaxo]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]]\n|[[Eurystheus]], [[Alcyone]], Medusa\n| \u2013\n|Hippothoe\n|[[Alcmene]], Stratobates, Anactor, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, [[Amphimachus of Mycenae|Amphimachus]], Lysinomus, Archelaus, Chirimachus, [[Licymnius]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Aphareus of Messenia|Aphareus]], [[Leucippus of Messenia|Leucippus]], [[Tyndareus]], [[Icarius of Sparta|Icarius]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Third Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|Melas, [[Argius]], [[Oeonus]]\n|[[Admete]], [[Perimedes]], [[Alexander]], Iphimedon, [[Eurybius]], [[Mentor]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Taphius]]\n|[[Heracles]], [[Iphicles]], [[Oeonus]], [[Melas (mythology)|Melas]], [[Argius]],\n| \u2013\n|[[Idas]], [[Lynceus of Messenia|Lynceus]], [[Peisus]]; [[Hilaeira]]; [[Castor and Pollux]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Clytemnestra]], [[Timandra (mythology)|Timandra]], [[Phoebe of Messenia|Phoebe]], Philonoe; [[Penelope]], Perileos, Thoas, Iphthime, Aletes, Imeusimus, Damasippus\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fourth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Iolaus]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Pterelaus (son of Taphius)|Pterelaus]]\n|[[Heracles#Children|Heraclides]], [[Iolaus]]\n|\n|[[Mnesileos]]; [[Anogon]]; [[Cleopatra Alcyone]]; [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]], [[Orestes]], [[Chrysothemis]], Laodice,<ref group=\"note\">Laodice may be the daughter of Agamemnon mentioned by Homer, who is generally equated with [[Electra]].</ref> [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]; [[Ladocus]]; [[Telemachus]], [[Poliporthes]], [[Acusilaus]], [[Italus]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fifth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Chromius]], Tyrannus, Antiochus, Mestor, Chersidamas, Eueres, Comaetho\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n|\n|Medon, Strophius; [[Tisamenus (son of Orestes)|Tisamenus]], [[Penthilus]]; Persepolis, [[Latinus]], [[Poliporthes]]\n| \u2013\n|}\n\n==On Pegasus==\nThe replacement of [[Bellerophon]] as the tamer and rider of [[Pegasus]] by the more familiar [[culture hero]] Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the [[Renaissance]].

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.
