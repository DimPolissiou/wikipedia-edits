In 2018, he graduated from Columbia Business School with an MBA. He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Maryland]].\n\n== Early years ==\nCosta played [[high school football]] at [[Holy Cross Academy (New Jersey)|Holy Cross High School]], where he was a starting [[guard (American football)|guard]] who played in every game during his three seasons on the team. \n\nHe accepted a scholarship from the [[University of Maryland]], where he was a two-year starter, playing mostly [[guard (American football)|guard]] until his senior season when he started at [[center (American football)|center]].\n\n== Professional football career ==\n\n=== Dallas Cowboys ===\nCosta was signed by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] after the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. He began as the fourth string center, with [[Kyle Kosier]] and Travis Bright ahead of him, but when Kosier got hurt and Bright struggled, Costa became the primary backup. He impressed the coaching staff and made the opening day 53-man roster. As a rookie, he earned his first career start at [[guard (American football)|left guard]] in place of the injured [[Kyle Kosier]] and [[Montrae Holland]], in the seventh game of the season against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].\n\nHe performed well during the [[2011 NFL season|2011]] training camp and preseason, before suffering a strained right [[posterior cruciate ligament]] on August 24, [[2011 NFL season|2011]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Knee injury stalls rise for Cowboys center Costa |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/article3828719.html |author=Clarence Hill, Jr. |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2016-09-06}}</ref>  After contract restructuring negotiations fell through, five time [[Pro Bowl]] center [[Andre Gurode]] was cut before the fourth preseason game and Costa became the starting [[center (American football)|center]] for the year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cowboys cut center Andre Gurode|url=http://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/6906080/dallas-cowboys-cut-pro-bowl-center-andre-gurode|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref> Because of his small size for the position, as the season wore on he was exposed and struggled in his blocking assignments against bigger defenders.\n\nIn [[2012 NFL season|2012]], the Cowboys signed [[free agent]]s [[guard (American football)|guard]]s [[Mackenzy Bernadeau]] and [[Nate Livings]] to help protect Costa against stronger defensive fronts. [[Ryan Cook (American football)|Ryan Cook]] replaced him in the season opener after one series, because he was limited by a back injury he carried from training camp. He returned to play against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and arguably had his best game as a pro, with the Ravens yielding a franchise record 227 rushing yards. In the next game against the [[Carolina Panthers]], he suffered a  dislocated ankle and was eventually placed on the [[injured reserve list]], after playing only six quarters in the season.\n\nLooking to improve the [[center (American football)|center]] position, the Cowboys selected [[Travis Frederick]] in the first round of the [[2013 NFL Draft]] and moved Costa to a backup role during training camp.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4709668/phil-costa-keeps-fighting | title=Phil Costa healthy, fighting for job | accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> He was eventually waived in a [[salary cap]] move on March 7, [[2014 NFL season|2014]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/10569561/dallas-cowboys-release-phil-costa-make-other-moves-get-cap | title=Cowboys clear salary cap room | accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Indianapolis Colts ===\nCosta signed a two-year contract with the [[Indianapolis Colts]] on March 13, 2014.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.espn.com/espn/wire?id=10603478&section=nfl | title=Indianapolis signs free agent center Phil Costa | accessdate=February 19, 2017}}</ref> He retired at the age of 26 on April 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/indianapolis-colts/post/_/id/5221/costas-retirement-puts-colts-in-tough-position|title=Costa's retirement puts Colts in tough spot |last=Wells |first=Mike |work=ESPN.com|date=April 21, 2014|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Football Career ==\nCosta is the author of The Transition Playbook for ATHLETES: How Elite Athletes WIN After Sports.\n\nAfter the NFL, Costa worked in medical device sales and actively participated in more than 500 heart surgeries.

In 2018, he graduated from Columbia Business School with an MBA. He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Maryland]].\n\n== Early years ==\nCosta played [[high school football]] at [[Holy Cross Academy (New Jersey)|Holy Cross High School]], where he was a starting [[guard (American football)|guard]] who played in every game during his three seasons on the team. \n\nHe accepted a scholarship from the [[University of Maryland]], where he was a two-year starter, playing mostly [[guard (American football)|guard]] until his senior season when he started at [[center (American football)|center]].\n\n== Professional football career ==\n\n=== Dallas Cowboys ===\nCosta was signed by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] after the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. He began as the fourth string center, with [[Kyle Kosier]] and Travis Bright ahead of him, but when Kosier got hurt and Bright struggled, Costa became the primary backup. He impressed the coaching staff and made the opening day 53-man roster. As a rookie, he earned his first career start at [[guard (American football)|left guard]] in place of the injured [[Kyle Kosier]] and [[Montrae Holland]], in the seventh game of the season against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].\n\nHe performed well during the [[2011 NFL season|2011]] training camp and preseason, before suffering a strained right [[posterior cruciate ligament]] on August 24, [[2011 NFL season|2011]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Knee injury stalls rise for Cowboys center Costa |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/article3828719.html |author=Clarence Hill, Jr. |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2016-09-06}}</ref>  After contract restructuring negotiations fell through, five time [[Pro Bowl]] center [[Andre Gurode]] was cut before the fourth preseason game and Costa became the starting [[center (American football)|center]] for the year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cowboys cut center Andre Gurode|url=http://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/6906080/dallas-cowboys-cut-pro-bowl-center-andre-gurode|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref> Because of his small size for the position, as the season wore on he was exposed and struggled in his blocking assignments against bigger defenders.\n\nIn [[2012 NFL season|2012]], the Cowboys signed [[free agent]]s [[guard (American football)|guard]]s [[Mackenzy Bernadeau]] and [[Nate Livings]] to help protect Costa against stronger defensive fronts. [[Ryan Cook (American football)|Ryan Cook]] replaced him in the season opener after one series, because he was limited by a back injury he carried from training camp. He returned to play against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and arguably had his best game as a pro, with the Ravens yielding a franchise record 227 rushing yards.
