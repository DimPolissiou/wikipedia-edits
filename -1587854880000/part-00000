The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or [[Glass engraving|glass]] are engraved, or may provide an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called \"engravings\". Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques in [[printmaking]]. [[Wood engraving]] is a form of [[relief printing]] and is not covered in this article.\n\nEngraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic [[printmaking]], in [[mapmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by various [[photographic]] processes in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques.\n\n\"Engraving\" is also loosely but incorrectly used for any old black and white print; it requires a degree of expertise to distinguish engravings from prints using other techniques such as [[etching]] in particular, but also [[mezzotint]] and other techniques. Many [[old master print]]s also combine techniques on the same plate, further confusing matters.  [[Line engraving]] and [[steel engraving]] cover use for reproductive prints, illustrations in books and magazines, and similar uses, mostly in the 19th century, and often not actually using engraving.\nTraditional engraving, by [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] or with the use of machines, continues to be practised by [[goldsmith]]s, glass engravers, [[Gunsmith#Gun Engraver|gunsmiths]] and others, while modern industrial techniques such as [[photoengraving]] and [[laser engraving]] have many important applications. [[Engraved gem]]s were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers [[relief]] as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.\n\n==Terms==\n[[Image:gravers.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of hand engraving tools]]\n\nOther terms often used for printed engravings are '''copper engraving''', '''copper-plate engraving''' or ''[[line engraving]]''. [[Steel engraving]] is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, [[letterhead]]s and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes and other forms of [[security printing]]. Especially in the past, \"engraving\" was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or [[mezzotint]]. \"Hand engraving\" is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also \"hand engraved\", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.\n\n==Process==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Louis George Gravur 1.jpg|thumb|right|At an engravers workshop: Miniature engraving on a ''[[Louis George]]'' watch movement: Smallest engraving of the royal [[Prussia]]n eagle on a watch movement. It takes about 100 passes to create the figure.]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Norblin Ecce Homo 02.jpg\n| width1 = 205\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Norblin Ecce Homo 01.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Ecce Homo'' by [[Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine|Jan Norblin]], original print (left) and copper plate (right) with composition reversed ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).\n}}\n\nEach graver is different and has its own use. '''Engravers''' use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/214.htm|title=Abraham Bosse|year=1645|publisher=Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|accessdate=15 July 2008}}</ref> However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. [[Die (manufacturing)|Dies]] used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.\n\nIn addition to hand engraving, there are engraving machines that require less human finesse and are not directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a [[pantograph]]ic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.\n\n===Tools and gravers or burins===\nGravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as \"wriggle\" cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called '''bright-cut engraving'''), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as [[mezzotint]] rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.\n\nMusical instrument engraving on American-made brass instruments flourished in the 1920s and utilizes a specialized engraving technique where a flat graver is \"walked\" across the surface of the instrument to make zig-zag lines and patterns. The method for \"walking\" the graver may also be referred to as \"wriggle\" or \"wiggle\" cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry. Wriggle cuts are commonly found on silver Western jewelry and other Western metal work.\n\n===Tool geometry===\n[[File:2008-engraving.jpg|right|thumb|Stone engraving]]\nTool geometry is extremely important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a \"face\", which is the top of the graver, and a \"heel\", which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.\n\n===Tool sharpening===\nSharpening a graver or burin requires either a [[sharpening stone]] or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which is essential in creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on \"feel\" and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.\n\n===Artwork design===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Aachen Preparatory drawing for Aegidius Sadeler's print.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Portrait of Rudolph II MET DP102234.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Preparatory drawing by [[Hans von Aachen]] for a print with effigy of Emperor Rudolph II, [[National Library of Poland]]<ref name=print/> and [[Aegidius Sadeler]]'s print from 1603, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].\n}}\n\nDesign or artwork is generally prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers are able to draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or [[Stipple engraving|stippled]]. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.\n\n===Handpieces===\nOriginally, handpieces varied little in design as the common use was to push with the handle placed firmly in the center of the palm. With modern pneumatic engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals. The most widely known hand engraving tool maker, GRS Tools in Kansas is an American-owned and operated company that manufacture handpieces as well as many other tools for various applications in metal engraving.\n\n===Cutting the surface===\n[[File:Louis George Meistergraveurin 2.jpg|thumb|left|Master engraver ennobling a watch movement. Top level engravers work under a [[stereo microscope]]. ]]\n\nThe actual engraving is traditionally done by a combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional \"hand push\" process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the \"hand push\" effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.\n\nHand engraving artists today employ a combination of hand push, pneumatic, rotary, or hammer and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create \"bulino\" style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.\n\n===Finishing===\nFinishing the work is often necessary when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called \"burrs\" that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before lacquering or sealing, which may or may not be desired by the artist.\n\n===Modern hand engraving===\n[[File:Hand engraving tool.jpg|thumb|Hand Engraving Tool Example]]\n\nBecause of the high level of microscopic detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, [[counterfeit]]ing of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern [[banknote]]s are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand engraved images, nor can it be scanned. In the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.\n\nThe modern discipline of hand engraving, as it is called in a [[metalworking]] context, survives largely in a few specialized fields. The highest levels of the art are found on firearms and other metal weaponry, jewellery, and musical instruments.\n\nIn most commercial markets today, hand engraving has been replaced with milling using CNC engraving or [[milling machine]]s. Still, there are certain applications where use of hand engraving tools cannot be replaced.\n\n===Machine engraving===\n[[File:1847Colt Walker.jpg|thumb|1847 Colt Walker pistol with roll engraved cylinder]]\nIn some instances, images or designs can be transferred to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s [[pistol cylinder]]s were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.\n\n===Computer-aided machine engraving===\n[[File:Engraving on Corian.jpg|thumb|left|Computerized engraving on [[Corian]].]]\nEngraving machines such as the K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of .1&nbsp;\u00b5m and below. They are fully computer-controlled and the whole process of cylinder-making is fully automated.\n\nIt is now common place for retail stores (mostly jewellery, silverware or award stores) to have a small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator and the ability to do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.\n\nRetail engravers mainly use two different processes. The first and most common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through the surface of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.\n\nWith state-of-the-art machinery it is easy to have a simple, single item complete in under ten minutes.\nThe engraving process with diamonds is state-of-the-art since the 1960s.\n\nToday laser engraving machines are in development but still mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make approx. 8 Mio printing cylinders worldwide per year.\n\n==History==\n''For the printing process, see [[intaglio (printmaking)]].

The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing. [[Engraved gem]] is a term for any carved or engraved semi-precious stone; this was an important small-scale art form in the ancient world, and remained popular until the 19th century.\n[[File:Battle of Engravers by George Cruikshank 1828.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Battle of Engravers'', [[satire|satirical]] [[etching]] by [[George Cruikshank]], showing hypothetical battle between the engravers, including [[William Hogarth]], [[Antoine Masson]], [[William Woollett]], [[Jean-Joseph Balechou]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]].]]\nHowever the use of [[glass engraving]], usually using a wheel, to cut decorative scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of [[hardstone carving]]s, appears as early as the first century AD,<ref name=\"Caron\">Caron, B., A Roman Figure-Engraved Glass Bowl.

Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament.<ref name=\"Fleming\" /> It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and it seems likely that the engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.<ref name=\"Caron\" />\n\nIn the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s, in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gardner's art through the ages : the western perspective|last=Gardner, Helen, 1878-1946|publisher=|others=Kleiner, Fred S.|isbn=9781305633940|edition=Fifteenth |location=Boston, MA|pages=416|oclc=914290700|date = January 2016}}</ref> [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].\n\n[[File:Rembrandt - self portrait etching.jpg|thumb|right|Modern impression of Rembrandt's 1639 self-portrait, with the engraving plate.]]\nThereafter engraving tended to lose ground to [[etching]], which was a much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although [[Rembrandt]]'s prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, many of them have some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.\n\nBefore the advent of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, as they were cheaper to use in printing than photographic images.\n\nMany classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more \"elegant\" design is desired and a limited color range is acceptable.\n\n[[File:Buffalo nickles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buffalo nickel]]s, coins customised with engraving tools]] \nModifying the [[relief]] designs on coins is a craft dating back to the 18th century and today modified coins are known colloquially as [[hobo nickel]]s. In the United States, especially during the [[Great Depression]], coin engraving on the large-faced [[Buffalo nickel|Indian Head nickel]] became a way to help make ends meet. The craft continues today, and with modern equipment often produces stunning miniature sculptural artworks and floral scrollwork.<ref>[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/10/shaun-hughes-engraving/ Elaborate Floral Scrollwork Engraved on Coins] by Shaun Hughes embellishing existing coin faces with different styles of floral scrollwork (2016).  Retrieved May 27, 2018</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-20th century, a renaissance in hand-engraving began to take place. With the inventions of pneumatic hand-engraving systems that aided hand-engravers, the art and techniques of hand-engraving became more accessible.\n\n===Music engraving===\n{{main|Music engraving}}\nThe first music printed from engraved plates dates from 1446 and most printed music was produced through engraving from roughly 1700\u20131860. From 1860\u20131990 most printed music was produced through a combination of engraved master plates reproduced through offset lithography.\n\nThe first comprehensive account is given by Mme Delusse in her article \"Gravure en lettres, en g\u00e9ographie et en musique\" in [[Diderot]]'s Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by callipers, hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work. The process involved intensive pre-planning of the layout, and many manuscript scores with engraver's planning marks survive from the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Poole|first=H. Edmund|title=Music Printing and Publishing|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York|pages=40\u201354}}</ref>\n\nBy 1837 [[pewter]] had replaced copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (''Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce'', 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking to be carried out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very little is known about the practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gamble|first=William|title=Music Engraving and Printing: Historical and Technical Treatise|year=1923|publisher=Pitman|location=London}}</ref> By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.\n\n==Applications today==\n[[File:Ars moriendi (Meister E.S.), L.181.png|thumb|[[Ars moriendi]] engraving by Master ES, circa 1450]]\n\nExamples of contemporary uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants or on the inside of [[engagement ring|engagement]]- and [[wedding ring]]s to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy.  Another application of modern engraving is found in the [[printing]] industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto [[rotogravure]] cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1&nbsp;mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6&nbsp;\u00b5m chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed [[printing press]]es.  \nSome schools throughout the world are renowned for their teaching of engraving, like the [[\u00c9cole Estienne]] in Paris.\n\n==Creating tone==\n[[File:Claude Mellan - Face of Christ - WGA14764.jpg|thumb|''Sudarium of Saint Veronica'' by [[Claude Mellan]] (1649), a famous showpiece where the image is formed by a single continuous line, starting on the tip of Christ's nose.]]\n\nIn traditional engraving, which is a purely linear medium, the impression of [[half-tone]]s was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called [[hatching]]. When two sets of parallel-line ''hatchings'' intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as ''cross-hatching''. Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called [[stippling]], first used around 1505 by [[Giulio Campagnola]]. [[Claude Mellan]] was one of many 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the \"swelling line\") to give subtle effects of tone (as was [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]]) \u2013 see picture below. One famous example is his ''[[Veil of Veronica|Sudarium of Saint Veronica]]'' (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.\n\n==Biblical references==\nThe earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]]'s seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).\n\nEach of the two onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the high priest\u2019s [[ephod]] was engraved with the names of six different tribes of [[Israel]], and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest's turban, was engraved with the words: \"Holiness belongs to [[Adonai]].\" [[Bezalel]], along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.\u2014Ex 35:30\u201335; 28:9\u201312; 39:6\u201314, 30.\n\n==Noted engravers==\n{{see also|List of printmakers}}\n<!-- IT SAYS \"NOTED\"!

The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or [[Glass engraving|glass]] are engraved, or may provide an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called \"engravings\". Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques in [[printmaking]]. [[Wood engraving]] is a form of [[relief printing]] and is not covered in this article.\n\nEngraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic [[printmaking]], in [[mapmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by various [[photographic]] processes in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques.\n\n\"Engraving\" is also loosely but incorrectly used for any old black and white print; it requires a degree of expertise to distinguish engravings from prints using other techniques such as [[etching]] in particular, but also [[mezzotint]] and other techniques. Many [[old master print]]s also combine techniques on the same plate, further confusing matters.  [[Line engraving]] and [[steel engraving]] cover use for reproductive prints, illustrations in books and magazines, and similar uses, mostly in the 19th century, and often not actually using engraving.\nTraditional engraving, by [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] or with the use of machines, continues to be practised by [[goldsmith]]s, glass engravers, [[Gunsmith#Gun Engraver|gunsmiths]] and others, while modern industrial techniques such as [[photoengraving]] and [[laser engraving]] have many important applications. [[Engraved gem]]s were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers [[relief]] as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.\n\n==Terms==\n[[Image:gravers.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of hand engraving tools]]\n\nOther terms often used for printed engravings are '''copper engraving''', '''copper-plate engraving''' or ''[[line engraving]]''. [[Steel engraving]] is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, [[letterhead]]s and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes and other forms of [[security printing]]. Especially in the past, \"engraving\" was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or [[mezzotint]]. \"Hand engraving\" is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also \"hand engraved\", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.\n\n==Process==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Louis George Gravur 1.jpg|thumb|right|At an engravers workshop: Miniature engraving on a ''[[Louis George]]'' watch movement: Smallest engraving of the royal [[Prussia]]n eagle on a watch movement.

'''Engravers''' use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/214.htm|title=Abraham Bosse|year=1645|publisher=Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|accessdate=15 July 2008}}</ref> However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. [[Die (manufacturing)|Dies]] used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.\n\nIn addition to hand engraving, there are engraving machines that require less human finesse and are not directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a [[pantograph]]ic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.\n\n===Tools and gravers or burins===\nGravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as \"wriggle\" cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called '''bright-cut engraving'''), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as [[mezzotint]] rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.\n\nMusical instrument engraving on American-made brass instruments flourished in the 1920s and utilizes a specialized engraving technique where a flat graver is \"walked\" across the surface of the instrument to make zig-zag lines and patterns. The method for \"walking\" the graver may also be referred to as \"wriggle\" or \"wiggle\" cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry. Wriggle cuts are commonly found on silver Western jewelry and other Western metal work.\n\n===Tool geometry===\n[[File:2008-engraving.jpg|right|thumb|Stone engraving]]\nTool geometry is extremely important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a \"face\", which is the top of the graver, and a \"heel\", which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.\n\n===Tool sharpening===\nSharpening a graver or burin requires either a [[sharpening stone]] or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which is essential in creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on \"feel\" and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.\n\n===Artwork design===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Aachen Preparatory drawing for Aegidius Sadeler's print.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Portrait of Rudolph II MET DP102234.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Preparatory drawing by [[Hans von Aachen]] for a print with effigy of Emperor Rudolph II, [[National Library of Poland]]<ref name=print/> and [[Aegidius Sadeler]]'s print from 1603, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].\n}}\n\nDesign or artwork is generally prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers are able to draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or [[Stipple engraving|stippled]]. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.\n\n===Handpieces===\nOriginally, handpieces varied little in design as the common use was to push with the handle placed firmly in the center of the palm. With modern pneumatic engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals. The most widely known hand engraving tool maker, GRS Tools in Kansas is an American-owned and operated company that manufacture handpieces as well as many other tools for various applications in metal engraving.\n\n===Cutting the surface===\n[[File:Louis George Meistergraveurin 2.jpg|thumb|left|Master engraver ennobling a watch movement. Top level engravers work under a [[stereo microscope]]. ]]\n\nThe actual engraving is traditionally done by a combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional \"hand push\" process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the \"hand push\" effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.\n\nHand engraving artists today employ a combination of hand push, pneumatic, rotary, or hammer and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create \"bulino\" style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.\n\n===Finishing===\nFinishing the work is often necessary when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called \"burrs\" that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before lacquering or sealing, which may or may not be desired by the artist.\n\n===Modern hand engraving===\n[[File:Hand engraving tool.jpg|thumb|Hand Engraving Tool Example]]\n\nBecause of the high level of microscopic detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, [[counterfeit]]ing of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern [[banknote]]s are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand engraved images, nor can it be scanned. In the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.\n\nThe modern discipline of hand engraving, as it is called in a [[metalworking]] context, survives largely in a few specialized fields. The highest levels of the art are found on firearms and other metal weaponry, jewellery, and musical instruments.\n\nIn most commercial markets today, hand engraving has been replaced with milling using CNC engraving or [[milling machine]]s. Still, there are certain applications where use of hand engraving tools cannot be replaced.\n\n===Machine engraving===\n[[File:1847Colt Walker.jpg|thumb|1847 Colt Walker pistol with roll engraved cylinder]]\nIn some instances, images or designs can be transferred to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s [[pistol cylinder]]s were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.\n\n===Computer-aided machine engraving===\n[[File:Engraving on Corian.jpg|thumb|left|Computerized engraving on [[Corian]].]]\nEngraving machines such as the K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of .1&nbsp;\u00b5m and below. They are fully computer-controlled and the whole process of cylinder-making is fully automated.\n\nIt is now common place for retail stores (mostly jewellery, silverware or award stores) to have a small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator and the ability to do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.\n\nRetail engravers mainly use two different processes. The first and most common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through the surface of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.\n\nWith state-of-the-art machinery it is easy to have a simple, single item complete in under ten minutes.\nThe engraving process with diamonds is state-of-the-art since the 1960s.\n\nToday laser engraving machines are in development but still mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality.

The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing. [[Engraved gem]] is a term for any carved or engraved semi-precious stone; this was an important small-scale art form in the ancient world, and remained popular until the 19th century.\n[[File:Battle of Engravers by George Cruikshank 1828.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Battle of Engravers'', [[satire|satirical]] [[etching]] by [[George Cruikshank]], showing hypothetical battle between the engravers, including [[William Hogarth]], [[Antoine Masson]], [[William Woollett]], [[Jean-Joseph Balechou]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]].]]\nHowever the use of [[glass engraving]], usually using a wheel, to cut decorative scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of [[hardstone carving]]s, appears as early as the first century AD,<ref name=\"Caron\">Caron, B., A Roman Figure-Engraved Glass Bowl.

Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament.<ref name=\"Fleming\" /> It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and it seems likely that the engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.<ref name=\"Caron\" />\n\nIn the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s, in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gardner's art through the ages : the western perspective|last=Gardner, Helen, 1878-1946|publisher=|others=Kleiner, Fred S.|isbn=9781305633940|edition=Fifteenth |location=Boston, MA|pages=416|oclc=914290700|date = January 2016}}</ref> [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].\n\n[[File:Rembrandt - self portrait etching.jpg|thumb|right|Modern impression of Rembrandt's 1639 self-portrait, with the engraving plate.]]\nThereafter engraving tended to lose ground to [[etching]], which was a much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although [[Rembrandt]]'s prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, many of them have some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.\n\nBefore the advent of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, as they were cheaper to use in printing than photographic images.\n\nMany classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more \"elegant\" design is desired and a limited color range is acceptable.\n\n[[File:Buffalo nickles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buffalo nickel]]s, coins customised with engraving tools]] \nModifying the [[relief]] designs on coins is a craft dating back to the 18th century and today modified coins are known colloquially as [[hobo nickel]]s. In the United States, especially during the [[Great Depression]], coin engraving on the large-faced [[Buffalo nickel|Indian Head nickel]] became a way to help make ends meet. The craft continues today, and with modern equipment often produces stunning miniature sculptural artworks and floral scrollwork.<ref>[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/10/shaun-hughes-engraving/ Elaborate Floral Scrollwork Engraved on Coins] by Shaun Hughes embellishing existing coin faces with different styles of floral scrollwork (2016).  Retrieved May 27, 2018</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-20th century, a renaissance in hand-engraving began to take place. With the inventions of pneumatic hand-engraving systems that aided hand-engravers, the art and techniques of hand-engraving became more accessible.\n\n===Music engraving===\n{{main|Music engraving}}\nThe first music printed from engraved plates dates from 1446 and most printed music was produced through engraving from roughly 1700\u20131860. From 1860\u20131990 most printed music was produced through a combination of engraved master plates reproduced through offset lithography.\n\nThe first comprehensive account is given by Mme Delusse in her article \"Gravure en lettres, en g\u00e9ographie et en musique\" in [[Diderot]]'s Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by callipers, hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work. The process involved intensive pre-planning of the layout, and many manuscript scores with engraver's planning marks survive from the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Poole|first=H. Edmund|title=Music Printing and Publishing|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York|pages=40\u201354}}</ref>\n\nBy 1837 [[pewter]] had replaced copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (''Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce'', 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking to be carried out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very little is known about the practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gamble|first=William|title=Music Engraving and Printing: Historical and Technical Treatise|year=1923|publisher=Pitman|location=London}}</ref> By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.\n\n==Applications today==\n[[File:Ars moriendi (Meister E.S.), L.181.png|thumb|[[Ars moriendi]] engraving by Master ES, circa 1450]]\n\nExamples of contemporary uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants or on the inside of [[engagement ring|engagement]]- and [[wedding ring]]s to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy.  Another application of modern engraving is found in the [[printing]] industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto [[rotogravure]] cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1&nbsp;mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6&nbsp;\u00b5m chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed [[printing press]]es.  \nSome schools throughout the world are renowned for their teaching of engraving, like the [[\u00c9cole Estienne]] in Paris.\n\n==Creating tone==\n[[File:Claude Mellan - Face of Christ - WGA14764.jpg|thumb|''Sudarium of Saint Veronica'' by [[Claude Mellan]] (1649), a famous showpiece where the image is formed by a single continuous line, starting on the tip of Christ's nose.]]\n\nIn traditional engraving, which is a purely linear medium, the impression of [[half-tone]]s was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called [[hatching]]. When two sets of parallel-line ''hatchings'' intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as ''cross-hatching''. Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called [[stippling]], first used around 1505 by [[Giulio Campagnola]]. [[Claude Mellan]] was one of many 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the \"swelling line\") to give subtle effects of tone (as was [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]]) \u2013 see picture below. One famous example is his ''[[Veil of Veronica|Sudarium of Saint Veronica]]'' (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.\n\n==Biblical references==\nThe earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]]'s seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).\n\nEach of the two onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the high priest\u2019s [[ephod]] was engraved with the names of six different tribes of [[Israel]], and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest's turban, was engraved with the words: \"Holiness belongs to [[Adonai]].\" [[Bezalel]], along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.\u2014Ex 35:30\u201335; 28:9\u201312; 39:6\u201314, 30.\n\n==Noted engravers==\n{{see also|List of printmakers}}\n<!-- IT SAYS \"NOTED\"!

Pictured here is a cross-section showing the [[gross anatomy]] of the [[human brain]]]]\n'''Neuroanatomy''' is the study of the structure and organization of the [[nervous system]]. In contrast to animals with [[radial symmetry]], whose nervous system consists of a distributed network of cells, animals with [[bilateral symmetry]] have segregated, defined nervous systems. Their neuroanatomy is therefore better understood. In [[vertebrate]]s, the nervous system is segregated into the internal structure of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] (together called the [[central nervous system]], or CNS) and the routes of the nerves that connect to the rest of the body (known as the [[peripheral nervous system]], or PNS). The delineation of distinct structures and regions of the nervous system has been critical in investigating how it works. For example, much of what neuroscientists have learned comes from observing how damage or \"lesions\" to specific brain areas affects [[behavior]] or other neural functions.\n\nFor information about the composition of non-human animal nervous systems, see [[nervous system]]. For information about the typical structure of the Homo sapiens nervous system, see [[human brain]] or [[peripheral nervous system]].

Herophilus and Erasistratus of Alexandria were perhaps the most influential Greek neuroscientists with their studies involving dissecting brains.<ref name = RF/> For several hundred years afterward, with the cultural taboo of dissection, no major progress occurred in neuroscience. However, Pope Sixtus IV effectively revitalized the study of neuroanatomy by altering the papal policy and allowing human dissection. This resulted in a boom of research in neuroanatomy by artists and scientists of the Renaissance.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ginn | first1 = S.

Both neurons and glial cells come in many types (see, for example, the nervous system section of the [[list of distinct cell types in the adult human body]]). Neurons are the information-processing cells of the nervous system: they sense our environment, communicate with each other via electrical signals and chemicals called neurotransmitters which generally act across [[synapse]]s (close contacts between two neurons, or between a neuron and a muscle cell; note also extrasynaptic effects are possible, as well as release of neurotransmitters into the neural extracellular space), and produce our memories, thoughts, and movements. Glial cells maintain homeostasis, produce [[myelin|myelin (oligodendrocytes)]], and provide support and protection for the brain's neurons. Some glial cells ([[astrocytes]]) can even propagate intercellular [[Astrocyte#Calcium waves|calcium waves]] over long distances in response to stimulation, and release [[gliotransmitter]]s in response to changes in calcium concentration. Wound scars in the brain largely contain astrocytes. The [[extracellular matrix]] also provides support on the molecular level for the brain's cells, vehiculating substances to and from the blood vessels.\n\nAt the organ level, the nervous system is composed of brain regions, such as the [[hippocampus]] in mammals or the [[mushroom bodies]] of the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]].<ref>[http://web.neurobio.arizona.edu/Flybrain/html/atlas/structures/mushroom.html Mushroom Bodies of the Fruit Fly] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716000325/http://web.neurobio.arizona.edu/Flybrain/html/atlas/structures/mushroom.html |date=2012-07-16 }}</ref> These regions are often modular and serve a particular role within the general systemic pathways of the nervous system. For example, the hippocampus is critical for forming memories in connection with many other cerebral regions. The peripheral nervous system also contains afferent or efferent [[nerves]], which are bundles of fibers that originate from the brain and spinal cord, or from sensory or motor sorts of peripheral ganglia, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body. Nerves are made primarily of the [[axons]] or dendrites of neurons (axons in case of efferent motor fibres, and dendrites in case of afferent sensory fibres of the nerves), along with a variety of membranes that wrap around and segregate them into [[nerve fascicle]]s.\n\nThe vertebrate nervous system is divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems. The [[central nervous system]] (CNS) consists of the [[human brain|brain]], [[retina]], and [[spinal cord]], while the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS) is made up of all the nerves and ganglia (packets of peripheral neurons) outside of the CNS that connect it to the rest of the body. The PNS is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The [[somatic nervous system]] is made up of \"afferent\" neurons, which bring sensory information from the somatic (body) sense organs to the CNS, and \"efferent\" neurons, which carry motor instructions out to the voluntary muscles of the body. The [[autonomic nervous system]] can work with or without the control of the CNS (that's why it's called 'autonomous'), and also has two subdivisions, called [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]], which are important for transmitting motor orders to the body's basic internal organs, thus controlling functions such as heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and salivation. Autonomic nerves, unlike somatic nerves, contain only efferent fibers. Sensory signals coming from the viscera course into the CNS through the somatic sensory nerves (e.g., visceral pain), or through some particular cranial nerves (e.g., chemosensitive or mechanic signals).\n\n=== Orientation in neuroanatomy ===\n[[Image:Parasagittal MRI of human head in patient with benign familial macrocephaly prior to brain injury (ANIMATED).gif|thumb|left|Para-sagittal [[MRI]] of the head in a patient with benign familial [[macrocephaly]].]]\nIn anatomy in general and neuroanatomy in particular, several sets of topographic terms are used to denote orientation and location, which are generally referred to the body or brain axis (see [[Anatomical terms of location]]). The axis of the CNS is often wrongly assumed to be more or less straight, but it actually shows always two ventral flexures (cervical and cephalic flexures) and a dorsal flexure (pontine flexure), all due to differential growth during embryogenesis. The pairs of terms used most commonly in neuroanatomy are:\n\n* Dorsal and ventral: dorsal loosely refers to the top or upper side, represented by the roof plate of the brain, and ventral to the bottom or lower side, represented by the floor plate. These descriptors originally were used for ''dorsum'' and ''ventrum'' \u2013 back and belly \u2013 of the body; the belly of most animals is oriented towards the ground; the erect posture of humans places our ventral aspect anteriorly, and the dorsal aspect becomes posterior. The case of the head and the brain is peculiar, since the belly does not properly extend into the head, unless we assume that the mouth represents an extended belly element. Therefore, in common use, those brain parts that lie close to the base of the cranium, and through it to the mouth cavity, are called ventral \u2013 i.e., at its bottom or lower side, as defined above \u2013 whereas dorsal parts are closer to the enclosing cranial vault. Reference to the roof and floor plates of the brain is less prone to confusion, also allow us to keep an eye on the axial flexures mentioned above. Dorsal and ventral are thus relative terms in the brain, whose exact meaning depends on the specific location.\n* Rostral and caudal: ''rostral'' refers in general anatomy to the front of the body (towards the nose, or ''rostrum'' in Latin), and ''caudal'' refers to the tail end of the body (towards the tail; ''cauda'' in Latin). The rostrocaudal dimension of the brain corresponds to its length axis, which runs across the cited flexures from the caudal tip of the spinal cord into a rostral end roughly at the optic chiasma. In the erect Man, the directional terms \"superior\" and \"inferior\" essentially refer to this rostrocaudal dimension, because our body and brain axes are roughly oriented vertically in the erect position. However, all vertebrates develop a very marked ventral kink in the neural tube that is still detectable in the adult central nervous system, known as the [[cephalic flexure]]. The latter bends the rostral part of the CNS at a 180-degree angle relative to the caudal part, at the transition between the [[forebrain]] (axis ending rostrally at the optic chiasma) and the [[brainstem]] and [[spinal cord]] (axis roughly vertical, but including additional minor kinks at the pontine and cervical flexures) These flexural changes in axial dimension are problematic when trying to describe relative position and sectioning planes in the brain. There is abundant literature that wrongly disregards the axial flexures and assumes a relatively straight brain axis.\n* Medial and lateral: ''medial'' refers to being close, or relatively closer, to the midline (the descriptor ''median'' means a position precisely at the midline). ''Lateral'' is the opposite (a position more or less separated away from the midline).\nNote that such descriptors (dorsal/ventral, rostral/caudal; medial/lateral) are relative rather than absolute (e.g., a lateral structure may be said to lie medial to something else that lies even more laterally).\n\nCommonly used terms for planes of orientation or planes of section in neuroanatomy are \"sagittal\", \"transverse\" or \"coronal\", and \"axial\" or \"horizontal\". Again in this case, the situation is different for swimming, creeping or quadrupedal (prone) animals than for Man, or other erect species, due to the changed position of the axis. Due to the axial brain flexures, no section plane ever achieves a complete section series in a selected plane, because some sections inevitably result cut oblique or even perpendicular to it, as they pass through the flexures. Experience allows to discern the portions that result cut as desired.\n\n* A mid-sagittal plane divides the body and brain into left and right halves; sagittal sections, in general, are parallel to this median plane, moving along the medial-lateral dimension (see the image above). The term ''sagittal'' refers etymologically to the median suture between the right and left parietal bones of the cranium, known classically as sagittal suture, because it looks roughly like an arrow by its confluence with other sutures (''sagitta''; arrow in Latin).\n* A section plane orthogonal to the axis of any elongated form in principle is held to be transverse (e.g., a transverse section of a finger or of the vertebral column); if there is no length axis, there is no way to define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities). Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are parallel to the ribs, which are orthogonal to the vertebral column, which represents the body axis both in animals and man. The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis \u2013 that of the primordial elongated neural tube \u2013 which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above. This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly parallel to our ribs, or to the ground. However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the chiasmatic hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer parallel to the ribs and ground, but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes much erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts. Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely ''coronal'' sections. Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) to the local bent axis. The concept cannot be applied meaningfully to the brainstem and spinal cord, since there the coronal sections become horizontal to the axial dimension, being parallel to the axis. In any case, the concept of 'coronal' sections is less precise than that of 'transverse', since often coronal section planes are used which are not truly orthogonal to the rostral end of the brain axis. The term is etymologically related to the ''coronal suture'' of the craneum and this to the position where crowns are worn (Latin ''corona'' means crown). It is not clear what sort of crown was meant originally (maybe just a diadema), and this leads unfortunately to ambiguity in the section plane defined merely as coronal.\n* A coronal plane across the human head and brain is modernly conceived to be parallel to the face (the plane in which a king's crown sits on his head is not exactly parallel to the face, and exportation of the concept to less frontally endowed animals than us is obviously even more conflictive, but there is an implicit reference to the ''coronal suture'' of the cranium, which forms between the frontal and temporal/parietal bones, giving a sort of diadema configuration which is roughly parallel to the face). Coronal section planes thus essentially refer only to the head and brain, where a diadema makes sense, and not to the neck and body below.\n* Horizontal sections by definition are aligned (parallel) with the horizon. In swimming, creeping and quadrupedal animals the body axis itself is horizontal, and, thus, horizontal sections run along the length of the spinal cord, separating ventral from dorsal parts. Horizontal sections are orthogonal to both transverse and sagittal sections, and in theory, are parallel to the length axis. Due to the axial bend in the brain (forebrain), true horizontal sections in that region are orthogonal to coronal (transverse) sections (as is the horizon relative to the face).\n\nAccording to these considerations, the three directions of space are represented precisely by the sagittal, transverse and horizontal planes, whereas coronal sections can be transverse, oblique or horizontal, depending on how they relate to the brain axis and its incurvations.\n\n== Tools ==\nModern developments in neuroanatomy are directly correlated to the technologies used to perform [[research]]. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the various tools that are available. Many of the [[histological]] techniques used to study other tissues can be applied to the nervous system as well. However, there are some techniques that have been developed especially for the study of neuroanatomy.\n\n=== Cell staining ===\nIn biological systems, [[staining]] is a technique used to enhance the contrast of particular features in microscopic images.\n\n[[Nissl staining]] uses aniline basic dyes to intensely stain the acidic polyribosomes in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]], which is abundant in neurons. This allows researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and [[glia]]), and neuronal shapes and sizes, in various regions of the nervous system [[cytoarchitecture]].\n\nThe classic [[Golgi stain]] uses [[potassium dichromate]] and [[silver nitrate]] to fill selectively with a silver chromate precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle, any cells can react similarly). This so-called silver chromate impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -[[dendrites]], [[axon]]- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths up to their thinnest terminal branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent to the lack of staining in the majority of surrounding cells. Modernly, Golgi-impregnated material has been adapted for electron-microscopic visualization of the unstained elements surrounding the stained processes and cell bodies, thus adding further resolutive power.\n\n=== Histochemistry ===\n[[Histochemistry]] uses knowledge about biochemical reaction properties of the chemical constituents of the brain (including notably enzymes) to apply selective methods of reaction to visualize where they occur in the brain and any functional or pathological changes. This applies importantly to molecules related to neurotransmitter production and metabolism, but applies likewise in many other directions chemoarchitecture, or chemical neuroanatomy.\n\n[[Immunocytochemistry]] is a special case of histochemistry that uses selective antibodies against a variety of chemical epitopes of the nervous system to selectively stain particular cell types, axonal fascicles, neuropiles, glial processes or blood vessels, or specific intracytoplasmic or intranuclear proteins and other immunogenetic molecules, e.g., neurotransmitters. Immunoreacted transcription factor proteins reveal genomic readout in terms of translated protein. This immensely increases the capacity of researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and [[glia]]) in various regions of the nervous system.\n\n[[In situ hybridization]] uses synthetic RNA probes that attach (hybridize) selectively to complementary mRNA transcripts of DNA exons in the cytoplasm, to visualize genomic readout, that is, distinguish active gene expression, in terms of mRNA rather than protein. This allows identification histologically (in situ) of the cells involved in the production of genetically-coded molecules, which often represent differentiation or functional traits, as well as the molecular boundaries separating distinct brain domains or cell populations.\n\n=== Genetically encoded markers ===\nBy expressing variable amounts of red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in the brain, the so-called \"[[brainbow]]\" mutant mouse allows the combinatorial visualization of many different colors in neurons. This tags neurons with enough unique colors that they can often be distinguished from their neighbors with [[fluorescence microscopy]], enabling researchers to map the local connections or mutual arrangement (tiling) between neurons.\n\n[[Optogenetics]] uses transgenic constitutive and site-specific expression (normally in mice) of blocked markers that can be activated selectively by illumination with a light beam. This allows researchers to study axonal connectivity in the nervous system in a very discriminative way.\n\n=== Non-invasive brain imaging ===\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] has been used extensively to investigate brain [[Diffusion tensor imaging|structure]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|function]] non-invasively in healthy human subjects. An important example is [[diffusion tensor imaging]], which relies on the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce axon images. In particular, water moves more quickly along the direction aligned with the axons, permitting the inference of their structure.\n\n=== Viral-based methods ===\nCertain viruses can replicate in brain cells and cross synapses. So, viruses modified to express markers (such as fluorescent proteins) can be used to trace connectivity between brain regions across multiple synapses.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ginger | first1 = M. | last2 = Haberl | first2 = M. | last3 = Conzelmann | first3 = K.-K. | last4 = Schwarz | first4 = M. | last5 = Frick | first5 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Revealing the secrets of neuronal circuits with recombinant rabies virus technology | url = | journal = Front.

These molecules are selectively transported [[anterograde tracing|anterogradely]] (from soma to axon terminals) or [[retrograde tracing|retrogradely]] (from axon terminals to soma), thus providing evidence of primary and collateral connections in the brain. These 'physiologic' methods (because properties of living, unlesioned cells are used) can be combined with other procedures, and have essentially superseded the earlier procedures studying degeneration of lesioned neurons or axons. Detailed synaptic connections can be determined by correlative electron microscopy.\n\n=== Connectomics ===\n{{Main|Connectomics}}\nSerial section electron microscopy has been extensively developed for use in studying nervous systems.

Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages as a model system. For example, the ''C. elegans'' nervous system is extremely stereotyped from one individual worm to the next. This has allowed researchers using [[electron microscopy]] to map the paths and connections of all of the approximately 300 neurons in this species. The fruit fly is widely studied in part because its genetics is very well understood and easily manipulated. The mouse is used because, as a mammal, its brain is more similar in structure to our own (e.g., it has a six-layered [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], yet its genes can be easily modified and its reproductive cycle is relatively fast).\n\n=== Caenorhabditis elegans ===\n[[Image:Bilaterian-plan.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A rod-shaped body contains a digestive system running from the mouth at one end to the anus at the other.

In contrast to animals with [[radial symmetry]], whose nervous system consists of a distributed network of cells, animals with [[bilateral symmetry]] have segregated, defined nervous systems. Their neuroanatomy is therefore better understood. In [[vertebrate]]s, the nervous system is segregated into the internal structure of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] (together called the [[central nervous system]], or CNS) and the routes of the nerves that connect to the rest of the body (known as the [[peripheral nervous system]], or PNS). The delineation of distinct structures and regions of the nervous system has been critical in investigating how it works. For example, much of what neuroscientists have learned comes from observing how damage or \"lesions\" to specific brain areas affects [[behavior]] or other neural functions.\n\nFor information about the composition of non-human animal nervous systems, see [[nervous system]].

Both neurons and glial cells come in many types (see, for example, the nervous system section of the [[list of distinct cell types in the adult human body]]). Neurons are the information-processing cells of the nervous system: they sense our environment, communicate with each other via electrical signals and chemicals called neurotransmitters which generally act across [[synapse]]s (close contacts between two neurons, or between a neuron and a muscle cell; note also extrasynaptic effects are possible, as well as release of neurotransmitters into the neural extracellular space), and produce our memories, thoughts, and movements. Glial cells maintain homeostasis, produce [[myelin|myelin (oligodendrocytes)]], and provide support and protection for the brain's neurons. Some glial cells ([[astrocytes]]) can even propagate intercellular [[Astrocyte#Calcium waves|calcium waves]] over long distances in response to stimulation, and release [[gliotransmitter]]s in response to changes in calcium concentration. Wound scars in the brain largely contain astrocytes. The [[extracellular matrix]] also provides support on the molecular level for the brain's cells, vehiculating substances to and from the blood vessels.\n\nAt the organ level, the nervous system is composed of brain regions, such as the [[hippocampus]] in mammals or the [[mushroom bodies]] of the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]].<ref>[http://web.neurobio.arizona.edu/Flybrain/html/atlas/structures/mushroom.html Mushroom Bodies of the Fruit Fly] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716000325/http://web.neurobio.arizona.edu/Flybrain/html/atlas/structures/mushroom.html |date=2012-07-16 }}</ref> These regions are often modular and serve a particular role within the general systemic pathways of the nervous system. For example, the hippocampus is critical for forming memories in connection with many other cerebral regions. The peripheral nervous system also contains afferent or efferent [[nerves]], which are bundles of fibers that originate from the brain and spinal cord, or from sensory or motor sorts of peripheral ganglia, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body. Nerves are made primarily of the [[axons]] or dendrites of neurons (axons in case of efferent motor fibres, and dendrites in case of afferent sensory fibres of the nerves), along with a variety of membranes that wrap around and segregate them into [[nerve fascicle]]s.\n\nThe vertebrate nervous system is divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems. The [[central nervous system]] (CNS) consists of the [[human brain|brain]], [[retina]], and [[spinal cord]], while the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS) is made up of all the nerves and ganglia (packets of peripheral neurons) outside of the CNS that connect it to the rest of the body. The PNS is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The [[somatic nervous system]] is made up of \"afferent\" neurons, which bring sensory information from the somatic (body) sense organs to the CNS, and \"efferent\" neurons, which carry motor instructions out to the voluntary muscles of the body. The [[autonomic nervous system]] can work with or without the control of the CNS (that's why it's called 'autonomous'), and also has two subdivisions, called [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]], which are important for transmitting motor orders to the body's basic internal organs, thus controlling functions such as heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and salivation. Autonomic nerves, unlike somatic nerves, contain only efferent fibers. Sensory signals coming from the viscera course into the CNS through the somatic sensory nerves (e.g., visceral pain), or through some particular cranial nerves (e.g., chemosensitive or mechanic signals).\n\n=== Orientation in neuroanatomy ===\n[[Image:Parasagittal MRI of human head in patient with benign familial macrocephaly prior to brain injury (ANIMATED).gif|thumb|left|Para-sagittal [[MRI]] of the head in a patient with benign familial [[macrocephaly]].]]\nIn anatomy in general and neuroanatomy in particular, several sets of topographic terms are used to denote orientation and location, which are generally referred to the body or brain axis (see [[Anatomical terms of location]]). The axis of the CNS is often wrongly assumed to be more or less straight, but it actually shows always two ventral flexures (cervical and cephalic flexures) and a dorsal flexure (pontine flexure), all due to differential growth during embryogenesis. The pairs of terms used most commonly in neuroanatomy are:\n\n* Dorsal and ventral: dorsal loosely refers to the top or upper side, represented by the roof plate of the brain, and ventral to the bottom or lower side, represented by the floor plate. These descriptors originally were used for ''dorsum'' and ''ventrum'' \u2013 back and belly \u2013 of the body; the belly of most animals is oriented towards the ground; the erect posture of humans places our ventral aspect anteriorly, and the dorsal aspect becomes posterior. The case of the head and the brain is peculiar, since the belly does not properly extend into the head, unless we assume that the mouth represents an extended belly element. Therefore, in common use, those brain parts that lie close to the base of the cranium, and through it to the mouth cavity, are called ventral \u2013 i.e., at its bottom or lower side, as defined above \u2013 whereas dorsal parts are closer to the enclosing cranial vault. Reference to the roof and floor plates of the brain is less prone to confusion, also allow us to keep an eye on the axial flexures mentioned above. Dorsal and ventral are thus relative terms in the brain, whose exact meaning depends on the specific location.\n* Rostral and caudal: ''rostral'' refers in general anatomy to the front of the body (towards the nose, or ''rostrum'' in Latin), and ''caudal'' refers to the tail end of the body (towards the tail; ''cauda'' in Latin). The rostrocaudal dimension of the brain corresponds to its length axis, which runs across the cited flexures from the caudal tip of the spinal cord into a rostral end roughly at the optic chiasma. In the erect Man, the directional terms \"superior\" and \"inferior\" essentially refer to this rostrocaudal dimension, because our body and brain axes are roughly oriented vertically in the erect position. However, all vertebrates develop a very marked ventral kink in the neural tube that is still detectable in the adult central nervous system, known as the [[cephalic flexure]]. The latter bends the rostral part of the CNS at a 180-degree angle relative to the caudal part, at the transition between the [[forebrain]] (axis ending rostrally at the optic chiasma) and the [[brainstem]] and [[spinal cord]] (axis roughly vertical, but including additional minor kinks at the pontine and cervical flexures) These flexural changes in axial dimension are problematic when trying to describe relative position and sectioning planes in the brain. There is abundant literature that wrongly disregards the axial flexures and assumes a relatively straight brain axis.\n* Medial and lateral: ''medial'' refers to being close, or relatively closer, to the midline (the descriptor ''median'' means a position precisely at the midline). ''Lateral'' is the opposite (a position more or less separated away from the midline).\nNote that such descriptors (dorsal/ventral, rostral/caudal; medial/lateral) are relative rather than absolute (e.g., a lateral structure may be said to lie medial to something else that lies even more laterally).\n\nCommonly used terms for planes of orientation or planes of section in neuroanatomy are \"sagittal\", \"transverse\" or \"coronal\", and \"axial\" or \"horizontal\". Again in this case, the situation is different for swimming, creeping or quadrupedal (prone) animals than for Man, or other erect species, due to the changed position of the axis. Due to the axial brain flexures, no section plane ever achieves a complete section series in a selected plane, because some sections inevitably result cut oblique or even perpendicular to it, as they pass through the flexures. Experience allows to discern the portions that result cut as desired.\n\n* A mid-sagittal plane divides the body and brain into left and right halves; sagittal sections, in general, are parallel to this median plane, moving along the medial-lateral dimension (see the image above). The term ''sagittal'' refers etymologically to the median suture between the right and left parietal bones of the cranium, known classically as sagittal suture, because it looks roughly like an arrow by its confluence with other sutures (''sagitta''; arrow in Latin).\n* A section plane orthogonal to the axis of any elongated form in principle is held to be transverse (e.g., a transverse section of a finger or of the vertebral column); if there is no length axis, there is no way to define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities). Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are parallel to the ribs, which are orthogonal to the vertebral column, which represents the body axis both in animals and man. The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis \u2013 that of the primordial elongated neural tube \u2013 which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above. This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly parallel to our ribs, or to the ground. However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the chiasmatic hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer parallel to the ribs and ground, but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes much erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts. Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely ''coronal'' sections. Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) to the local bent axis. The concept cannot be applied meaningfully to the brainstem and spinal cord, since there the coronal sections become horizontal to the axial dimension, being parallel to the axis. In any case, the concept of 'coronal' sections is less precise than that of 'transverse', since often coronal section planes are used which are not truly orthogonal to the rostral end of the brain axis. The term is etymologically related to the ''coronal suture'' of the craneum and this to the position where crowns are worn (Latin ''corona'' means crown). It is not clear what sort of crown was meant originally (maybe just a diadema), and this leads unfortunately to ambiguity in the section plane defined merely as coronal.\n* A coronal plane across the human head and brain is modernly conceived to be parallel to the face (the plane in which a king's crown sits on his head is not exactly parallel to the face, and exportation of the concept to less frontally endowed animals than us is obviously even more conflictive, but there is an implicit reference to the ''coronal suture'' of the cranium, which forms between the frontal and temporal/parietal bones, giving a sort of diadema configuration which is roughly parallel to the face). Coronal section planes thus essentially refer only to the head and brain, where a diadema makes sense, and not to the neck and body below.\n* Horizontal sections by definition are aligned (parallel) with the horizon. In swimming, creeping and quadrupedal animals the body axis itself is horizontal, and, thus, horizontal sections run along the length of the spinal cord, separating ventral from dorsal parts. Horizontal sections are orthogonal to both transverse and sagittal sections, and in theory, are parallel to the length axis. Due to the axial bend in the brain (forebrain), true horizontal sections in that region are orthogonal to coronal (transverse) sections (as is the horizon relative to the face).\n\nAccording to these considerations, the three directions of space are represented precisely by the sagittal, transverse and horizontal planes, whereas coronal sections can be transverse, oblique or horizontal, depending on how they relate to the brain axis and its incurvations.\n\n== Tools ==\nModern developments in neuroanatomy are directly correlated to the technologies used to perform [[research]]. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the various tools that are available. Many of the [[histological]] techniques used to study other tissues can be applied to the nervous system as well. However, there are some techniques that have been developed especially for the study of neuroanatomy.\n\n=== Cell staining ===\nIn biological systems, [[staining]] is a technique used to enhance the contrast of particular features in microscopic images.\n\n[[Nissl staining]] uses aniline basic dyes to intensely stain the acidic polyribosomes in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]], which is abundant in neurons. This allows researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and [[glia]]), and neuronal shapes and sizes, in various regions of the nervous system [[cytoarchitecture]].\n\nThe classic [[Golgi stain]] uses [[potassium dichromate]] and [[silver nitrate]] to fill selectively with a silver chromate precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle, any cells can react similarly). This so-called silver chromate impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -[[dendrites]], [[axon]]- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths up to their thinnest terminal branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent to the lack of staining in the majority of surrounding cells. Modernly, Golgi-impregnated material has been adapted for electron-microscopic visualization of the unstained elements surrounding the stained processes and cell bodies, thus adding further resolutive power.\n\n=== Histochemistry ===\n[[Histochemistry]] uses knowledge about biochemical reaction properties of the chemical constituents of the brain (including notably enzymes) to apply selective methods of reaction to visualize where they occur in the brain and any functional or pathological changes. This applies importantly to molecules related to neurotransmitter production and metabolism, but applies likewise in many other directions chemoarchitecture, or chemical neuroanatomy.\n\n[[Immunocytochemistry]] is a special case of histochemistry that uses selective antibodies against a variety of chemical epitopes of the nervous system to selectively stain particular cell types, axonal fascicles, neuropiles, glial processes or blood vessels, or specific intracytoplasmic or intranuclear proteins and other immunogenetic molecules, e.g., neurotransmitters. Immunoreacted transcription factor proteins reveal genomic readout in terms of translated protein. This immensely increases the capacity of researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and [[glia]]) in various regions of the nervous system.\n\n[[In situ hybridization]] uses synthetic RNA probes that attach (hybridize) selectively to complementary mRNA transcripts of DNA exons in the cytoplasm, to visualize genomic readout, that is, distinguish active gene expression, in terms of mRNA rather than protein. This allows identification histologically (in situ) of the cells involved in the production of genetically-coded molecules, which often represent differentiation or functional traits, as well as the molecular boundaries separating distinct brain domains or cell populations.\n\n=== Genetically encoded markers ===\nBy expressing variable amounts of red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in the brain, the so-called \"[[brainbow]]\" mutant mouse allows the combinatorial visualization of many different colors in neurons. This tags neurons with enough unique colors that they can often be distinguished from their neighbors with [[fluorescence microscopy]], enabling researchers to map the local connections or mutual arrangement (tiling) between neurons.\n\n[[Optogenetics]] uses transgenic constitutive and site-specific expression (normally in mice) of blocked markers that can be activated selectively by illumination with a light beam. This allows researchers to study axonal connectivity in the nervous system in a very discriminative way.\n\n=== Non-invasive brain imaging ===\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] has been used extensively to investigate brain [[Diffusion tensor imaging|structure]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|function]] non-invasively in healthy human subjects. An important example is [[diffusion tensor imaging]], which relies on the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce axon images. In particular, water moves more quickly along the direction aligned with the axons, permitting the inference of their structure.\n\n=== Viral-based methods ===\nCertain viruses can replicate in brain cells and cross synapses. So, viruses modified to express markers (such as fluorescent proteins) can be used to trace connectivity between brain regions across multiple synapses.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ginger | first1 = M. | last2 = Haberl | first2 = M. | last3 = Conzelmann | first3 = K.-K. | last4 = Schwarz | first4 = M. | last5 = Frick | first5 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Revealing the secrets of neuronal circuits with recombinant rabies virus technology | url = | journal = Front.

These molecules are selectively transported [[anterograde tracing|anterogradely]] (from soma to axon terminals) or [[retrograde tracing|retrogradely]] (from axon terminals to soma), thus providing evidence of primary and collateral connections in the brain. These 'physiologic' methods (because properties of living, unlesioned cells are used) can be combined with other procedures, and have essentially superseded the earlier procedures studying degeneration of lesioned neurons or axons. Detailed synaptic connections can be determined by correlative electron microscopy.\n\n=== Connectomics ===\n{{Main|Connectomics}}\nSerial section electron microscopy has been extensively developed for use in studying nervous systems.

Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages as a model system. For example, the ''C. elegans'' nervous system is extremely stereotyped from one individual worm to the next. This has allowed researchers using [[electron microscopy]] to map the paths and connections of all of the approximately 300 neurons in this species. The fruit fly is widely studied in part because its genetics is very well understood and easily manipulated. The mouse is used because, as a mammal, its brain is more similar in structure to our own (e.g., it has a six-layered [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], yet its genes can be easily modified and its reproductive cycle is relatively fast).\n\n=== Caenorhabditis elegans ===\n[[Image:Bilaterian-plan.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A rod-shaped body contains a digestive system running from the mouth at one end to the anus at the other.
