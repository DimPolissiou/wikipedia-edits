After the release of ''Mindshadow'', Fargo hired an old high school friend and started work to create a role-playing game ''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|Bard's Tale]]'' for the Apple II and C64 for a then-new publisher [[Electronic Arts]]. Fargo subsequently co-designed Interplay's early RPGs, including the critically acclaimed ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'',<ref name=\"fallhistory\">{{cite web |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/948/948937p1.html |title=IGN Presents The History of Fallout |first=Rus |last=McLaughlin |date=July 21, 2010 |work=IGN |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref> where a character named Faran Brygo is a play on his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://me.ign.com/en/feature/18379/the-origin-of-fallout|title=The Origin of Fallout|date=December 12, 2013|accessdate=November 21, 2015|website=IGN}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Interplay at the time was utilizing small development teams of one to three people to produce games for other companies to publish, which only allowed Interplay to break even at best. In 1988, Fargo decided to make the transition from a development house to a developer/publisher, adding the additional costs of production and marketing, with both the risk and possible reward of publishing successful games. The first title produced by Interplay in this era was the internally developed ''[[Battle Chess]]'', followed by [[Quicksilver Software]]'s ''[[Castles (video game)|Castles]]''. The company was also experimenting at the time with new ideas and products such as ''[[Neuromancer (video game)|Neuromancer]]'', a video game version of the novel by [[William Gibson]].\n\nBy 1992, Interplay contracted with an old friend of Fargo's, [[Allen Adham]], and his partner, [[Michael Morhaime]],<ref name=\"fantastic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25264 |title=GDC Austin: How Fantastic Contraption Became A Fantastic Hit |first=Simon |last=Carless |date=September 15, 2009 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |publisher= |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref> to create ''[[RPM Racing]]''. This was Adham and Morhaime's first contract to produce a game as [[Silicon & Synapse]] and was the one of the first of such finds for Fargo, who had an eye for recognizing talent in small development teams.<ref name=\"gsinterview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2848761.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B2 |title=GameSpot Interview with Brian Fargo |author=Trey Walker |date=February 9, 2002 |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher= |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref> Adham and Morhaime eventually changed the name of their company to [[Blizzard Entertainment]], future developer of the ''[[Warcraft]]'', ''[[Starcraft (series)|Starcraft]]'' and ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'' franchises.\n\nInterplay continued to expand in the mid-1990s, adding licensed titles to its own [[intellectual properties]] such as ''[[Stonekeep]]'', by acquiring rights to the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' and creating a series of its adaptations. Fargo also continued to find talented small developers designing innovative games. One was [[Parallax Software]], whose demo game eventually became the hit game ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]''. Parallax, later renamed [[Volition (company)|Volition]], was eventually bought by [[THQ]]. In 1994, [[Universal Music Group|Universal/MCA]] bought a 45% stake in Interplay, which later went public in 1998.<ref name=ie>[http://www.inxile-entertainment.com/about inXile entertainment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051838/http://www.inxile-entertainment.com/about |date=July 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nInterplay grew to over 600 employees at its zenith in the mid-1990s. One of the most successful groups within Interplay was formed during this period, [[Black Isle Studios|Black Isle]]. Black Isle focused on role-playing games and eventually included the games of a new developer called [[BioWare]], which was initially contracted by Interplay to make ''[[Shattered Steel]]''. The next game they developed for Interplay, through the Black Isle division, was ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'', which proved to be a big hit, followed by others, such as ''[[Icewind Dale]]'' and the critically acclaimed ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''. Black Isle's celebrated ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'', which took some inspiration from ''Wasteland'' but was unique in its own right, was a personal project of Fargo, who served as its executive producer and was involved in setting the tone and sensibilities of the game.\n\nIn 1996, the company expanded again, adding a division focusing on sports games called VR Sports and buying [[Shiny Entertainment]].

Fargo subsequently co-designed Interplay's early RPGs, including the critically acclaimed ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'',<ref name=\"fallhistory\">{{cite web |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/948/948937p1.html |title=IGN Presents The History of Fallout |first=Rus |last=McLaughlin |date=July 21, 2010 |work=IGN |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref> where a character named Faran Brygo is a play on his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://me.ign.com/en/feature/18379/the-origin-of-fallout|title=The Origin of Fallout|date=December 12, 2013|accessdate=November 21, 2015|website=IGN}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Interplay at the time was utilizing small development teams of one to three people to produce games for other companies to publish, which only allowed Interplay to break even at best. In 1988, Fargo decided to make the transition from a development house to a developer/publisher, adding the additional costs of production and marketing, with both the risk and possible reward of publishing successful games. The first title produced by Interplay in this era was the internally developed ''[[Battle Chess]]'', followed by [[Quicksilver Software]]'s ''[[Castles (video game)|Castles]]''. The company was also experimenting at the time with new ideas and products such as ''[[Neuromancer (video game)|Neuromancer]]'', a video game version of the novel by [[William Gibson]].\n\nBy 1992, Interplay contracted with an old friend of Fargo's, [[Allen Adham]], and his partner, [[Michael Morhaime]],<ref name=\"fantastic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25264 |title=GDC Austin: How Fantastic Contraption Became A Fantastic Hit |first=Simon |last=Carless |date=September 15, 2009 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |publisher= |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref> to create ''[[RPM Racing]]''.

Fargo also continued to find talented small developers designing innovative games. One was [[Parallax Software]], whose demo game eventually became the hit game ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]''. Parallax, later renamed [[Volition (company)|Volition]], was eventually bought by [[THQ]]. In 1994, [[Universal Music Group|Universal/MCA]] bought a 45% stake in Interplay, which later went public in 1998.<ref name=ie>[http://www.inxile-entertainment.com/about inXile entertainment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051838/http://www.inxile-entertainment.com/about |date=July 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nInterplay grew to over 600 employees at its zenith in the mid-1990s. One of the most successful groups within Interplay was formed during this period, [[Black Isle Studios|Black Isle]]. Black Isle focused on role-playing games and eventually included the games of a new developer called [[BioWare]], which was initially contracted by Interplay to make ''[[Shattered Steel]]''. The next game they developed for Interplay, through the Black Isle division, was ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'', which proved to be a big hit, followed by others, such as ''[[Icewind Dale]]'' and the critically acclaimed ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''. Black Isle's celebrated ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'', which took some inspiration from ''Wasteland'' but was unique in its own right, was a personal project of Fargo, who served as its executive producer and was involved in setting the tone and sensibilities of the game.\n\nIn 1996, the company expanded again, adding a division focusing on sports games called VR Sports and buying [[Shiny Entertainment]].

Large parts of the continent were essentially uninhabitable for Europeans because of the high mortality rates from diseases such as malaria.<ref>Thomas Pakenham, ''The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912'' (1991) ch 1</ref> In the middle decades of the 19th century, European explorers had mapped  areas of [[East Africa]] and [[Central Africa]].\n\nEven as late as the 1870s, Western European states controlled only ten percent of the African continent, with all their territories located near the coast. The most important holdings were [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], held by Portugal; the [[Cape Colony]], held by the United Kingdom; and [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], held by [[France in the nineteenth century|France]].

Industrialisation brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of steamships, railways and telegraphs. Medical advances also played an important role, especially medicines for [[tropical disease]]s. The development of [[quinine]], an effective treatment for [[malaria]], made vast expanses of the tropics more accessible for Europeans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/quinine|title=Quinine|website=broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\n===Africa and global markets===\n\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\n\n[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], one of the last regions of the world largely untouched by \"informal imperialism\", was also attractive to Europe's ruling elites for economic, political and social reasons. During a time when Britain's [[balance of trade]] showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly [[protectionism|protectionist]] continental markets due to the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u201396), Africa offered [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and other countries an open market that would garner them a [[trade surplus]]: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.<ref name=\"Shillington\" /><ref>Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, \"An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble?

Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially [[copper]], cotton, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], diamonds, tea, and [[tin]], to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.<ref>Lynn Hunt, ''The Making of the West'': volume C, Bedford: St. Martin, 2009.</ref> However, in Africa \u2013 excluding the area which became the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 \u2013 the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[De Beers Mining Company]]. Rhodes had carved out [[Rhodesia]] for himself; [[Leopold II of Belgium]] later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the [[Congo Free State]].\n\nThese events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', [[Francesco Crispi]] and [[Jules Ferry]], who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and [[overproduction]] caused by shrinking continental markets. [[John A.

The vast interior between [[Egypt]] and the gold and diamond-rich [[southern Africa]] had strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade. Britain was under political pressure to secure lucrative markets against encroaching rivals in [[Qing|China]] and its eastern colonies, particularly [[British India|India]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Thus, it was crucial to secure the key waterway between East and West&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Suez Canal]].

The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance. Defense bases were also needed for the protection of sea routes and communication lines, particularly of expensive and vital international waterways such as the Suez Canal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\">H.R.

Colonies with large native populations were also a source of military power; Britain and France used large numbers of [[Sepoy#Sepoys in British India|British Indian]] and North African soldiers, respectively, in many of their colonial wars (and would do so again in the coming World Wars).

Following the 1904 ''[[Entente cordiale]]'' between France and the British Empire, Germany tried to isolate France in 1905 with the [[First Moroccan Crisis]].

The [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee]] to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The [[Second Boer War]], fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.\n\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of [[West Africa]] (modern day [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the [[Niger River]] to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] (modern South Africa, [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Zambia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], leader of the Mahdists. This fundamentalist group of Muslim dervishes overran much of [[Sudan]] and [[Mahdist War|fought]] British forces.]]\n\nThe Sudan (which included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This \"red line\" through Africa is made most famous by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Along with [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a \"Cape to Cairo\" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.\n\nIf one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes's dream), and one from [[Dakar]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] (now [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]] and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near [[Fashoda]], explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].\n\nA French force under [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew [[Fashoda Incident|after a standoff]] and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and [[Congo River]]s should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\n===Moroccan Crisis===\n{{Main|First Moroccan Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis}}\n\nAlthough the 1884\u201385 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the ''[[Entente cordiale|Entente Cordiale]]'' of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of [[Morocco]] as a battlefield.\n\nThus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited [[Tangiers]] on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass\u00e9 was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier [[Maurice Rouvier]]. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.\n\n[[File:Si Kaddour ben Ghabrit et le sultan Moufay Hafid.jpg|thumb|left|The Moroccan [[Sultan]] [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], who led the resistance to French expansionism during the [[Agadir Crisis]]]]\n\nThe 1906 [[Algeciras Conference]] was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was [[Austria-Hungary]]. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.\n\nHowever, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or [[Agadir Crisis]]) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat ''[[SMS Panther|Panther]]'' to the port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[History of the Royal Navy|naval supremacy]]&nbsp;\u2013 the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the ''Panther'''s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.\n\nThe German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the [[North Africa]]n kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the [[French Equatorial Africa]]n colony of [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]).\n\n[[French protectorate in Morocco|France]] and [[Spanish Protectorate in Morocco|Spain]] subsequently established a full [[protectorate]] over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.\n\n===Dervish resistance===\n[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sayyid [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (the \"Mad Mullah\"), leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[Berlin conference|Berlin Conference]] at the end of the 19th century, the [[British people|British]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Ethiopia]]ns sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and the [[Gobroon Dynasty]].\n\nThe [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish]] movement was a state established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region.<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'' (CRC Press, 2005), p. 1406.</ref> Due to these successful expeditions, the Dervish movement was recognised as an ally by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German Empire|German]] empires.

In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|genocide of the population]].\n\nIn total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the [[Namib Desert]].\n\n==Colonial encounter==\n\n===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===\n\n====Colonial lobby====\n[[File:African Pigmies CNE-v1-p58-B.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pygmies]] and a European. Some pygmies would be exposed in [[human zoo]]s, such as [[Ota Benga]] displayed by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]].]]\n\nIn its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the [[class conflict|social tensions]] caused by the [[Long Depression]] pushed him to favor [[jingoism]]: the imperialists had become the \"parasites of [[patriotism]]\" ([[John A. Hobson]]).<ref>[[John A. Hobson]], ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'', 1902, p. 61 (quoted by Arendt).</ref> In [[French Third Republic|France]], then [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] politician [[Georges Clemenceau]] also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" mountains, that is [[revanchism]] and the patriotic urge to reclaim the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. Clemenceau actually made [[Jules Ferry]]'s cabinet fall after the 1885 [[Sino-French War|Tonkin disaster]]. According to [[Hannah Arendt]] in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the [[nation state]] which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the [[Moral universalism|universalist]] will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as \"citizens\" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899)&nbsp;\u2013 published around the same time as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''&nbsp;\u2013 or in [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (1932).\n\nColonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like [[Enrico Corradini]] claimed a \"place in the sun\" for so-called \"proletarian nations\", bolstering [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]] in an early prototype of [[fascism]].\n\n====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====\n\n=====Colonial exhibitions=====\n[[File:Dellepiane-exposition-nationale-coloniale-1906.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1906 [[Colonial Exhibition]] in [[Marseilles]] (France)]]\nHowever, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: [[public opinion]] had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. [[Colonial exhibition]]s were instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists.<ref>Paul S. Landau, and Deborah D. Kaspin, eds. ''Images and empires: visuality in colonial and postcolonial Africa'' (U of California Press, 2002).</ref> Thus, conquests of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the [[indigenous people]] for scientific and leisure purposes. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoa]] and [[Sami people]] as \"purely natural\" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such \"[[human zoos]]\" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. [[Tuaregs]] were exhibited after the French conquest of [[Timbuktu]] (visited by [[Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9]], disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie''); [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] after the [[French Madagascar|occupation]] of [[Madagascar]]; [[Dahomey Amazons|Amazons]] of [[Abomey]] after [[Behanzin]]'s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894.

It was the central theme of the [[Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889\u201390]]. During the Scramble for Africa, an early but secondary focus of all [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900 and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history.

Large parts of the continent were essentially uninhabitable for Europeans because of the high mortality rates from diseases such as malaria.<ref>Thomas Pakenham, ''The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912'' (1991) ch 1</ref> In the middle decades of the 19th century, European explorers had mapped  areas of [[East Africa]] and [[Central Africa]].\n\nEven as late as the 1870s, Western European states controlled only ten percent of the African continent, with all their territories located near the coast. The most important holdings were [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], held by Portugal; the [[Cape Colony]], held by the United Kingdom; and [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria]], held by [[France in the nineteenth century|France]].

Industrialisation brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of steamships, railways and telegraphs. Medical advances also played an important role, especially medicines for [[tropical disease]]s. The development of [[quinine]], an effective treatment for [[malaria]], made vast expanses of the tropics more accessible for Europeans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/quinine|title=Quinine|website=broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\n===Africa and global markets===\n\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\n\n[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], one of the last regions of the world largely untouched by \"informal imperialism\", was also attractive to Europe's ruling elites for economic, political and social reasons. During a time when Britain's [[balance of trade]] showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly [[protectionism|protectionist]] continental markets due to the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u201396), Africa offered [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and other countries an open market that would garner them a [[trade surplus]]: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.<ref name=\"Shillington\" /><ref>Ewout Frankema, Jeffrey Williamson, and Pieter Woltjer, \"An Economic Rationale for the West African Scramble? The Commercial Transition and the Commodity Price Boom of 1835\u20131885,\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 78#1 (2018) , pp. 231\u201367.</ref>\n\nSurplus capital was often more profitably invested overseas, where cheap materials, limited competition, and abundant raw materials made a greater premium possible. Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially [[copper]], cotton, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], diamonds, tea, and [[tin]], to which European consumers had grown accustomed and upon which European industry had grown dependent. Additionally, Britain wanted the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India.<ref>Lynn Hunt, ''The Making of the West'': volume C, Bedford: St. Martin, 2009.</ref> However, in Africa \u2013 excluding the area which became the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910 \u2013 the amount of capital investment by Europeans was relatively small, compared to other continents. Consequently, the companies involved in tropical African commerce were relatively small, apart from [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[De Beers Mining Company]]. Rhodes had carved out [[Rhodesia]] for himself; [[Leopold II of Belgium]] later, and with considerable brutality, exploited the [[Congo Free State]].\n\nThese events might detract from the pro-imperialist arguments of colonial lobbyists such as the ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]'', [[Francesco Crispi]] and [[Jules Ferry]], who argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and [[overproduction]] caused by shrinking continental markets. [[John A. Hobson]] argued in ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'' that this shrinking of continental markets was a key factor of the global \"New Imperialism\" period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Imperialism|last=Hobson|first=John Atkinson|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-79207-6|location=Cambridge|pages=77|oclc=889962491}}</ref> [[William Easterly]], however, disagrees with the link made between [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]], arguing that [[colonialism]] is used mostly to promote state-led development rather than \"corporate\" development.

The vast interior between [[Egypt]] and the gold and diamond-rich [[southern Africa]] had strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade. Britain was under political pressure to secure lucrative markets against encroaching rivals in [[Qing|China]] and its eastern colonies, particularly [[British India|India]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Thus, it was crucial to secure the key waterway between East and West&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Suez Canal]].

The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance. Defense bases were also needed for the protection of sea routes and communication lines, particularly of expensive and vital international waterways such as the Suez Canal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\">H.R.

Colonies with large native populations were also a source of military power; Britain and France used large numbers of [[Sepoy#Sepoys in British India|British Indian]] and North African soldiers, respectively, in many of their colonial wars (and would do so again in the coming World Wars).

Nearly all of its overall empire of 2.6 million square kilometres and 14 million colonial subjects in 1914 was found in its African possessions of Southwest Africa, Togoland, the Cameroons, and Tanganyika. Following the 1904 ''[[Entente cordiale]]'' between France and the British Empire, Germany tried to isolate France in 1905 with the [[First Moroccan Crisis]]. This led to the 1905 [[Algeciras Conference]], in which France's influence on Morocco was compensated by the exchange of other territories, and then to the [[Agadir Crisis]] in 1911.

The [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the [[Johannesburg Reform Committee]] to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The [[Second Boer War]], fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the South African Republic (or Transvaal) were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.\n\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of [[West Africa]] (modern day [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the Sahara, a huge desert covering most of present-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the [[Niger River]] to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the Caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] (modern South Africa, [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Zambia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], leader of the Mahdists. This fundamentalist group of Muslim dervishes overran much of [[Sudan]] and [[Mahdist War|fought]] British forces.]]\n\nThe Sudan (which included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfillment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This \"red line\" through Africa is made most famous by [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Along with [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a \"Cape to Cairo\" empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich Southern part of the continent by rail. Though hampered by German occupation of [[Tanganyika]] until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.\n\nIf one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes's dream), and one from [[Dakar]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] (now [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]] and Somalia), (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near [[Fashoda]], explaining its strategic importance. In short, Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], while France had sought to extend its own holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Red Sea]].\n\nA French force under [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew [[Fashoda Incident|after a standoff]] and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. In March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and [[Congo River]]s should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\n===Moroccan Crisis===\n{{Main|First Moroccan Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis}}\n\nAlthough the 1884\u201385 Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. The 1898 Fashoda Incident, which had seen France and the British Empire on the brink of war, ultimately led to the signature of the ''[[Entente cordiale|Entente Cordiale]]'' of 1904, which countered the influence of the European powers of the Triple Alliance. As a result, the new German Empire decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of [[Morocco]] as a battlefield.\n\nThus, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited [[Tangiers]] on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favor of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France's influence in Morocco had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser's speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support the French foreign minister, [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905, when Delcass\u00e9 was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier [[Maurice Rouvier]]. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis. Both France and Germany continued to posture up until the conference, with Germany mobilizing reserve army units in late December and France actually moving troops to the border in January 1906.\n\n[[File:Si Kaddour ben Ghabrit et le sultan Moufay Hafid.jpg|thumb|left|The Moroccan [[Sultan]] [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], who led the resistance to French expansionism during the [[Agadir Crisis]]]]\n\nThe 1906 [[Algeciras Conference]] was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was [[Austria-Hungary]]. France had firm support from Britain, the US, Russia, Italy and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.\n\nHowever, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or [[Agadir Crisis]]) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat ''[[SMS Panther|Panther]]'' to the port of [[Agadir]] on 1 July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to surpass [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[History of the Royal Navy|naval supremacy]]&nbsp;\u2013 the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two naval fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the ''Panther'''s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic.\n\nThe German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the [[North Africa]]n kingdom, where France's pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911 a convention was signed under which Germany accepted France's position in Morocco in return for territory in the [[French Equatorial Africa]]n colony of [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]).\n\n[[French protectorate in Morocco|France]] and [[Spanish Protectorate in Morocco|Spain]] subsequently established a full [[protectorate]] over Morocco (30 March 1912), ending what remained of the country's formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the Entente between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.\n\n===Dervish resistance===\n[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sayyid [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] (the \"Mad Mullah\"), leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]]]]\n\nFollowing the [[Berlin conference|Berlin Conference]] at the end of the 19th century, the [[British people|British]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Ethiopia]]ns sought to claim lands owned by the Somalis such as the Warsangali Sultanate, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] and the [[Gobroon Dynasty]].\n\nThe [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish]] movement was a state established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a Somali religious leader who gathered Muslim soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands sought after by the Ethiopians and the European powers.

In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South-West Africa being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare. German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South-West Africa then resulted in a [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|genocide of the population]].\n\nIn total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] between 1904 and 1908. Characteristic of this genocide was death by starvation and the poisoning of the population's wells whilst they were trapped in the [[Namib Desert]].\n\n==Colonial encounter==\n\n===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===\n\n====Colonial lobby====\n[[File:African Pigmies CNE-v1-p58-B.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pygmies]] and a European. Some pygmies would be exposed in [[human zoo]]s, such as [[Ota Benga]] displayed by [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] in the [[Bronx Zoo]].]]\n\nIn its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], opposed colonisation in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885 he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet, and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the [[class conflict|social tensions]] caused by the [[Long Depression]] pushed him to favor [[jingoism]]: the imperialists had become the \"parasites of [[patriotism]]\" ([[John A. Hobson]]).<ref>[[John A. Hobson]], ''[[Imperialism (Hobson)|Imperialism]]'', 1902, p. 61 (quoted by Arendt).</ref> In [[French Third Republic|France]], then [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] politician [[Georges Clemenceau]] also adamantly opposed himself to it: he thought colonisation was a diversion from the \"blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]\" mountains, that is [[revanchism]] and the patriotic urge to reclaim the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. Clemenceau actually made [[Jules Ferry]]'s cabinet fall after the 1885 [[Sino-French War|Tonkin disaster]]. According to [[Hannah Arendt]] in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the [[nation state]] which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the [[Moral universalism|universalist]] will to respect human rights of the colonised people, as they may be considered as \"citizens\" of the nation state, and the imperialist drive to cynically [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonising countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899)&nbsp;\u2013 published around the same time as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[The White Man's Burden]]''&nbsp;\u2013 or in [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (1932).\n\nColonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like [[Enrico Corradini]] claimed a \"place in the sun\" for so-called \"proletarian nations\", bolstering [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]] in an early prototype of [[fascism]].\n\n====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====\n\n=====Colonial exhibitions=====\n[[File:Dellepiane-exposition-nationale-coloniale-1906.jpg|thumb|Poster for the 1906 [[Colonial Exhibition]] in [[Marseilles]] (France)]]\nHowever, by the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: [[public opinion]] had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. [[Colonial exhibition]]s were instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists.<ref>Paul S. Landau, and Deborah D. Kaspin, eds. ''Images and empires: visuality in colonial and postcolonial Africa'' (U of California Press, 2002).</ref> Thus, conquests of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the [[indigenous people]] for scientific and leisure purposes. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoa]] and [[Sami people]] as \"purely natural\" populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such \"[[human zoos]]\" could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. [[Tuaregs]] were exhibited after the French conquest of [[Timbuktu]] (visited by [[Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9]], disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie''); [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] after the [[French Madagascar|occupation]] of [[Madagascar]]; [[Dahomey Amazons|Amazons]] of [[Abomey]] after [[Behanzin]]'s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894.

It was the central theme of the [[Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889\u201390]]. During the Scramble for Africa, an early but secondary focus of all [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over a million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] abolished slavery in 1900 and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa even though it has gradually moved to a [[wage]] economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). Encyclopedia of African history.

{"title_page": "Culture of Kenya", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Culture of Kenya}}\n[[File:LocationKenya.svg|thumb|Location of [[Kenya]]]]\n\nThe '''culture of [[Kenya]]''' consists of multiple trends. Kenya has no single prominent culture that identifies it. It instead consists of various cultures practiced by the country's different communities.\n\n==Specifics==\nThe largest subsaharan ethnic groups are the Bantu, especially the Kikuyu, and the Nilotes, especially the kalenjins, each with unique cultural traits. The other native subsaharan Africans, the ''[[Cushitic peoples|Cushite]]s'', may geopolitically self-identify as [[East Africa]]n, but culture-wise increasingly also consider themselves as ''[[Horner (demography)|Horner]]s''. In addition, the small minority of Kenyans with[[Eurasian]] heritage mainly hail from northwestern parts of India, Oman and the British aristocracy. <ref>Lomoywara, Korir Meshack. Transformation of cattle rustling in west pokot county, kenya 1895-2000. Diss. Kenyatta University, 2018.</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n[[File:Ugali with beef and sauce.JPG|thumb|[[Ugali]] is a mainstay of the cuisine throughout the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Served here with beef and sauce.]]\nThere is no singular dish that represents all of Kenya's wide cuisine. Different communities have their own native foods. Staples are maize and other cereals depending on the region, including [[millet]] and [[sorghum]] eaten with various meats and vegetables. The foods that are universally eaten in Kenya are [[ugali]], [[sukuma wiki]], and nyama choma. Kenya's coastal cuisine is unique and highly regarded throughout the country.\n\nSukuma wiki, a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] phrase which literally means \"to push the week\", is a simple dish made with greens similar to [[kale]] or [[Collard greens|collards]] that can also be made with cassava leaves, sweet potato leaves, or pumpkin leaves. Its Swahili name comes from the fact that it is typically eaten to \"get through the week\" or \"stretch the week\". Nyama choma is grilled meat \u2013 usually goat or sheep - while kuku choma is grilled chicken. It is usually cooked over an open fire. It is usually eaten with [[ugali]] and [[kachumbari]], [[maharagwe]] (bean stew) and [[mchicha]] (shredded spinach).\t\n\nAmong the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] residing in the western region of the country, ''ingokho'' ([[Chicken (food)|chicken]]) and ugali is a favorite meal. Other than these, they also eat tsisaka, miroo, managu and other dishes. In the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]], the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] have long made [[mursik]], which they have with ''kimyet'' ([[ugali]]) and a vegetable relish called ''isageek''. Also among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] of Central Kenya, a lot of [[tubers]], including ''ngwaci'' ([[sweet potatoes]]), ''nd\u0169ma'' ([[taro root]], known in Kenya as [[arrowroot]]), ''ikwa'' ([[Yam (vegetable)|yams]]), and ''mianga'' ([[cassava]]) are eaten, as well as legumes like [[beans]] and a Kikuyu bean known as ''njahi''. Among the [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] residing on the western region around Lake Victoria, \"kuon\" (Ugali) and \"rech\" fish  is a favourite, as well as \"gweno\" (chicken), \"Aliya\" (sun dried meat), \"Onyoso\" (type of ant), \"Ng'wen\" (termitoidae), \"Dede\" (grasshoppers), various birds and green vegetables \"Alode\" such as \"Osuga\", \"Akeyo\", \"Muto\", \"Dodo\", \"Dek\", \"Apoth\" and \"Bo\", all consumed with Ugali.\n\nAs you travel around the country distinct differences are noted mainly based on what foods are locally available around such areas. Grains are a staple food for groups that grow grains (e.g. Kikuyu, Embu, Meru, Kisii, etc.). Other communities such as the Luo and the Coastal community have [[Fish (food)|fish]] and seafood for their staple food as available in such areas. In semi-arid areas like Turkana, foods made from sorghum are more common staple foods. As you move towards the city \u2013 food eaten by working families vary according to preference and ethnicity. Rice and stew is more common with working families, and other dishes like [[chapati]] (parantha), chicken stew, etc.\n\n==National dress==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Masai woman in Nairobi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Maasai people|Maasai]] woman in traditional headdress and attire.]]\nApart from its [[Flag of Kenya|national flag]], Kenya does not have national dress that transcends its diverse ethnic divisions. With more than 42 ethnic communities having their own traditional practices and symbols unique to them, this is a task that has proved elusive. However, several attempts have been made to design an outfit that can be worn as a national dress, much like the [[Kente cloth]] of [[Ghana]].\n\n[[Kitenge]] is a cotton fabric made into colours and design through [[Tie-dye|tie-and-dye]] and heavy embroidery. It is commonly worn by a number of Kenya's populations. Though also worn in many other African countries, Kitenge is yet to be accepted in Kenya as an official dress as it is only worn during ceremonies and non-official functions. The Maasai wear dark red garments to symbolise their love for the earth and their dependence on it. It also stands for courage and blood that is given to them by nature.\n\nThe [[Kanga (African garment)|Kanga]] (Khanga, Lesso) is another cloth that is in common use in practically every Kenyan home. The Kanga is a piece of clothing about {{convert|1.5|m}} by {{convert|1|m}}, screen printed with beautiful sayings in Swahili (or English) and is largely worn by women around the waist and torso.\n\n==Music==\n{{Further|Music of Kenya}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Dubbelvellige cilindrische trom tweede gebruik TMnr 4261-109.jpg|thumb|A traditional Kenyan drum, similar to the [[Djembe]] of West Africa.]]\n[[File:Kenya dancing (10706364576).jpg|thumb|Kenyan dancers performing a traditional dance]]\nKenya is home to a diverse range of music styles, ranging from imported popular music, [[afro-fusion]] and [[benga music]] to traditional [[folk music|folk]] songs. The guitar is the most popular instrument in Kenyan music, and songs often feature intricate guitar rhythms. The most famous guitarist of the early 20th century was Bonie Makie. Other notable musicians of the 60s era include [[Fadhili Williams]], recognised by many as the author of the hit song \"Grace Phillips\" that was later re-done by [[Miriam Makeba]], [[Boney M]] and [[Daudi Kabaka]].\n\nPopular music in the 1980s and 1990s in Kenya could be divided into two genres: the Swahili sound and the Congolese sound. There are varying regional styles, and some performers create tourist-oriented \"hotel pop\" that is similar to western music. [[Them Mushrooms]], later renamed Uyoga, was one of the popular groups in this era.\n\nIn the recent past, newer varieties of modern popular music have arisen which are mostly local derivatives of western hip-hop. Two subgenres have emerged: \"[[Genge]]\" and \"[[Kapuka (music)|Kapuka]]\" beats. This has revolutionised popular Kenyan music and created an industry dominated by the youth. There is also underground Kenyan hip hop that gets less radio play than Kapuka or Genge because it is less club oriented and more focussed on social commentary. Early pioneers include [[Poxi Presha]], [[Kalamashaka]], and [[K-South]]. In Nairobi, hip-hop is viewed as more of a style than as a musical culture. There is a great correlation between the youth who listen to rap music and their economical status in the country with the majority of them coming from wealthy economic backgrounds. Since hip-hop is portrayed through clothing, magazines, and CDs, all of which are expensive, only the wealthier individuals are able to enjoy these luxuries.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Rebensdorf, Alicia. \u201c\u2018Representing the Real\u2019: Exploring Appropriations of Hip-hop Culture in the Internet and Nairobi.\u201d Senior Thesis, Lewis & Clark.</ref>\n\nMainstream artists include [[David Mathenge|Nameless]], [[Redsan]], [[Necessary Noize]], [[Nonini]], [[Juacali]], [[Kleptomaniax]], [[Longombas]], [[Suzzanna Owiyo]], [[Achieng Abura]], [[Eric Wainaina (musician)|Eric Wainaina]] and others. Their sounds run the gamut from [[Reggae]]/[[Ragga]], Pop, Afro-Fusion to Hip-Hop. Contemporary Kenyan music is becoming quite popular, with African-based music channels such as [[Channel O]] and [[MTV Base]], giving them a greater audience(a hybrid of Kenyan languages and English/Swahili).\n\nThe [[Kisima Music Awards]], which recognise musical talent across East Africa, were founded and are currently based in Kenya. Every year numerous Kenyan artists take out categories in the scheme.\n\nThe [[African Children's Choir]] features children, many of whom are orphaned, from Kenya, as well as from other neighbouring African countries.\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Kenyan literature}}Kenya National Theatre contributes a lot when it comes to Literature by building most of the local media personalities. Spoken words and stage acting being the most prominent. People like \"Kennet B\" and his group at National Theatre have done marvelous work from High schools and in the local Radio and Television. A lot of wax painting and color printing is done within the Villages like Kibra and Railway Museum do describe a lot of Kenyan literature. \nHowever, in Kenyan High Schools have done a lot of \"set books\" from various Kenyan Authors like Ngugi wa Thiongo, Margaret ogola, Meja mwangi among others.There work describes more of Kenyan political, social-life and contemporary Kenya lifestyle.\nOther places go learn about the Kenyan set books are Sarakasi Dome.\n\n==Media==\n{{Further|Media of Kenya}}\n\n===Film===\n{{Further|Cinema of Kenya}}\n\n[[File:TS-ONSET-small2.jpg|thumb|left|Filmmaker [[Nathan Collett]] (with camera) shooting feature film ''Togetherness Supreme'' in collaboration with [[Kibera]] youth trainees.]]\nThe government has not been very supportive of the [[film industry]] in Kenya. Few locally-made films have consequently been released. However, a number of foreign productions have been shot in the country. The most recent such movie is the award-winning ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'' directed by [[Fernando Meirelles]] and starring [[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Other films shot in Kenya in the recent past include the [[Academy Award]] winning ''[[Nowhere in Africa]]'' and ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life]]''.\n\n''Sheena, Queen of the Jungle'' won great acclaim in the 1980s and was one of the first foreign movies to be shot entirely on location in Kenya. Other highly acclaimed films set (and shot) in Kenya include [[Karen Blixen]]'s [[Out of Africa (film)|''Out of Africa'']], starring [[Robert Redford]] and [[Meryl Streep]] and directed by [[Sydney Pollack]], and ''[[Born Free]]'', an adaptation of the autobiography of [[Joy Adamson]]. In 1999, part of the movie ''[[To Walk With Lions]]'', which featured actor [[Richard Harris]], was shot on location in the country. Notable film actors from Kenya include Paul Onsongo, David Mulwa, [[Sidede Onyulo]], [[John Sibi Okumu]] and [[Njeri Osaak]].\n\n''Die Wei\u00dfe Massai'' (''[[The White Masai]]''), a German movie about a Swiss Woman who fell in love with a Samburu (Maasai) warrior; won an Award as the best Foreign language Movie (2006) though it was received very poorly in Kenya itself. ''[[Rise and Fall of Idi Amin]]'', based on the Ugandan dictator, was shot in Kenya and is considered one of the most successful movies produced and directed by a Kenyan (Sharad Patel). Indigenous Kenyan filmmakers include Ingolo Wa Keya, Albert Wandago and Judy Kibinge.\n''[[Nowhere in Africa]]'' (Nirgendwo in Afrika \u2013 2001), an award-winning German production, tells a story about German Jewish refugees living in Kenya during Second World War. Most of the movie is set in Kenya and numerous scenes show actors, either Kenyans or main German actors, speaking Swahili.\n\nSome of the latest notable productions include the footage screened to the music of [[U2]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[R.E.M.]] and other acts at the [[Live 8]] concerts in Europe and the US in July 2005, Africa Mon Amor, shot over a period of three months in Samburu, Shaba and Lamu with a renowned German actress, [[Iris Berben]], in 2006.\n\nThe [[Kenya Film Commission]] (KFC) was established by the Kenyan government in 2005, but only became fully operational in mid-2006.\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Raila and the media.jpg|thumb|Former Prime Minister [[Raila Odinga]] speaking to the Kenyan media.]]\nActing for television has proved popular with the Kenyan audience. This [[genre]] has been around from the 1960s when actors like Mzee Pembe graced the Kenyan television screen. Others, like Benson Wanjau (Ojwang' Hatari) and Mary Khavere (Mama Kayai), followed later with their comedies presented exclusively in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], reaching millions of households courtesy of [[Kenya Broadcasting Corporation]] television station.\n\nSerious Television drama was witnessed for the first time in the early 1990s with the entry of popular actors like [[Packson Ngugi]], [[BMJ]] Muriithi alias [[Ben Mutua Jonathan Muriithi]] and Betty Achieng', alongside other thespians who featured in a variety of TV shows following the [[liberalisation]] of the [[Radio waves|airwaves]] by the Kenyan government. Tushauriane, a Swahili television series featuring Kenyan fine actors like Dennis Kashero and Tony Msalame had premiered in the late 1980s becoming arguably one of the most popular productions to ever hit the [[Kenyan]] TV screens.\n\nA new genre in the form of stand-up comedy followed when actor Joni Nderitu entered the scene. The new style was later to be perfected by the group, 'Redykyulass', a trio of young Kenyans \u2013 Walter Mong'are, Tony Njuguna and John Kiare (KJ) \u2013 who specialized in political satire. They lampooned not only the establishment but also [[Daniel arap Moi]], the Kenyan President at the time.<ref>{{cite news|author=|title=Kenyans laugh at their leaders|date=22 December 2000|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1076682.stm|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> The lampooning of the Kenyan head of state was unprecedented and could have easily led to their prosecution, or even detention without trial, had it been done in the 1980s, when mimicking the head of state and exhibiting any form of political dissent was considered treason.\n\nOther Stations known to promote theatre in Kenya include Nation TV, Kenya Television Network (KTN) a Citizen TV, all based in the nation's capital, [[Nairobi]]. K24, the newest TV station to enter the scene, started its test run in Nairobi in December 2007. It captured the interest of many mainly because of the introduction of [[Jeff Koinange]], one of the most popular Kenyan journalists who has worked for major international media houses like [[CNN]], as its chief News anchor.\n\nA satellite- and Internet-based 24-hour pan-African TV channel, [[A24 news channel|A24]], was scheduled to start broadcasting from Nairobi in 2008. This will be in honor and memory of world-renowned and award-winning Kenyan Photojournalist, [[Mohamed Amin]].\n\n==Theatre==\n[[File:BMJ Muriithi DSC 2483.JPG|thumb|left|BMJ, A US-based award-winning Kenyan [[actor]].

Kenya has no single prominent culture that identifies it. It instead consists of various cultures practiced by the country's different communities.\n\n==Specifics==\nThe largest subsaharan ethnic groups are the Bantu, especially the Kikuyu, and the Nilotes, especially the kalenjins, each with unique cultural traits. The other native subsaharan Africans, the ''[[Cushitic peoples|Cushite]]s'', may geopolitically self-identify as [[East Africa]]n, but culture-wise increasingly also consider themselves as ''[[Horner (demography)|Horner]]s''. In addition, the small minority of Kenyans with[[Eurasian]] heritage mainly hail from northwestern parts of India, Oman and the British aristocracy. <ref>Lomoywara, Korir Meshack. Transformation of cattle rustling in west pokot county, kenya 1895-2000. Diss. Kenyatta University, 2018.</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n[[File:Ugali with beef and sauce.JPG|thumb|[[Ugali]] is a mainstay of the cuisine throughout the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Served here with beef and sauce.]]\nThere is no singular dish that represents all of Kenya's wide cuisine. Different communities have their own native foods. Staples are maize and other cereals depending on the region, including [[millet]] and [[sorghum]] eaten with various meats and vegetables. The foods that are universally eaten in Kenya are [[ugali]], [[sukuma wiki]], and nyama choma. Kenya's coastal cuisine is unique and highly regarded throughout the country.\n\nSukuma wiki, a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] phrase which literally means \"to push the week\", is a simple dish made with greens similar to [[kale]] or [[Collard greens|collards]] that can also be made with cassava leaves, sweet potato leaves, or pumpkin leaves. Its Swahili name comes from the fact that it is typically eaten to \"get through the week\" or \"stretch the week\". Nyama choma is grilled meat \u2013 usually goat or sheep - while kuku choma is grilled chicken. It is usually cooked over an open fire. It is usually eaten with [[ugali]] and [[kachumbari]], [[maharagwe]] (bean stew) and [[mchicha]] (shredded spinach).\t\n\nAmong the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] residing in the western region of the country, ''ingokho'' ([[Chicken (food)|chicken]]) and ugali is a favorite meal. Other than these, they also eat tsisaka, miroo, managu and other dishes. In the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]], the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] have long made [[mursik]], which they have with ''kimyet'' ([[ugali]]) and a vegetable relish called ''isageek''. Also among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] of Central Kenya, a lot of [[tubers]], including ''ngwaci'' ([[sweet potatoes]]), ''nd\u0169ma'' ([[taro root]], known in Kenya as [[arrowroot]]), ''ikwa'' ([[Yam (vegetable)|yams]]), and ''mianga'' ([[cassava]]) are eaten, as well as legumes like [[beans]] and a Kikuyu bean known as ''njahi''. Among the [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] residing on the western region around Lake Victoria, \"kuon\" (Ugali) and \"rech\" fish  is a favourite, as well as \"gweno\" (chicken), \"Aliya\" (sun dried meat), \"Onyoso\" (type of ant), \"Ng'wen\" (termitoidae), \"Dede\" (grasshoppers), various birds and green vegetables \"Alode\" such as \"Osuga\", \"Akeyo\", \"Muto\", \"Dodo\", \"Dek\", \"Apoth\" and \"Bo\", all consumed with Ugali.\n\nAs you travel around the country distinct differences are noted mainly based on what foods are locally available around such areas. Grains are a staple food for groups that grow grains (e.g. Kikuyu, Embu, Meru, Kisii, etc.). Other communities such as the Luo and the Coastal community have [[Fish (food)|fish]] and seafood for their staple food as available in such areas. In semi-arid areas like Turkana, foods made from sorghum are more common staple foods. As you move towards the city \u2013 food eaten by working families vary according to preference and ethnicity. Rice and stew is more common with working families, and other dishes like [[chapati]] (parantha), chicken stew, etc.\n\n==National dress==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Masai woman in Nairobi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Maasai people|Maasai]] woman in traditional headdress and attire.]]\nApart from its [[Flag of Kenya|national flag]], Kenya does not have national dress that transcends its diverse ethnic divisions. With more than 42 ethnic communities having their own traditional practices and symbols unique to them, this is a task that has proved elusive. However, several attempts have been made to design an outfit that can be worn as a national dress, much like the [[Kente cloth]] of [[Ghana]].\n\n[[Kitenge]] is a cotton fabric made into colours and design through [[Tie-dye|tie-and-dye]] and heavy embroidery. It is commonly worn by a number of Kenya's populations. Though also worn in many other African countries, Kitenge is yet to be accepted in Kenya as an official dress as it is only worn during ceremonies and non-official functions. The Maasai wear dark red garments to symbolise their love for the earth and their dependence on it. It also stands for courage and blood that is given to them by nature.\n\nThe [[Kanga (African garment)|Kanga]] (Khanga, Lesso) is another cloth that is in common use in practically every Kenyan home. The Kanga is a piece of clothing about {{convert|1.5|m}} by {{convert|1|m}}, screen printed with beautiful sayings in Swahili (or English) and is largely worn by women around the waist and torso.\n\n==Music==\n{{Further|Music of Kenya}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Dubbelvellige cilindrische trom tweede gebruik TMnr 4261-109.jpg|thumb|A traditional Kenyan drum, similar to the [[Djembe]] of West Africa.]]\n[[File:Kenya dancing (10706364576).jpg|thumb|Kenyan dancers performing a traditional dance]]\nKenya is home to a diverse range of music styles, ranging from imported popular music, [[afro-fusion]] and [[benga music]] to traditional [[folk music|folk]] songs. The guitar is the most popular instrument in Kenyan music, and songs often feature intricate guitar rhythms. The most famous guitarist of the early 20th century was Bonie Makie. Other notable musicians of the 60s era include [[Fadhili Williams]], recognised by many as the author of the hit song \"Grace Phillips\" that was later re-done by [[Miriam Makeba]], [[Boney M]] and [[Daudi Kabaka]].\n\nPopular music in the 1980s and 1990s in Kenya could be divided into two genres: the Swahili sound and the Congolese sound. There are varying regional styles, and some performers create tourist-oriented \"hotel pop\" that is similar to western music. [[Them Mushrooms]], later renamed Uyoga, was one of the popular groups in this era.\n\nIn the recent past, newer varieties of modern popular music have arisen which are mostly local derivatives of western hip-hop. Two subgenres have emerged: \"[[Genge]]\" and \"[[Kapuka (music)|Kapuka]]\" beats. This has revolutionised popular Kenyan music and created an industry dominated by the youth. There is also underground Kenyan hip hop that gets less radio play than Kapuka or Genge because it is less club oriented and more focussed on social commentary. Early pioneers include [[Poxi Presha]], [[Kalamashaka]], and [[K-South]]. In Nairobi, hip-hop is viewed as more of a style than as a musical culture. There is a great correlation between the youth who listen to rap music and their economical status in the country with the majority of them coming from wealthy economic backgrounds. Since hip-hop is portrayed through clothing, magazines, and CDs, all of which are expensive, only the wealthier individuals are able to enjoy these luxuries.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Rebensdorf, Alicia. \u201c\u2018Representing the Real\u2019: Exploring Appropriations of Hip-hop Culture in the Internet and Nairobi.\u201d Senior Thesis, Lewis & Clark.</ref>\n\nMainstream artists include [[David Mathenge|Nameless]], [[Redsan]], [[Necessary Noize]], [[Nonini]], [[Juacali]], [[Kleptomaniax]], [[Longombas]], [[Suzzanna Owiyo]], [[Achieng Abura]], [[Eric Wainaina (musician)|Eric Wainaina]] and others. Their sounds run the gamut from [[Reggae]]/[[Ragga]], Pop, Afro-Fusion to Hip-Hop. Contemporary Kenyan music is becoming quite popular, with African-based music channels such as [[Channel O]] and [[MTV Base]], giving them a greater audience(a hybrid of Kenyan languages and English/Swahili).\n\nThe [[Kisima Music Awards]], which recognise musical talent across East Africa, were founded and are currently based in Kenya. Every year numerous Kenyan artists take out categories in the scheme.\n\nThe [[African Children's Choir]] features children, many of whom are orphaned, from Kenya, as well as from other neighbouring African countries.\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Kenyan literature}}Kenya National Theatre contributes a lot when it comes to Literature by building most of the local media personalities. Spoken words and stage acting being the most prominent. People like \"Kennet B\" and his group at National Theatre have done marvelous work from High schools and in the local Radio and Television. A lot of wax painting and color printing is done within the Villages like Kibra and Railway Museum do describe a lot of Kenyan literature. \nHowever, in Kenyan High Schools have done a lot of \"set books\" from various Kenyan Authors like Ngugi wa Thiongo, Margaret ogola, Meja mwangi among others.There work describes more of Kenyan political, social-life and contemporary Kenya lifestyle.\nOther places go learn about the Kenyan set books are Sarakasi Dome.\n\n==Media==\n{{Further|Media of Kenya}}\n\n===Film===\n{{Further|Cinema of Kenya}}\n\n[[File:TS-ONSET-small2.jpg|thumb|left|Filmmaker [[Nathan Collett]] (with camera) shooting feature film ''Togetherness Supreme'' in collaboration with [[Kibera]] youth trainees.]]\nThe government has not been very supportive of the [[film industry]] in Kenya. Few locally-made films have consequently been released. However, a number of foreign productions have been shot in the country. The most recent such movie is the award-winning ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'' directed by [[Fernando Meirelles]] and starring [[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Other films shot in Kenya in the recent past include the [[Academy Award]] winning ''[[Nowhere in Africa]]'' and ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life]]''.\n\n''Sheena, Queen of the Jungle'' won great acclaim in the 1980s and was one of the first foreign movies to be shot entirely on location in Kenya. Other highly acclaimed films set (and shot) in Kenya include [[Karen Blixen]]'s [[Out of Africa (film)|''Out of Africa'']], starring [[Robert Redford]] and [[Meryl Streep]] and directed by [[Sydney Pollack]], and ''[[Born Free]]'', an adaptation of the autobiography of [[Joy Adamson]]. In 1999, part of the movie ''[[To Walk With Lions]]'', which featured actor [[Richard Harris]], was shot on location in the country. Notable film actors from Kenya include Paul Onsongo, David Mulwa, [[Sidede Onyulo]], [[John Sibi Okumu]] and [[Njeri Osaak]].\n\n''Die Wei\u00dfe Massai'' (''[[The White Masai]]''), a German movie about a Swiss Woman who fell in love with a Samburu (Maasai) warrior; won an Award as the best Foreign language Movie (2006) though it was received very poorly in Kenya itself. ''[[Rise and Fall of Idi Amin]]'', based on the Ugandan dictator, was shot in Kenya and is considered one of the most successful movies produced and directed by a Kenyan (Sharad Patel). Indigenous Kenyan filmmakers include Ingolo Wa Keya, Albert Wandago and Judy Kibinge.\n''[[Nowhere in Africa]]'' (Nirgendwo in Afrika \u2013 2001), an award-winning German production, tells a story about German Jewish refugees living in Kenya during Second World War. Most of the movie is set in Kenya and numerous scenes show actors, either Kenyans or main German actors, speaking Swahili.\n\nSome of the latest notable productions include the footage screened to the music of [[U2]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[R.E.M.]] and other acts at the [[Live 8]] concerts in Europe and the US in July 2005, Africa Mon Amor, shot over a period of three months in Samburu, Shaba and Lamu with a renowned German actress, [[Iris Berben]], in 2006.\n\nThe [[Kenya Film Commission]] (KFC) was established by the Kenyan government in 2005, but only became fully operational in mid-2006.\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Raila and the media.jpg|thumb|Former Prime Minister [[Raila Odinga]] speaking to the Kenyan media.]]\nActing for television has proved popular with the Kenyan audience. This [[genre]] has been around from the 1960s when actors like Mzee Pembe graced the Kenyan television screen. Others, like Benson Wanjau (Ojwang' Hatari) and Mary Khavere (Mama Kayai), followed later with their comedies presented exclusively in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], reaching millions of households courtesy of [[Kenya Broadcasting Corporation]] television station.\n\nSerious Television drama was witnessed for the first time in the early 1990s with the entry of popular actors like [[Packson Ngugi]], [[BMJ]] Muriithi alias [[Ben Mutua Jonathan Muriithi]] and Betty Achieng', alongside other thespians who featured in a variety of TV shows following the [[liberalisation]] of the [[Radio waves|airwaves]] by the Kenyan government. Tushauriane, a Swahili television series featuring Kenyan fine actors like Dennis Kashero and Tony Msalame had premiered in the late 1980s becoming arguably one of the most popular productions to ever hit the [[Kenyan]] TV screens.\n\nA new genre in the form of stand-up comedy followed when actor Joni Nderitu entered the scene. The new style was later to be perfected by the group, 'Redykyulass', a trio of young Kenyans \u2013 Walter Mong'are, Tony Njuguna and John Kiare (KJ) \u2013 who specialized in political satire. They lampooned not only the establishment but also [[Daniel arap Moi]], the Kenyan President at the time.<ref>{{cite news|author=|title=Kenyans laugh at their leaders|date=22 December 2000|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1076682.stm|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> The lampooning of the Kenyan head of state was unprecedented and could have easily led to their prosecution, or even detention without trial, had it been done in the 1980s, when mimicking the head of state and exhibiting any form of political dissent was considered treason.\n\nOther Stations known to promote theatre in Kenya include Nation TV, Kenya Television Network (KTN) a Citizen TV, all based in the nation's capital, [[Nairobi]]. K24, the newest TV station to enter the scene, started its test run in Nairobi in December 2007. It captured the interest of many mainly because of the introduction of [[Jeff Koinange]], one of the most popular Kenyan journalists who has worked for major international media houses like [[CNN]], as its chief News anchor.\n\nA satellite- and Internet-based 24-hour pan-African TV channel, [[A24 news channel|A24]], was scheduled to start broadcasting from Nairobi in 2008. This will be in honor and memory of world-renowned and award-winning Kenyan Photojournalist, [[Mohamed Amin]].\n\n==Theatre==\n[[File:BMJ Muriithi DSC 2483.JPG|thumb|left|BMJ, A US-based award-winning Kenyan [[actor]].
