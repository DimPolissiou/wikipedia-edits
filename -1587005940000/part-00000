It is intended to perform both [[Air superiority fighter|air superiority]] and [[attack aircraft|strike]] missions while also providing [[electronic warfare]] and [[intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance]] capabilities. [[Lockheed Martin]] is the prime F-35 contractor, with principal partners [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[BAE Systems]]. The aircraft has three main variants: the [[CTOL|conventional takeoff and landing]] F-35A (CTOL), the [[STOVL|short take-off and vertical-landing]] F-35B (STOVL), and the [[carrier-based]] F-35C (CV/[[CATOBAR]]).\n\nThe aircraft descends from the [[Lockheed Martin X-35]], which in 2001 beat the [[Boeing X-32]] to win the [[Joint Strike Fighter program|Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF) program. Its development is principally funded by the United States, with additional funding from program partner countries from [[NATO]] and close U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and [[S-400 missile system#Turkey|formerly Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/f35/global-partnerships.html |title= F-35 Global Partnerships |website= lockheedmartin.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120902025203/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/f35/global-partnerships.html |archivedate= 2 September 2012 |publisher= Lockheed Martin |access-date= 31 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Dudley05Mar12\">Dudley, Richard.

One progenitor program was the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) which ran from 1983 to 1994; ASTOVL aimed to develop a [[Harrier Jump Jet]] replacement for the U.K. [[Royal Navy]] and the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). Under one of ASTOVL's classified programs, the Supersonic STOVL Fighter (SSF), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] conducted research for a stealthy supersonic STOVL fighter intended for both U.S. Air Force (USAF) and USMC; a key technology explored was the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF) system. Lockheed's concept was a single-engine [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] delta aircraft weighing about {{cvt|24000|lb|kg}} empty. ASTOVL was rechristened as the [[Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter]] (CALF) in 1993 and involved Lockheed, [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[Boeing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/images/C1_V09N3_SM_1271449318_9088.pdf |website= Code One Magazine |publisher= Lockheed |title= Common Lightweight Fighter |first= Stadler |last= Rich |date= October 1994}}</ref><ref name=\"pre-jast_hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |title=History (Pre-JAST) |work=jsf.mil |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206155846/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |archive-date=6 December 2019 |access-date=24 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program emerged following the USAF's Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) and U.S. Navy's (USN) Advanced Fighter-Attack (A/F-X) programs cancellations. MRF, a program for a relatively affordable [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] replacement, was scaled back and delayed due to post-Cold War defense cuts easing the F-16 service life situation and increasing budget pressure from the USAF's [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22]] program. The A/F-X, initially known as the Advanced-Attack (A-X), began in 1991 as the USN's follow-on to the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program for an [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6]] replacement; the resulting [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II|A-12 Avenger II]] was cancelled due to problems and cost overruns in 1991. In the same year, the termination of the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), an offshoot of USAF's [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] (ATF) program, to replace the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] resulted in additional fighter capability being added to A-X, which was then renamed A/F-X. Amid increased budget pressure, the [[Department of Defense]]{{'}}s (DoD) Bottom-Up Review (BUR) in September 1993 announced MRF's and A/F-X's cancellation, with applicable experience brought to the emerging JAST program.<ref name=\"pre-jast_hist\"/> JAST was not meant to develop a new aircraft, instead developing requirements, maturing technologies, and demonstrating concepts for advanced strike warfare.<ref name=\"jast_hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |title=History (JAST) |work=jsf.mil |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715052740/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |archive-date=15 July 2019 |access-date=24 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs JAST progressed, the need for concept demonstrator aircraft by 1996 emerged, which would coincide with the full-scale flight demonstrator phase of ASTOVL/CALF. Because the ASTOVL/CALF concept appeared to align with the JAST charter, the two programs were eventually merged in 1994 under the JAST name, with the program now serving the USAF, USMC, and USN.<ref name=\"jast_hist\"/> JAST was subsequently renamed the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) in 1995, with STOVL submissions by McDonnell Douglas, [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Lockheed Martin]],{{refn|Lockheed acquired General Dynamics fighter division at Fort Worth in 1993 and merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin.|group=N}} and Boeing. The JSF was expected to eventually replace large numbers of multi-role and strike fighters in the inventories of the US and its allies, including the Harrier, F-16, [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]], [[Fairchild A-10|A-10]], and [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barrie |first1=Douglas |last2=Norris |first2=Guy |last3=Warwick |first3=Graham |date=4 April 1995 |title=Short take-off, low funding |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |work=Flight Global |access-date=24 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717172813/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |archive-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nInternational participation is a key aspect of the JSF program, starting with United Kingdom participation in the ASTOVL program. Many international partners requiring modernization of their air forces that deployed the F-16 and F/A-18 were interested in the JSF.

Known as distributed STOVL operations (DSO), F-35Bs would operate from temporary bases in allied territory within the range of hostile ballistic and cruise missiles and be moved between temporary locations inside the enemy's 24- to 48-hour targeting cycle; this strategy accounts for the F-35B's short range, the shortest of the three variants, with mobile forward arming and refueling points (M-Farps) accommodating [[KC-130]] and [[MV-22 Osprey]] aircraft to rearm and refuel the jets, as well as littoral areas for sea links of mobile distribution sites. M-Farps can be based on small airfields, multi-lane roads, or damaged main bases, while F-35Bs return to rear-area USAF bases or friendly ships for scheduled maintenance. Helicopter-portable metal planking is needed to protect unprepared roads from the F-35B's engine exhaust; the USMC are studying lighter heat-resistant alternatives.<ref>[http://aviationweek.com/defense/marines-propose-rapidly-mobile-f-35-operations Marines Propose Rapidly Mobile F-35 Operations] \u2013 Aviationweek.com, 16 December 2014</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:F-35B Ligntining II lands aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) on 17 October 2019 (191017-N-QI061-1159).JPG|thumb|F-35B ''ZM148'' of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No. 617 Squadron]] landing on [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']], 2019|alt=]]\n\nThe United Kingdom's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy both operate the F-35B, known simply as the Lightning in British service;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircraft/f-35b-lightning/ |title=F-35B Lightning |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref> it has replaced the [[British Aerospace Harrier II|Harrier GR9]], which was retired in 2010, and [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado GR4]], which was retired in 2019.

It is intended to perform both [[Air superiority fighter|air superiority]] and [[attack aircraft|strike]] missions while also providing [[electronic warfare]] and [[intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance]] capabilities. [[Lockheed Martin]] is the prime F-35 contractor, with principal partners [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[BAE Systems]]. The aircraft has three main variants: the [[CTOL|conventional takeoff and landing]] F-35A (CTOL), the [[STOVL|short take-off and vertical-landing]] F-35B (STOVL), and the [[carrier-based]] F-35C (CV/[[CATOBAR]]).\n\nThe aircraft descends from the [[Lockheed Martin X-35]], which in 2001 beat the [[Boeing X-32]] to win the [[Joint Strike Fighter program|Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF) program. Its development is principally funded by the United States, with additional funding from program partner countries from [[NATO]] and close U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and [[S-400 missile system#Turkey|formerly Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/f35/global-partnerships.html |title= F-35 Global Partnerships |website= lockheedmartin.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120902025203/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/f35/global-partnerships.html |archivedate= 2 September 2012 |publisher= Lockheed Martin |access-date= 31 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Dudley05Mar12\">Dudley, Richard.

One progenitor program was the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) which ran from 1983 to 1994; ASTOVL aimed to develop a [[Harrier Jump Jet]] replacement for the U.K. [[Royal Navy]] and the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). Under one of ASTOVL's classified programs, the Supersonic STOVL Fighter (SSF), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]] conducted research for a stealthy supersonic STOVL fighter intended for both U.S. Air Force (USAF) and USMC; a key technology explored was the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF) system. Lockheed's concept was a single-engine [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] delta aircraft weighing about {{cvt|24000|lb|kg}} empty. ASTOVL was rechristened as the [[Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter]] (CALF) in 1993 and involved Lockheed, [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[Boeing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/images/C1_V09N3_SM_1271449318_9088.pdf |website= Code One Magazine |publisher= Lockheed |title= Common Lightweight Fighter |first= Stadler |last= Rich |date= October 1994}}</ref><ref name=\"pre-jast_hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |title=History (Pre-JAST) |work=jsf.mil |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206155846/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_prejast.htm |archive-date=6 December 2019 |access-date=24 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program emerged following the USAF's Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) and U.S. Navy's (USN) Advanced Fighter-Attack (A/F-X) programs cancellations. MRF, a program for a relatively affordable [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] replacement, was scaled back and delayed due to post-Cold War defense cuts easing the F-16 service life situation and increasing budget pressure from the USAF's [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22]] program. The A/F-X, initially known as the Advanced-Attack (A-X), began in 1991 as the USN's follow-on to the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program for an [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6]] replacement; the resulting [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II|A-12 Avenger II]] was cancelled due to problems and cost overruns in 1991. In the same year, the termination of the Naval Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), an offshoot of USAF's [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] (ATF) program, to replace the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] resulted in additional fighter capability being added to A-X, which was then renamed A/F-X. Amid increased budget pressure, the [[Department of Defense]]{{'}}s (DoD) Bottom-Up Review (BUR) in September 1993 announced MRF's and A/F-X's cancellation, with applicable experience brought to the emerging JAST program.<ref name=\"pre-jast_hist\"/> JAST was not meant to develop a new aircraft, instead developing requirements, maturing technologies, and demonstrating concepts for advanced strike warfare.<ref name=\"jast_hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |title=History (JAST) |work=jsf.mil |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715052740/http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jast.htm |archive-date=15 July 2019 |access-date=24 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs JAST progressed, the need for concept demonstrator aircraft by 1996 emerged, which would coincide with the full-scale flight demonstrator phase of ASTOVL/CALF. Because the ASTOVL/CALF concept appeared to align with the JAST charter, the two programs were eventually merged in 1994 under the JAST name, with the program now serving the USAF, USMC, and USN.<ref name=\"jast_hist\"/> JAST was subsequently renamed the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) in 1995, with STOVL submissions by McDonnell Douglas, [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Lockheed Martin]],{{refn|Lockheed acquired General Dynamics fighter division at Fort Worth in 1993 and merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin.|group=N}} and Boeing. The JSF was expected to eventually replace large numbers of multi-role and strike fighters in the inventories of the US and its allies, including the Harrier, F-16, [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]], [[Fairchild A-10|A-10]], and [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barrie |first1=Douglas |last2=Norris |first2=Guy |last3=Warwick |first3=Graham |date=4 April 1995 |title=Short take-off, low funding |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |work=Flight Global |access-date=24 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717172813/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1995/1995%20-%200833.html |archive-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nInternational participation is a key aspect of the JSF program, starting with United Kingdom participation in the ASTOVL program. Many international partners requiring modernization of their air forces that deployed the F-16 and F/A-18 were interested in the JSF.

Known as distributed STOVL operations (DSO), F-35Bs would operate from temporary bases in allied territory within the range of hostile ballistic and cruise missiles and be moved between temporary locations inside the enemy's 24- to 48-hour targeting cycle; this strategy accounts for the F-35B's short range, the shortest of the three variants, with mobile forward arming and refueling points (M-Farps) accommodating [[KC-130]] and [[MV-22 Osprey]] aircraft to rearm and refuel the jets, as well as littoral areas for sea links of mobile distribution sites. M-Farps can be based on small airfields, multi-lane roads, or damaged main bases, while F-35Bs return to rear-area USAF bases or friendly ships for scheduled maintenance. Helicopter-portable metal planking is needed to protect unprepared roads from the F-35B's engine exhaust; the USMC are studying lighter heat-resistant alternatives.<ref>[http://aviationweek.com/defense/marines-propose-rapidly-mobile-f-35-operations Marines Propose Rapidly Mobile F-35 Operations] \u2013 Aviationweek.com, 16 December 2014</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:F-35B Ligntining II lands aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) on 17 October 2019 (191017-N-QI061-1159).JPG|thumb|F-35B ''ZM148'' of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No. 617 Squadron]] landing on [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']], 2019|alt=]]\n\nThe United Kingdom's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy both operate the F-35B, known simply as the Lightning in British service;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircraft/f-35b-lightning/ |title=F-35B Lightning |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref> it has replaced the [[British Aerospace Harrier II|Harrier GR9]], which was retired in 2010, and [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado GR4]], which was retired in 2019.

The five stages have since been adopted by bereavement as applying to the survivors of a loved one's death as well alike.\n\nElisabeth wrote over 20 books on death and dying. <ref name=\":0\" /> At the end of her life she was mentally active, co-authoring a book with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]] on grief and grieving.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n*''On Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1969\n*''Questions & Answers on Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1972\n*''Death: The Final Stage of Growth'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1974\n* ''Questions and Answers on Death and Dying: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', Macmillan, 1976. {{ISBN|0-02-567120-0}}.\n*''To Live Until We Say Goodbye'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1978\n*''The Dougy Letter -A Letter to a Dying Child'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1979\n*''Quest, Biography of EKR (Written with Derek Gill)'', (Harper & Row), 1980\n*''Working It Through'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Living with Death & Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Touchstone), 1981\n*''Remember the Secret'', (Celestial Arts/Ten Speed Press), 1981\n*''On Children & Death'', (Simon & Schuster), 1985\n*''AIDS: The Ultimate Challenge'', (Simon & Schuster), 1988\n*''On Life After Death'', (Celestial Arts), 1991\n*''Death Is of Vital Importance'', (Out of Print- Now ''The Tunnel and the Light''), 1995\n*''Unfolding the Wings of Love'' (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1996\n*''Making the Most of the Inbetween'', (Various Foreign), 1996\n*''AIDS & Love'', The Conference in Barcelona, (Spain), 1996\n*''Longing to Go Back Home'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1997\n* ''Working It Through: An Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross Workshop on Life, Death, and Transition'', Simon & Schuster, 1997. {{ISBN|0-684-83942-3}}.\n*''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying'', (Simon & Schuster/Scribner), 1997\n*''Why Are We Here'', (Germany only - Silberschnur), 1999\n*''The Tunnel and the Light'', (Avalon), 1999\n*''Life Lessons: Two Experts on Death and Dying Teach Us About the Mysteries of Life and Living'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]], Scribner, 2001. {{ISBN|0-684-87074-6}}.\n* ''On Grief and Grieving: Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss'', with [[David Kessler (writer)|David Kessler]].

Such damages include bulky chemical adducts, UV-induced pyrimidine dimers, and several forms of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|oxidative damage]].  Mutations in the ERCC2/XPD gene can lead to various syndromes, either [[xeroderma pigmentosum]] (XP), [[trichothiodystrophy]] (TTD) or a combination of XP and TTD (XPTTD), or a combination of XP and [[Cockayne syndrome]] (XPCS).<ref name=Andressoo>{{cite journal |vauthors=Andressoo JO, Hoeijmakers JH, Mitchell JR |title=Nucleotide excision repair disorders and the balance between cancer and aging |journal=Cell Cycle |volume=5 |issue=24 |pages=2886\u20138 |year=2006 |pmid=17172862 |doi=10.4161/cc.5.24.3565 |url=|doi-access=free }}</ref>  TTD and CS both display features of premature aging.

The XPD protein is an indispensable part of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex which is a group of proteins. Gene transcription and repairing damaged DNA are the two vital functions of the TFIIH complex. With the help of gene transcription, the TFIIH complex is able to control the functioning of many different genes in the body and the XPD protein acts as a stabilizer. XPB is another protein in the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex and is also made from the ERCC2 gene, which works in coordination with XDP protein to commence the process of gene transcription.\n\nUltraviolet (UV) rays emerging from the sun, various hazardous chemicals, harmful radiations, are all known parameters for the sabotage of the DNA. A normal and healthy cell has the capability to fix the DNA damages before the problems begin due to the damaged DNA. Cells use Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) to fix damaged DNA. As a part of the process, the double-stranded DNA that encircles the damage is separated by the TFIIH complex. The XPD protein acts as a helicase and helps with the NER process by binding to the specific regions of DNA and by unwinding the two DNA spiral strands. This exposes the damaged protein which allows the other proteins to remove the damaged section and replace the impaired area with the correct DNA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ERCC2|title=ERCC2 gene|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n== ERCC2 and Xeroderma Pigmentosum ==\nXeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is associated with the lack of DNA repair mechanism and high susceptibility of cancer. A slight insufficiency in the DNA repair mechanism may result in the development of cancer. \u00a0Some cancers have been recognized with the help of the relation between the single nucleotide polymorphism and genes.The XPD protein produced by ERCC2 gene plays an important role in the process of transcription and cell death and is also known for nucleotide excision repair pathway. Various literature studies have reviewed the correlation between polymorphisms in ERCC2 and reduced DNA repair efficiency and their influence on the development of the cancers as well as interaction with environmental exposures.\n\nThe second most common cause of xeroderma pigmentosum in the United States are due to mutations in ERCC2 gene, more than twenty-five of which have been observed in people with this disease. The xeroderma pigmentosum is caused when the ERCC2 gene prevents the TFIIH complex from repairing the damaged DNA constructively.\n\nConsequently, all the deformity collects inside the DNA, sabotaging the repair mechanism and results in the cancerous or dead cells. Thus, the people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosum are highly sensitive to the UV rays from the sunlight due to the DNA repair problems.\n\nSo, when UV rays harms the genes, the cell grows and divides in an uncontrolled fashion and is highly prone to be cancerous. Xeroderma pigmentosum have high risk of developing cancer in skin and eyes as they are the areas mostly exposed to sun. Xeroderma pigmentosum caused by ERCC2 mutations is associated with the numerable developmental neurological malfunctioning which includes; hearing loss, poor coordination, mobility issues, lack of intellectual abilities, difficulties in talking, walking, swallowing the food and seizures.\n\nResearchers suspect that these neurological abnormalities are due to the accumulation of DNA damage despite the brain not being exposed to UV rays. Other factors might cause the DNA damage in nerve cells as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benhamou|first=Simone|last2=Sarasin|first2=Alain|date=2002-11-01|title=ERCC2/XPD gene polymorphisms and cancer

The XPD protein is an indispensable part of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex which is a group of proteins. Gene transcription and repairing damaged DNA are the two vital functions of the TFIIH complex. With the help of gene transcription, the TFIIH complex is able to control the functioning of many different genes in the body and the XPD protein acts as a stabilizer. XPB is another protein in the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex and is also made from the ERCC2 gene, which works in coordination with XDP protein to commence the process of gene transcription.\n\nUltraviolet (UV) rays emerging from the sun, various hazardous chemicals, harmful radiations, are all known parameters for the sabotage of the DNA. A normal and healthy cell has the capability to fix the DNA damages before the problems begin due to the damaged DNA. Cells use Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) to fix damaged DNA. As a part of the process, the double-stranded DNA that encircles the damage is separated by the TFIIH complex. The XPD protein acts as a helicase and helps with the NER process by binding to the specific regions of DNA and by unwinding the two DNA spiral strands. This exposes the damaged protein which allows the other proteins to remove the damaged section and replace the impaired area with the correct DNA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ERCC2|title=ERCC2 gene|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n== ERCC2 and Xeroderma Pigmentosum ==\nXeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is associated with the lack of DNA repair mechanism and high susceptibility of cancer.

The sequel to [[Turtle Rock Studios]]'s ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'', it was released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] in November 2009, [[Mac OS X]] in October 2010, and [[Linux]] in July 2013.<ref name=\"Steam News 4436\"/><ref name=\"Left 4 Dead Blog\"/>\n\n''Left 4 Dead 2'' builds upon cooperatively focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]], the same game engine used in the original ''Left 4 Dead''. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic [[pandemic]], ''Left 4 Dead 2'' focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of zombies, known as the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and act extremely aggressive. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with [[safe house]]s that act as [[Continue point|checkpoints]], with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale. The gameplay is [[Procedural generation|procedurally altered]] by the \"[[artificial intelligence|AI]] Director 2.0\", which monitors the players' performance and adjusts the [[scenario]] to provide a dynamic challenge. Other new features include new types of special infected and an arsenal of [[melee weapon]]s.<ref name=\"rps preview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/06/01/left-4-dead-2-exclusive-rps-preview/ |title=Left 4 Dead 2: Exclusive RPS Preview |first=John |last=Walker |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2009-06-01 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]}}</ref>\n\nThe game made its world premiere at [[E3 2009]] with a trailer during the [[Microsoft]] press event.<ref name=\"e3preview\">{{cite web |url=http://e3.gamespot.com/live.html?tag=live-schedule |title=E3 09 Live Game Demos at GameSpot |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-02 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> Prior to release, it received a combination of positive and negative critical and community reactions.

The game presents five new campaigns, each composed of three to five smaller levels. As in the first game, each campaign is presented in menus and loading screens as a film starring the four Survivors; and features, upon completing a campaign, a faux credits screen which acts as the final scoreboard for the players and recaps certain performance statistics for the group. In every campaign, most levels involve the Survivors attempting to reach a safe zone and close the door once they are all safely inside. However, the final level in each campaign requires the Survivors to call for rescue and either survive a prolonged onslaught until rescue arrives, pass through an especially challenging gauntlet of Infected to reach an escape vehicle, or (in ''[[#Story|Dead Center]]'' and ''[[#DLC campaigns|The Passing]]'') collect and utilize fuel cans to enable their escape.<ref name=dc_04 /><ref name=passing_03 />\n\nEach Survivor can carry one each of five categories of equipment: primary weapons, secondary weapons, throwable weapons, major medical supplies (which also includes ammunition upgrades) and minor medical supplies. Primary weapons are broken down into four tiers based on their availability and attributes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/100/1002529p1.html |title=Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 Compared |publisher=IGN |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2009-09-25 |first=Jason |last=Ocampo}}</ref> Tier one weapons (such as the ''[[submachine gun|SMG]]'' and ''Chrome Shotgun'') deal damage relatively slowly and serve as basic offensive weapons. Tier two weapons (such as the ''Assault Rifle'' and ''Combat Shotgun'') deal damage faster and often appear in later maps of each chapter. The two tier three weapons (''Grenade Launcher'' and ''M60'') differ from tier one and two weapons both because of their rarity and because players cannot refill their ammunition from ammunition dumps. They deal damage quickly at the cost of limited ammo. Tier four weapons are all mounted weapon systems and carry unlimited ammunition. The mounted weapons deal damage the fastest, but at the cost of overheating after a period of non-stop use. The mounted weapons are in set positions in maps and have a fixed arc of fire. They cannot be given ammunition upgrades like other weapons and players cannot utilize the laser sights attachment with them. There are three types of secondary weapons available: melee weapons, small caliber pistols (that can be dual wielded) and large caliber pistols. Although melee weapons cause extra damage to Infected when struck, the Survivors can use any other weapon or item for weaker melee attacks that can push the Infected back. Players also carry a flashlight with infinite battery life, the use of which enables players to see in the dark (with the downside of the player gaining the attention of the Infected much faster). They may also carry a single [[first aid kit]], special ammo pack, or a [[Defibrillation|defibrillator]] in their major medical supply slot; in addition to either pain pills or an [[adrenaline]] shot in their minor medical supply slot. They may also carry a single throwable weapon\u2014[[Molotov cocktail]]s to set an area on fire; [[pipe bomb]]s to attract any nearby Infected to the flashing light and sound it makes until it explodes;<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Ellis''': ''[throwing a pipe bomb]'' Hey! Chase ''this!''}}</ref> and jars of Boomer [[bile]], which attracts Common Infected to whatever it hits (e.g. fires, Special Infected, each other).<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Nick''': ''[throwing Boomer bile]'' Puke in the hole! [or] Fight amongst yourselves!}}</ref>\n\nTo enable situational awareness of other Survivors, players are shown the health and status of their fellow survivors. If a player does not have direct sight of another Survivor (e.g. a wall is blocking their view of the others), they will be shown the Survivor's highlighted silhouette. The Survivors are also susceptible to [[friendly fire]], forcing players to exercise caution when shooting or swinging their weapons.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |level=Any |quote='''Nick''': ''[when a Survivor shoots him]'' You know, it's not all right that you are ''shooting me!'' [or] Stop! Shooting ''me'' isn't gonna get ''us'' anywhere!}}</ref> As Survivors take damage, they move more slowly; if a Survivor's health drops to zero, they are incapacitated and left to fight off the Infected using a handgun until rescued by another Survivor. If a Survivor dies, they remain dead until the next level, unless revived by a defibrillator, or, in Campaign or Singleplayer mode, reappear in a \"Rescue Closet\" to be freed by other Survivors.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |level=Any |quote=''[When a Survivor is trapped in a Rescue Closet]''<br/>'''Coach''': Hey!

[or] Okay, I triple-dog-dare you to rescue me!}}</ref> Should all Survivors die or be incapacitated, the game will end, at which point the players may restart that chapter or quit the game.\n\n===Game modes===\n''Left 4 Dead 2'' includes 5 regular game modes:\n* '''Campaign''': up to four human players fight against the Infected to make their way through Campaign stages; any Survivor not controlled by a human player is controlled by the computer. \n* A '''Singleplayer''' mode allows players to play without intrusion from human players, working through the Campaign stages with three computer-controlled Survivor allies.\n* '''Versus''': up to four other human players take control of various [[#The Infected|Special Infected]] to try and prevent the Survivors from completing a stage. Special Infected are randomly assigned to Infected players; they cannot control the Witch or any Common Infected. Occasionally, as determined by the AI Director, certain players will become the Tank. The two teams swap sides once per stage, and are scored based on their stage progress as Survivors. If both teams make it to the saferoom with all four Survivors, a 25-point tiebreaker is awarded to the team that dealt the most combined damage as Special Infected.\n* '''[[Survival mode|Survival]]''': a timed challenge where the Survivors are trapped in a section of the campaign maps, and try to survive as long as possible against an unending onslaught of Infected.\n* '''Scavenge''': a new 4-on-4 mode that requires the Survivor players to collect and use as many fuel cans scattered about a level to fill up a power generator, while the Infected players attempt to stop them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/60783 |first=Chris |last=Faylor |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2009-10-07 |title=Left 4 Dead 2's New Multiplayer Mode Revealed |publisher=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref>\n\n''Left 4 Dead 2'' also features a '''Realism''' mode, which can be enabled at any difficulty for either Campaign or Versus. This mode removes some of the video-game aspects from the gameplay: Survivors cannot see each other's silhouettes, and dead teammates can only be revived with defibrillators and will not respawn later in the level.<ref name=\"realism mode\"/> Weapons and other items will only glow when the player is within a few feet, forcing the players to search the levels more thoroughly. Headshots to enemies deal more damage, whereas limb or body shots require more shots.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} In addition, the Witch enemy can kill any Survivor she would have normally incapacitated (on difficulties other than Easy). Designed to force players to work closely together and rely on voice communication, Valve created Realism mode to give players a way \"to be challenged as a team\" without having to increase the difficulty level of the game.<ref name=\"realism mode\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/videos/eg-expo-2009-developer-sessions-left-4-dead-2-q-and-a |title=EG Expo 2009 Developer Sessions: Left 4 Dead 2 Q&A |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2009-11-03 |format=[[Adobe Flash|Flash video]]}}</ref>\nN\nFinally, in later versions of the game, there is a Mutation option, in which players can select from a menu of 30 variations, some singleplayer, some multiplayer (and some of the latter cooperative, some versus, or both). Each variation changes one or more major game dynamics, such as: constantly draining health, solo mode with no Survivor allies, death upon incapacitation, only one kind of weapon available, coop that later switches to versus, shooting or targeting constraints, an enemy type with increased power, increased numbers of Special Infected, etc.  One of these modes, named GunBrain, is a weapons stats analyzer.\n\n===The Infected===\nWhile also referred to as zombies, the Infected are humans who have contracted a mutated strain of an infection, though neither the source nor nature of this \"Green Flu\" are made clear in the games. The most numerous Infected encountered by the survivors are the common Infected. Though individually weak, they can swarm and overwhelm the Survivors, especially when separated from their teammates. Damage to the infected in ''Left 4 Dead 2'' is portrayed more realistically, with bullets and melee weapons ripping off bits of flesh and, in some cases, limbs.<ref>{{cite web |first=Shaun |last=McInnis |title=Left 4 Dead 2 Updated Hands-On Impressions |url=http://pax.gamespot.com/story/6216891/left-4-dead-2-updated-hands-on-impressions |publisher=Gamestop |date=2009-09-05 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908144953/http://pax.gamespot.com/story/6216891/left-4-dead-2-updated-hands-on-impressions |archive-date=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A new addition to ''Left 4 Dead 2'' is the Uncommon Infected unique to each campaign. By virtue of location and equipment worn pre-infection, they possess abilities that separate them from the Common Infected. For example, the ''Dead Center'' campaign introduces infected CEDA agents in [[hazmat suit]]s, making them [[fireproof]];<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |level=Dead Center |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Nick''': ''[when the group encounters Hazmat Infected]'' Are those guys fireproof?}}</ref> ''Dark Carnival'' includes clowns, whose squeaking shoes attract small hordes of Common Infected;<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |level=Dark Carnival, Stages 2-5 |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Coach''': ''[when the group encounters Clown Infected]'' That clown's attractin' zombies!}}</ref> and ''The Parish'' includes infected [[Private security company|private security contractor]]s in [[Riot-gear|riot gear]], making them [[bulletproof]] from the front.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |level=The Parish |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Coach''': ''[when the group encounters Riot Infected]'' That zombie's got armor!

The presence of such Infected nearby is hinted at by sound effects or musical cues unique to each type. The five Special Infected from the first game return in ''Left 4 Dead 2'', some with modified behavior and skin models:\n* The '''Boomer''': an extremely bloated Infected who vomits bile.  The bile attracts a horde of Common Infected on contact with Survivors and also momentarily blinds them.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Coach''': ''[hit by Boomer bile]'' Augh, ''shit!''

I am ''covered'' in ''vomit''...''again.''}}</ref>  Upon death, they explode and can also spray bile onto nearby Survivors.\n* The '''Hunter''': an agile male Infected that can pounce on and incapacitate Survivors from great distances, tearing at them until the Survivor dies or another Survivor shoves him off/kills him.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Ellis''': ''[when attacked by Hunter]'' Get him&nbsp;\u2013 OFF! (or) GET HIM OFF ME, DAMN IT!}}</ref>\n* The '''Smoker''': a male Infected with a long tongue<!--they are ''not'' intestines--> that it uses to ensnare Survivors from a distance, continually choking them. Upon death, he releases a cloud of smoke that can obscure the Survivors' vision and cause them to cough, should they come in direct contact with the smoke.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Coach''': ''[when a Smoker \"grabs\" him]'' Hey!

One key development factor was recognizing a way to create greater variation in the appearance of the common infected through a number of modeling and rendering tasks. Simple changes of the underlying geometry of the model, either the head or the body, with the resulting effects on the texture mapping was one means to create apparent variation. Another means was created by using different head textures along with various blood and dirt maps, and similarly different wounds applied to the body texture. A final means to alter the tone of both the skin and the clothing worn by the infected. As a result, a single infected model could have up to 24,000 variations within the game. This allowed Valve to effectively only keep two to six common infected core models in memory for each level, leaving only the unique infected for each campaign and the special infected as their own unique models. As a result, the memory use for the infected dropped by 50%.<ref name=\"l4d2 shading\">{{cite conference |url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/GDC10_ShaderTechniquesL4D2.pdf |title=Shading a Bigger, Better Sequel: Shading Techniques in Left 4 Dead 2 |first=Bronwen |last=Grimes |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |conference=2010 [[Game Developers Conference]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201172323/http://valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/GDC10_ShaderTechniquesL4D2.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Valve's programmers also sought how to better represent damage the players did to the infected by showing inflicted wounds in the appropriate location and in a manner based on the weapon used, allowing for the inclusion of more resilient infected creatures in advanced game modes. They had simulated this in ''Left 4 Dead'' by having five possible character models that would result from a fatal attack but felt this could be advanced further. Already limited by memory concerns on the Xbox 360 that prevented further variations on the core infected models, the team devised a system of using textures with transparencies combined with ellipsoid culling from any infected character model to simulate the wounds, with several graphical process simplifications to avoid taxing the rendering system. This allowed the team to simulate up to two such wounds on each infected using only 13% of the memory resources of the based system in ''Left 4 Dead''.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/gdc2010_vlachos_l4d2wounds.pdf |first=Alex |last=Vlachos |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-08-09 |title=Rendering Wounds in Left 4 Dead 2 |conference=2010 [[Game Developers Conference]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201172018/http://valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/gdc2010_vlachos_l4d2wounds.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAnother visual aspect that the Valve team explored was the rendering of water, particularly in the \"Swamp Fever\" campaign, which takes place mostly in a large swamp area. Valve found early play-testers would become confused with the large, tree-covered map, but by adding hints of water movement in the direction they were to go, there was a significant reduction in players becoming lost on the map.  The water maps were created by using the 3D animation tool [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]] against its landscape maps to create realistic water flow patterns as surface maps. These surface maps were then applied in a \"flowing\" manner instead of the scrolling manner used in previous games. These water effects were further expanded upon for Valve's next game, ''[[Portal 2]]''.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/siggraph2010_vlachos_waterflow.pdf |title=Water Flow in Portal 2 |first=Alex |last=Vlachos |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |conference=[[SigGraph]] 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820182322/http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/siggraph2010_vlachos_waterflow.pdf |archive-date=2010-08-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDoug Lombardi, vice-president of marketing for Valve, noted that the [[software development kit|SDK]] released for ''Left 4 Dead'' would also be compatible with ''Left 4 Dead 2''.<ref name=\"valve protest reply\"/>\n\n==Promotion==\nPC and Xbox 360 players who pre-ordered ''Left 4 Dead 2'' through participating retailers gained early access to the game's demo, which was released on October 27, 2009 for Xbox Live and October 28, 2009 for PC players, and an exclusive baseball bat melee weapon to be used in game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/60717 |title=Left 4 Dead 2 Pre-orders Get 10% Off |first=Chris |last=Faylor |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2009-10-03 |publisher=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2009/10/29/left-4-dead-2-pc-demo-off-to-a-shambling-start/ |title=Left 4 Dead 2 PC demo off to a shambling start |first=Nathan |last=Grayson |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2009-10-29 |publisher=[[VG247]]}}</ref> Pre-ordering the PC version of the game through the Steam network also unlocks Bill's beret from ''Left 4 Dead'' for use in the PC version of ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5395713/preorder-bonus-puts-l4d-headwear-in-team-fortress-2 |title=Preorder Bonus Puts L4D Headwear in Team Fortress 2 |first=Owen |last=Good |publisher=Kotaku |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref> Also, when a person buys the game and starts up Team Fortress 2, they will get a frying pan as a melee weapon and Ellis' hat as an in-game hat.

The gameplay is [[Procedural generation|procedurally altered]] by the \"[[artificial intelligence|AI]] Director 2.0\", which monitors the players' performance and adjusts the [[scenario]] to provide a dynamic challenge. Other new features include new types of special infected and an arsenal of [[melee weapon]]s.<ref name=\"rps preview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/06/01/left-4-dead-2-exclusive-rps-preview/ |title=Left 4 Dead 2: Exclusive RPS Preview |first=John |last=Walker |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2009-06-01 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]}}</ref>\n\nThe game made its world premiere at [[E3 2009]] with a trailer during the [[Microsoft]] press event.<ref name=\"e3preview\">{{cite web |url=http://e3.gamespot.com/live.html?tag=live-schedule |title=E3 09 Live Game Demos at GameSpot |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-02 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> Prior to release, it received a combination of positive and negative critical and community reactions.

The game presents five new campaigns, each composed of three to five smaller levels. As in the first game, each campaign is presented in menus and loading screens as a film starring the four Survivors; and features, upon completing a campaign, a faux credits screen which acts as the final scoreboard for the players and recaps certain performance statistics for the group. In every campaign, most levels involve the Survivors attempting to reach a safe zone and close the door once they are all safely inside. However, the final level in each campaign requires the Survivors to call for rescue and either survive a prolonged onslaught until rescue arrives, pass through an especially challenging gauntlet of Infected to reach an escape vehicle, or (in ''[[#Story|Dead Center]]'' and ''[[#DLC campaigns|The Passing]]'') collect and utilize fuel cans to enable their escape.<ref name=dc_04 /><ref name=passing_03 />\n\nEach Survivor can carry one each of five categories of equipment: primary weapons, secondary weapons, throwable weapons, major medical supplies (which also includes ammunition upgrades) and minor medical supplies. Primary weapons are broken down into four tiers based on their availability and attributes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/100/1002529p1.html |title=Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 Compared |publisher=IGN |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2009-09-25 |first=Jason |last=Ocampo}}</ref> Tier one weapons (such as the ''[[submachine gun|SMG]]'' and ''Chrome Shotgun'') deal damage relatively slowly and serve as basic offensive weapons. Tier two weapons (such as the ''Assault Rifle'' and ''Combat Shotgun'') deal damage faster and often appear in later maps of each chapter. The two tier three weapons (''Grenade Launcher'' and ''M60'') differ from tier one and two weapons both because of their rarity and because players cannot refill their ammunition from ammunition dumps. They deal damage quickly at the cost of limited ammo. Tier four weapons are all mounted weapon systems and carry unlimited ammunition. The mounted weapons deal damage the fastest, but at the cost of overheating after a period of non-stop use. The mounted weapons are in set positions in maps and have a fixed arc of fire. They cannot be given ammunition upgrades like other weapons and players cannot utilize the laser sights attachment with them. There are three types of secondary weapons available: melee weapons, small caliber pistols (that can be dual wielded) and large caliber pistols. Although melee weapons cause extra damage to Infected when struck, the Survivors can use any other weapon or item for weaker melee attacks that can push the Infected back. Players also carry a flashlight with infinite battery life, the use of which enables players to see in the dark (with the downside of the player gaining the attention of the Infected much faster). They may also carry a single [[first aid kit]], special ammo pack, or a [[Defibrillation|defibrillator]] in their major medical supply slot; in addition to either pain pills or an [[adrenaline]] shot in their minor medical supply slot. They may also carry a single throwable weapon\u2014[[Molotov cocktail]]s to set an area on fire; [[pipe bomb]]s to attract any nearby Infected to the flashing light and sound it makes until it explodes;<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Ellis''': ''[throwing a pipe bomb]'' Hey!

[or] Fight amongst yourselves!}}</ref>\n\nTo enable situational awareness of other Survivors, players are shown the health and status of their fellow survivors. If a player does not have direct sight of another Survivor (e.g. a wall is blocking their view of the others), they will be shown the Survivor's highlighted silhouette. The Survivors are also susceptible to [[friendly fire]], forcing players to exercise caution when shooting or swinging their weapons.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |level=Any |quote='''Nick''': ''[when a Survivor shoots him]'' You know, it's not all right that you are ''shooting me!'' [or] Stop! Shooting ''me'' isn't gonna get ''us'' anywhere!}}</ref> As Survivors take damage, they move more slowly; if a Survivor's health drops to zero, they are incapacitated and left to fight off the Infected using a handgun until rescued by another Survivor. If a Survivor dies, they remain dead until the next level, unless revived by a defibrillator, or, in Campaign or Singleplayer mode, reappear in a \"Rescue Closet\" to be freed by other Survivors.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |level=Any |quote=''[When a Survivor is trapped in a Rescue Closet]''<br/>'''Coach''': Hey!

[or] Okay, I triple-dog-dare you to rescue me!}}</ref> Should all Survivors die or be incapacitated, the game will end, at which point the players may restart that chapter or quit the game.\n\n===Game modes===\n''Left 4 Dead 2'' includes 5 regular game modes:\n* '''Campaign''': up to four human players fight against the Infected to make their way through Campaign stages; any Survivor not controlled by a human player is controlled by the computer. \n* A '''Singleplayer''' mode allows players to play without intrusion from human players, working through the Campaign stages with three computer-controlled Survivor allies.\n* '''Versus''': up to four other human players take control of various [[#The Infected|Special Infected]] to try and prevent the Survivors from completing a stage. Special Infected are randomly assigned to Infected players; they cannot control the Witch or any Common Infected. Occasionally, as determined by the AI Director, certain players will become the Tank. The two teams swap sides once per stage, and are scored based on their stage progress as Survivors. If both teams make it to the saferoom with all four Survivors, a 25-point tiebreaker is awarded to the team that dealt the most combined damage as Special Infected.\n* '''[[Survival mode|Survival]]''': a timed challenge where the Survivors are trapped in a section of the campaign maps, and try to survive as long as possible against an unending onslaught of Infected.\n* '''Scavenge''': a new 4-on-4 mode that requires the Survivor players to collect and use as many fuel cans scattered about a level to fill up a power generator, while the Infected players attempt to stop them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/60783 |first=Chris |last=Faylor |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2009-10-07 |title=Left 4 Dead 2's New Multiplayer Mode Revealed |publisher=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref>\n\n''Left 4 Dead 2'' also features a '''Realism''' mode, which can be enabled at any difficulty for either Campaign or Versus. This mode removes some of the video-game aspects from the gameplay: Survivors cannot see each other's silhouettes, and dead teammates can only be revived with defibrillators and will not respawn later in the level.<ref name=\"realism mode\"/> Weapons and other items will only glow when the player is within a few feet, forcing the players to search the levels more thoroughly. Headshots to enemies deal more damage, whereas limb or body shots require more shots.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} In addition, the Witch enemy can kill any Survivor she would have normally incapacitated (on difficulties other than Easy). Designed to force players to work closely together and rely on voice communication, Valve created Realism mode to give players a way \"to be challenged as a team\" without having to increase the difficulty level of the game.<ref name=\"realism mode\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/videos/eg-expo-2009-developer-sessions-left-4-dead-2-q-and-a |title=EG Expo 2009 Developer Sessions: Left 4 Dead 2 Q&A |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2009-11-03 |format=[[Adobe Flash|Flash video]]}}</ref>\n\nFinally, in later versions of the game, there is a Mutation option, in which players can select from a menu of 30 variations, some singleplayer, some multiplayer (and some of the latter cooperative, some versus, or both). Each variation changes one or more major game dynamics, such as: constantly draining health, solo mode with no Survivor allies, death upon incapacitation, only one kind of weapon available, coop that later switches to versus, shooting or targeting constraints, an enemy type with increased power, increased numbers of Special Infected, etc.  One of these modes, named GunBrain, is a weapons stats analyzer.\n\n===The Infected===\nWhile also referred to as zombies, the Infected are humans who have contracted a mutated strain of an infection, though neither the source nor nature of this \"Green Flu\" are made clear in the games. The most numerous Infected encountered by the survivors are the common Infected. Though individually weak, they can swarm and overwhelm the Survivors, especially when separated from their teammates. Damage to the infected in ''Left 4 Dead 2'' is portrayed more realistically, with bullets and melee weapons ripping off bits of flesh and, in some cases, limbs.<ref>{{cite web |first=Shaun |last=McInnis |title=Left 4 Dead 2 Updated Hands-On Impressions |url=http://pax.gamespot.com/story/6216891/left-4-dead-2-updated-hands-on-impressions |publisher=Gamestop |date=2009-09-05 |accessdate=2009-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908144953/http://pax.gamespot.com/story/6216891/left-4-dead-2-updated-hands-on-impressions |archive-date=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A new addition to ''Left 4 Dead 2'' is the Uncommon Infected unique to each campaign.

The presence of such Infected nearby is hinted at by sound effects or musical cues unique to each type. The five Special Infected from the first game return in ''Left 4 Dead 2'', some with modified behavior and skin models:\n* The '''Boomer''': an extremely bloated Infected who vomits bile.  The bile attracts a horde of Common Infected on contact with Survivors and also momentarily blinds them.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Coach''': ''[hit by Boomer bile]'' Augh, ''shit!''

Upon death, he releases a cloud of smoke that can obscure the Survivors' vision and cause them to cough, should they come in direct contact with the smoke.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Left 4 Dead 2 |developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |publisher=Valve |version=2.1.0.7 |quote='''Coach''': ''[when a Smoker \"grabs\" him]'' Hey!

One key development factor was recognizing a way to create greater variation in the appearance of the common infected through a number of modeling and rendering tasks. Simple changes of the underlying geometry of the model, either the head or the body, with the resulting effects on the texture mapping was one means to create apparent variation. Another means was created by using different head textures along with various blood and dirt maps, and similarly different wounds applied to the body texture. A final means to alter the tone of both the skin and the clothing worn by the infected. As a result, a single infected model could have up to 24,000 variations within the game. This allowed Valve to effectively only keep two to six common infected core models in memory for each level, leaving only the unique infected for each campaign and the special infected as their own unique models. As a result, the memory use for the infected dropped by 50%.<ref name=\"l4d2 shading\">{{cite conference |url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/GDC10_ShaderTechniquesL4D2.pdf |title=Shading a Bigger, Better Sequel: Shading Techniques in Left 4 Dead 2 |first=Bronwen |last=Grimes |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |conference=2010 [[Game Developers Conference]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201172323/http://valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/GDC10_ShaderTechniquesL4D2.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Valve's programmers also sought how to better represent damage the players did to the infected by showing inflicted wounds in the appropriate location and in a manner based on the weapon used, allowing for the inclusion of more resilient infected creatures in advanced game modes. They had simulated this in ''Left 4 Dead'' by having five possible character models that would result from a fatal attack but felt this could be advanced further. Already limited by memory concerns on the Xbox 360 that prevented further variations on the core infected models, the team devised a system of using textures with transparencies combined with ellipsoid culling from any infected character model to simulate the wounds, with several graphical process simplifications to avoid taxing the rendering system. This allowed the team to simulate up to two such wounds on each infected using only 13% of the memory resources of the based system in ''Left 4 Dead''.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/gdc2010_vlachos_l4d2wounds.pdf |first=Alex |last=Vlachos |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-08-09 |title=Rendering Wounds in Left 4 Dead 2 |conference=2010 [[Game Developers Conference]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201172018/http://valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/gdc2010_vlachos_l4d2wounds.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAnother visual aspect that the Valve team explored was the rendering of water, particularly in the \"Swamp Fever\" campaign, which takes place mostly in a large swamp area. Valve found early play-testers would become confused with the large, tree-covered map, but by adding hints of water movement in the direction they were to go, there was a significant reduction in players becoming lost on the map.  The water maps were created by using the 3D animation tool [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]] against its landscape maps to create realistic water flow patterns as surface maps. These surface maps were then applied in a \"flowing\" manner instead of the scrolling manner used in previous games. These water effects were further expanded upon for Valve's next game, ''[[Portal 2]]''.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/siggraph2010_vlachos_waterflow.pdf |title=Water Flow in Portal 2 |first=Alex |last=Vlachos |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |conference=[[SigGraph]] 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820182322/http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/siggraph2010_vlachos_waterflow.pdf |archive-date=2010-08-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDoug Lombardi, vice-president of marketing for Valve, noted that the [[software development kit|SDK]] released for ''Left 4 Dead'' would also be compatible with ''Left 4 Dead 2''.<ref name=\"valve protest reply\"/>\n\n==Promotion==\nPC and Xbox 360 players who pre-ordered ''Left 4 Dead 2'' through participating retailers gained early access to the game's demo, which was released on October 27, 2009 for Xbox Live and October 28, 2009 for PC players, and an exclusive baseball bat melee weapon to be used in game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/60717 |title=Left 4 Dead 2 Pre-orders Get 10% Off |first=Chris |last=Faylor |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2009-10-03 |publisher=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2009/10/29/left-4-dead-2-pc-demo-off-to-a-shambling-start/ |title=Left 4 Dead 2 PC demo off to a shambling start |first=Nathan |last=Grayson |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2009-10-29 |publisher=[[VG247]]}}</ref> Pre-ordering the PC version of the game through the Steam network also unlocks Bill's beret from ''Left 4 Dead'' for use in the PC version of ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5395713/preorder-bonus-puts-l4d-headwear-in-team-fortress-2 |title=Preorder Bonus Puts L4D Headwear in Team Fortress 2 |first=Owen |last=Good |publisher=Kotaku |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref> Also, when a person buys the game and starts up Team Fortress 2, they will get a frying pan as a melee weapon and Ellis' hat as an in-game hat.

At a local competition felicitation, the local minister, Shriram Singh, proud of him, promises for help whenever needed.\n\nAnand frequently goes to Banaras Hindu University's library to solve a foreign Math journal. One day, the manager finally catches him, and says that he has no right to read there. One staff member suggests him to get his article published in this journal and earn a free lifetime subscription to it. Anand goes to the post-office, where his father Rajendra works as the head, and posts a letter regarding the solution to a difficult Math problem that no one has been able to solve yet. He then gets featured in the journal for solving the problem, and gets a letter from Professor Richard of the [[University of Cambridge]] to join a program there. But Anand needs money to travel. He and Rajendra go to Shriram but he denies any promise. They both further try to collect money but remain helpless, and get depressed. One day, Rajendra dies of a heart attack. Anand refuses to go to Cambridge due to his father's death and financial condition.\n\nHe then sells [[Papadum|papads]] in the city. One day, he meets Lallan Singh, an assistant of the local minister. Lallan takes Anand as a teacher in his coaching centre, Excellence Coaching Centre. There, Anand sees the plight of a boy who had to leave due to poverty. He thinks that these poor kids also have a right to study. Hence, he leaves Excellence and starts a separate tuition for poor kids, in which he enrolls 30 kids at a time. He teaches them to learn everything practically and have the concepts cleared in an easy and fun way. All this enrages Lallan, whose centre is facing criticism for not retaining Anand.\n\nIn course of the tuition, Anand gets immense help from his brother Pranav and his mother. Lallan and Shriram plan to have Anand killed so that his kids won't be entering [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]]. Anand is hurt brutally by two of Lallan's henchmen, and is hospitalised, on the verge of death.

At a local competition felicitation, the local minister, Shriram Singh, proud of him, promises for help whenever needed.\n\nAnand frequently goes to Banaras Hindu University's library to solve a foreign Math journal. One day, the manager finally catches him, and says that he has no right to read there. One staff member suggests him to get his article published in this journal and earn a free lifetime subscription to it. Anand goes to the post-office, where his father Rajendra works as the head, and posts a letter regarding the solution to a difficult Math problem that no one has been able to solve yet. He then gets featured in the journal for solving the problem, and gets a letter from Professor Richard of the [[University of Cambridge]] to join a program there. But Anand needs money to travel. He and Rajendra go to Shriram but he denies any promise. They both further try to collect money but remain helpless, and get depressed. One day, Rajendra dies of a heart attack. Anand refuses to go to Cambridge due to his father's death and financial condition.\n\nHe then sells [[Papadum|papads]] in the city. One day, he meets Lallan Singh, an assistant of the local minister. Lallan takes Anand as a teacher in his coaching centre, Excellence Coaching Centre. There, Anand sees the plight of a boy who had to leave due to poverty. He thinks that these poor kids also have a right to study. Hence, he leaves Excellence and starts a separate tuition for poor kids, in which he enrolls 30 kids at a time. He teaches them to learn everything practically and have the concepts cleared in an easy and fun way. All this enrages Lallan, whose centre is facing criticism for not retaining Anand.\n\nIn course of the tuition, Anand gets immense help from his brother Pranav and his mother. Lallan and Shriram plan to have Anand killed so that his kids won't be entering [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]]. Anand is hurt brutally by two of Lallan's henchmen, and is hospitalised, on the verge of death. He tells his students to then use their knowledge to defeat the goons sent by Shriram, while he is being treated. The students, in unity, use their knowledge and defeat the goons and Anand is treated successfully. The students take the IIT exam and all 30 students pass successfully.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as [[Anand Kumar]], a [[Mathematician|mathematician]] who opens a program named Super 30 where he teaches 30 students for [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]] in free cost.\n* [[Mrunal Thakur]] as Supriya, Anand's love interest.\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Rajendra Kumar,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mid-day.com/articles/on-sets-hrithik-roshan-loses-weight-for-his-role-in-super-30/19433190|title=On sets: Hrithik Roshan loses weight for his role in Super 30|date=2018-05-18|work=mid-day|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en}}</ref> Anand's father who dies after suffering from a heart attack.\n* [[Nandish Sandhu|Nandish Singh]] as Pranav Kumar,<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet Nandish Singh, who plays Hrithik Roshan's brother in 'Super 30'|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-meet-nandish-singh-who-plays-hrithik-roshan-s-brother-in-super-30-2589947|website=dnaindia.com|date=2 March 2018|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref> Anand's brother.\n* [[Aditya Shrivastava]] as Lallan Singh, Shri Ram's assistant.\n* [[Sadhana Singh]] as Jayanti Kumar, Anand's mother.\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Shri Ram Singh,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-pankaj-tripathi-to-play-hrithik-roshan-aka-anand-kumar-s-arch-rival-in-super-30-2625091|title=Pankaj Tripathi to play Hrithik Roshan aka Anand Kumar's arch-rival in Super 30|date=2018-06-13|work=dna|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US}}</ref> a local minister.\n*[[Vijay Varma]] as Fugga Kumar\n* [[Amit Sadh]] as Raghunath<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/amit-sadh-is-super-30s-sutradhar/articleshow/64753466.cms|title=Amit Sadh is the narrator for Hrithik Roshan-starrer Super 30|work=Mumbai Mirror|access-date=2018-08-09}}</ref>\n*Sharat Sonu as Haadim Malik, Shriram's secretary.\n*[[Manav Gohil]] as Purushottam\n*Aayush Kumar Shukla as Vinod\n*[[Rahul Raj]] as Kishore\n*Deepali Gautam as Kusum\n*[[Ali Haji (actor)|Ali Haji]] as Prithvi\n*[[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as Bachchi\n*[[Karishma Sharma]] in [[item number]] \"Paisa\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.desimartini.com/news/martini-shots/breakdowns/super-30s-paisa-song-hrithik-roshan-shows-the-power-money-can-give-article112078.htm|title=Super 30\u2019s Paisa Song: Hrithik Roshan Shows The Power Money Can Give!|date=21 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/super-30-new-song-paisa-hrithik-roshan-as-anand-kumar-shows-importance-of-money-1553307-2019-06-21|title=Super 30 new song Paisa: Hrithik Roshan as Anand Kumar shows importance of money|date=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[Mrunal Thakur]] was cast opposite Hrithik Roshan in the film.

He is also known to South African audiences for his 2004-2006 appearance as \"Mad Dog\" on the long-running soap opera ''[[Isidingo]]'', for his portrayal as [[Joel Joffe]] in the large-scale and well-received 2010 and 2011 stage productions of ''Rivonia Trial'', and for his role as radio station manager Hermanus Meyer on the soap opera ''[[Rhythm City (TV series)|Rhythm City]]''.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nJames grew up in [[Paarl]], Western Cape, South Africa, on a wine farm.<ref name=\"DJames\">{{Citation  | last = Fitzpatrick  | first = Marida  | title = Knoppie om af te sit werk toe nie  | newspaper = Beeld  | date = 2009-09-12  | url = http://www.beeld.com/In-Diepte/Nuus/Knoppie-om-af-te-sit-werk-toe-nie-20090912 }}</ref> His family were conservatives and [[separatist]]s, his father a [[Dutch Reformed]] man, whereas James was liberal.<ref name=\"video\">{{Cite web  | title = Moral Fibre Interviews Cast of District 9  | publisher = Moral Fibre  | year = 2009  | url = http://zoopy.com/q/1fl4  }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  He and his family also clashed early on regarding his choice of careers.  As a young man, James struck a bargain with his family that if he were to receive his [[Sporting colours|WP-colours]] in sports, he could then pursue his choice of studies.  After accomplishing this and after his tour of duty in the military, he chose to study acting.\n\nFrom 1995-2001, James studied acting, singing, dancing, and the flute.  One of his instructors was the famous [[Joan Brickhill]], a \"grand dame\" of South African theatre and a [[Tony Award]]-nominated choreographer, under whom James studied from 1997 through 2001.  During this time he also worked selling cars, washing cars, cleaning pools, and even caring for the elderly.<ref name=\"DJames\"/><ref name=\"Contractors Artists Johannesburg\">{{Citation  | title = Contractors Artists Johannesburg  | url = http://www.contractors.org.za/}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n===Early work===\n\nOn stage he has costarred in productions of ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (2002), ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (2005) and ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (2006), and others, as well as in the locally written and well-reviewed 2007 ''Fangs'', a comedic telling of a Johannesburg vampire that loses his fangs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Fangs Bites Back | publisher = Joburg News | date = 21 August 2006 | url = http://www.joburgnews.co.za/2006/aug/aug21_fangs.stm}}</ref> He also costarred in ''Everybody Else (is Fucking Perfect)'', a 2007 comedy about a married couple forced to face the husband's sexuality and infidelity.<ref>{{cite web | title = David Krut Publishing | url = http://www.davidkrutpublishing.com/16454/everybody-else-is-fucking-perfect-playscript-series-no-2 | access-date = 22 July 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063011/http://www.davidkrutpublishing.com/16454/everybody-else-is-fucking-perfect-playscript-series-no-2 | archive-date = 4 March 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nJames has appeared in numerous commercials and corporate promotional materials, including ads and promotions for [[Toys 'R Us]], [[Ford]], [[Compaq]], and Cipler Insurance.\n\nHe has also guest-starred in many South African television series and [[Soap opera|soaps]], including roles in ''Criminal Minds'' (2000), ''Snitch'' (2004), ''Jozi Street'' (2004), and the long-running ''[[Isidingo]]'', where from 2004-2006 he portrayed a hired [[assassin]] called Mad Dog.<ref name=\"Contractors Artists Johannesburg\" />\n\n=== ''District 9'' ===\n{{Quote box\n |bgcolor = lightblue\n |font = \n |quote = ''\"I think Neill [Blomkamp] liked the psychopathic edge I gave to Koobus in my audition.

Since ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films were released, it was a personal dream of his to work on a [[Peter Jackson]] film; he would jokingly say to his agent after every meeting, \"Tell [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] I can't work for him since I'm working for Peter Jackson now.\"  He went to his auditions and callbacks without knowing the details of the film.  After getting the role, when his agent said that it was a Peter Jackson-produced film, he thought she was joking as well.<ref>{{Cite web  | title = On Screen Interviews Cast of District 9  | publisher = On Screen  | year = 2009  | url = http://zoopy.com/q/1ex2  }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the role, James took a course of [[steroids]] to put on 10&nbsp;kg (approx. 22&nbsp;lbs) of muscle.

It is widely believed that Biko died at the hands of Hattingh during police interrogations in 1977.
