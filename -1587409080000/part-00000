It is mainly written by [[Henry Eeles Dresser]], although [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]] co-authored the earlier volumes. It describes all the bird species reliably recorded in the wild in Europe and adjacent geographical areas with similar [[fauna]], giving their worldwide distribution, [[anatomical variation|variations in appearance]] and [[bird migration|migratory movements]].\n\nThe pioneering ornithological work of [[John Ray]] and [[Francis Willughby]] in the seventeenth century had introduced an effective [[classification]] system based on [[anatomy|anatomical]] features, and a [[single-access key|dichotomous key]] to help readers identify birds. This was followed by other English-language ornithologies, notably [[John Gould]]'s five-volume ''Birds of Europe'' published between 1832 and 1837. Sharpe, then librarian of the [[Zoological Society of London]], had worked closely with Gould and wanted to expand on his work by including all species reliably recorded in Europe, North Africa, parts of the Middle East and the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]], the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. He lacked the resources to undertake this task on his own, so he proposed to Dresser that they work together on this encyclopaedia, using Dresser's extensive collection of birds and their eggs and network of contacts.\n\nThe ''Birds of Europe'' was published as 84 [[quarto]] parts, each typically containing 56 pages of text and eight plates of illustrations, the latter mainly by the Dutch artist [[John Gerrard Keulemans]], and bound into volumes when all the parts were published. 339 copies were made, at a cost to each subscriber of \u00a352 10s. Sharpe did not contribute after part 13, and was not listed as an author after part 17. ''Birds of Europe'' was well received by its contemporary reviewers, although a commentator in 2018 considered that Dresser's outdated views and the cost of his books meant that in the long run his works had limited influence. The ''Birds of Europe'' continued a tradition dating from the seventeenth century whereby the study and classification of specimens by \"museum men\" operated largely independently of those field observers who studied [[ethology|behaviour]] and [[ecology]], a rift that continued until the 1920s, when the German naturalist [[Erwin Stresemann]] integrated the two strands as part of modern [[zoology]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Francis Willughby by Soest.png|thumb|upright|[[Francis Willughby]] by [[Gerard Soest]]|alt=long-haired man in seventeenth-century clothes]]\nEarly ornithologies, such as those of [[Conrad Gessner]], [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] and [[Pierre Belon]], relied for much of their content on the authority of [[Aristotle]] and the teachings of the [[Christian Church|church]],<ref name= birkheadwis18>Birkhead (2011) pp. 18\u201322.</ref><ref name= birkhead11>Birkhead (2018) pp. 11\u201312.</ref> and included much extraneous material relating to the species, such as [[proverb]]s, references in history and literature, or its use as an [[emblem]].<ref name=kusukawa306>Kusukawa (2016) p. 306.</ref> The arrangement of the species was by alphabetical order in Gessner's ''[[Historia animalium (Gessner)|Historia animalium]]'', and by arbitrary criteria in most other early works.<ref name= birkheadwis18/> In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, [[Francis Bacon]] had advocated the advancement of knowledge through observation and experiment,<ref name= birkhead11/> and the English [[Royal Society]] and its members such as [[John Ray]], [[John Wilkins]] and [[Francis Willughby]] sought to put the [[Empirical research|empirical method]] into practice,<ref name= birkhead34>Birkhead (2018) pp. 34\u201338.</ref> including travelling widely to collect specimens and information.<ref name= birkhead47>Birkhead (2018) pp. 47\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe first modern ornithology, intended to describe all the then-known birds worldwide,<ref name= birkhead218>Birkhead (2018) p. 218.</ref> was produced by Ray and Willughby and published in [[Latin]] as ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'' (''Three Books of Ornithology'') in 1676,<ref name= birkhead225>Birkhead (2018) p. 225.</ref> and in English, as ''The Ornithology of Francis Willughby of Middleton'', in 1678.<ref name= birkhead236>Birkhead (2018) p. 236.</ref> Its innovative features were an effective [[classification]] system based on [[anatomy|anatomical]] features, including the bird's beak, feet and overall size, and a [[single-access key|dichotomous key]], which helped readers to identify birds by guiding them to the page describing that group.<ref name= birkhead219>Birkhead (2018) pp. 219\u2013221.</ref> The authors also placed an asterisk against species of which they had no first-hand knowledge, and were therefore unable to verify.<ref name= birkhead292>Birkhead ''et al'' (2016) p. 292.</ref> The commercial success of the ''Ornithology'' is unknown, but it was historically significant,<ref name= birkhead239>Birkhead (2018) p. 239.</ref> influencing writers including [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur|Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9amur]], [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson]], [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Carl Linnaeus]] in compiling their own works.<ref name=charm377>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) pp. 377\u2013380.</ref><ref name=Johanson>Johanson ''et al'' (2016) p. 139.</ref>\n\nDuring the early nineteenth century, a number of ornithologies were written in English,<ref name= davison>{{cite journal | last1 = Davison | first1 =G W H|year =2013| title = Dresser, Seebohm, and the Scope of Palaearctic Ornithology | journal = The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology | volume = Supplement No. 29 | issue = | pages = 259\u2013268| url = https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/s29rbz259-268.pdf | jstor = | doi =}}</ref> including [[John Gould]]'s five-volume ''Birds of Europe'', which was published between 1832 and 1837.<ref name=dress97>McGhie (2017) pp. 97\u2013100.</ref> [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]], then librarian of the [[Zoological Society of London]], had worked closely with Gould and completed some of his books that were still unfinished when he died.<ref name=ODNBsh>{{Cite ODNB |id=36042|title= Sharpe, Richard Bowdler }}</ref> He wished to build on Gould's work to include all species reliably recorded in the wild in Europe, expand the geographical range to include North Africa, parts of the [[Middle East]] and the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]], the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]] (this extended area constitutes the [[Western Palaearctic]] [[ecozone]]) and to describe the worldwide distribution, [[anatomical variation|variation]] and [[bird migration|movements]] of each of the species.

The first part released therefore included birds as diverse as the [[Eurasian teal]], [[red-footed falcon]], [[marsh sandpiper]] and [[woodchat shrike]]. Articles for each species included alternative [[binomial nomenclature|binomial names]], a detailed description of both sexes and the juveniles, the bird's range, habitat and habits, and the specimens that had been examined during the preparation of the text.<ref name =dress143>McGhie (2017) p. 143.</ref>\n\nThe [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] used by Dresser was based on a scheme created by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and developed by [[Philip Sclater]] which used a hierarchical classification using [[order (biology)|orders]] and families rather than the arbitrary division into bird groups used by earlier writers. His book started with the [[passerine]]s, rather than the traditional birds of prey.<ref name=intro>Dresser (1871\u20131896) pp. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/37117415#page/35/mode/1up xix\u2013xxi].</ref>\n\nWhen choosing binomial names for his species, Dresser kept strictly to chronological priority. Since the first mention might be in an obscure or foreign language journal, this led to changes in the established Latin names of some species, \"causing great consternation among his colleagues\".<ref name =dress143/> The situation was made worse in that many early descriptions were so vague that it was impossible to be sure of the species.<ref name=ohl >Ohl (2018) p. 60.</ref> Dresser introduced five new names. ''Parus grisescens'' ([[Siberian tit]]), ''Calandrella baetica'' ([[lesser short-toed lark]]), ''Serinus canonicus'' ([[Syrian serin]]) and ''Anthus seebohmi'' ([[Pechora pipit]]) are now considered to be junior [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s for the species, and ''Otocorys brandti'' is now ''Eremophila alpestris brandti'', a subspecies of the [[horned lark]].<ref name=McGhie2011>McGhie (2011) pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\nDresser and Sharp initially co-authored the articles, both struggling to keep up to schedule since they were also working full-time. Sharpe resigned as librarian of the Zoological Society late in 1871 to give himself more opportunity to write, but then accepted a post as bird curator at the [[British Museum]] in May 1872. His contract meant that he was not allowed to have a personal collection, so he sold his skins of African birds to the Museum. Relations between the two authors soon became strained, Sharpe considering that his colleague was too interested in the commercial aspects of the project, rather than the science, and their partnership was dissolved in December 1872. Sharpe did not contribute after part 13, and was not listed as an author after part 17.<ref name =dress140>McGhie (2017) pp. 140\u2013142.</ref>\n\nA supplement to the ''Birds of Europe'' was published in nine parts in 1895 and 1896, giving a final count of more than 5,100 pages and 723 plates.<ref name=davison/> The ''Supplement'' covered 114 further species, including 14 discovered since the earlier publication, 22 rare vagrants to Europe and 26 that had been elevated to full species status in the interim. Dresser had also extended the area covered  beyond Europe and the Middle East to include neighbouring Persia and western Central Asia, which added many birds from that region.<ref name =dress186>McGhie (2017) p. 186.</ref>\n\n=== Illustrations ===\n\n[[File:Glossy Ibis by John Gerrard Keulemann in Dresser's Birds of Europe.jpg|thumb|[[Glossy ibis]] by Keulemans from volume 6, plate 409|alt=glossy brown wading bird with long bill]]\nThe principal illustrator was the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans, who had previously illustrated Sharpe's study of [[kingfisher]]s, ''A Monograph of the Alcdinidae''. Keulemans mostly worked from skins rather than life, but attempted to depict the birds realistically. Artists normally painted a picture and then copied it onto a fine [[lithographic limestone|limestone]] slab using a special waxy crayon. The slab was then wetted before adding an oil-based ink, which would only be held by the greasy crayon lines, and copies were printed from the slab. This process was known as [[lithography]].<ref name=dress139/>\n\nTo reduce costs, Keulemans drew directly on to the limestone instead of first making a painting.<ref name=dress139/> Although this was more technically difficult, drawing directly could give a livelier feel to the final illustration, and was also favoured by other contemporary bird artists such as [[Edward Lear]].<ref name=uglow17>Uglow (2017) p. 17.</ref> The printed plates were hand-coloured, mainly by young women.<ref name=dress139/>\n\nKeulemans was also working on other projects, so Dresser had to commission Edward Neale and [[Joseph Wolfe]] to draw 28 and 15 plates respectively. Each of the 339 copies produced contained 633 plates, so nearly 215,000 plates were individually coloured.<ref name=dress146>McGhie (2017) pp. 146\u2013147.</ref> In addition to the colour plates, there were also monochrome engravings to illustrate interesting features, one example being a drawing of a skull of a [[Boreal owl|Tengmalm's owl]] to show its asymmetry.{{efn|Most owls, unlike other birds, have ear openings that are asymmetric in shape or position to help them locate the source of a sound at night.

It is mainly written by [[Henry Eeles Dresser]], although [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]] co-authored the earlier volumes. It describes all the bird species reliably recorded in the wild in Europe and adjacent geographical areas with similar [[fauna]], giving their worldwide distribution, [[anatomical variation|variations in appearance]] and [[bird migration|migratory movements]].\n\nThe pioneering ornithological work of [[John Ray]] and [[Francis Willughby]] in the seventeenth century had introduced an effective [[classification]] system based on [[anatomy|anatomical]] features, and a [[single-access key|dichotomous key]] to help readers identify birds. This was followed by other English-language ornithologies, notably [[John Gould]]'s five-volume ''Birds of Europe'' published between 1832 and 1837. Sharpe, then librarian of the [[Zoological Society of London]], had worked closely with Gould and wanted to expand on his work by including all species reliably recorded in Europe, North Africa, parts of the Middle East and the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]], the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. He lacked the resources to undertake this task on his own, so he proposed to Dresser that they work together on this encyclopaedia, using Dresser's extensive collection of birds and their eggs and network of contacts.\n\nThe ''Birds of Europe'' was published as 84 [[quarto]] parts, each typically containing 56 pages of text and eight plates of illustrations, the latter mainly by the Dutch artist [[John Gerrard Keulemans]], and bound into volumes when all the parts were published. 339 copies were made, at a cost to each subscriber of \u00a352 10s. Sharpe did not contribute after part 13, and was not listed as an author after part 17. ''Birds of Europe'' was well received by its contemporary reviewers, although a commentator in 2018 considered that Dresser's outdated views and the cost of his books meant that in the long run his works had limited influence. The ''Birds of Europe'' continued a tradition dating from the seventeenth century whereby the study and classification of specimens by \"museum men\" operated largely independently of those field observers who studied [[ethology|behaviour]] and [[ecology]], a rift that continued until the 1920s, when the German naturalist [[Erwin Stresemann]] integrated the two strands as part of modern [[zoology]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Francis Willughby by Soest.png|thumb|upright|[[Francis Willughby]] by [[Gerard Soest]]|alt=long-haired man in seventeenth-century clothes]]\nEarly ornithologies, such as those of [[Conrad Gessner]], [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] and [[Pierre Belon]], relied for much of their content on the authority of [[Aristotle]] and the teachings of the [[Christian Church|church]],<ref name= birkheadwis18> Birkhead (2011) pp. 18\u201322.</ref><ref name= birkhead11> Birkhead (2018) pp. 11\u201312.</ref> and included much extraneous material relating to the species, such as [[proverb]]s, references in history and literature, or its use as an [[emblem]].<ref name=kusukawa306> Kusukawa (2016) p. 306.</ref> The arrangement of the species was by alphabetical order in Gessner's ''[[Historia animalium (Gessner)|Historia animalium]]'', and by arbitrary criteria in most other early works.<ref name= birkheadwis18/> In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, [[Francis Bacon]] had advocated the advancement of knowledge through observation and experiment,<ref name= birkhead11/> and the English [[Royal Society]] and its members such as [[John Ray]], [[John Wilkins]] and [[Francis Willughby]] sought to put the [[Empirical research|empirical method]] into practice,<ref name= birkhead34>Birkhead (2018) pp. 34\u201338.</ref> including travelling widely to collect specimens and information.<ref name= birkhead47>Birkhead (2018) pp. 47\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe first modern ornithology, intended to describe all the then-known birds worldwide,<ref name= birkhead218>Birkhead (2018) p. 218.</ref> was produced by Ray and Willughby and published in [[Latin]] as ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'' (''Three Books of Ornithology'') in 1676,<ref name= birkhead225>Birkhead (2018) p. 225.</ref> and in English, as ''The Ornithology of Francis Willughby of Middleton'', in 1678.<ref name= birkhead236>Birkhead (2018) p. 236.</ref> Its innovative features were an effective [[classification]] system based on [[anatomy|anatomical]] features, including the bird's beak, feet and overall size, and a [[single-access key|dichotomous key]], which helped readers to identify birds by guiding them to the page describing that group.<ref name= birkhead219>Birkhead (2018) pp. 219\u2013221.</ref> The authors also placed an asterisk against species of which they had no first-hand knowledge, and were therefore unable to verify.<ref name= birkhead292>Birkhead ''et al'' (2016) p. 292.</ref> The commercial success of the ''Ornithology'' is unknown, but it was historically significant,<ref name= birkhead239>Birkhead (2018) p. 239.</ref> influencing writers including [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur|Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9amur]], [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson]], [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Carl Linnaeus]] in compiling their own works.<ref name=charm377>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) pp. 377\u2013380.</ref><ref name=Johanson>Johanson ''et al'' (2016) p. 139.</ref>\n\nDuring the early nineteenth century, a number of ornithologies were written in English,<ref name= davison>{{cite journal | last1 = Davison | first1 =G W H|year =2013| title = Dresser, Seebohm, and the Scope of Palaearctic Ornithology | journal = The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology | volume = Supplement No. 29 | issue = | pages = 259\u2013268| url = https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/s29rbz259-268.pdf | jstor = | doi =}}</ref> including [[John Gould]]'s five-volume ''Birds of Europe'', which was published between 1832 and 1837.<ref name=dress97> McGhie (2017) pp. 97\u2013100.</ref> [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]], then librarian of the [[Zoological Society of London]], had worked closely with Gould and completed some of his books that were still unfinished when he died.<ref name=ODNBsh>{{Cite ODNB |id=36042|title= Sharpe, Richard Bowdler }}</ref> He wished to build on Gould's work to include all species reliably recorded in the wild in Europe, expand the geographical range to include North Africa, parts of the [[Middle East]] and the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]], the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]] (this extended area constitutes the [[Western Palaearctic]] [[ecozone]]) and to describe the worldwide distribution, [[anatomical variation|variation]] and [[bird migration|movements]] of each of the species. He lacked the resources to undertake this task on his own, so he proposed to businessman and amateur ornithologist [[Henry Eeles Dresser]] that they work together on this great encyclopaedia.

The first part released therefore included birds as diverse as the [[Eurasian teal]], [[red-footed falcon]], [[marsh sandpiper]] and [[woodchat shrike]]. Articles for each species included alternative [[binomial nomenclature|binomial names]], a detailed description of both sexes and the juveniles, the bird's range, habitat and habits, and the specimens that had been examined during the preparation of the text.<ref name =dress143>McGhie (2017) p. 143. </ref>\n\nThe [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] used by Dresser was based on a scheme created by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and developed by [[Philip Sclater]] which used a hierarchical classification using [[order (biology)|orders]] and families rather than the arbitrary division into bird groups used by earlier writers. His book started with the [[passerine]]s, rather than the traditional birds of prey.<ref name=intro> Dresser (1871\u20131896) pp. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/37117415#page/35/mode/1up xix\u2013xxi]. </ref>\n\nWhen choosing binomial names for his species, Dresser kept strictly to chronological priority. Since the first mention might be in an obscure or foreign language journal, this led to changes in the established Latin names of some species, \"causing great consternation among his colleagues\".<ref name =dress143/> The situation was made worse in that many early descriptions were so vague that it was impossible to be sure of the species.<ref name=ohl > Ohl (2018) p. 60. </ref> Dresser introduced five new names. ''Parus grisescens'' ([[Siberian tit]]), ''Calandrella baetica'' ([[lesser short-toed lark]]), ''Serinus canonicus'' ([[Syrian serin]]) and ''Anthus seebohmi'' ([[Pechora pipit]]) are now considered to be junior [[synonym]]s for the species, and ''Otocorys brandti'' is now ''Eremophila alpestris brandti'', a subspecies of the [[horned lark]].<ref name=McGhie2011> McGhie (2011) pp. 88\u201389. </ref>\n\nDresser and Sharp initially co-authored the articles, both struggling to keep up to schedule since they were also working full-time. Sharpe resigned as librarian of the Zoological Society late in 1871 to give himself more opportunity to write, but then accepted a post as bird curator at the [[British Museum]] in May 1872. His contract meant that he was not allowed to have a personal collection, so he sold his skins of African birds to the Museum. Relations between the two authors soon became strained, Sharpe considering that his colleague was too interested in the commercial aspects of the project, rather than the science, and their partnership was dissolved in December 1872. Sharpe did not contribute after part 13, and was not listed as an author after part 17.<ref name =dress140>McGhie (2017) pp. 140\u2013142. </ref>\n\nA supplement to the ''Birds of Europe'' was published in nine parts in 1895 and 1896, giving a final count of more than 5,100 pages and 723 plates.<ref name=davison/> The ''Supplement'' covered 114 further species, including 14 discovered since the earlier publication, 22 rare vagrants to Europe and 26 that had been elevated to full species status in the interim. Dresser had also extended the area covered  beyond Europe and the Middle East to include neighbouring Persia and western Central Asia, which added many birds from that region.<ref name =dress186>McGhie (2017) p. 186. </ref>\n\n=== Illustrations ===\n\n[[File:Glossy Ibis by John Gerrard Keulemann in Dresser's Birds of Europe.jpg|thumb|[[Glossy ibis]] by Keulemans from volume 6, plate 409|alt=glossy brown wading bird with long bill]]\nThe principal illustrator was the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans, who had previously illustrated Sharpe's study of [[kingfisher]]s, ''A Monograph of the Alcdinidae''. Keulemans mostly worked from skins rather than life, but attempted to depict the birds realistically. Artists normally painted a picture and then copied it onto a fine [[lithographic limestone|limestone]] slab using a special waxy crayon. The slab was then wetted before adding an oil-based ink, which would only be held by the greasy crayon lines, and copies were printed from the slab. This process was known as [[lithography]].<ref name=dress139/>\n\nTo reduce costs, Keulemans drew directly on to the limestone instead of first making a painting.<ref name=dress139/> Although this was more technically difficult, drawing directly could give a livelier feel to the final illustration, and was also favoured by other contemporary bird artists such as [[Edward Lear]].<ref name=uglow17>Uglow (2017) p. 17.</ref> The printed plates were hand-coloured, mainly by young women.<ref name=dress139/> \n\nKeulemans was also working on other projects, so Dresser had to commission Edward Neale and [[Joseph Wolfe]] to draw 28 and 15 plates respectively. Each of the 339 copies produced contained 633 plates, so nearly 215,000 plates were individually coloured.<ref name=dress146>McGhie (2017) pp. 146\u2013147.</ref> In addition to the colour plates, there were also monochrome engravings to illustrate interesting features, one example being a drawing of a skull of a [[Boreal owl|Tengmalm's owl]] to show its asymmetry.{{efn|Most owls, unlike other birds, have ear openings that are asymmetric in shape or position to help them locate the source of a sound at night.

He wrote several other ornithological works, namely ''A Monograph of the Meropidae, or Family of the Bee-eaters'' (1884\u20131886), ''A Monograph of the Coraciidae, or Family of the Rollers'' (1893), the two-volume ''A Manual of Palaearctic Birds'' (1902\u20131903) and the two-volume ''Eggs of the Birds of Europe'' (1910), which was issued in 24 parts beginning in 1905.<ref name=dress293>McGhie (2017) pp. 293\u2013296.</ref> \n\nHe had started on the [[bee-eater]] monograph in 1882, using his own collection of 200 skins of these birds as one of his sources, and by 1883 he was also working on the [[Coraciidae|rollers]], adding ''Birds of Europe'' to his workload in the following year.<ref name=dress173>McGhie (2017) p. 173.</ref> The 1881 ''A List of European Birds, including all species found in the western palaearctic region'' was based on the ''History of the Birds of Europe'', and may have been a response to criticism from Sclater that the earlier publication was too large.<ref name=dress146/>\n\nThe ''Manual of Palaearctic Birds'' was largely traditional in its taxonomy, as with its predecessor, but in his treatment of [[dipper]]s he showed a partial acceptance that subspecies could share a [[common ancestor]], as proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] in ''[[The Origin of Species]]''.<ref name=dress207>McGhie (2017) pp. 207\u2013208.</ref> In ''The Eggs of the Birds of Europe'', Dresser used a then-new photographic technique, the [[Color photography#Three-color processes|three-colour process]], to illustrate the subtleties of bird egg markings with [[Color photography|colour photographs]] rather than paintings.<ref name=dress210>McGhie (2017) p. 210.</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n=== Cited texts ===\n\n* {{cite book | last1 = Birkhead | first1 = Tim | title = The Wisdom of Birds: An Illustrated History of Ornithology | publisher= Bloomsbury | year = 2011| location = London | url = | isbn = 978-0-7475-9822-0}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Birkhead | first1 = Tim| title = The Wonderful Mr Willughby: The First True Ornithologist | publisher = Bloomsbury | year = 2018 | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4088-7848-4 }}\n* {{cite book | last1= Birkhead | first1= Tim | last2= Smith | first2= Paul J.| last3= Doherty | first3= Meghan | last4= Charmantier | first4= Isabelle | year=2016 | chapter= Willughby\u2019s Ornithology | editor-last=Birkhead | editor-first=Tim | title=Virtuoso by Nature: The Scientific Worlds of Francis Willughby FRS (1635\u20131672) | location=Leiden | publisher=Brill | isbn=978-90-04-28531-6 | pages=268\u2013304 }}\n* {{cite book | last1=Charmantier | first1= Isabelle| last2= Johnston| first2= Dorothy |last3=Smith | first3=Paul J | year=2016 | chapter=The legacies of Francis Willughby| editor-last=Birkhead | editor-first=Tim | title=Virtuoso by Nature: The Scientific Worlds of Francis Willughby FRS (1635\u20131672) | location=Leiden | publisher=Brill | isbn=978-90-04-28531-6 | pages=360\u2013385 }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Dresser | first1 = Henry Eeles | editor= | title = A History of the Birds of Europe : including all the Species inhabiting the Western Palaearctic region | volume=1| publisher= self-published| year =1871\u20131896 | location = London | url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/114184#page/7/mode/1up  }} \n* {{cite book | last1 = Johanson | first1 = Zerina |last2 = Barrett |first2= Paul M | last3 = Richter| first3= Martha |last4= Smith |first4= Mike | title = Arthur Smith Woodward: His Life and Influence on Modern Vertebrate Palaeontology| publisher= Geological Society of London | year = 2016| location =London | url = |volume =430|series= Geological Society of London, Special Publications | isbn = 978-1-86239-741-5}}\n* {{cite book | last= Kusukawa | first=Sachiko | year=2016 | chapter= ''Historia Piscium'' (1686) and its sources | editor-last=Birkhead | editor-first=Tim | title=Virtuoso by Nature: The Scientific Worlds of Francis Willughby FRS (1635-1672) | location=Leiden | publisher=Brill | isbn=978-90-04-28531-6 | pages=305\u2013334}}\n*{{ cite book | last1=McGhie | first=Henry A. | chapter=Dresser, H.E.
