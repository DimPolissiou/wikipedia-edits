In [[mammal]]s and most other [[vertebrate]]s, two lungs are located near the [[vertebral column|backbone]] on either side of the [[heart]]. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract [[oxygen]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and transfer it into the [[bloodstream]], and to release [[carbon dioxide]] from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of [[gas exchange]]. [[Respiration (physiology)|Respiration]] is driven by different [[muscle|muscular systems]] in different species. Mammals, [[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s use their different [[muscle]]s to support and foster [[breathing]]. In early [[tetrapod]]s, air was driven into the lungs by the [[pharyngeal muscles]] via [[buccal pumping]], a mechanism still seen in [[amphibian]]s. In humans, the main [[muscles of respiration|muscle of respiration]] that drives breathing is the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human [[speech]] possible.\n\nHumans have two lungs, a right lung, and a left lung. They are situated within the [[thoracic cavity]] of the [[chest]]. The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the [[heart]]. The lungs together weigh approximately {{convert|1.3|kg|lbs}}, and the right is heavier. The lungs are part of the [[lower respiratory tract]] that begins at the [[trachea]] and branches into the [[bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s, and which receive [[air]] [[inhalation|breathed in]] via the [[Respiratory tract#Structure|conducting zone]]. The conducting zone ends at the [[Bronchiole#Terminal bronchioles|terminal bronchioles]]. These divide into the [[Bronchiole#Respiratory bronchioles|respiratory bronchioles]] of the [[Respiratory tract#Structure|respiratory zone]] which divide into [[alveolar duct]]s that give rise to the [[alveolar sac]]s that contain the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], where gas exchange takes place. Alveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts. Together, the lungs contain approximately {{convert|2400|km|mi}} of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a [[pleural sac]] that contains pleural fluid, which allows the [[pulmonary pleurae|inner and outer walls]] to slide over each other whilst [[breathing]] takes place, without much friction. This sac also divides each lung into sections called [[lobe (anatomy)|lobes]]. The right lung has three lobes and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into  [[bronchopulmonary segment]]s and  [[Lung#Microanatomy|pulmonary lobules]]. The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the [[pulmonary circulation]] for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the [[bronchial circulation]].\n\nThe [[Parenchyma#Lung parenchyma|tissue of the lungs]] can be affected by a number of [[respiratory disease]]s, including [[pneumonia]] and [[lung cancer]]. [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] includes [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]] and [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], and can be related to [[smoking]] or exposure to [[Toxicity|harmful substances]].  A number of [[occupational lung disease]]s can be caused by substances such as [[coal dust]], [[Asbestos|asbestos fibres]], and [[crystal]]line [[silicon dioxide|silica]] dust. Diseases such as [[bronchitis]] can also affect the [[respiratory tract]]. Medical terms related to the lung often begin with ''pulmo-'', from the [[Latin]] ''pulmonarius'' (of the lungs) as in [[pulmonology]], or with ''pneumo-'' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \"lung\") as in [[pneumonia]].\n\nIn [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]], the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the [[foregut]], a tube which goes on to form the upper part of the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]]. When the lungs are formed the [[fetus]] is held in the [[amniotic fluid|fluid-filled]] [[amniotic sac]] and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the [[ductus arteriosus]]. [[Adaptation to extrauterine life#Breathing and circulation|At birth]] however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.\n\n== Structure of the human lungs ==\n[[File:Meet the lungs.webm|thumb|\"Meet the lungs\" from the [[Khan Academy]]]]\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n[[File:Illu bronchi lungs.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|left]]\nThe lungs are located in the [[thoracic cavity|chest]] on either side of the [[heart]] in the [[rib cage]].

[[Vitamin A deficiency]] has been linked to changes in the epithelial lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma.

Severe nutritional deficiency in vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar walls (septa) and to notable changes in the respiratory epithelium; alterations are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the basement membrane. The extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement membrane is associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air barrier. The deficiency is associated with functional defects and disease states.

This limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with [[pulmonary function tests]] such as [[spirometry]]. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as [[dust mite]]s or [[smoking]]), with symptom control such as [[bronchodilator]]s, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through [[corticosteroid]]s) in severe cases. A common cause of chronic bronchitis, and [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], is smoking; and common causes of [[bronchiectasis]] include severe infections and [[cystic fibrosis]]. The definitive cause of [[asthma]] is not yet known.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2014 />\n\nThe breakdown of alveolar tissue, often as a result of tobacco-smoking leads to emphysema, which can become severe enough to develop into COPD. [[Elastase]] breaks down the [[elastin]] in the lung's connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. Elastase is inhibited by the [[acute-phase protein]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin]], and when there is a [[Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency|deficiency]] in this, emphysema can develop. With persistent stress from smoking, the [[airway basal cell]]s become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed to repair the epithelial barrier. The disorganised basal cells are seen to be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of [[COPD]], and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. Studies have shown that the initial development of emphysema is centred on the early changes in the airway epithelium of the small airways.<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> Basal cells become further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.<ref name=\"Crystal\">{{cite journal |last1=Crystal |first1=RG |title=Airway basal cells.

On inhalation, air travels through the trachea of a bird into the air sacs. Air then travels continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs, which are relatively fixed in size, to the air sacs at the front. From here, the air is exhaled.

These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture.

In [[mammal]]s and most other [[vertebrate]]s, two lungs are located near the [[vertebral column|backbone]] on either side of the [[heart]]. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract [[oxygen]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and transfer it into the [[bloodstream]], and to release [[carbon dioxide]] from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of [[gas exchange]]. [[Respiration (physiology)|Respiration]] is driven by different [[muscle|muscular systems]] in different species. Mammals, [[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s use their different [[muscle]]s to support and foster [[breathing]]. In early [[tetrapod]]s, air was driven into the lungs by the [[pharyngeal muscles]] via [[buccal pumping]], a mechanism still seen in [[amphibian]]s. In humans, the main [[muscles of respiration|muscle of respiration]] that drives breathing is the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human [[speech]] possible.\n\nHumans have two lungs, a right lung, and a left lung. They are situated within the [[thoracic cavity]] of the [[chest]]. The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the [[heart]]. The lungs together weigh approximately {{convert|1.3|kg|lbs}}, and the right is heavier. The lungs are part of the [[lower respiratory tract]] that begins at the [[trachea]] and branches into the [[bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s, and which receive [[air]] [[inhalation|breathed in]] via the [[Respiratory tract#Structure|conducting zone]]. The conducting zone ends at the [[Bronchiole#Terminal bronchioles|terminal bronchioles]]. These divide into the [[Bronchiole#Respiratory bronchioles|respiratory bronchioles]] of the [[Respiratory tract#Structure|respiratory zone]] which divide into [[alveolar duct]]s that give rise to the [[alveolar sac]]s that contain the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], where gas exchange takes place. Alveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts. Together, the lungs contain approximately {{convert|2400|km|mi}} of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a [[pleural sac]] that contains pleural fluid, which allows the [[pulmonary pleurae|inner and outer walls]] to slide over each other whilst [[breathing]] takes place, without much friction. This sac also divides each lung into sections called [[lobe (anatomy)|lobes]]. The right lung has three lobes and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into  [[bronchopulmonary segment]]s and  [[Lung#Microanatomy|pulmonary lobules]]. The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the [[pulmonary circulation]] for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the [[bronchial circulation]].\n\nThe [[Parenchyma#Lung parenchyma|tissue of the lungs]] can be affected by a number of [[respiratory disease]]s, including [[pneumonia]] and [[lung cancer]]. [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] includes [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]] and [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], and can be related to [[smoking]] or exposure to [[Toxicity|harmful substances]].  A number of [[occupational lung disease]]s can be caused by substances such as [[coal dust]], [[Asbestos|asbestos fibres]], and [[crystal]]line [[silicon dioxide|silica]] dust. Diseases such as [[bronchitis]] can also affect the [[respiratory tract]]. Medical terms related to the lung often begin with ''pulmo-'', from the [[Latin]] ''pulmonarius'' (of the lungs) as in [[pulmonology]], or with ''pneumo-'' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \"lung\") as in [[pneumonia]].\n\nIn [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]], the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the [[foregut]], a tube which goes on to form the upper part of the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]]. When the lungs are formed the [[fetus]] is held in the [[amniotic fluid|fluid-filled]] [[amniotic sac]] and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the [[ductus arteriosus]]. [[Adaptation to extrauterine life#Breathing and circulation|At birth]] however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.\n\n== Structure of the human lungs ==\n[[File:Meet the lungs.webm|thumb|\"Meet the lungs\" from the [[Khan Academy]]]]\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n[[File:Illu bronchi lungs.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|left]]\nThe lungs are located in the [[thoracic cavity|chest]] on either side of the [[heart]] in the [[rib cage]].

[[Vitamin A deficiency]] has been linked to changes in the epithelial lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma. This can disrupt the normal physiology of the lung and predispose to respiratory diseases. Severe nutritional deficiency in vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar walls (septa) and to notable changes in the respiratory epithelium; alterations are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the basement membrane. The extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement membrane is associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air barrier. The deficiency is associated with functional defects and disease states. Vitamin A is crucial in the development of the alveoli which continues for several years after birth.<ref name=Timoneda>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Timoneda J, Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez L, Zaragoz\u00e1 R, Mar\u00edn MP, Cabezuelo MT, Torres L, Vi\u00f1a JR, Barber T|date=2018|title=Vitamin A Deficiency and the Lung|url=|journal=Nutrients|volume=10|issue=9|at=pii: E1132|pmid=30134568 |pmc=6164133 |doi=10.3390/nu10091132}}</ref>\n\n=== After birth ===\nAt [[Childbirth|birth]], the baby's lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated.

This limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with [[pulmonary function tests]] such as [[spirometry]]. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as [[dust mite]]s or [[smoking]]), with symptom control such as [[bronchodilator]]s, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through [[corticosteroid]]s) in severe cases. A common cause of chronic bronchitis, and [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]], is smoking; and common causes of [[bronchiectasis]] include severe infections and [[cystic fibrosis]]. The definitive cause of [[asthma]] is not yet known.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2014 />\n\nThe breakdown of alveolar tissue, often as a result of tobacco-smoking leads to emphysema, which can become severe enough to develop into COPD. [[Elastase]] breaks down the [[elastin]] in the lung's connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. Elastase is inhibited by the [[acute-phase protein]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin]], and when there is a [[Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency|deficiency]] in this, emphysema can develop. With persistent stress from smoking, the [[airway basal cell]]s become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed to repair the epithelial barrier. The disorganised basal cells are seen to be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of [[COPD]], and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. Studies have shown that the initial development of emphysema is centred on the early changes in the airway epithelium of the small airways.<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> Basal cells become further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.<ref name=\"Crystal\">{{cite journal |last1=Crystal |first1=RG |title=Airway basal cells.

In some salamanders even these are lacking, and the lung has a smooth wall. In caecilians, as in snakes, only the right lung attains any size or development.<ref name=VB />\n\n=== Lungfish ===\nThe lungs of [[lungfish]] are similar to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal septa. In the [[Australian lungfish]], there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and ''[[Polypterus]]'', however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the [[esophagus]]. The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.<ref name=VB />\n\n=== Invertebrates ===\n{{further|Respiratory system of gastropods}}\n[[File:Spider internal anatomy-en.svg|thumb|Book lungs of spider (shown in pink)]]\nSome [[invertebrate]]s have lung-like structures that serve a similar respiratory purpose as, but are not evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs.

Security is often as good as or better than other traditional systems, in part because service providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many customers cannot afford to tackle or which they lack the technical skills to address.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mills |first=Elinor |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/cloud-computing-security-forecast-clear-skies/ |title=Cloud computing security forecast: Clear skies |publisher=CNET News |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2019-09-19}}</ref> However, the complexity of security is greatly increased when data is distributed over a wider area or over a greater number of devices, as well as in multi-tenant systems shared by unrelated users. In addition, user access to security [[audit log]]s may be difficult or impossible.

A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\n\n''Broad network access.'' Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, [[laptop]]s, and workstations).\n\n''[[Pooling (resource management)|Resource pooling]].'' The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.&nbsp;\n\n''Rapid elasticity.'' Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\n\n''Measured service.'' Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.|sign=National Institute of Standards and Technology<ref name=\"nist\">{{cite techreport |title=The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing |number=Special publication 800-145|institution=National Institute of Standards and Technology: U.S. Department of Commerce|date= September 2011|author1= Peter Mell |author2= Timothy Grance |doi= 10.6028/NIST.SP.800-145}}</ref>}}\n\n==Service models==\n[[File:Cloud computing layers.png|thumb|300px |Cloud computing service models arranged as layers in a stack]]\n\nThough [[service-oriented architecture]] advocates \"Everything as a service\" (with the acronyms '''EaaS''' or '''XaaS''',<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Everything as a Service (XaaS) on the Cloud: Origins, Current and Future Trends \n|last1=Duan |first1=Yucong \n|title=2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing \n|pages=621\u2013628 \n|last2=Fu |first2=Guohua \n|last3=Zhou |first3=Nianjun \n|last4=Sun |first4=Xiaobing\n|last5=Narendra |first5=Nanjangud \n|last6=Hu |first6=Bo\n|publisher=[[IEEE]]|doi=10.1109/CLOUD.2015.88 \n|year=2015 \n|isbn=978-1-4673-7287-9 \n}}</ref> or simply '''[[As a service|aas]]'''), cloud-computing providers offer their \"services\" according to different models, of which the three standard models per [[NIST]] are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).<ref name=\"nist\"/> These models offer increasing abstraction; they are thus often portrayed as ''layers'' in a [[solution stack|stack]]: infrastructure-, platform- and software-as-a-service, but these need not be related. For example, one can provide SaaS implemented on physical machines (bare metal), without using underlying PaaS or IaaS layers, and conversely one can run a program on IaaS and access it directly, without wrapping it as SaaS.\n\n===Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)===\n{{Main|Infrastructure as a service}}\n\n\"Infrastructure as a service\" (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level [[api|APIs]] used to [[abstraction (computer science)|abstract]] various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc. A [[hypervisor]] runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single [[Linux kernel]] running directly on the physical hardware. Linux [[cgroups]] and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. Containerisation offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead. Also, container capacity auto-scales dynamically with computing load, which eliminates the problem of over-provisioning and enables usage-based billing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elastichosts.com/blog/elastic-containers/#thetechnicaldetails|title=ElasticHosts Blog|date=2014-04-01|website=Elastichosts|access-date=2016-06-02}}</ref> IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine [[disk image|disk-image]] library, raw [[block storage]], file or [[object storage]], firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, [[VLAN|virtual local area networks]] (VLANs), and software bundles.<ref name=\"DHAC\">\n{{cite book\n  |title=Developing and Hosting Applications on the Cloud\n  |date=July 2012\n  |publisher=IBM Press\n  |isbn=978-0-13-306684-5\n  |chapter-url=http://www.ibmpressbooks.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=9780133066845\n  |chapter = Infrastructure as a Service Cloud Concepts\n  |first1 = Alex\n  |last1 = Amies\n  |first2 = Harm\n  |last2 = Sluiman\n  |first3 = Qiang Guo\n  |last3 = Tong\n  |first4 = Guo Ning\n  |last4 = Liu\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[NIST]]'s definition of cloud computing describes IaaS as \"where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications.

For [[Wide area network|wide-area]] connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or [[carrier cloud]]s (dedicated [[virtual private network]]s). To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software.

The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a [[computing platform]], typically including operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers develop and run their software on a cloud platform instead of directly buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers.

Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users, there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server. Additionally, [[Eugene Schultz]], chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. \"There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into\". Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack\u2014a process he called \"hyperjacking\".

A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\n\n''Broad network access.'' Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, [[laptop]]s, and workstations).\n\n''[[Pooling (resource management)|Resource pooling]].'' The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.&nbsp;\n\n''Rapid elasticity.'' Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\n\n''Measured service.'' Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts).

It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems.

These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The systems work by creating and describing identities, recording activities, and getting rid of unused identities.\n\nAccording to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are ''Insecure Interfaces and APIs'', ''Data Loss & Leakage'', and ''Hardware Failure''\u2014which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users, there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server. Additionally, [[Eugene Schultz]], chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. \"There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into\". Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack\u2014a process he called \"hyperjacking\". Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak.<ref name=\"psg.hitachi-solutions.com\">{{Cite web|title = Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and iCloud Reach the Top 5 Cloud Storage Security Breaches List|url = https://psg.hitachi-solutions.com/credeon/blog/google-drive-dropbox-box-and-icloud-reach-the-top-5-cloud-storage-security-breaches-list|website = psg.hitachi-solutions.com|accessdate = 2015-11-22|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151123032912/https://psg.hitachi-solutions.com/credeon/blog/google-drive-dropbox-box-and-icloud-reach-the-top-5-cloud-storage-security-breaches-list|archive-date = 2015-11-23|url-status=dead|df = }}</ref> Dropbox had been breached in October 2014, having over 7 million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC).

There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes don't read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click \"Accept\" without reading). This is important now that cloud computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work, for example for an [[intelligent personal assistant]] (Apple's [[Siri]] or [[Google Now]]). Fundamentally, private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Bumpy Road to Private Clouds| url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2549867/data-center/the-bumpy-road-to-private-clouds.html |access-date=8 October 2014| date=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n==Limitations and disadvantages==\nAccording to [[Bruce Schneier]], \"The downside is that you will have limited customization options.

Nevertheless, cloud computing has proven to have some limitations and disadvantages, especially for smaller business operations, particularly regarding security and downtime. Technical outages are inevitable and occur sometimes when cloud service providers (CSPs) become overwhelmed in the process of serving their clients. This may result in temporary business suspension. Since this technology's systems rely on the Internet, an individual cannot access their applications, server or data from the cloud during an outage.\n\n==Emerging trends==\nCloud computing is still a subject of research.<ref name=ghc>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=David Mitchell|title=Hype Cycle for Cloud Computing, 2013|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2573318/hype-cycle-cloud-computing-|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref> A driving factor in the evolution of cloud computing has been [[chief technology officer]]s seeking to minimize risk of internal outages and mitigate the complexity of housing network and computing hardware in-house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hello-cirro.co.uk/evolution-of-cloud-computing/|title=The evolution of Cloud Computing|accessdate=22 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329121024/http://www.hello-cirro.co.uk/evolution-of-cloud-computing/|archive-date=29 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Major cloud technology companies invest billions of dollars per year in cloud [[Research and Development]].

Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.

Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n==== Cycle ====\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n==== Limit ====\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n=== Breath exhalation ===\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ==\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a [[tracheal tube |T tube test]].\n\n==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Artificial airway}}\nThere are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]:\n* [[Respirator|Face mask]] \u2014 In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]].

A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. Tracheostomy tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected to be difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.\n* ''Mouthpiece'' \u2014 Less common interface, does not provide protection against aspiration.

Due to the anatomy of the human [[pharynx]], [[larynx]], and [[esophagus]] and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed, additional measures are often required to secure the [[Artificial airway|airway]] during positive-pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach. The common method is by [[Artificial airway|insertion of a tube into the trachea]]: intubation, which provides a clear route for the air. This can be either an [[tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]], inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose, or a [[tracheostomy]] inserted through an artificial opening in the neck. In other circumstances simple [[Airway management#Airway maneuvers|airway maneuvres]], an [[oropharyngeal airway]] or [[laryngeal mask airway]] may be employed. If the patient is able to protect his/her own airway and [[non-invasive ventilation]] or [[Negative pressure ventilator|negative-pressure ventilation]] is used then an [[Artificial airway|airway adjunct]] may not be needed.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n== Types of ventilators ==\n{{See also|COVID\u201319 related shortages}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n[[Image:Ballon ventilation 1.jpg|thumb|SMART BAG MO Bag-Valve-Mask Resuscitator]]\nVentilators come in many different styles and method of giving a breath to sustain life.{{cn|date = March 2020}}  There are manual ventilators such as [[bag valve mask]]s and [[anesthesia bag]]s that require the users to hold the ventilator to the face or to an [[artificial airway]] and maintain breaths with their hands.{{cn|date = March 2020}}  Mechanical ventilators are ventilators not requiring operator effort and are typically computer-controlled or pneumatic-controlled.{{cn|date = March 2020}} Mechanical ventilators typically require power by a battery or a wall outlet (DC or AC) though some ventilators work on a pneumatic system not requiring power.{{cn|date = March 2020}} There are a variety of technologies available for ventilation, falling into two main (and then lesser categories), the two being the older technology of negative-pressure mechanisms,{{what|date=April 2020}} and the more common positive-pressure types.{{cn|date = March 2020}}\n\nCommon positive-pressure mechanical ventilators include:\n#Transport ventilators\u2014These ventilators are small and more rugged, and can be powered pneumatically or via AC or DC power sources.\n#Intensive-care ventilators\u2014These ventilators are larger and usually run on AC power (though virtually all contain a battery to facilitate intra-facility transport and as a back-up in the event of a power failure).  This style of ventilator often provides greater control of a wide variety of ventilation parameters (such as inspiratory rise time).  Many ICU ventilators also incorporate graphics to provide visual feedback of each breath.\n#Neonatal ventilators ([[Bubble CPAP]]{{what|date=April 2020}})\u2014Designed with the preterm neonate in mind, these are a specialized subset of ICU ventilators that are designed to deliver the smaller, more precise volumes and pressures required to ventilate these patients.\n#[[Positive airway pressure]] ventilators (PAP) \u2014 These ventilators are specifically designed for [[non-invasive ventilation]].  This includes ventilators for use at home for treatment of chronic conditions such as [[sleep apnea]] or [[COPD]].\n\n=== Modes of mechanical ventilation  ===\n{{Main|Modes of mechanical ventilation}}\nMechanical ventilation utilizes several separate systems for ventilation referred to as the mode.  Modes come in many different delivery concepts but all modes fall into one of three categories;  volume-cycled,{{what|date=April 2020}} pressure-cycled,{{what|date=April 2020}} spontaneously cycled.{{what|date=April 2020}}  In general, the selection of which mode of mechanical ventilation to use for a given patient is based on the familiarity of [[clinician]]s with modes and the equipment availability at a particular institution.<ref name=\"pmid10806138\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Esteban A, Anzueto A, Al\u00eda I, Gordo F, Apeztegu\u00eda C, P\u00e1lizas F, etal | title=How is mechanical ventilation employed in the intensive care unit?

Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engstrom|first=C.-G.|date=1954|title=Treatment of Severe Cases of Respiratory Paralysis by the Engstrom Universal Respirator|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=2|issue=4889|pages=666\u2013669|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4889.666|issn=0959-8138|pmc=2079443|pmid=13190223}}</ref><ref>{{Cite patent|country=US|number=US2699163A|title=Respirator|status=|pubdate=|gdate=1951-06-25|invent1=Engstr\u00f6m|inventor1-first=Carl Gunnar|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2699163A/en}}</ref> and the United States and was the beginning of [[modern ventilation therapy]]. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a [[tracheostomy]] tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nPositive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the [[tidal volume]] \u2014 the breath-out through passive exhalation.\n\n====Negative pressure machines====\n[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|An iron lung]]\n{{main|Negative pressure ventilator}}\nNegative pressure mechanical ventilators are produced in small, field-type and larger formats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The prominent design of the smaller devices is known as the [[cuirass]], a shell-like unit used to create negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{efn|1=The early types of these were prone to falling off and caused severe chafing, and so were not used as a long-term devices.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}} In recent years this device has been manufactured using various-sized [[polycarbonate]] shells with multiple seals, and a high-pressure [[oscillation pump]] in order to carry out [[biphasic cuirass ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Its main use has been in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The latter, larger formats are in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in [[England]] such as [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|John Radcliffe]] in [[Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} \n\nThe larger units have their origin in the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, which was developed in 1929 and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the [[polio]] [[epidemic]] that struck the world in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The machine is, in effect, a large elongated [[tank]], which encases the patient up to the neck.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The neck is sealed with a rubber [[gasket]] so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by [[diffusion]] and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the [[human lung|lungs]] to make it available to the [[gas exchange]] process.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the [[pleural cavity]] by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the [[atmospheric pressure]] and the pressure inside the [[human thorax|thorax]] generates a flow of air.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities.

Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator ====\nAnother type is the ''intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator'' that applies pressure externally via an inflated bladder, forcing exhalation, sometimes termed [[exsufflation]].

Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.\n\n==== Cycle ====\nThe cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase.  Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in [[pressure regulated volume control]].\n\n==== Limit ====\nLimit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum circuit\npressure or a set maximum flow.\n\n=== Breath exhalation ===\nExhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator's expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure ([[PEEP]]) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.\n\n== Weaning from mechanical ventilation ==\nTiming of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation\u2014also known as weaning\u2014should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.\n\nThe [[Rapid Shallow Breathing Index]] (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the \"Tobin Index\" after Dr. Martin Tobin of [[Loyola University Medical Center]]) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L predicted weaning success with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 97%, 64%, 78%, 95% respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang KL, Tobin MJ |title=A prospective study of indexes predicting the outcome of trials of weaning from mechanical ventilation |journal=N.

There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a [[tracheal tube |T tube test]].\n\n==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Artificial airway}}\nThere are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]:\n* [[Respirator|Face mask]] \u2014 In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of ''nasopharyngeal'' or ''[[oropharyngeal airway]]''. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the [[pharynx]] through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for [[non-invasive ventilation]] in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. [[Non-invasive ventilation]] can be considered for epidemics of [[COVID-19]] where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases) but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors=Murthy S, Gomersall CD, Fowler RA |title=Care for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 |journal=JAMA |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=2020-03-11 |doi=10.1001/jama.2020.3633 |pmid=32159735 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n* ''[[Tracheal intubation]]'' is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the [[nasopharynx]] or [[oropharynx]] and [[subglottic stenosis]].\n* ''[[Supraglottic airway]]'' \u2014 a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook T, Howes B |title=Supraglottic airway devices: recent advances |journal=Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=56\u201361 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkq058 |url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/56.full}}</ref> There are many types of SGAs available including the [[Combitube|Esophageal-tracheal Combitube]] (ETC), [[Laryngeal tube]] (LT), and the obsolete [[Esophageal obturator airway]] (EOA).\n*''[[Cricothyrotomy]]'' \u2014 Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the [[cricothyroid membrane]].

A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. Tracheostomy tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected to be difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.\n* ''Mouthpiece'' \u2014 Less common interface, does not provide protection against aspiration.

English underwent distinct variations and developments following the [[Old English]] period. Scholarly opinion varies, but the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' specifies the period when Middle English was spoken as being from 1150 to 1500.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Middle English\u2013an overview - Oxford English Dictionary|url = http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-time/middle-english-an-overview/|website = Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate = 2016-01-04|language = en-US|date = 2012-08-16}}</ref> This stage of the development of the English language roughly followed the [[High Middle Ages|High]] to the [[Late Middle Ages]].\n\nMiddle English saw significant changes to its vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and [[orthography]]. Writing conventions during the Middle English period varied widely. Examples of writing from this period that have survived show extensive regional variation. The more standardized Old English language became fragmented, localized, and was, for the most part, being improvised.<ref name=\":0\"/> By the end of the period (about 1470) and aided by the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1439, a standard based on the London dialect (Chancery Standard) had become established. This largely formed the basis for Modern English spelling, although pronunciation has changed considerably since that time. Middle English was succeeded in England by the era of [[Early Modern English]], which lasted until about 1650. [[History of the Scots language|Scots]] developed concurrently from a variant of the [[Northumbrian dialect]] (prevalent in northern England and spoken in southeast [[Scotland]]).\n\nDuring the Middle English period, many Old English grammatical features either became simplified or disappeared altogether. Noun, adjective and verb [[inflection]]s were simplified by the reduction (and eventual elimination) of most [[grammatical case]] distinctions. Middle English also saw considerable adoption of [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]] vocabulary, especially in the areas of politics, law, the arts, and religion. Conventional English vocabulary retained its mostly Germanic [[etiology]], with [[Old Norse]] influences becoming more apparent. Significant changes in pronunciation took place, particularly involving long vowels and diphthongs, which in the later Middle English period began to undergo the [[Great Vowel Shift]].\n\nLittle survives of early [[Middle English literature]], due in part to Norman domination and the prestige that came with writing in French rather than English. During the 14th century, a new style of literature emerged with the works of writers including [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], whose ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' remains one of the most studied and read works of the period.{{refn|The name \"tales of Canterbury\" appears within the surviving texts of Chaucer's work.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Carlson, David. |title= The Chronology of Lydgate's Chaucer References |journal= [[The Chaucer Review]] |volume=38 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=246\u2013254 |doi=10.1353/cr.2004.0003 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.691.7778 }}</ref>}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Transition from Old English===\n[[File:Middle English Dialects.png|thumb|The dialects of Middle English c. 1300]]\n\nTransition from Late [[Old English]] to Early Middle English occurred at some time during the 12th century.\n\nThe influence of [[Old Norse]] aided the development of English from a [[synthetic language]] with relatively free word order, to a more [[Analytic language|analytic]] or [[Isolating language|isolating]] language with a more strict word order.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Language|last = Baugh|first = Albert|publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul|year = 1951|isbn = |location = London|pages = 110\u2013130 (Danelaw); 131\u2013132 (Normans)}}</ref> Both Old English and Old Norse (as well as the descendants of the latter, [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]) were synthetic languages with complicated inflections.

Pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs (like \"hence\" and \"together\"), conjunctions and prepositions show the most marked Danish influence. The best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in extensive word borrowings, yet no texts exist in either Scandinavia or in Northern England from this period to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax.

The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost.\" This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in \"simplifying English grammar.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile the influence of Scandinavian languages was strongest in the dialects of the [[Danelaw]] region and Scotland, words in the spoken language emerge in the tenth and eleventh centuries near the transition from the Old to Middle English. Influence on the written language only appeared at the beginning of the thirteenth century, likely because of a scarcity of literary texts from an earlier date.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 saw the replacement of the top levels of the English-speaking political and ecclesiastical hierarchies by [[Normans|Norman]] rulers who spoke a dialect of [[Old French]] known as [[Old Norman]], which developed in England into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. The use of Norman as the preferred language of literature and polite discourse fundamentally  altered the role of Old English in education and administration, even though many Normans of this period were illiterate and depended on the clergy for written communication and record-keeping. A significant number of words of French origin began to appear in the English language alongside native English words of similar meaning, giving rise to such Modern English synonyms as ''[[pig]]/[[pork]], [[chicken]]/[[poultry]], [[calf (animal)|calf]]/[[veal]], [[cow]]/[[beef]], [[sheep]]/[[mutton]], wood/[[forest]], house/[[mansion]], worthy/valuable, bold/courageous, freedom/[[liberty]], sight/vision, eat/dine''.\nThe role of Anglo-Norman as the language of government and law can be seen in the abundance of Modern English words for the mechanisms of government that are derived from Anglo-Norman: ''[[court]]'', ''[[judge]]'', ''[[jury]]'', ''[[appeal]]'', ''[[parliament]]''. There are also many Norman-derived terms relating to the [[chivalric]] cultures that arose in the 12th century; an era of [[feudalism]] and [[crusading]].\n\nWords were often taken from [[Latin]], usually through French transmission. This gave rise to various synonyms including ''kingly'' (inherited from Old English), ''royal'' (from French, which inherited it from Vulgar Latin), and ''regal'' (from French, which borrowed it from classical Latin). Later French appropriations were derived from standard, rather than Norman, French. Examples of resultant cognate pairs include the words ''warden'' (from Norman), and ''guardian'' (from later French; both share a common Germanic ancestor).\n\nThe end of Anglo-Saxon rule did not result in immediate changes to the language. The general population would have spoken the same [[Old English dialects|dialects]] as they had before the Conquest. Once the writing of Old English came to an end, Middle English had no standard language, only dialects that derived from the [[Old English dialects|dialects of the same regions]] in the Anglo-Saxon period.\n\n===Early Middle English===\nEarly Middle English (1150\u20131300)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fuster-M\u00e1rquez |first1=Miguel |last2=Calvo Garc\u00eda de Leonardo |first2=Juan Jos\u00e9 |year=2011 |title=A Practical Introduction to the History of English |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQLBqKjxuvAC&pg=PA21&dq=%22ca+1150+and+1500%22#v=onepage&q=%22ca%201150%20and%201500%22&f=false |location=[Val\u00e8ncia] |publisher=Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia |page=21 |isbn=9788437083216 |access-date=19 December 2017 }}</ref> has a largely Anglo-Saxon vocabulary (with [[Scandinavian influence in English|many Norse borrowings]] in the northern parts of the country), but a greatly simplified [[inflection]]al system. The grammatical relations that were expressed in Old English by the [[dative]] and [[instrumental case]]s are replaced in Early Middle English with [[preposition]]al constructions. The Old English [[genitive]] ''-es'' survives in the ''-'s'' of the modern [[English possessive]], but most of the other case endings disappeared in the Early Middle English period, including most of the [[Old English declension#Definite articles and demonstratives|roughly one dozen forms]] of the [[definite article]] (\"the\"). The [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] personal pronouns (denoting exactly two) also disappeared from English during this period.\n\nGradually, the wealthy and the government [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] again, although Norman (and subsequently [[Law French|French]]) remained the dominant language of literature and law until the 14th century, even after the loss of the majority of the continental possessions of the [[English monarchy]]. The loss of case endings was part of a general trend from inflections to fixed [[word order]] that also occurred in other Germanic languages (though more slowly and to a lesser extent), and therefore it cannot be attributed simply to the influence of French-speaking sections of the population: English did, after all, remain the [[vernacular]]. It is also argued<ref>McWhorter, ''Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue,'' 2008, pp. 89\u2013136.</ref> that Norse immigrants to England had a great impact on the loss of inflectional endings in Middle English. One argument is that, although Norse- and English-speakers were somewhat comprehensible to each other due to similar morphology, the Norse-speakers' inability to reproduce the ending sounds of English words influenced Middle English's loss of inflectional endings.\n\nImportant texts for the reconstruction of the evolution of Middle English out of Old English are the ''[[Peterborough Chronicle]]'', which continued to be compiled up to 1154; the ''[[Ormulum]]'', a biblical commentary probably composed in [[Lincolnshire]] in the second half of the 12th century, incorporating a unique phonetic spelling system; and the ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'' and the [[Katherine Group]], religious texts written for [[anchoress]]es, apparently in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in the early 13th century.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Burchfield |first=Robert W. |chapter=Ormulum |editor-first=Joseph R. |editor-last=Strayer |title=Dictionary of the Middle Ages |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=1987 |volume=9 |page=280 |isbn=978-0-684-18275-9 }}, p. 280</ref> The language found in the last two works is sometimes called the [[AB language]].'''Old English''' was the language spoken during 5th to mid-12th century; '''Middle English''' was spoken during mid-11th to late 15th century. '''Old English''' developed and originated from North Sea Germanic; '''Middle English''' developed from Wessex.\n\nMore literary sources of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries include ''[[Layamon's Brut|Lawman's Brut]]'' and ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]''.\n\nSome scholars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hcmc.uvic.ca/makingEME/about.html|title=Making Early Middle English: About the Conference|website=hcmc.uvic.ca}}</ref> have defined \"Early Middle English\" as encompassing English texts up to 1350. This longer time frame would extend the corpus to include many Middle English Romances (especially those of the ''[[Auchinleck manuscript]]'' ca. 1330).\n\n===14th century===\nFrom around the early 14th century, there was significant migration into [[London]], particularly from the counties of the [[East Midlands]], and a new [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] London dialect began to develop, based chiefly on the speech of the East Midlands, but also influenced by that of other regions.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite encyclopedia |author= Wright, L. |title=About the evolution of Standard English |encyclopedia= Studies in English Language and Literature |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2012 |page=99ff |isbn=978-1138006935}}</ref> The writing of this period, however, continues to reflect a variety of regional forms of English. The ''[[Ayenbite of Inwyt]]'', a translation of a French confessional prose work, completed in 1340, is written in a [[Kentish dialect]]. The best known writer of Middle English, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], wrote in the second half of the 14th century in the emerging London dialect, although he also portrays some of his characters as speaking in northern dialects, as in the \"[[Reeve's Tale]]\".\n\nIn the English-speaking areas of lowland [[Scotland]], an independent standard was developing, based on the [[Northumbrian dialect]]. This would develop into what came to be known as the [[Scots language]].\n\n{{anchor|Chancery Standard}}\n\n===Late Middle English===\nThe '''Chancery Standard''' of written English emerged {{circa}} 1430 in official documents that, since the Norman Conquest, had normally been written in French.<sup>[[Middle English#cite note-Wright-16|[16]]]</sup> Like Chaucer's work, this new standard was based on the East-Midlands-influenced speech of London. Clerks using this standard were usually familiar with [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]], influencing the forms they chose. The Chancery Standard, which was adopted slowly, was used in England by bureaucrats for most official purposes, excluding those of the Church and legalities, which used Latin and [[Law French]] (and some Latin), respectively.<sup>[[Middle English#cite note-Nevalainen2008-17|[17]]]</sup>\n\nThe Chancery Standard's influence on later forms of written English is disputed, but it did undoubtedly provide the core around which [[Early Modern English]] formed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Early Modern English emerged with the help of [[William Caxton]]'s printing press, developed during the 1470s. The press stabilized English through a push towards standardization, led by Chancery Standard enthusiast and writer [[Richard Pynson]].<sup>[[Middle English#cite note-18|[18]]]</sup> Early Modern English began in the 1540s after the printing and wide distribution of the [[English Bible]] and [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]], which made the new standard of English publicly recognizable, and lasted until about 1650.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Middle English phonology}}\nThe main changes between the [[Old English phonology|Old English sound system]] and [[Middle English phonology|that of Middle English]] include:\n*Emergence of the voiced [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/v/, /\u00f0/, /z/}} as separate [[phoneme]]s, rather than mere [[allophone]]s of the corresponding [[voiceless]] fricatives.\n*Reduction of the Old English [[diphthong]]s to monophthongs, and the emergence of new diphthongs due to vowel breaking in certain positions, change of Old English post-vocalic {{IPA|/j/, /w/}} (sometimes resulting from the {{IPA|[\u0263]}} allophone of {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) to offglides, and borrowing from French.\n*Merging of Old English {{IPA|/\u00e6/ and /\u0251/}} into a single vowel {{IPA|/a/}}.\n*Raising of the long vowel {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} to {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, and (in the south) raising and rounding of {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} to {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}.\n*Unrounding of the front [[rounded vowel]]s in most dialects.\n*Lengthening of vowels in [[open syllable]]s (and in certain other positions). The resultant long vowels (and other pre-existing long vowels) subsequently underwent changes of quality in the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which began during the later Middle English period.\n*Loss of [[gemination]] (double consonants came to be pronounced as single ones).\n*Loss of weak final vowels ([[schwa]], written {{angle bracket|e}}). By [[Chaucer]]'s time this vowel was silent in normal speech, although it was normally pronounced in verse as the [[meter (verse)|meter]] required (much as occurs in modern [[French language|French]]). Also, non-final unstressed {{angle bracket|e}} was dropped when adjacent to only a single consonant on either side if there was another short {{angbr|e}} in an adjoining syllable. Thus, ''every'' began to be pronounced as \"evry\", and ''palmeres'' as \"palmers\".\n\nThe combination of the last three processes listed above led to the spelling conventions associated with [[silent e|silent {{vr|e}}]] and [[double letter|doubled consonants]] (see under [[#Orthography|Orthography]], below).\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\nMiddle English retains only two distinct noun-ending patterns from the more complex system of [[Old English grammar#Nouns|inflection in Old English]]. The Early Middle English nouns ''engel'' (\"angel\") and ''name'' (\"name\") demonstrate the two patterns:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Strong (engel)\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Weak (name)\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n!Nominative\n| rowspan=\"2\" |engel\n| rowspan=\"2\" |engles\n!Nominative\n| rowspan=\"2\" |name\n| rowspan=\"2\" |namen\n|-\n!Accusative\n!Accusative\n|-\n!Dative\n|engle\n|engle(n)/englem\n!Dative\n| rowspan=\"2\" |namen\n|namen/namem\n|-\n!Genitive\n|engles<ref>cf.

'Ancrene Wisse' (The ''Anchoresses<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' Guide)</ref>\n!Genitive\n|namen(e)\n|}\n\nSome nouns of the ''engel'' type have an ''-e'' in the nominative/accusative singular, like the weak declension, but otherwise strong endings. Often these are the same nouns that had an ''-e'' in the nominative/accusative singular of Old English (they, in turn, were inherited from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''ja''-stem and ''i''-stem nouns.)\n\nThe distinct dative case was lost in early Middle English. The genitive survived, however, but by the end of the Middle English period, only the strong ''-'s'' ending (variously spelt) was in use.<ref>Fischer, O., van Kemenade, A., Koopman, W., van der Wurff, W., ''The Syntax of Early English'', CUP 2000, p. 72.</ref> Some formerly feminine nouns, as well as some weak nouns, continued to make their genitive forms with -e or no ending (e.g. ''fole hoves'', horses' hoves), and nouns of relationship ending in -er frequently have no genitive ending (e.g. ''fader bone'', \"father's bane\").<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=23}}</ref>\n\nThe strong ''-(e)s'' plural form has survived into Modern English. The weak ''-(e)n'' form is now rare and used only in ''oxen'' and, as part of a [[double plural]], in ''children'' and ''brethren''. Some dialects still have forms such as ''eyen'' (for ''eyes''), ''shoon'' (for ''shoes''), ''hosen'' (for ''hose(s)''), ''kine'' (for ''cows''), and ''been'' (for ''bees'').\n\n[[Grammatical gender]] survived to a limited extent in early Middle English,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=23}}</ref>  before being replaced by natural gender in the course of the Middle English period. Grammatical gender was indicated by agreement of articles and pronouns, i.e. \u00feo ule (\"the-feminine owl\") or using the pronoun ''he'' to refer to masculine nouns such as ''helm'' (\"helmet\"), or phrases such as ''scaft st\u00e6rcne'' (strong shaft) with the masculine accusative adjective ending ''-ne''.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=38}}</ref>\n\n===Adjectives===\nSingle syllable adjectives add -e when modifying a noun in the plural and when used after the definite article (''\u00fee''), after a demonstrative (''\u00feis'', ''\u00feat''), after a possessive pronoun (e.g. ''hir'', ''our''), or with a name or in a form of address. This derives from the Old English \"weak\" declension of adjectives.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |pages=27\u201328}}</ref> This inflexion continued to be used in writing even after final -e had ceased to be pronounced.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |pages=28}}</ref> In earlier texts, multi-syllable adjectives also receive a final -e in these situations, but this occurs less regularly in later Middle English texts. Otherwise adjectives have no ending, and adjectives already ending in -e etymologically receive no ending as well.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=28}}</ref>\n\nEarlier texts sometimes inflect adjectives for case as well. [[Layamon's Brut]] inflects adjectives for the masculine accusative, genitive, and dative, the feminine dative, and the plural genitive.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J.

Also, the nominative form of the feminine third-person singular was replaced by a form of the [[demonstrative]] that developed into ''sche'' (modern ''she''), but the alternative ''heyr'' remained in some areas for a long time.\n\nAs with nouns, there was some inflectional simplification (the distinct Old English [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] forms were lost), but pronouns, unlike nouns, retained distinct nominative and accusative forms. Third-person pronouns also retained a distinction between accusative and dative forms, but that was gradually lost: the masculine ''hine'' was replaced by ''him'' south of the Thames by the early 14th century, and the neuter dative ''him'' was ousted by ''it'' in most dialects by the 15th.<ref>Fulk, R.D., ''An Introduction to Middle English'', Broadview Press, 2012, p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe following table shows some of the various Middle English pronouns, together with their modern (in quotation marks) and (sometimes) Old English equivalents.

The past-tense forms, without their personal endings, also serve as past participles with past-participle prefixes derived from Old English: ''i-'', ''y-'' and sometimes ''bi-''.\n\n[[Germanic strong verb|Strong verbs]], by contrast, form their past tense by changing their stem vowel (''binden'' becomes ''bound'', a process called [[apophony]]), as in Modern English.\n\n==Orthography==\n\nWith the discontinuation of the [[Late West Saxon]] standard used for the [[Old English orthography|writing of Old English]] in the period prior to the Norman Conquest, Middle English came to be written in a wide variety of scribal forms, reflecting different regional dialects and orthographic conventions. Later in the Middle English period, however, and particularly with the development of the [[#Chancery Standard|Chancery Standard]] in the 15th century, orthography became relatively standardised in a form based on the East Midlands-influenced speech of London. Spelling at the time was mostly quite [[regular spelling|regular]] (there was a fairly consistent correspondence between letters and sounds). The irregularity of [[English orthography|present-day English orthography]] is largely due to [[Phonological history of English|pronunciation changes]] that have taken place over the [[Early Modern English]] and [[Modern English]] eras.\n\nMiddle English generally did not have [[silent letter]]s. For example, ''knight'' was pronounced {{IPA-enm|\u02c8kni\u00e7t|}} (with both the {{vr|k}} and the {{vr|gh}} pronounced, the latter sounding as the {{angle bracket|ch}} in German ''Knecht''). The major exception was the [[silent e|silent {{angbr|e}}]] \u2013 originally pronounced, but lost in normal speech by Chaucer's time. This letter, however, came to indicate a lengthened \u2013 and later also modified \u2013 pronunciation of a preceding vowel. For example, in ''name'', originally pronounced as two syllables, the /a/ in the first syllable (originally an open syllable) lengthened, the final weak vowel was later dropped, and the remaining long vowel was modified in the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (for these sound changes, see under [[#Phonology|Phonology]], above). The final {{angbr|e}}, now silent, thus became the indicator of the longer and changed pronunciation of {{angbr|a}}. In fact vowels could have this lengthened and modified pronunciation in various positions, particularly before a single consonant letter and another vowel, or before certain pairs of consonants.\n\nA related convention involved the doubling of consonant letters to show that the preceding vowel was not to be lengthened. In some cases the double consonant represented a sound that was (or had previously been) [[gemination|geminated]], i.e. had genuinely been \"doubled\" (and would thus have regularly blocked the lengthening of the preceding vowel). In other cases, by analogy, the consonant was written double merely to indicate the lack of lengthening.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe basic [[Old English Latin alphabet]] had consisted of 20 standard letters (there was not yet a distinct ''j'', ''v'' or ''w'', and Old English scribes did not generally use ''k'', ''q'' or ''z'') plus four additional letters: [[ash (letter)|ash]] {{angbr|\u00e6}}, [[eth]] {{angbr|\u00f0}}, [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] {{angbr|\u00fe}} and [[wynn]] {{angbr|\u01bf}}.\n\nAsh was no longer required in Middle English, as the Old English vowel /\u00e6/ that it represented had [[#Phonology|merged into /a/]]. The symbol nonetheless came to be used as a [[typographic ligature|ligature]] for the digraph {{angle bracket|ae}} in many words of Greek or Latin origin, as did [[\u0153]] for {{angbr|oe}}.\n\nEth and thorn both represented {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} or its [[allophone]] {{IPAslink|\u00f0}} in Old English. Eth fell out of use during the 13th century and was replaced by thorn. Thorn mostly fell out of use during the 14th century, and was replaced by [[th (digraph)|{{angbr|th}}]]. (Anachronistic usage of the scribal abbreviation [[File:EME ye.svg|10px]] (\"\u00fee\", i.e. \"the\") has led to the modern mispronunciation of ''thorn'' as {{angle bracket|[[y]]}} in this context; see ''[[ye olde]]''.<ref>''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'', [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ye%5B2%5D ye<nowiki>[2]</nowiki>] retrieved February 1, 2009</ref>)\n\nWynn, which represented the phoneme {{IPA|/w/}}, was replaced by {{angle bracket|[[w]]}} during the 13th century. Due to its similarity to the letter {{angle bracket|p}}, it is mostly represented by {{angle bracket|w}} in modern editions of Old and Middle English texts even when the manuscript has wynn.\n\nUnder Norman influence, the continental [[Carolingian minuscule]] replaced the [[insular script]] that had been used for Old English. However, because of the significant difference in appearance between the old [[insular G|insular ''g'']] and the [[Carolingian G|Carolingian ''g'']] (modern g), the former continued in use as a separate letter, known as [[yogh]], written {{angbr|\u021d}}. This was adopted for use to represent a variety of sounds: {{IPA|[\u0263], [j], [d\u0292], [x], [\u00e7]}}, while the Carolingian ''g'' was normally used for [g]. Instances of yogh were eventually replaced by {{angbr|j}} or {{angbr|y}}, and by {{angbr|gh}} in words like ''night'' and ''laugh''. In [[Middle Scots]] yogh became indistinguishable from cursive ''z'', and printers tended to use {{angle bracket|z}} when ''yogh'' was not available in their fonts; this led to new spellings (often giving rise to new pronunciations), as in [[Mackenzie (surname)|''McKenzie'']], where the {{angbr|z}} replaced a yogh which had the pronunciation {{IPA|/j/}}.\n\nUnder continental influence, the letters {{vr|k}}, {{vr|q}} and {{vr|z}}, which had not normally been used by Old English scribes, came to be commonly used in the writing of Middle English. Also the newer Latin letter {{vr|w}} was introduced (replacing wynn). The distinct letter forms {{vrl|v}} and {{vrl|u}} came into use, but were still used interchangeably; the same applies to {{vrl|j}} and {{vrl|i}}.<ref name=\"Salmon\">Salmon, V., (in) Lass, R. (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'', Vol. III, CUP 2000, p. 39.</ref> (For example, spellings such as ''wijf'' and ''paradijs'' for ''wife'' and ''paradise'' can be found in Middle English.)\n\nThe consonantal {{vr|j}}/{{vr|i}} was sometimes used to transliterate the Hebrew letter [[yodh]], representing the [[palatal approximant]] sound /j/ (and transliterated in Greek by [[iota]] and in Latin by {{vr|i}}); words like ''Jerusalem'', ''Joseph'', etc. would have originally followed the Latin pronunciation beginning with /j/, that is, the sound of {{vr|y}} in ''yes''. In some words, however, notably from [[Old French]], {{vr|j}}/{{vr|i}} was used for the [[affricate consonant]] {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}, as in ''joie'' (modern \"joy\"), used in [[Wycliffe's Bible]].<ref name=\"j-oed\">\"J\", ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989)</ref><ref>\"J\" and \"jay\", ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1993)</ref> This was similar to the [[gemination|geminate sound]] {{IPA|[dd\u0292]}}, which had been represented as {{vr|cg}} in Old English. By the time of Modern English, the sound came to be written as {{vr|j}}/{{vr|i}} at the start of words (like ''joy''), and usually as {{vr|dg}} elsewhere (as in ''bridge''). It could also be written, mainly in French loanwords, as {{vr|g}}, with the adoption of the [[hard and soft G|soft G]] convention (''age'', ''page'', etc.)\n\n===Other symbols===\nMany [[scribal abbreviation]]s were also used. It was common for the [[Lollardy|Lollards]] to abbreviate the name of Jesus (as in Latin manuscripts) to ''[[Christogram|ihc]]''. The letters {{vr|n}} and {{vr|m}} were often omitted and indicated by a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] above an adjacent letter, so for example ''in'' could be written as ''\u012b''. A thorn with a superscript {{vr|t}} or {{vr|e}} could be used for ''that'' and ''the''; the thorn here resembled a {{vr|Y}}, giving rise to the ''ye'' of \"[[Ye Olde]]\". Various forms of the [[ampersand]] replaced the word ''and''.\n\nNumbers were still always written using [[Roman numerals]], except for some rare occurrences of [[Arabic numerals]] during the 15th century.\n\n===Letter-to-sound correspondences===\nAlthough Middle English spelling was never fully standardised, the following table shows the pronunciations most usually represented by particular letters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s towards the end of the Middle English period, using the notation given in the article on [[Middle English phonology]].<ref>For certain details, see \"Chancery Standard spelling\" in Upward, C., Davidson, G., ''The History of English Spelling'', Wiley 2011.</ref> As explained above, single vowel letters had alternative pronunciations depending on whether they were in a position where their sounds had been subject to lengthening. Long vowel pronunciations were in flux due to the beginnings of the [[Great Vowel Shift]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Symbol !!

English underwent distinct variations and developments following the [[Old English]] period. Scholarly opinion varies, but the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' specifies the period when Middle English was spoken as being from 1150 to 1500.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Middle English\u2013an overview - Oxford English Dictionary|url = http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-time/middle-english-an-overview/|website = Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate = 2016-01-04|language = en-US|date = 2012-08-16}}</ref> This stage of the development of the English language roughly followed the [[High Middle Ages|High]] to the [[Late Middle Ages]].\n\nMiddle English saw significant changes to its vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and [[orthography]]. Writing conventions during the Middle English period varied widely. Examples of writing from this period that have survived show extensive regional variation. The more standardized Old English language became fragmented, localized, and was, for the most part, being improvised.<ref name=\":0\"/> By the end of the period (about 1470) and aided by the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1439, a standard based on the London dialect (Chancery Standard) had become established. This largely formed the basis for Modern English spelling, although pronunciation has changed considerably since that time. Middle English was succeeded in England by the era of [[Early Modern English]], which lasted until about 1650. [[History of the Scots language|Scots]] developed concurrently from a variant of the [[Northumbrian dialect]] (prevalent in northern England and spoken in southeast [[Scotland]]).\n\nDuring the Middle English period, many Old English grammatical features either became simplified or disappeared altogether. Noun, adjective and verb [[inflection]]s were simplified by the reduction (and eventual elimination) of most [[grammatical case]] distinctions. Middle English also saw considerable adoption of [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]] vocabulary, especially in the areas of politics, law, the arts, and religion. Conventional English vocabulary retained its mostly Germanic [[etiology]], with [[Old Norse]] influences becoming more apparent. Significant changes in pronunciation took place, particularly involving long vowels and diphthongs, which in the later Middle English period began to undergo the [[Great Vowel Shift]].\n\nLittle survives of early [[Middle English literature]], due in part to Norman domination and the prestige that came with writing in French rather than English. During the 14th century, a new style of literature emerged with the works of writers including [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], whose ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' remains one of the most studied and read works of the period.{{refn|The name \"tales of Canterbury\" appears within the surviving texts of Chaucer's work.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Carlson, David. |title= The Chronology of Lydgate's Chaucer References |journal= [[The Chaucer Review]] |volume=38 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=246\u2013254 |doi=10.1353/cr.2004.0003 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.691.7778 }}</ref>}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Transition from Old English===\n[[File:Middle English Dialects.png|thumb|The dialects of Middle English c. 1300]]\n\nTransition from Late [[Old English]] to Early Middle English occurred at some time during the 12th century.\n\nThe influence of [[Old Norse]] aided the development of English from a [[synthetic language]] with relatively free word order, to a more [[Analytic language|analytic]] or [[Isolating language|isolating]] language with a more strict word order.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Language|last = Baugh|first = Albert|publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul|year = 1951|isbn = |location = London|pages = 110\u2013130 (Danelaw); 131\u2013132 (Normans)}}</ref> Both Old English and Old Norse (as well as the descendants of the latter, [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]) were synthetic languages with complicated inflections.

Pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs (like \"hence\" and \"together\"), conjunctions and prepositions show the most marked Danish influence. The best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in extensive word borrowings, yet no texts exist in either Scandinavia or in Northern England from this period to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax.

The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost.\" This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in \"simplifying English grammar.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile the influence of Scandinavian languages was strongest in the dialects of the [[Danelaw]] region and Scotland, words in the spoken language emerge in the tenth and eleventh centuries near the transition from the Old to Middle English. Influence on the written language only appeared at the beginning of the thirteenth century, likely because of a scarcity of literary texts from an earlier date.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 saw the replacement of the top levels of the English-speaking political and ecclesiastical hierarchies by [[Normans|Norman]] rulers who spoke a dialect of [[Old French]] known as [[Old Norman]], which developed in England into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. The use of Norman as the preferred language of literature and polite discourse fundamentally  altered the role of Old English in education and administration, even though many Normans of this period were illiterate and depended on the clergy for written communication and record-keeping. A significant number of words of French origin began to appear in the English language alongside native English words of similar meaning, giving rise to such Modern English synonyms as ''[[pig]]/[[pork]], [[chicken]]/[[poultry]], [[calf (animal)|calf]]/[[veal]], [[cow]]/[[beef]], [[sheep]]/[[mutton]], wood/[[forest]], house/[[mansion]], worthy/valuable, bold/courageous, freedom/[[liberty]], sight/vision, eat/dine''.\nThe role of Anglo-Norman as the language of government and law can be seen in the abundance of Modern English words for the mechanisms of government that are derived from Anglo-Norman: ''[[court]]'', ''[[judge]]'', ''[[jury]]'', ''[[appeal]]'', ''[[parliament]]''. There are also many Norman-derived terms relating to the [[chivalric]] cultures that arose in the 12th century; an era of [[feudalism]] and [[crusading]].\n\nWords were often taken from [[Latin]], usually through French transmission. This gave rise to various synonyms including ''kingly'' (inherited from Old English), ''royal'' (from French, which inherited it from Vulgar Latin), and ''regal'' (from French, which borrowed it from classical Latin). Later French appropriations were derived from standard, rather than Norman, French. Examples of resultant cognate pairs include the words ''warden'' (from Norman), and ''guardian'' (from later French; both share a common Germanic ancestor).\n\nThe end of Anglo-Saxon rule did not result in immediate changes to the language. The general population would have spoken the same [[Old English dialects|dialects]] as they had before the Conquest. Once the writing of Old English came to an end, Middle English had no standard language, only dialects that derived from the [[Old English dialects|dialects of the same regions]] in the Anglo-Saxon period.\n\n===Early Middle English===\nEarly Middle English (1150\u20131300)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fuster-M\u00e1rquez |first1=Miguel |last2=Calvo Garc\u00eda de Leonardo |first2=Juan Jos\u00e9 |year=2011 |title=A Practical Introduction to the History of English |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQLBqKjxuvAC&pg=PA21&dq=%22ca+1150+and+1500%22#v=onepage&q=%22ca%201150%20and%201500%22&f=false |location=[Val\u00e8ncia] |publisher=Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia |page=21 |isbn=9788437083216 |access-date=19 December 2017 }}</ref> has a largely Anglo-Saxon vocabulary (with [[Scandinavian influence in English|many Norse borrowings]] in the northern parts of the country), but a greatly simplified [[inflection]]al system. The grammatical relations that were expressed in Old English by the [[dative]] and [[instrumental case]]s are replaced in Early Middle English with [[preposition]]al constructions. The Old English [[genitive]] ''-es'' survives in the ''-'s'' of the modern [[English possessive]], but most of the other case endings disappeared in the Early Middle English period, including most of the [[Old English declension#Definite articles and demonstratives|roughly one dozen forms]] of the [[definite article]] (\"the\"). The [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] personal pronouns (denoting exactly two) also disappeared from English during this period.\n\nGradually, the wealthy and the government [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] again, although Norman (and subsequently [[Law French|French]]) remained the dominant language of literature and law until the 14th century, even after the loss of the majority of the continental possessions of the [[English monarchy]]. The loss of case endings was part of a general trend from inflections to fixed [[word order]] that also occurred in other Germanic languages (though more slowly and to a lesser extent), and therefore it cannot be attributed simply to the influence of French-speaking sections of the population: English did, after all, remain the [[vernacular]]. It is also argued<ref>McWhorter, ''Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue,'' 2008, pp. 89\u2013136.</ref> that Norse immigrants to England had a great impact on the loss of inflectional endings in Middle English. One argument is that, although Norse- and English-speakers were somewhat comprehensible to each other due to similar morphology, the Norse-speakers' inability to reproduce the ending sounds of English words influenced Middle English's loss of inflectional endings.\n\nImportant texts for the reconstruction of the evolution of Middle English out of Old English are the ''[[Peterborough Chronicle]]'', which continued to be compiled up to 1154; the ''[[Ormulum]]'', a biblical commentary probably composed in [[Lincolnshire]] in the second half of the 12th century, incorporating a unique phonetic spelling system; and the ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'' and the [[Katherine Group]], religious texts written for [[anchoress]]es, apparently in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in the early 13th century.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Burchfield |first=Robert W. |chapter=Ormulum |editor-first=Joseph R. |editor-last=Strayer |title=Dictionary of the Middle Ages |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=1987 |volume=9 |page=280 |isbn=978-0-684-18275-9 }}, p. 280</ref> The language found in the last two works is sometimes called the [[AB language]].\n\nMore literary sources of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries include ''[[Layamon's Brut|Lawman's Brut]]'' and ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]''.\n\nSome scholars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hcmc.uvic.ca/makingEME/about.html|title=Making Early Middle English: About the Conference|website=hcmc.uvic.ca}}</ref> have defined \"Early Middle English\" as encompassing English texts up to 1350. This longer time frame would extend the corpus to include many Middle English Romances (especially those of the ''[[Auchinleck manuscript]]'' ca. 1330).\n\n===14th century===\nFrom around the early 14th century, there was significant migration into [[London]], particularly from the counties of the [[East Midlands]], and a new [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] London dialect began to develop, based chiefly on the speech of the East Midlands, but also influenced by that of other regions.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite encyclopedia |author= Wright, L. |title=About the evolution of Standard English |encyclopedia= Studies in English Language and Literature |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2012 |page=99ff |isbn=978-1138006935}}</ref> The writing of this period, however, continues to reflect a variety of regional forms of English. The ''[[Ayenbite of Inwyt]]'', a translation of a French confessional prose work, completed in 1340, is written in a [[Kentish dialect]]. The best known writer of Middle English, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], wrote in the second half of the 14th century in the emerging London dialect, although he also portrays some of his characters as speaking in northern dialects, as in the \"[[Reeve's Tale]]\".\n\nIn the English-speaking areas of lowland [[Scotland]], an independent standard was developing, based on the [[Northumbrian dialect]]. This would develop into what came to be known as the [[Scots language]].\n\n{{anchor|Chancery Standard}}\n\n===Late Middle English===\nThe '''Chancery Standard''' of written English emerged {{circa}} 1430 in official documents that, since the Norman Conquest, had normally been written in French.<sup>[[Middle English#cite note-Wright-16|[16]]]</sup> Like Chaucer's work, this new standard was based on the East-Midlands-influenced speech of London. Clerks using this standard were usually familiar with [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]], influencing the forms they chose. The Chancery Standard, which was adopted slowly, was used in England by bureaucrats for most official purposes, excluding those of the Church and legalities, which used Latin and [[Law French]] (and some Latin), respectively.<sup>[[Middle English#cite note-Nevalainen2008-17|[17]]]</sup>\n\nThe Chancery Standard's influence on later forms of written English is disputed, but it did undoubtedly provide the core around which [[Early Modern English]] formed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Early Modern English emerged with the help of [[William Caxton]]'s printing press, developed during the 1470s. The press stabilized English through a push towards standardization, led by Chancery Standard enthusiast and writer [[Richard Pynson]].<sup>[[Middle English#cite note-18|[18]]]</sup> Early Modern English began in the 1540s after the printing and wide distribution of the [[English Bible]] and [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]], which made the new standard of English publicly recognizable, and lasted until about 1650.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Middle English phonology}}\nThe main changes between the [[Old English phonology|Old English sound system]] and [[Middle English phonology|that of Middle English]] include:\n*Emergence of the voiced [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/v/, /\u00f0/, /z/}} as separate [[phoneme]]s, rather than mere [[allophone]]s of the corresponding [[voiceless]] fricatives.\n*Reduction of the Old English [[diphthong]]s to monophthongs, and the emergence of new diphthongs due to vowel breaking in certain positions, change of Old English post-vocalic {{IPA|/j/, /w/}} (sometimes resulting from the {{IPA|[\u0263]}} allophone of {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) to offglides, and borrowing from French.\n*Merging of Old English {{IPA|/\u00e6/ and /\u0251/}} into a single vowel {{IPA|/a/}}.\n*Raising of the long vowel {{IPA|/\u00e6\u02d0/}} to {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}}, and (in the south) raising and rounding of {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} to {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}.\n*Unrounding of the front [[rounded vowel]]s in most dialects.\n*Lengthening of vowels in [[open syllable]]s (and in certain other positions). The resultant long vowels (and other pre-existing long vowels) subsequently underwent changes of quality in the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which began during the later Middle English period.\n*Loss of [[gemination]] (double consonants came to be pronounced as single ones).\n*Loss of weak final vowels ([[schwa]], written {{angle bracket|e}}). By [[Chaucer]]'s time this vowel was silent in normal speech, although it was normally pronounced in verse as the [[meter (verse)|meter]] required (much as occurs in modern [[French language|French]]). Also, non-final unstressed {{angle bracket|e}} was dropped when adjacent to only a single consonant on either side if there was another short {{angbr|e}} in an adjoining syllable. Thus, ''every'' began to be pronounced as \"evry\", and ''palmeres'' as \"palmers\".\n\nThe combination of the last three processes listed above led to the spelling conventions associated with [[silent e|silent {{vr|e}}]] and [[double letter|doubled consonants]] (see under [[#Orthography|Orthography]], below).\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\nMiddle English retains only two distinct noun-ending patterns from the more complex system of [[Old English grammar#Nouns|inflection in Old English]]. The Early Middle English nouns ''engel'' (\"angel\") and ''name'' (\"name\") demonstrate the two patterns:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Strong (engel)\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Weak (name)\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n!Nominative\n| rowspan=\"2\" |engel\n| rowspan=\"2\" |engles\n!Nominative\n| rowspan=\"2\" |name\n| rowspan=\"2\" |namen\n|-\n!Accusative\n!Accusative\n|-\n!Dative\n|engle\n|engle(n)/englem\n!Dative\n| rowspan=\"2\" |namen\n|namen/namem\n|-\n!Genitive\n|engles<ref>cf.

'Ancrene Wisse' (The ''Anchoresses<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' Guide)</ref>\n!Genitive\n|namen(e)\n|}\n\nSome nouns of the ''engel'' type have an ''-e'' in the nominative/accusative singular, like the weak declension, but otherwise strong endings. Often these are the same nouns that had an ''-e'' in the nominative/accusative singular of Old English (they, in turn, were inherited from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''ja''-stem and ''i''-stem nouns.)\n\nThe distinct dative case was lost in early Middle English. The genitive survived, however, but by the end of the Middle English period, only the strong ''-'s'' ending (variously spelt) was in use.<ref>Fischer, O., van Kemenade, A., Koopman, W., van der Wurff, W., ''The Syntax of Early English'', CUP 2000, p. 72.</ref> Some formerly feminine nouns, as well as some weak nouns, continued to make their genitive forms with -e or no ending (e.g. ''fole hoves'', horses' hoves), and nouns of relationship ending in -er frequently have no genitive ending (e.g. ''fader bone'', \"father's bane\").<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=23}}</ref>\n\nThe strong ''-(e)s'' plural form has survived into Modern English. The weak ''-(e)n'' form is now rare and used only in ''oxen'' and, as part of a [[double plural]], in ''children'' and ''brethren''. Some dialects still have forms such as ''eyen'' (for ''eyes''), ''shoon'' (for ''shoes''), ''hosen'' (for ''hose(s)''), ''kine'' (for ''cows''), and ''been'' (for ''bees'').\n\n[[Grammatical gender]] survived to a limited extent in early Middle English,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=23}}</ref>  before being replaced by natural gender in the course of the Middle English period. Grammatical gender was indicated by agreement of articles and pronouns, i.e. \u00feo ule (\"the-feminine owl\") or using the pronoun ''he'' to refer to masculine nouns such as ''helm'' (\"helmet\"), or phrases such as ''scaft st\u00e6rcne'' (strong shaft) with the masculine accusative adjective ending ''-ne''.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=38}}</ref>\n\n===Adjectives===\nSingle syllable adjectives add -e when modifying a noun in the plural and when used after the definite article (''\u00fee''), after a demonstrative (''\u00feis'', ''\u00feat''), after a possessive pronoun (e.g. ''hir'', ''our''), or with a name or in a form of address. This derives from the Old English \"weak\" declension of adjectives.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |pages=27\u201328}}</ref> This inflexion continued to be used in writing even after final -e had ceased to be pronounced.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |pages=28}}</ref> In earlier texts, multi-syllable adjectives also receive a final -e in these situations, but this occurs less regularly in later Middle English texts. Otherwise adjectives have no ending, and adjectives already ending in -e etymologically receive no ending as well.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=28}}</ref>\n\nEarlier texts sometimes inflect adjectives for case as well. [[Layamon's Brut]] inflects adjectives for the masculine accusative, genitive, and dative, the feminine dative, and the plural genitive.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |pages=28\u201329}}</ref> [[The Owl and the Nightingale]] adds a final -e to all adjectives not in the nominative, here only inflecting adjectives in the weak declension (as described above).<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=29}}</ref>\n\nComparatives and superlatives are usually formed by adding ''-er'' and ''-est''. Adjectives with long vowels sometimes shorten these vowels in the comparative and superlative, e.g. ''greet'' (great) ''gretter'' (greater).<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=29}}</ref> Adjectives ending in ''-ly'' or ''-lich'' form comparatives either with ''-lier'', ''-liest'' or ''-loker'', ''-lokest''.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=29}}</ref> A few adjectives also display [[Germanic umlaut]] in their comparatives and superlatives, such as ''long'', ''lenger''.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=29}}</ref> Other irregular forms are mostly the same as in modern English.<ref> {{cite book|last1=Burrow |first1=J. A. |last2=Turville-Petre |first2=Thorlac |title=A Book of Middle English |edition=3 |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |page=29}}</ref>\n\n===Pronouns===\nMiddle English [[personal pronoun]]s were mostly developed from [[Old English pronouns|those of Old English]], with the exception of the third-person plural, a borrowing from [[Old Norse]] (the original Old English form clashed with the third person singular and was eventually dropped). Also, the nominative form of the feminine third-person singular was replaced by a form of the [[demonstrative]] that developed into ''sche'' (modern ''she''), but the alternative ''heyr'' remained in some areas for a long time.\n\nAs with nouns, there was some inflectional simplification (the distinct Old English [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] forms were lost), but pronouns, unlike nouns, retained distinct nominative and accusative forms. Third-person pronouns also retained a distinction between accusative and dative forms, but that was gradually lost: the masculine ''hine'' was replaced by ''him'' south of the Thames by the early 14th century, and the neuter dative ''him'' was ousted by ''it'' in most dialects by the 15th.<ref>Fulk, R.D., ''An Introduction to Middle English'', Broadview Press, 2012, p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe following table shows some of the various Middle English pronouns, together with their modern (in quotation marks) and (sometimes) Old English equivalents.

The past-tense forms, without their personal endings, also serve as past participles with past-participle prefixes derived from Old English: ''i-'', ''y-'' and sometimes ''bi-''.\n\n[[Germanic strong verb|Strong verbs]], by contrast, form their past tense by changing their stem vowel (''binden'' becomes ''bound'', a process called [[apophony]]), as in Modern English.\n\n==Orthography==\n\nWith the discontinuation of the [[Late West Saxon]] standard used for the [[Old English orthography|writing of Old English]] in the period prior to the Norman Conquest, Middle English came to be written in a wide variety of scribal forms, reflecting different regional dialects and orthographic conventions. Later in the Middle English period, however, and particularly with the development of the [[#Chancery Standard|Chancery Standard]] in the 15th century, orthography became relatively standardised in a form based on the East Midlands-influenced speech of London. Spelling at the time was mostly quite [[regular spelling|regular]] (there was a fairly consistent correspondence between letters and sounds). The irregularity of [[English orthography|present-day English orthography]] is largely due to [[Phonological history of English|pronunciation changes]] that have taken place over the [[Early Modern English]] and [[Modern English]] eras.\n\nMiddle English generally did not have [[silent letter]]s. For example, ''knight'' was pronounced {{IPA-enm|\u02c8kni\u00e7t|}} (with both the {{vr|k}} and the {{vr|gh}} pronounced, the latter sounding as the {{angle bracket|ch}} in German ''Knecht''). The major exception was the [[silent e|silent {{angbr|e}}]] \u2013 originally pronounced, but lost in normal speech by Chaucer's time. This letter, however, came to indicate a lengthened \u2013 and later also modified \u2013 pronunciation of a preceding vowel. For example, in ''name'', originally pronounced as two syllables, the /a/ in the first syllable (originally an open syllable) lengthened, the final weak vowel was later dropped, and the remaining long vowel was modified in the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (for these sound changes, see under [[#Phonology|Phonology]], above). The final {{angbr|e}}, now silent, thus became the indicator of the longer and changed pronunciation of {{angbr|a}}. In fact vowels could have this lengthened and modified pronunciation in various positions, particularly before a single consonant letter and another vowel, or before certain pairs of consonants.\n\nA related convention involved the doubling of consonant letters to show that the preceding vowel was not to be lengthened. In some cases the double consonant represented a sound that was (or had previously been) [[gemination|geminated]], i.e. had genuinely been \"doubled\" (and would thus have regularly blocked the lengthening of the preceding vowel). In other cases, by analogy, the consonant was written double merely to indicate the lack of lengthening.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe basic [[Old English Latin alphabet]] had consisted of 20 standard letters (there was not yet a distinct ''j'', ''v'' or ''w'', and Old English scribes did not generally use ''k'', ''q'' or ''z'') plus four additional letters: [[ash (letter)|ash]] {{angbr|\u00e6}}, [[eth]] {{angbr|\u00f0}}, [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] {{angbr|\u00fe}} and [[wynn]] {{angbr|\u01bf}}.\n\nAsh was no longer required in Middle English, as the Old English vowel /\u00e6/ that it represented had [[#Phonology|merged into /a/]]. The symbol nonetheless came to be used as a [[typographic ligature|ligature]] for the digraph {{angle bracket|ae}} in many words of Greek or Latin origin, as did [[\u0153]] for {{angbr|oe}}.\n\nEth and thorn both represented {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} or its [[allophone]] {{IPAslink|\u00f0}} in Old English. Eth fell out of use during the 13th century and was replaced by thorn. Thorn mostly fell out of use during the 14th century, and was replaced by [[th (digraph)|{{angbr|th}}]]. (Anachronistic usage of the scribal abbreviation [[File:EME ye.svg|10px]] (\"\u00fee\", i.e. \"the\") has led to the modern mispronunciation of ''thorn'' as {{angle bracket|[[y]]}} in this context; see ''[[ye olde]]''.<ref>''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'', [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ye%5B2%5D ye<nowiki>[2]</nowiki>] retrieved February 1, 2009</ref>)\n\nWynn, which represented the phoneme {{IPA|/w/}}, was replaced by {{angle bracket|[[w]]}} during the 13th century. Due to its similarity to the letter {{angle bracket|p}}, it is mostly represented by {{angle bracket|w}} in modern editions of Old and Middle English texts even when the manuscript has wynn.\n\nUnder Norman influence, the continental [[Carolingian minuscule]] replaced the [[insular script]] that had been used for Old English. However, because of the significant difference in appearance between the old [[insular G|insular ''g'']] and the [[Carolingian G|Carolingian ''g'']] (modern g), the former continued in use as a separate letter, known as [[yogh]], written {{angbr|\u021d}}. This was adopted for use to represent a variety of sounds: {{IPA|[\u0263], [j], [d\u0292], [x], [\u00e7]}}, while the Carolingian ''g'' was normally used for [g]. Instances of yogh were eventually replaced by {{angbr|j}} or {{angbr|y}}, and by {{angbr|gh}} in words like ''night'' and ''laugh''. In [[Middle Scots]] yogh became indistinguishable from cursive ''z'', and printers tended to use {{angle bracket|z}} when ''yogh'' was not available in their fonts; this led to new spellings (often giving rise to new pronunciations), as in [[Mackenzie (surname)|''McKenzie'']], where the {{angbr|z}} replaced a yogh which had the pronunciation {{IPA|/j/}}.\n\nUnder continental influence, the letters {{vr|k}}, {{vr|q}} and {{vr|z}}, which had not normally been used by Old English scribes, came to be commonly used in the writing of Middle English. Also the newer Latin letter {{vr|w}} was introduced (replacing wynn). The distinct letter forms {{vrl|v}} and {{vrl|u}} came into use, but were still used interchangeably; the same applies to {{vrl|j}} and {{vrl|i}}.<ref name=\"Salmon\">Salmon, V., (in) Lass, R. (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'', Vol. III, CUP 2000, p. 39.</ref> (For example, spellings such as ''wijf'' and ''paradijs'' for ''wife'' and ''paradise'' can be found in Middle English.)\n\nThe consonantal {{vr|j}}/{{vr|i}} was sometimes used to transliterate the Hebrew letter [[yodh]], representing the [[palatal approximant]] sound /j/ (and transliterated in Greek by [[iota]] and in Latin by {{vr|i}}); words like ''Jerusalem'', ''Joseph'', etc. would have originally followed the Latin pronunciation beginning with /j/, that is, the sound of {{vr|y}} in ''yes''. In some words, however, notably from [[Old French]], {{vr|j}}/{{vr|i}} was used for the [[affricate consonant]] {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}, as in ''joie'' (modern \"joy\"), used in [[Wycliffe's Bible]].<ref name=\"j-oed\">\"J\", ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989)</ref><ref>\"J\" and \"jay\", ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1993)</ref> This was similar to the [[gemination|geminate sound]] {{IPA|[dd\u0292]}}, which had been represented as {{vr|cg}} in Old English. By the time of Modern English, the sound came to be written as {{vr|j}}/{{vr|i}} at the start of words (like ''joy''), and usually as {{vr|dg}} elsewhere (as in ''bridge''). It could also be written, mainly in French loanwords, as {{vr|g}}, with the adoption of the [[hard and soft G|soft G]] convention (''age'', ''page'', etc.)\n\n===Other symbols===\nMany [[scribal abbreviation]]s were also used. It was common for the [[Lollardy|Lollards]] to abbreviate the name of Jesus (as in Latin manuscripts) to ''[[Christogram|ihc]]''. The letters {{vr|n}} and {{vr|m}} were often omitted and indicated by a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] above an adjacent letter, so for example ''in'' could be written as ''\u012b''. A thorn with a superscript {{vr|t}} or {{vr|e}} could be used for ''that'' and ''the''; the thorn here resembled a {{vr|Y}}, giving rise to the ''ye'' of \"[[Ye Olde]]\". Various forms of the [[ampersand]] replaced the word ''and''.\n\nNumbers were still always written using [[Roman numerals]], except for some rare occurrences of [[Arabic numerals]] during the 15th century.\n\n===Letter-to-sound correspondences===\nAlthough Middle English spelling was never fully standardised, the following table shows the pronunciations most usually represented by particular letters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s towards the end of the Middle English period, using the notation given in the article on [[Middle English phonology]].<ref>For certain details, see \"Chancery Standard spelling\" in Upward, C., Davidson, G., ''The History of English Spelling'', Wiley 2011.</ref> As explained above, single vowel letters had alternative pronunciations depending on whether they were in a position where their sounds had been subject to lengthening.
