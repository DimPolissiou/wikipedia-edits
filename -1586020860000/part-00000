[[United States Navy]] Seabees of NMCB133 were some of the first on the scene as they utilized their earth moving equipment to clear roadways and timber from the crash site approach. The Seabees used backhoes to crack open the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders.

For his work on magnets, Gilbert became known as \"The Father of Magnetism.\" His book ''De Magnete'' quickly became the standard work throughout Europe on electrical and magnetic phenomena, and made a clear distinction between magnetism and what was then called the \"amber effect\" (static electricity).\n\n[[Image:Guericke-electricaldevice.PNG|thumb|200px|German [[physicist]] [[Otto von Guericke]] beside his electrical generator while conducting experiment.]]\nIn 1663, German [[physicist]] [[Otto von Guericke]] created the first electrostatic generator, which produced static electricity by applying friction. The generator was made of a large [[sulfur]] ball inside a glass globe, mounted on a shaft. The ball was rotated by means of a crank and a [[static electricity|static electric]] [[Electric spark|spark]] was produced when a pad was rubbed against the ball as it rotated. The globe could be removed and used as an electrical source for experiments with electricity.  Von Guericke used his generator to show that like charges repelled each other.\n\n==The 18th century and birth of electrochemistry==\n[[File:Hauksbee Generator.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Francis Hauksbee]]'s gas-discharge lamp]]\nIn 1709, [[Francis Hauksbee]] at the [[Royal Society]] in London discovered that by putting a small amount of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the glass of Von Guericke's generator and evacuating the air from it, it would glow whenever the ball built up a charge and his hand was touching the globe. He had created the first [[Gas-discharge lamp#History|gas-discharge lamp]].\n\nBetween 1729 and 1736, two English scientists, [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]] and [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|Jean Desaguliers]], performed a series of experiments which showed that a [[cork (material)|cork]] or other object as far away as 800 or 900 feet (245\u2013275&nbsp;m) could be electrified by connecting it via a charged glass tube to materials such as metal wires or hempen string. They found that other materials, such as [[silk]], would not convey the effect.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, [[France|French]] [[chemist]] [[C. F. du Fay|Charles Fran\u00e7ois de Cisternay Du Fay]] had discovered two forms of static electricity, and that like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract. Du Fay announced that electricity consisted of two fluids: ''vitreous'' (from the [[latin language|Latin]] for \"glass\"), or positive, electricity; and ''resinous'', or negative, electricity. This was the \"two-fluid theory\" of electricity, which was opposed by [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's]] \"one-fluid theory\" later in the century.\n\nIn 1745, [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]] developed a theory of electrical attraction and repulsion that supposed the existence of a continuous flow of electrical matter between charged bodies. Nollet's theory at first gained wide acceptance, but met resistance in 1752 with the translation of Franklin's ''[[Experiments and Observations on Electricity]]'' into French. Franklin and Nollet debated the nature of electricity, with Franklin supporting action at a distance and two qualitatively opposing types of electricity, and Nollet advocating mechanical action and a single type of electrical fluid. Franklin's argument eventually won and Nollet's theory was abandoned.\n\nIn 1748, Nollet invented one of the first [[electrometer]]s, the [[electroscope]], which showed electric charge using [[electrostatic attraction]] and repulsion. Nollet is reputed to be the first to apply the name \"[[Leyden jar]]\" to the first device for storing electricity. Nollet's invention was replaced by [[Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure]]'s electrometer in 1766.\n\nBy the 1740s, [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] had conducted several experiments to determine the speed of electricity. The general belief at the time was that electricity was faster than sound, but no accurate test had been devised to measure the velocity of a current. Watson, in the fields north of London, laid out a line of wire supported by dry sticks and silk which ran for 12,276 feet (3.7&nbsp;km). Even at this length, the velocity of electricity seemed instantaneous. [[Electrical resistance|Resistance]] in the wire was also noticed but apparently not fully understood, as Watson related that \"we observed again, that although the electrical compositions were very severe to those who held the wires, the report of the Explosion at the prime Conductor was little, in comparison of that which is heard when the Circuit is short.\" Watson eventually decided not to pursue his electrical experiments, concentrating instead upon his medical career.\n\nBy the 1750s, as the study of electricity became popular, efficient ways of producing electricity were sought. The generator developed by [[Jesse Ramsden]] was among the first electrostatic generators invented. Electricity produced by such generators was used to treat paralysis, muscle spasms, and to control heart rates. Other medical uses of electricity included filling the body with electricity, drawing sparks from the body, and applying sparks from the generator to the body.\n\n[[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] developed the law of electrostatic attraction in 1781 as an outgrowth of his attempt to investigate the law of electrical repulsions as stated by [[Joseph Priestley]] in England. To this end, he invented a sensitive apparatus to measure the electrical forces involved in Priestley's law. He also established the [[inverse square law]] of attraction and repulsion magnetic poles, which became the basis for the mathematical theory of magnetic forces developed by [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]]. Coulomb wrote seven important works on electricity and magnetism which he submitted to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences between 1785 and 1791, in which he reported having developed a theory of attraction and repulsion between charged bodies, and went on to search for perfect [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] and [[dielectrics]]. He suggested that there was no perfect dielectric, proposing that every substance has a limit, above which it will conduct electricity.  The [[SI]] unit of charge is called a [[coulomb]] in his honour.\n\nIn 1789, [[Franz Aepinus]] developed a device with the properties of a \"condenser\" (now known as a [[capacitor]].) The Aepinus condenser was the first capacitor developed after the Leyden jar, and was used to demonstrate conduction and [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]]. The device was constructed so that the space between two plates could be adjusted, and the glass dielectric separating the two plates could be removed or replaced with other materials.\n[[File:Galvani frog legs experiment setup.png|thumb|left|200px|Late 1780s diagram of Galvani's experiment on frog legs.]]\nDespite the gain in knowledge of electrical properties and the building of generators, it wasn't until the late 18th century that Italian [[physician]] and [[anatomist]] [[Luigi Galvani]] marked the birth of electrochemistry by establishing a bridge between muscular contractions and electricity with his 1791 essay ''De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius'' (Commentary on the Effect of Electricity on Muscular Motion), where he proposed a \"nerveo-electrical substance\" in life forms.\n\nIn his essay, Galvani concluded that animal tissue contained a before-unknown innate, vital force, which he termed \"animal electricity,\" which activated [[muscle]] when placed between two metal probes. He believed that this was evidence of a new form of electricity, separate from the \"natural\" form that is produced by lightning and  the \"artificial\" form that is produced by friction (static electricity). He considered the brain to be the most important organ for the secretion of this \"electric fluid\" and that the nerves conducted the fluid to the muscles.  He believed the tissues acted similarly to the outer and inner surfaces of Leyden jars. The flow of this electric fluid provided a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] to the muscle fibres.\n[[File:Volta-and-napoleon.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Italian physicist [[Alessandro Volta]] showing his ''\"[[Battery (electricity)|battery]]\"'' to French [[emperor]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the early 19th century.]]\nGalvani's scientific colleagues generally accepted his views, but [[Alessandro Volta]], the outstanding professor of physics at the [[University of Pavia]], was not convinced by the analogy between muscles and Leyden jars. Deciding that the frogs' legs used in Galvani's experiments served only as an electroscope, he held that the contact of dissimilar metals was the true source of stimulation.  He referred to the electricity so generated as \"metallic electricity\" and decided that the muscle, by contracting when touched by metal, resembled the action of an electroscope. Furthermore, Volta claimed that if two dissimilar metals in contact with each other also touched a muscle, agitation would also occur and increase with the dissimilarity of the metals. Galvani refuted this by obtaining muscular action using two pieces of similar metal.  Volta's name was later used for the unit of electrical potential, the [[volt]].\n\n==Rise of electrochemistry as branch of chemistry==\n[[File:Ritter Wasserelektrolyse.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Scheme of Ritter's apparatus to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis]]\nIn 1800, English chemists [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] succeeded in separating water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] by [[electrolysis]]. Soon thereafter, Ritter discovered the process of [[electroplating]]. He also observed that the amount of metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the [[electrodes]]. By 1801 Ritter had observed thermoelectric currents, which anticipated the discovery of [[thermoelectricity]] by [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]].\n\nIn 1802, [[William Cruickshank (chemist)|William Cruickshank]] designed the first electric battery capable of mass production. Like Volta, Cruickshank arranged square copper plates, which he soldered at their ends, together with plates of zinc of equal size. These plates were placed into a long rectangular wooden box which was sealed with cement. Grooves inside the box held the metal plates in position. The box was then filled with an electrolyte of [[brine]], or watered down acid. This flooded design had the advantage of not drying out with use and provided more energy than Volta's arrangement, which used brine-soaked papers between the plates.\n\nIn the quest for a better production of [[platinum]] metals, two scientists, [[William Hyde Wollaston]] and [[Smithson Tennant]], worked together to design an efficient electrochemical technique to refine or purify platinum. Tennant ended up discovering the elements [[iridium]] and [[osmium]]. Wollaston's effort, in turn, led him to the discovery of the metals [[palladium]] in 1803 and [[rhodium]] in 1804.\n\nWollaston made improvements to the galvanic battery (named after Galvani) in the 1810s. In Wollaston's battery, the wooden box was replaced with an earthenware vessel, and a copper plate was bent into a U-shape, with a single plate of zinc placed in the center of the bent copper. The zinc plate was prevented from making contact with the copper by dowels (pieces) of cork or wood. In his single cell design, the U-shaped copper plate was welded to a horizontal handle for lifting the copper and zinc plates out of the electrolyte when the battery was not in use.\n\nIn 1809, [[Samuel Thomas von Soemmering]] developed the first [[telegraph]]. He used a device with 26 wires (1 wire for each letter of the [[German alphabet]]) terminating in a container of acid. At the sending station, a key, which completed a circuit with a battery, was connected as required to each of the line wires. The passage of current caused the acid to decompose chemically, and the message was read by observing at which of the terminals the bubbles of gas appeared. This is how he was able to send messages, one letter at a time.\n\n[[Humphry Davy]]'s work with electrolysis led to conclusion that the production of electricity in simple [[electrolytic cell]]s resulted from chemical reactions between the electrolyte and the metals, and occurred between substances of opposite charge. He reasoned that the interactions of electric currents with chemicals offered the most likely means of [[decomposition|decomposing]] all substances to their basic elements. These views were explained in 1806 in his lecture ''On Some Chemical Agencies of Electricity'', for which he received the [[Napoleon Prize]] from the [[Institut de France]] in 1807 (despite the fact that England and France were at war at the time). This work led directly to the isolation of sodium and potassium from their common compounds and of the [[alkaline earth metals]] from theirs in 1808.\n\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]]'s discovery of the magnetic effect of electric currents in 1820 was immediately recognised as an important advance, although he left further work on [[electromagnetism]] to others. [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] quickly repeated \u00d8rsted's experiment, and formulated them mathematically (which became [[Amp\u00e8re's law]]) . \u00d8rsted also discovered that not only is a magnetic needle deflected by the electric current, but that the live electric wire is also deflected in a magnetic field, thus laying the foundation for the construction of an electric motor.  \u00d8rsted's discovery of [[piperine]], one of the pungent components of pepper, was an important contribution to chemistry, as was his preparation of [[aluminium]] in 1825.\n\nDuring the 1820s, [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]] developed the [[Deflagrator]], a form of voltaic battery having large plates used for producing rapid and powerful [[combustion]]. A modified form of this apparatus was employed in 1823 in volatilising and fusing [[carbon]]. It was with these batteries that the first use of voltaic electricity for blasting under water was made in 1831.\n\nIn 1821, the [[Estonia]]n-German physicist, Thomas Johann Seebeck, demonstrated the electrical potential in the juncture points of two dissimilar metals when there is a temperature difference between the joints. He joined a copper wire with a [[bismuth]] wire to form a loop or circuit. Two junctions were formed by connecting the ends of the wires to each other. He then accidentally discovered that if he heated one junction to a high temperature, and the other junction remained at room temperature, a magnetic field was observed around the circuit.\n\nHe did not recognise that an electric current was being generated when heat was applied to a bi-metal junction. He used the term \"thermomagnetic currents\" or \"thermomagnetism\" to express his discovery. Over the following two years, he reported on his continuing observations to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], where he described his observation as \"the magnetic polarization of metals and ores produced by a temperature difference.\" This [[Seebeck effect]] became the basis of the [[thermocouple]], which is still considered the most accurate measurement of temperature today.  The converse [[Peltier effect]] was seen over a decade later when a current was run through a circuit with two dissimilar metals, resulting in a temperature difference between the metals.\n\nIn 1827 German scientist [[Georg Ohm]] expressed his [[Ohm's law|law]] in his famous book ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' (The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically) in which he gave his complete theory of electricity.\n\nIn 1829 [[Antoine-C\u00e9sar Becquerel]] developed the \"constant current\" cell, forerunner of the well-known [[electrochemical cell|Daniell cell]]. When this acid-alkali cell was monitored by a [[galvanometer]], current was found to be constant for an hour, the first instance of \"constant current\". He applied the results of his study of thermoelectricity to the construction of an electric thermometer, and measured the temperatures of the interior of animals, of the soil at different depths, and of the atmosphere at different heights. He helped validate [[Faraday's law of electrolysis|Faraday's law]]s and conducted extensive investigations on the [[electroplating]] of metals with applications for metal finishing and [[metallurgy]]. [[Solar cell]] technology dates to 1839 when Becquerel observed that shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current.\n\n[[Michael Faraday]] began, in 1832, what promised to be a rather tedious attempt to prove that all electricities had precisely the same properties and caused precisely the same effects. The key effect was electrochemical decomposition. Voltaic and electromagnetic electricity posed no problems, but static electricity did. As Faraday delved deeper into the problem, he made two startling discoveries. First, electrical force did not, as had long been supposed, act at a distance upon molecules to cause them to dissociate. It was the passage of electricity through a conducting liquid medium that caused the molecules to dissociate, even when the electricity merely discharged into the air and did not pass through a \"pole\" or \"center of action\" in a voltaic cell. Second, the amount of the decomposition was found to be related directly to the amount of electricity passing through the solution.\n\nThese findings led Faraday to a new theory of electrochemistry. The electric force, he argued, threw the molecules of a solution into a state of tension. When the force was strong enough to distort the [[Force field (physics)|forces]] that held the molecules together so as to permit the interaction with neighbouring particles, the tension was relieved by the migration of particles along the lines of tension, the different parts of atoms migrating in opposite directions. The amount of electricity that passed, then, was clearly related to the chemical affinities of the substances in solution. These experiments led directly to Faraday's two laws of electrochemistry which state:\n*The amount of a substance deposited on each electrode of an electrolytic cell is directly proportional to the amount of electricity passing through the cell.\n*The quantities of different elements deposited by a given amount of electricity are in the ratio of their chemical [[equivalent weight]]s.\n\n[[William Sturgeon]] built an electric motor in 1832 and invented the [[commutator]], a ring of metal-bristled brushes which allow the spinning [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] to maintain contact with the electric current and changed the [[alternating current]] to a pulsating [[direct current]]. He also improved the voltaic battery and worked on the theory of thermoelectricity.\n\n[[Hippolyte Pixii]], a French instrument maker, constructed the first [[Electrical generator|dynamo]] in 1832 and later built a direct current dynamo using the commutator. This was the first practical mechanical generator of electric current that used concepts demonstrated by Faraday.\n\n[[File:Daniell-element---Elemento-Daniell.jpg|thumb|200px|Daniell cell]]\n[[John Frederic Daniell|John Daniell]] began experiments in 1835 in an attempt to improve the voltaic battery with its problems of being unsteady and a weak source of electric current. His experiments soon led to remarkable results. In 1836, he invented a primary cell in which hydrogen was eliminated in the generation of the electricity. Daniell had solved the problem of [[Polarization (electrostatics)|polarization]]. In his laboratory he had learned to alloy the [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]ated zinc of Sturgeon with mercury. His version was the first of the two-fluid class battery and the first battery that produced a constant reliable source of electric current over a long period of time.\n\n[[William Robert Grove|William Grove]] produced the first [[fuel cell]] in 1839. He based his experiment on the fact that sending an electric current through water splits the water into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen. So, Grove tried reversing the reaction\u2014combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water. Eventually the term ''fuel cell'' was coined in 1889 by [[Ludwig Mond]] and [[Charles Langer]], who attempted to build the first practical device using air and industrial [[coal gas]]. He also introduced a powerful battery at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1839. Grove's first cell consisted of zinc in diluted sulfuric acid and platinum in concentrated [[nitric acid]], separated by a porous pot. The cell was able to generate about 12 [[ampere]]s of current at about 1.8 volts. This cell had nearly double the voltage of the first Daniell cell. Grove's nitric acid cell was the favourite battery of the early American telegraph (1840\u20131860), because it offered strong current output.\n\nAs telegraph traffic increased, it was found that the Grove cell discharged poisonous [[nitrogen dioxide]] gas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} As telegraphs became more complex, the need for a constant voltage became critical and the Grove device was limited (as the cell discharged, nitric acid was depleted and voltage was reduced). By the time of the [[American Civil War]], Grove's battery had been replaced by the Daniell battery. In 1841 [[Robert Bunsen]] replaced the expensive platinum electrode used in Grove's battery with a carbon electrode. This led to large scale use of the \"Bunsen battery\" in the production of [[Arc lamp|arc-lighting]] and in electroplating.\n\n[[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] developed, in 1846, the [[electrodynamometer]], in which a current causes a coil suspended within another coil to turn when a current is passed through both. In 1852, Weber defined the absolute unit of electrical resistance (which was named the [[ohm]] after Georg Ohm).  Weber's name is now used as a unit name to describe [[magnetic flux]], the [[weber (unit)|weber]].\n\nGerman physicist [[Johann Hittorf]] concluded that ''ion movement'' caused electric current. In 1853 Hittorf noticed that some ions traveled more rapidly than others. This observation led to the concept of transport number, the rate at which particular ions carried the electric current. Hittorf measured the changes in the concentration of electrolysed solutions, computed from these the transport numbers (relative carrying capacities) of many ions, and, in 1869, published his findings governing the migration of ions.\n\n[[File:Pile Leclanch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|300px|Leclanch\u00e9 cell]]\nIn 1866, [[Georges Leclanch\u00e9]] patented a new battery system, which was immediately successful. Leclanch\u00e9's original cell was assembled in a porous pot. The positive electrode (the [[cathode]]) consisted of crushed manganese dioxide with a little carbon mixed in. The negative pole ([[Anode#Electrolytic anode|anode]]) was a zinc rod. The cathode was packed into the pot, and a carbon rod was inserted to act as a current collector. The anode and the pot were then immersed in an ammonium chloride solution. The liquid acted as the electrolyte, readily seeping through the porous pot and making contact with the cathode material. Leclanch\u00e9's \"wet\" cell became the forerunner to the world's first widely used battery, the zinc-carbon cell.\n\n==Late 19th century advances and the advent of electrochemical societies==\nIn 1869 [[Z\u00e9nobe Gramme]] devised his first clean direct current dynamo. His generator featured a ring armature wound with many individual coils of wire.\n\n[[Svante August Arrhenius]] published his thesis in 1884, ''Recherches sur la conductibilit\u00e9 galvanique des \u00e9lectrolytes'' (Investigations on the galvanic conductivity of electrolytes). From the results of his experiments, the author concluded that electrolytes, when dissolved in water, become to varying degrees split or dissociated into positive and negative ions. The degree to which this dissociation occurred depended above all on the nature of the substance and its concentration in the solution, being more developed the greater the dilution. The ions were supposed to be the carriers of not only the electric current, as in electrolysis, but also of the chemical activity. The relation between the actual number of ions and their number at great dilution (when all the molecules were dissociated) gave a quantity of special interest (\"activity constant\").\n\n[[File:Hall-heroult-kk-2008-12-31.png|thumb|250px|left|A Hall-H\u00e9roult industrial cell.]]\nThe race for the commercially viable production of [[aluminium]] was won in 1886 by [[Paul H\u00e9roult]] and [[Charles M. Hall]]. The problem many researchers had with extracting aluminium was that electrolysis of an aluminium salt dissolved in water yields [[aluminium hydroxide]]. Both Hall and H\u00e9roult avoided this problem by dissolving aluminium oxide in a new solvent\u2014 fused [[cryolite]] ([[Sodium|Na]]<sub>3</sub>Al[[Fluoride|F]]<sub>6</sub>).\n\n[[Wilhelm Ostwald]], 1909 [[Nobel Laureate]], started his experimental work in 1875, with an investigation on the law of mass action of water in relation to the problems of chemical affinity, with special emphasis on electrochemistry and [[chemical kinetics|chemical dynamics]]. In 1894 he gave the first modern definition of a [[catalyst]] and turned his attention to catalytic reactions. Ostwald is especially known for his contributions to the field of electrochemistry, including important studies of the electrical conductivity and electrolytic dissociation of organic acids.\n\n[[Hermann Nernst]] developed the theory of the electromotive force of the voltaic cell in 1888. He developed methods for measuring [[dielectric constant]]s and was the first to show that solvents of high dielectric constants promote the ionization of substances. Nernst's early studies in electrochemistry were inspired by Arrhenius' dissociation theory which first recognised the importance of ions in solution. In 1889, Nernst elucidated the theory of galvanic cells by assuming an \"electrolytic pressure of dissolution,\" which forces ions from electrodes into solution and which was opposed to the osmotic pressure of the dissolved ions. He applied the principles of thermodynamics to the chemical reactions proceeding in a battery. In that same year he showed how the characteristics of the current produced could be used to calculate the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] change in the chemical reaction producing the current. He constructed an equation, known as [[Nernst Equation]], which describes the relation of a battery cell's voltage to its properties.\n\nIn 1898 [[Fritz Haber]] published his textbook, ''Electrochemistry: Grundriss der technischen Elektrochemie auf theoretischer Grundlage'' (The Theoretical Basis of Technical Electrochemistry), which was based on the lectures he gave at [[University of Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe]]. In the preface to his book he expressed his intention to relate chemical research to industrial processes and in the same year he reported the results of his work on electrolytic oxidation and reduction, in which he showed that definite reduction products can result if the voltage at the cathode is kept constant. In 1898 he explained the reduction of [[nitrobenzene]] in stages at the cathode and this became the model for other similar reduction processes.\n\nIn 1909, [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron. He began by measuring the course of charged water droplets in an electrical field. The results suggested that the charge on the droplets is a multiple of the elementary electric charge, but the experiment was not accurate enough to be convincing. He obtained more precise results in 1910 with his famous [[oil-drop experiment]] in which he replaced water (which tended to evaporate too quickly) with oil.\n\n[[Jaroslav Heyrovsk\u00fd]], a Nobel laureate, eliminated the tedious weighing required by previous analytical techniques, which used the differential precipitation of mercury by measuring drop-time. In the previous method, a voltage was applied to a dropping mercury electrode and a reference electrode was immersed in a test solution. After 50 drops of mercury were collected, they were dried and weighed. The applied voltage was varied and the experiment repeated. Measured weight was plotted versus applied voltage to obtain the curve. In 1921, Heyrovsk\u00fd had the idea of measuring the current flowing through the cell instead of just studying drop-time.\n\n[[File:Heyrovsk\u00e9ho polarograf 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Heyrovsk\u00fd's Polarograph]]\nOn February 10, 1922, the \"[[polarograph]]\" was born as Heyrovsk\u00fd recorded the current-voltage curve for a solution of 1 [[Molar concentration|mol/L]] [[NaOH]]. Heyrovsk\u00fd  correctly interpreted the current increase between \u22121.9 and \u22122.0 V as being due to the deposit of Na<sup>+</sup> ions, forming an amalgam. Shortly thereafter, with his Japanese colleague [[Masuzo Shikata]], he constructed the first instrument for the automatic recording of polarographic curves, which became world-famous later as the polarograph.\n\nIn 1923, [[Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] published essentially the same theory about how acids and bases behave using electrochemical basis.\n\nThe [[International Society of Electrochemistry]] (ISE) was founded in 1949, and some years later the first sophisticated [[electrophoretic]] apparatus was developed in 1937 by [[Arne Tiselius]], who was awarded the 1948 Nobel prize for his work in protein [[electrophoresis]]. He developed the \"moving boundary,\" which later would become known as ''zone electrophoresis'', and used it to separate serum proteins in solution. Electrophoresis became widely developed in the 1940s and 1950s when the technique was applied to molecules ranging from the largest proteins to amino acids and even inorganic ions.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s [[quantum electrochemistry]] was developed by [[Revaz Dogonadze]] and his pupils.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|History of electrochemistry}}\n* [[Electrochemistry]]\n* [[History of the battery]]\n* [[Karpen Pile]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|title=Physician-described use of electricity in medicine|work=T.Gale's Electricity, or Ethereal Fire, Considered, 1802|url=http://www.iment.com/maida/familytree/henry/theman/atlocustgrove/medical/electricity/tableofcontents.htm|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}\n* [http://corrosion-doctors.org/History/Introduction.htm Corrosion-Doctors.org]\n*A classic and knowledgeable\u2014but dated\u2014reference on the history of electrochemistry is by 1909 Nobelist in Chemistry, Wilhelm Ostwald: Elektrochemie: Ihre Geschichte und Lehre,   Wilhelm Ostwald, Veit, Leipzig, 1896.

Von Guericke used his generator to show that like charges repelled each other.\n\n==The 18th century and birth of electrochemistry==\n[[File:Hauksbee Generator.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Francis Hauksbee]]'s gas-discharge lamp]]\nIn 1709, [[Francis Hauksbee]] at the [[Royal Society]] in London discovered that by putting a small amount of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the glass of Von Guericke's generator and evacuating the air from it, it would glow whenever the ball built up a charge and his hand was touching the globe. He had created the first [[Gas-discharge lamp#History|gas-discharge lamp]].\n\nBetween 1729 and 1736, two English scientists, [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]] and [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|Jean Desaguliers]], performed a series of experiments which showed that a [[cork (material)|cork]] or other object as far away as 800 or 900 feet (245\u2013275&nbsp;m) could be electrified by connecting it via a charged glass tube to materials such as metal wires or hempen string. They found that other materials, such as [[silk]], would not convey the effect.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, [[France|French]] [[chemist]] [[C. F. du Fay|Charles Fran\u00e7ois de Cisternay Du Fay]] had discovered two forms of static electricity, and that like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract. Du Fay announced that electricity consisted of two fluids: ''vitreous'' (from the [[latin language|Latin]] for \"glass\"), or positive, electricity; and ''resinous'', or negative, electricity. This was the \"two-fluid theory\" of electricity, which was opposed by [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's]] \"one-fluid theory\" later in the century.\n\nIn 1745, [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]] developed a theory of electrical attraction and repulsion that supposed the existence of a continuous flow of electrical matter between charged bodies. Nollet\u2019s theory at first gained wide acceptance, but met resistance in 1752 with the translation of Franklin\u2019s ''[[Experiments and Observations on Electricity]]'' into French. Franklin and Nollet debated the nature of electricity, with Franklin supporting action at a distance and two qualitatively opposing types of electricity, and Nollet advocating mechanical action and a single type of electrical fluid. Franklin's argument eventually won and Nollet\u2019s theory was abandoned.\n\nIn 1748, Nollet invented one of the first [[electrometer]]s, the [[electroscope]], which showed electric charge using [[electrostatic attraction]] and repulsion. Nollet is reputed to be the first to apply the name \"[[Leyden jar]]\" to the first device for storing electricity. Nollet's invention was replaced by [[Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure]]'s electrometer in 1766.\n\nBy the 1740s, [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] had conducted several experiments to determine the speed of electricity. The general belief at the time was that electricity was faster than sound, but no accurate test had been devised to measure the velocity of a current. Watson, in the fields north of London, laid out a line of wire supported by dry sticks and silk which ran for 12,276 feet (3.7&nbsp;km). Even at this length, the velocity of electricity seemed instantaneous. [[Electrical resistance|Resistance]] in the wire was also noticed but apparently not fully understood, as Watson related that \"we observed again, that although the electrical compositions were very severe to those who held the wires, the report of the Explosion at the prime Conductor was little, in comparison of that which is heard when the Circuit is short.\" Watson eventually decided not to pursue his electrical experiments, concentrating instead upon his medical career.\n\nBy the 1750s, as the study of electricity became popular, efficient ways of producing electricity were sought. The generator developed by [[Jesse Ramsden]] was among the first electrostatic generators invented. Electricity produced by such generators was used to treat paralysis, muscle spasms, and to control heart rates. Other medical uses of electricity included filling the body with electricity, drawing sparks from the body, and applying sparks from the generator to the body.\n\n[[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] developed the law of electrostatic attraction in 1781 as an outgrowth of his attempt to investigate the law of electrical repulsions as stated by [[Joseph Priestley]] in England. To this end, he invented a sensitive apparatus to measure the electrical forces involved in Priestley's law. He also established the [[inverse square law]] of attraction and repulsion magnetic poles, which became the basis for the mathematical theory of magnetic forces developed by [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]]. Coulomb wrote seven important works on electricity and magnetism which he submitted to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences between 1785 and 1791, in which he reported having developed a theory of attraction and repulsion between charged bodies, and went on to search for perfect [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] and [[dielectrics]]. He suggested that there was no perfect dielectric, proposing that every substance has a limit, above which it will conduct electricity.  The [[SI]] unit of charge is called a [[coulomb]] in his honour.\n\nIn 1789, [[Franz Aepinus]] developed a device with the properties of a \"condenser\" (now known as a [[capacitor]].) The Aepinus condenser was the first capacitor developed after the Leyden jar, and was used to demonstrate conduction and [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]]. The device was constructed so that the space between two plates could be adjusted, and the glass dielectric separating the two plates could be removed or replaced with other materials.\n[[File:Galvani frog legs experiment setup.png|thumb|left|200px|Late 1780s diagram of Galvani's experiment on frog legs.]]\nDespite the gain in knowledge of electrical properties and the building of generators, it wasn't until the late 18th century that Italian [[physician]] and [[anatomist]] [[Luigi Galvani]] marked the birth of electrochemistry by establishing a bridge between muscular contractions and electricity with his 1791 essay ''De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius'' (Commentary on the Effect of Electricity on Muscular Motion), where he proposed a \"nerveo-electrical substance\" in life forms.\n\nIn his essay, Galvani concluded that animal tissue contained a before-unknown innate, vital force, which he termed \"animal electricity,\" which activated [[muscle]] when placed between two metal probes. He believed that this was evidence of a new form of electricity, separate from the \"natural\" form that is produced by lightning and  the \"artificial\" form that is produced by friction (static electricity). He considered the brain to be the most important organ for the secretion of this \"electric fluid\" and that the nerves conducted the fluid to the muscles.  He believed the tissues acted similarly to the outer and inner surfaces of Leyden jars. The flow of this electric fluid provided a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] to the muscle fibres.\n[[File:Volta-and-napoleon.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Italian physicist [[Alessandro Volta]] showing his ''\"[[Battery (electricity)|battery]]\"'' to French [[emperor]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the early 19th century.]]\nGalvani's scientific colleagues generally accepted his views, but [[Alessandro Volta]], the outstanding professor of physics at the [[University of Pavia]], was not convinced by the analogy between muscles and Leyden jars. Deciding that the frogs' legs used in Galvani's experiments served only as an electroscope, he held that the contact of dissimilar metals was the true source of stimulation.  He referred to the electricity so generated as \"metallic electricity\" and decided that the muscle, by contracting when touched by metal, resembled the action of an electroscope. Furthermore, Volta claimed that if two dissimilar metals in contact with each other also touched a muscle, agitation would also occur and increase with the dissimilarity of the metals. Galvani refuted this by obtaining muscular action using two pieces of similar metal.  Volta's name was later used for the unit of electrical potential, the [[volt]].\n\n==Rise of electrochemistry as branch of chemistry==\n[[File:Ritter Wasserelektrolyse.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Scheme of Ritter's apparatus to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis]]\nIn 1800, English chemists [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] succeeded in separating water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] by [[electrolysis]]. Soon thereafter, Ritter discovered the process of [[electroplating]]. He also observed that the amount of metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the [[electrodes]]. By 1801 Ritter had observed thermoelectric currents, which anticipated the discovery of [[thermoelectricity]] by [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]].\n\nIn 1802, [[William Cruickshank (chemist)|William Cruickshank]] designed the first electric battery capable of mass production. Like Volta, Cruickshank arranged square copper plates, which he soldered at their ends, together with plates of zinc of equal size. These plates were placed into a long rectangular wooden box which was sealed with cement. Grooves inside the box held the metal plates in position. The box was then filled with an electrolyte of [[brine]], or watered down acid. This flooded design had the advantage of not drying out with use and provided more energy than Volta's arrangement, which used brine-soaked papers between the plates.\n\nIn the quest for a better production of [[platinum]] metals, two scientists, [[William Hyde Wollaston]] and [[Smithson Tennant]], worked together to design an efficient electrochemical technique to refine or purify platinum. Tennant ended up discovering the elements [[iridium]] and [[osmium]]. Wollaston's effort, in turn, led him to the discovery of the metals [[palladium]] in 1803 and [[rhodium]] in 1804.\n\nWollaston made improvements to the galvanic battery (named after Galvani) in the 1810s. In Wollaston's battery, the wooden box was replaced with an earthenware vessel, and a copper plate was bent into a U-shape, with a single plate of zinc placed in the center of the bent copper. The zinc plate was prevented from making contact with the copper by dowels (pieces) of cork or wood. In his single cell design, the U-shaped copper plate was welded to a horizontal handle for lifting the copper and zinc plates out of the electrolyte when the battery was not in use.\n\nIn 1809, [[Samuel Thomas von Soemmering]] developed the first [[telegraph]]. He used a device with 26 wires (1 wire for each letter of the [[German alphabet]]) terminating in a container of acid. At the sending station, a key, which completed a circuit with a battery, was connected as required to each of the line wires. The passage of current caused the acid to decompose chemically, and the message was read by observing at which of the terminals the bubbles of gas appeared. This is how he was able to send messages, one letter at a time.\n\n[[Humphry Davy]]'s work with electrolysis led to conclusion that the production of electricity in simple [[electrolytic cell]]s resulted from chemical reactions between the electrolyte and the metals, and occurred between substances of opposite charge. He reasoned that the interactions of electric currents with chemicals offered the most likely means of [[decomposition|decomposing]] all substances to their basic elements. These views were explained in 1806 in his lecture ''On Some Chemical Agencies of Electricity'', for which he received the [[Napoleon Prize]] from the [[Institut de France]] in 1807 (despite the fact that England and France were at war at the time). This work led directly to the isolation of sodium and potassium from their common compounds and of the [[alkaline earth metals]] from theirs in 1808.\n\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]]'s discovery of the magnetic effect of electric currents in 1820 was immediately recognised as an important advance, although he left further work on [[electromagnetism]] to others. [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] quickly repeated \u00d8rsted's experiment, and formulated them mathematically (which became [[Amp\u00e8re's law]]) . \u00d8rsted also discovered that not only is a magnetic needle deflected by the electric current, but that the live electric wire is also deflected in a magnetic field, thus laying the foundation for the construction of an electric motor.  \u00d8rsted's discovery of [[piperine]], one of the pungent components of pepper, was an important contribution to chemistry, as was his preparation of [[aluminium]] in 1825.\n\nDuring the 1820s, [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]] developed the [[Deflagrator]], a form of voltaic battery having large plates used for producing rapid and powerful [[combustion]]. A modified form of this apparatus was employed in 1823 in volatilising and fusing [[carbon]]. It was with these batteries that the first use of voltaic electricity for blasting under water was made in 1831.\n\nIn 1821, the [[Estonia]]n-German physicist, Thomas Johann Seebeck, demonstrated the electrical potential in the juncture points of two dissimilar metals when there is a temperature difference between the joints. He joined a copper wire with a [[bismuth]] wire to form a loop or circuit. Two junctions were formed by connecting the ends of the wires to each other. He then accidentally discovered that if he heated one junction to a high temperature, and the other junction remained at room temperature, a magnetic field was observed around the circuit.\n\nHe did not recognise that an electric current was being generated when heat was applied to a bi-metal junction. He used the term \"thermomagnetic currents\" or \"thermomagnetism\" to express his discovery. Over the following two years, he reported on his continuing observations to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], where he described his observation as \"the magnetic polarization of metals and ores produced by a temperature difference.\" This [[Seebeck effect]] became the basis of the [[thermocouple]], which is still considered the most accurate measurement of temperature today.  The converse [[Peltier effect]] was seen over a decade later when a current was run through a circuit with two dissimilar metals, resulting in a temperature difference between the metals.\n\nIn 1827 German scientist [[Georg Ohm]] expressed his [[Ohm's law|law]] in his famous book ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' (The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically) in which he gave his complete theory of electricity.\n\nIn 1829 [[Antoine-C\u00e9sar Becquerel]] developed the \"constant current\" cell, forerunner of the well-known [[electrochemical cell|Daniell cell]]. When this acid-alkali cell was monitored by a [[galvanometer]], current was found to be constant for an hour, the first instance of \"constant current\". He applied the results of his study of thermoelectricity to the construction of an electric thermometer, and measured the temperatures of the interior of animals, of the soil at different depths, and of the atmosphere at different heights. He helped validate [[Faraday's law of electrolysis|Faraday's law]]s and conducted extensive investigations on the [[electroplating]] of metals with applications for metal finishing and [[metallurgy]]. [[Solar cell]] technology dates to 1839 when Becquerel observed that shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current.\n\n[[Michael Faraday]] began, in 1832, what promised to be a rather tedious attempt to prove that all electricities had precisely the same properties and caused precisely the same effects. The key effect was electrochemical decomposition. Voltaic and electromagnetic electricity posed no problems, but static electricity did. As Faraday delved deeper into the problem, he made two startling discoveries. First, electrical force did not, as had long been supposed, act at a distance upon molecules to cause them to dissociate. It was the passage of electricity through a conducting liquid medium that caused the molecules to dissociate, even when the electricity merely discharged into the air and did not pass through a \"pole\" or \"center of action\" in a voltaic cell. Second, the amount of the decomposition was found to be related directly to the amount of electricity passing through the solution.\n\nThese findings led Faraday to a new theory of electrochemistry. The electric force, he argued, threw the molecules of a solution into a state of tension. When the force was strong enough to distort the [[Force field (physics)|forces]] that held the molecules together so as to permit the interaction with neighbouring particles, the tension was relieved by the migration of particles along the lines of tension, the different parts of atoms migrating in opposite directions. The amount of electricity that passed, then, was clearly related to the chemical affinities of the substances in solution. These experiments led directly to Faraday's two laws of electrochemistry which state:\n*The amount of a substance deposited on each electrode of an electrolytic cell is directly proportional to the amount of electricity passing through the cell.\n*The quantities of different elements deposited by a given amount of electricity are in the ratio of their chemical [[equivalent weight]]s.\n\n[[William Sturgeon]] built an electric motor in 1832 and invented the [[commutator]], a ring of metal-bristled brushes which allow the spinning [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] to maintain contact with the electric current and changed the [[alternating current]] to a pulsating [[direct current]]. He also improved the voltaic battery and worked on the theory of thermoelectricity.\n\n[[Hippolyte Pixii]], a French instrument maker, constructed the first [[Electrical generator|dynamo]] in 1832 and later built a direct current dynamo using the commutator. This was the first practical mechanical generator of electric current that used concepts demonstrated by Faraday.\n\n[[File:Daniell-element---Elemento-Daniell.jpg|thumb|200px|Daniell cell]]\n[[John Frederic Daniell|John Daniell]] began experiments in 1835 in an attempt to improve the voltaic battery with its problems of being unsteady and a weak source of electric current. His experiments soon led to remarkable results. In 1836, he invented a primary cell in which hydrogen was eliminated in the generation of the electricity. Daniell had solved the problem of [[Polarization (electrostatics)|polarization]]. In his laboratory he had learned to alloy the [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]ated zinc of Sturgeon with mercury. His version was the first of the two-fluid class battery and the first battery that produced a constant reliable source of electric current over a long period of time.\n\n[[William Robert Grove|William Grove]] produced the first [[fuel cell]] in 1839. He based his experiment on the fact that sending an electric current through water splits the water into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen. So, Grove tried reversing the reaction\u2014combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water. Eventually the term ''fuel cell'' was coined in 1889 by [[Ludwig Mond]] and [[Charles Langer]], who attempted to build the first practical device using air and industrial [[coal gas]]. He also introduced a powerful battery at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1839. Grove's first cell consisted of zinc in diluted sulfuric acid and platinum in concentrated [[nitric acid]], separated by a porous pot. The cell was able to generate about 12 [[ampere]]s of current at about 1.8 volts. This cell had nearly double the voltage of the first Daniell cell. Grove's nitric acid cell was the favourite battery of the early American telegraph (1840\u20131860), because it offered strong current output.\n\nAs telegraph traffic increased, it was found that the Grove cell discharged poisonous [[nitrogen dioxide]] gas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} As telegraphs became more complex, the need for a constant voltage became critical and the Grove device was limited (as the cell discharged, nitric acid was depleted and voltage was reduced). By the time of the [[American Civil War]], Grove's battery had been replaced by the Daniell battery. In 1841 [[Robert Bunsen]] replaced the expensive platinum electrode used in Grove's battery with a carbon electrode. This led to large scale use of the \"Bunsen battery\" in the production of [[Arc lamp|arc-lighting]] and in electroplating.\n\n[[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] developed, in 1846, the [[electrodynamometer]], in which a current causes a coil suspended within another coil to turn when a current is passed through both. In 1852, Weber defined the absolute unit of electrical resistance (which was named the [[ohm]] after Georg Ohm).  Weber's name is now used as a unit name to describe [[magnetic flux]], the [[weber (unit)|weber]].\n\nGerman physicist [[Johann Hittorf]] concluded that ''ion movement'' caused electric current. In 1853 Hittorf noticed that some ions traveled more rapidly than others. This observation led to the concept of transport number, the rate at which particular ions carried the electric current. Hittorf measured the changes in the concentration of electrolysed solutions, computed from these the transport numbers (relative carrying capacities) of many ions, and, in 1869, published his findings governing the migration of ions.\n\n[[File:Pile Leclanch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|300px|Leclanch\u00e9 cell]]\nIn 1866, [[Georges Leclanch\u00e9]] patented a new battery system, which was immediately successful. Leclanch\u00e9's original cell was assembled in a porous pot. The positive electrode (the [[cathode]]) consisted of crushed manganese dioxide with a little carbon mixed in. The negative pole ([[Anode#Electrolytic anode|anode]]) was a zinc rod. The cathode was packed into the pot, and a carbon rod was inserted to act as a current collector. The anode and the pot were then immersed in an ammonium chloride solution. The liquid acted as the electrolyte, readily seeping through the porous pot and making contact with the cathode material. Leclanch\u00e9's \"wet\" cell became the forerunner to the world's first widely used battery, the zinc-carbon cell.\n\n==Late 19th century advances and the advent of electrochemical societies==\nIn 1869 [[Z\u00e9nobe Gramme]] devised his first clean direct current dynamo. His generator featured a ring armature wound with many individual coils of wire.\n\n[[Svante August Arrhenius]] published his thesis in 1884, ''Recherches sur la conductibilit\u00e9 galvanique des \u00e9lectrolytes'' (Investigations on the galvanic conductivity of electrolytes). From the results of his experiments, the author concluded that electrolytes, when dissolved in water, become to varying degrees split or dissociated into positive and negative ions. The degree to which this dissociation occurred depended above all on the nature of the substance and its concentration in the solution, being more developed the greater the dilution. The ions were supposed to be the carriers of not only the electric current, as in electrolysis, but also of the chemical activity. The relation between the actual number of ions and their number at great dilution (when all the molecules were dissociated) gave a quantity of special interest (\"activity constant\").\n\n[[File:Hall-heroult-kk-2008-12-31.png|thumb|250px|left|A Hall-H\u00e9roult industrial cell.]]\nThe race for the commercially viable production of [[aluminium]] was won in 1886 by [[Paul H\u00e9roult]] and [[Charles M. Hall]]. The problem many researchers had with extracting aluminium was that electrolysis of an aluminium salt dissolved in water yields [[aluminium hydroxide]]. Both Hall and H\u00e9roult avoided this problem by dissolving aluminium oxide in a new solvent\u2014 fused [[cryolite]] ([[Sodium|Na]]<sub>3</sub>Al[[Fluoride|F]]<sub>6</sub>).\n\n[[Wilhelm Ostwald]], 1909 [[Nobel Laureate]], started his experimental work in 1875, with an investigation on the law of mass action of water in relation to the problems of chemical affinity, with special emphasis on electrochemistry and [[chemical kinetics|chemical dynamics]]. In 1894 he gave the first modern definition of a [[catalyst]] and turned his attention to catalytic reactions. Ostwald is especially known for his contributions to the field of electrochemistry, including important studies of the electrical conductivity and electrolytic dissociation of organic acids.\n\n[[Hermann Nernst]] developed the theory of the electromotive force of the voltaic cell in 1888. He developed methods for measuring [[dielectric constant]]s and was the first to show that solvents of high dielectric constants promote the ionization of substances. Nernst's early studies in electrochemistry were inspired by Arrhenius' dissociation theory which first recognised the importance of ions in solution. In 1889, Nernst elucidated the theory of galvanic cells by assuming an \"electrolytic pressure of dissolution,\" which forces ions from electrodes into solution and which was opposed to the osmotic pressure of the dissolved ions. He applied the principles of thermodynamics to the chemical reactions proceeding in a battery. In that same year he showed how the characteristics of the current produced could be used to calculate the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] change in the chemical reaction producing the current. He constructed an equation, known as [[Nernst Equation]], which describes the relation of a battery cell's voltage to its properties.\n\nIn 1898 [[Fritz Haber]] published his textbook, ''Electrochemistry: Grundriss der technischen Elektrochemie auf theoretischer Grundlage'' (The Theoretical Basis of Technical Electrochemistry), which was based on the lectures he gave at [[University of Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe]]. In the preface to his book he expressed his intention to relate chemical research to industrial processes and in the same year he reported the results of his work on electrolytic oxidation and reduction, in which he showed that definite reduction products can result if the voltage at the cathode is kept constant. In 1898 he explained the reduction of [[nitrobenzene]] in stages at the cathode and this became the model for other similar reduction processes.\n\nIn 1909, [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] began a series of experiments to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron. He began by measuring the course of charged water droplets in an electrical field. The results suggested that the charge on the droplets is a multiple of the elementary electric charge, but the experiment was not accurate enough to be convincing. He obtained more precise results in 1910 with his famous [[oil-drop experiment]] in which he replaced water (which tended to evaporate too quickly) with oil.\n\n[[Jaroslav Heyrovsk\u00fd]], a Nobel laureate, eliminated the tedious weighing required by previous analytical techniques, which used the differential precipitation of mercury by measuring drop-time. In the previous method, a voltage was applied to a dropping mercury electrode and a reference electrode was immersed in a test solution. After 50 drops of mercury were collected, they were dried and weighed. The applied voltage was varied and the experiment repeated. Measured weight was plotted versus applied voltage to obtain the curve. In 1921, Heyrovsk\u00fd had the idea of measuring the current flowing through the cell instead of just studying drop-time.\n\n[[File:Heyrovsk\u00e9ho polarograf 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Heyrovsk\u00fd's Polarograph]]\nOn February 10, 1922, the \"[[polarograph]]\" was born as Heyrovsk\u00fd recorded the current-voltage curve for a solution of 1 [[Molar concentration|mol/L]] [[NaOH]]. Heyrovsk\u00fd  correctly interpreted the current increase between \u22121.9 and \u22122.0 V as being due to the deposit of Na<sup>+</sup> ions, forming an amalgam. Shortly thereafter, with his Japanese colleague [[Masuzo Shikata]], he constructed the first instrument for the automatic recording of polarographic curves, which became world-famous later as the polarograph.\n\nIn 1923, [[Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] published essentially the same theory about how acids and bases behave using electrochemical basis.\n\nThe [[International Society of Electrochemistry]] (ISE) was founded in 1949, and some years later the first sophisticated [[electrophoretic]] apparatus was developed in 1937 by [[Arne Tiselius]], who was awarded the 1948 Nobel prize for his work in protein [[electrophoresis]]. He developed the \"moving boundary,\" which later would become known as ''zone electrophoresis'', and used it to separate serum proteins in solution. Electrophoresis became widely developed in the 1940s and 1950s when the technique was applied to molecules ranging from the largest proteins to amino acids and even inorganic ions.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s [[quantum electrochemistry]] was developed by [[Revaz Dogonadze]] and his pupils.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|History of electrochemistry}}\n* [[Electrochemistry]]\n* [[History of the battery]]\n* [[Karpen Pile]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|title=Physician-described use of electricity in medicine|work=T.Gale's Electricity, or Ethereal Fire, Considered, 1802|url=http://www.iment.com/maida/familytree/henry/theman/atlocustgrove/medical/electricity/tableofcontents.htm|accessdate=March 10, 2008}}\n* [http://corrosion-doctors.org/History/Introduction.htm Corrosion-Doctors.org]\n*A classic and knowledgeable\u2014but dated\u2014reference on the history of electrochemistry is by 1909 Nobelist in Chemistry, Wilhelm Ostwald: Elektrochemie: Ihre Geschichte und Lehre,   Wilhelm Ostwald, Veit, Leipzig, 1896.

It is a country along the Marmara Sealine. The area, which was inhabited since the 8th century BC, was formerly known as \u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, ''Trigleia'' or \u0392\u03c1\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''Brylleion'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]. When demand for the products of Southern Marmara from the ancient world increased, ports have been constructed in [[Kios]] ([[Gemlik]]), [[Kur\u015funlu, Bursa|Kur\u015funlu]], [[Apamea Myrlea]]([[Mudanya]]), [[Si\u011fi]] ([[Kumyaka]]), and Trilye (Zeytinba\u011f\u0131) and the region boomed. The most important historical structure in Trilye (Triglia) is that of the Byzantine Haghioi Theodoroi Church, known today as the Fatih Mosque. Mudanya, a residential and commercial development in this township is under state protection as a historical site.\n\nTrisect has been an important religious center for [[Greek Orthodox]] Christians for a long time. Trilye is a first level protected area since 1980 because of the Byzantine and Ottoman architectural monuments and is considered as an open-air museum thanks to the historical buildings and houses. Osman Gazi\u2019s Turkmens in Bursa and surroundings have started settling in this location from the beginning of the year 1303. Kaymak Oba, Mirza Oba and \u00c7epni villages located at the back of Trilye are believed to have been established during this era. After Mudanya was conquered in 1321 Trilye\u2019s ports and other ports in the region started being used. The land at the western parts of Bursa namely the area between current Minor Industry Area (K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Sanayi B\u00f6lgesi) and Uluabat Lake were very fertile. Grapes, cocoons and cereal crops were grown in this region. In addition the Tahtal\u0131, Demirci and Do\u011fanc\u0131 regions had high quality wood used in the production of ships. There are signs proving a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] cargo boat has visited Trilye port in the 1330s.\n\nChurches and monasteries were constructed in Trigleia and its surroundings on the patronage of Byzantine Emperors.\n\nOnly 2500 people currently live in the town due to the impact of the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Only the ruins of the Byzantines remain, the ruins of old Byzantine churches. Greek houses built at the end of the 19th century prior to the Genocide line the remaining streets. Nevertheless, the town is under the protection of the Ministry of Culture so no one can destroy the old houses or rebuild them in a different style than the original one. The place is known for its olives and had historically been inhabited by Greek artisans engaged in the silk trade. 'Zeytingbagi' means 'olive yard'.\n\n==History==\n\nThe area has been host to various civilizations since antiquity. Tirilye is the original village. Although the name of the village has been officially changed to Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 (Olive Orchard), that name is rarely, if ever, used in daily life, and the name Trilye is used instead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nThere are several legends about the origins of the name. One is that the area was famous for red mullet and red gurnard and that those fish were the main course of the Byzantine emperors' tables. \"[[Trigleia]]\" ([[Triglia lucerna]]) is a word in Greek for such fish.\n\nAnother legend comes from the Genoese. Three inhabitants of the village were distressed by the looting of pirates. Therefore, they combined their power and decided to live together. The name Tirilye is said to be derived from those three villagers.\n\nEven after the Ottoman Empire absorbed the area, it remained Greek-populated. Although some Muslims from several areas in Anatolia had settled here the Christian population remained in the majority.\nDuring the [[Greek genocide]], the wealthier class of the inhabitants of the village opened their shops and started distributing oil, rice, sugar, etc., to the poor, but were prevented from continuing further distribution by the Government officials.<ref name=\"Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918\">{{cite book| title = Persecution of the Greeks in Turkey, 1914-1918| url = https://archive.org/details/persecutionofgre00consrich| publisher = Constantinople [London, Printed by the Hesperia Press]|date=1919}}</ref> One Church was turned into a Mosque.<ref name=\"Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918\"/>  Houses were demolished.<ref name=\"Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918\"/>  \n\nAfter the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]] and the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] that followed the Greeks left the village. The Greeks migrated to Greece with the help of local businessman and ship owner [[Phillipos Kavounidis]]. The refugees were taken mainly to two places 1) to [[Rafina]], near Athens, where icons from the churches can currently be seen inside one of the local churches and 2) to Nea Triglia, Chalkidiki. In turn, Muslim immigrants mainly from Salonica ([[Thessaloniki]] and [[Langadas]]) and other places were settled in Tirilye.\n\n==Fatih Mosque==\n{{main|Fatih Mosque, Tirilye}}\n[[File:Fatih Cami.JPG|thumb|Fatih Mosque]]\nThe Fatih Mosque (Turkish: Fatih Camii) is a mosque in Tirilye, which was converted from an 8th-century Byzantine church dedicated to Saint Stefanos (Moni Hinolakou- \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae \u03a7\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5). The building was constructed between 720 and 730 AD, originally as the Church of Christ and Saint Stefanos. After the Ottoman conquest of the town, it was converted (in 1661) to a mosque and named \"Fatih\", which means \"conqueror\". The mosque was briefly rededicated as a church during the Greek orccupation of the area in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922.\n\nThe church is the oldest Byzantine building in the region, and has protected status. It is of the typical Byzantine cross-in-square style and has Byzantine column headings at the entrance and a dome {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=off}} high. The mosque is entuered thorough a portico covered with a wooden roof which is standing on four columns that have ornamented metal headings. The building has a mihrab that is covered with a half-dome. It has been declared as a protected monument by 1299/31.8.1990 decision of BURSA K\u00dcLT\u00dcR ve TAB\u0130AT VARLIKLARINI KORUMA KURULU B\u00dcRO M\u00dcD\u00dcRL\u00dc\u011e\u00dc.\n\n==New Stone School (Ta\u015f Mektep)==\n[[File:Ta\u015f Mektep.JPG|thumb|Ta\u015f Mektep]]\nThe New Stone School, built on an idea of Metropolitan Chryssostomos, in a markedly neoclassical style, is the largest building in town. The construction of the magnificent building started in 1909 and was completed in three years (1912). It is situated on an area of {{convert|965|m2|abbr=off}}, is four stories high and is located on the hill at the west of \u0130skele Street. In 1924 after the establishment of the republic it is opened as a school called Dar-\u00fcl Eytam for orphans, who were the children of soldiers that died in the war. The building served as a boarding school, a primary school and a secondary school later on. The historical building that was evacuated in 1989 was transferred to Uluda\u011f University first and then was transferred to Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 Municipality for restorations.\n\n== Virgin Mary-Metropolis Church ==\n{{main| Virgin Mary- Metropolis Church, Tirilye}}\nThe complex, which was constructed in Trilye in 1878 as a Greek Church, after 1924 The Dar-\u00fcl Eytam School, which opens to the Stone School (being used for the workshops for carpentry and iron works for 400 students), and the \u201cD\u00fcndar House\", used as a mess house. The church had three vertical lines similar to all other churches(Vertical lines are separated with columns), but the abscissa of the church was demolished for creating a new entrance, causing the upper part of the entrance to be higher than the sides. The Church building was used as a mess hall until the school was closed in September 1927. Due to its function it was called \u201cmess hall\u201d until its restoration, which turned the building into Faruk \u00c7elik Cultural Center. Upon the request of the Greek Culture Delegation a ceremony was held in this building during the visit of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew I]] to Tirilye on July 1, 2009. Starting from 2019 \"Theofaneia\" ceremony is held each year (on 19/1/2019 and 20/1/2020) by Patriarch Bartholomew.\n\n== Churches in the city==\nIn Triyle there were seven churches, three monasteries and three holy springs in Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 however only four of these churches have survived up until now and are Ayios Stefanos or Moni Hinolakou (Fatih Camii since 1661), Panagia Pantovasilissa (Kemer Kilise), Ayios Georgios Ano (known as Dundar's House) and Virgin Mary-Metropolis. Of the monasteries, only Ayios Ioannis Theologos (Pelekete) Monastery has even partially survived among the three monasteries. On one of the demolished churches (Ayios Yoannis) has been built the Trilye Town Hall. The ruins of the three monasteries, which were built during the Byzantine era, are out of Trilye. One of these is the Medikion Monastery (Hagios Sergios Monastery) located on the road to E\u015fkel Village. The monastery was built during the 8th century and is now operated as a farm. Today, all that remains are the perimeter walls, and the magnificent entrance doors, being{{convert|200|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The ruin of the second monastery is {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} far from the town and is called Hagios Ioannis Theologos (Pelekete) Aya Yani Monastery, which is known as the Ayani Ranch by the public. The monastery was built in 709 and used until 1922; only some ruins of the church and walls are remaining today. The third ruin is the one of the Rhyakos Soteros Monastery known as the Aya Sotiri by the public. Most of the buildings of the monastery are ruined. However, their owners still use some buildings as shelters. Turks, who settled in the area during Yavuz Sultan Selim Time, also built a Turkish bath and a School in 1907. Those structures are regarded as important historical locations, which have also survived into modern day.\n\n==Panagia Pantobasilissa (Lady Queen of All) Church==\n\n{{main|Panagia Pantobasilissa church, Tirilye}}\nPanagia Pantobasilissa or Arched Church as it is called in the region is known to be the first church where the walls were decorated with [[fresco]]es.\n\nIt is indicated in some handwritten scripts that the church was dedicated to [[Panagia]] Pantobasillissa (Mary Queen of All). The church is based on a [[Greek cross]] plan to in the east and west directions. Although the building is not used currently it has still survived. According to the construction style of its walls, it is believed that the building was constructed at the end of the 13th century. The church has pictures on its walls at different layers and is considered to be very important for Christians. The first layer of frescos were made at the start of the 14th century, the second layer of frescos were made in 1723. It is believed that the columns were brought from [[Alexandria]]. There are support pillars at the fa\u00e7ades and the public calls the building as the Arched Church.\n\n==D\u00fcndar House==\n{{main|Agios Ioannis church, Tirilye}}\n\nThe Hagios Ioannes Greek Church (Yuannes Church), which is known as the D\u00fcndar House in the region, has been transferred to private property after Greeks abandoned the region. Three-floored western part of the church, which was constructed in the 19th century, is currently being used as a residence. The main entrance is through a stone door. There are Byzantine decorations and stone ornaments on its walls.\n\n==Monastery of Hagios Sergios==\n{{main|Medikion monastery}}\n\nIt is located at the beginning of the road that leaves the main road in the south of Tirilye and leads to the land with olive groves. The monastery was established in the late 8th century, and produced some important [[iconodule]] figures during the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]]. After that, its history is obscure; it is mentioned in 1054, and it is known that it burned down and was rebuilt in 1800\u201301, but had fallen into disuse by the end of the 19th century, Today, only the outer wall of the complex survives.\n\n==Pelekete monastery==\n{{main|Pelekete monastery}}\n\nThe ruin of the  monastery is {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} far from the town and is called Hagios Ioannes Theologos (Pelekete) Aya Yani Monastery, which is known as the Ayani Ranch by the public. The monastery was built in 709 and used until 1922; only the ruins of the church and walls are remaining today.\n\n==Batheos Rhyakos Soteros Monastery==\n{{main|Batheos Rhyakos Soteros Monastery}}\n\nThe ruins of the monastery belong to Batheos Rhyakos Soteros Monastery known as the Aya Sotiri by the public. Most of the buildings of the monastery are ruined however their owners use some buildings as shelters.\n\n==Christ-Sauveur / Ruissau-Profond Monastery==\n{{main|Christ-Sauveur / Ruissau-Profond Monastery}}\nIt was built in 956.<ref>http://www.yesilbursadergisi.com/mobil/haber.php?id=321</ref>\n\n==Kapanca Port==\nThe antic port, which is in Kapanca Districts of Trilye, dates back to the Roman era; it was the most important port for transportation during its time. It has been understood that the Genoese have used Trilye and Apemeia (Mudanya) ports for transporting the salt extracted from the northern part of the Appolonia Lake. Trilye was an important port for exporting the goods produced in the fertile lands to the center of the Byzantine Empire.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Swallow's Nest (Historical Pine Teahouse) (Tarihi \u00c7aml\u0131 Kahve)==\n{{main|Swallow's Nest, Tirilye}}\n\nThe Historical Pine Coffee lies on a high hill past the Stone School and is referred as the balcony of Trilye. This area is used as a teahouse and overlooks the sea and olive orchards.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Turkish bath==\n\nThe exact name and construction date is not known of hamam (Turkish Bath) which is located at the same building lot with the Fatih Mosque and in the southern side of it; however, there is information to the effect that it was built by Turks brought from Kastamonu and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar during Yavuz Sultan Selim's era in the first half of the 16th century.\n\nThe building features a rectangular plan schema consisting of five spaces. Its walls were laid with rough stone and brick; in the laying system, typical lighting gaps peculiar to baths were allowed. The space above the g\u00f6bek ta\u015f\u0131 (heated marble platform on which one lies to sweat in a Turkish bath) is covered with two small domes. Other spaces are covered with broken-roof. Despite its quite well preserved condition in physical terms, it is not being used today.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkey}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 sister cities===\nTirilye is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Rafina]], [[Greece]] <ref>[http://www.mudanya.gen.tr/guncel-haber/77-mudanya-kent-haberleri/199-zeytinbagi-trilye-rum-misafirlerini-agirladi.html Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 (Trilye) Rum Misafirlerini A\u011f\u0131rlad\u0131] {{in lang|tr}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Triglia]], [[Greece]]\n*{{flagicon|UKR}} [[Gaspra]], [[Ukraine]]\n\n== Notable people ==\n*[[Ismail Akbay]] (October 17, 1930 \u2013 2003) was the first [[Turkish people|Turk]] who worked for [[NASA]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Zeytinba\u011f\u0131|Tirilye}}\n{{external media\n|video1=http://video.bursa.bel.tr/belgeseller/trilye-6524.html\n}}\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20130810165039/http://www.zeytinbagi.bel.tr/\n* http://www.pbase.com/sabbilsel/zeytinbag\n* http://www.agbursa.com/tirilye/album2.shtml\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20120206010926/http://www.istanbulguide.net/picture/triglia.jpg\n\n{{coord|40|23|32|N|28|47|40|E|display=title|region:TR_type:city}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zeytinbagi}}\n[[Category:Towns in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Bursa Province]]\n[[Category:Fishing communities in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Bithynian colonies]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=January 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n|settlement_type =\n|subdivision_type = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n|subdivision_name = {{TUR}}\n|timezone=[[Eastern European Time|EET]]\n|utc_offset=+2\n|map_caption =Location of Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 within Turkey.\n|timezone_DST=[[Eastern European Summer Time|EEST]]\n|utc_offset_DST=+3\n\n |official_name = Tirilye\n |map2 =\n |map2 size = 250\n |map2 cap =\n |map1 =\n |map1 size =\n |map1 cap =\n |image_map = Bursa Turkey Provinces locator.gif\n |\n map cap = Location in [[Turkey]]\n |subdivision_type2=[[Provinces of Turkey|Province]]|\nsubdivision_name2 = Bursa |\n\n population_total =\n |population_as_of =\n |population_footnotes =\n |population_density_km2 =\n |area_total_km2 =\n |elevation_m =\n |postal_code_type=[[Postal code]]|\npostal_code = 16x xx\n |area_code = 0224\n |blank_info = 16|blank_name=[[Turkish car number plates|Licence&nbsp;plate]]|\n leader_name =\n |website = http://www.zeytinbagi.bel.tr\n |province website= http://www.zeytinbagi.bel.tr\n}}\n[[File:Zeytinba\u011f\u0131sokak.JPG|thumb|Street]]\n[[File:Mudanya Bursa.jpg|thumb|Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 in 1990]]\n'''Tirilye''' is a town in [[Bursa Province]], [[Turkey]], situated {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on|2}} west of Mudanya.

'Zeytingbagi' means 'olive yard'.\n\n==History==\n\nThe area has been host to various civilizations since antiquity. Tirilye is the original village. Although the name of the village has been officially changed to Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 (Olive Orchard), that name is rarely, if ever, used in daily life, and the name Trilye is used instead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nThere are several legends about the origins of the name. One is that the area was famous for red mullet and red gurnard and that those fish were the main course of the Byzantine emperors' tables. \"[[Trigleia]]\" ([[Triglia lucerna]]) is a word in Greek for such fish.\n\nAnother legend comes from the Genoese. Three inhabitants of the village were distressed by the looting of pirates. Therefore, they combined their power and decided to live together. The name Tirilye is said to be derived from those three villagers.\n\nEven after the Ottoman Empire absorbed the area, it remained Greek-populated. Although some Muslims from several areas in Anatolia had settled here the Christian population remained in the majority.\nDuring the [[Greek genocide]], the wealthier class of the inhabitants of the village opened their shops and started distributing oil, rice, sugar, etc., to the poor, but were prevented from continuing further distribution by the Government officials.<ref name=\"Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918\">{{cite book| title = Persecution of the Greeks in Turkey, 1914-1918| url = https://archive.org/details/persecutionofgre00consrich| publisher = Constantinople [London, Printed by the Hesperia Press]|date=1919}}</ref> One Church was turned into a Mosque.<ref name=\"Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918\"/>  Houses were demolished.<ref name=\"Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918\"/>  \n\nAfter the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]] and the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] that followed the Greeks left the village. The Greeks migrated to Greece with the help of local businessman and ship owner [[Phillipos Kavounidis]]. The refugees were taken mainly to two places 1) to [[Rafina]], near Athens, where icons from the churches can currently be seen inside one of the local churches and 2) to Nea Triglia, Chalkidiki. In turn, Muslim immigrants mainly from Salonica ([[Thessaloniki]] and [[Langadas]]) and other places were settled in Tirilye.\n\n==Fatih Mosque==\n{{main|Fatih Mosque, Tirilye}}\n[[File:Fatih Cami.JPG|thumb|Fatih Mosque]]\nThe Fatih Mosque (Turkish: Fatih Camii) is a mosque in Tirilye, which was convherted from an 8th-century Byzantine church dedicated to Saint Theodore. The building was constructed between 720 and 730 AD, originally as the Church of Christ and Saint Stephjen. After the Ottoman conquest of the town, it was converted to a mosque and named \"Fatih\", which means \"conqueror\". The mosque was briefly rededicated as a church during the Greek orccupation of the area in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922.\n\nThe church is the oldest Byzantine building in the region, and has protected status. It is of the typical Byzantine cross-in-square style and has Byzantine column headings at the entrance and a dome {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=off}} high. The mosque is entuered thorough a portico covered with a wooden roof which is standing on four columns that have ornamented metal headings. The byuilding has a mihrab that is covered with a half-dome.\n\n==New Stone School (Ta\u015f Mektep)==\n[[File:Ta\u015f Mektep.JPG|thumb|Ta\u015f Mektep]]\nThe New Stone School, built on an idea of Metropolitan Chryssostomos, in a markedly neoclassical style, is the largest building in town. The construction of the magnificent building started in 1909 and was completed in three years (1912). It is situated on an area of {{convert|965|m2|abbr=off}}, is four stories high and is located on the hill at the west of \u0130skele Street. In 1924 after the establishment of the republic it is opened as a school called Dar-\u00fcl Eytam for orphans, who were the children of soldiers that died in the war. The building served as a boarding school, a primary school and a secondary school later on. The historical building that was evacuated in 1989 was transferred to Uluda\u011f University first and then was transferred to Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 Municipality for restorations.\n\n== Virgin Mary-Metropolis Church ==\n{{main| Virgin Mary- Metropolis Church, Tirilye}}\nThe complex, which was constructed in Trilye in 1878 as a Greek Church, after 1924 The Dar-\u00fcl Eytam School, which opens to the Stone School (being used for the workshops for carpentry and iron works for 400 students), and the \u201cD\u00fcndar House\", used as a mess house. The church had three vertical lines similar to all other churches(Vertical lines are separated with columns), but the abscissa of the church was demolished for creating a new entrance, causing the upper part of the entrance to be higher than the sides. The Church building was used as a mess hall until the school was closed in September 1927. Due to its function it was called \u201cmess hall\u201d until its restoration, which turned the building into Faruk \u00c7elik Cultural Center. Upon the request of the Greek Culture Delegation a ceremony was held in this building during the visit of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew I]] to Tirilye on July 1, 2009. Starting from 2019 \"Theofaneia\" ceremony is held each year (on 19/1/2019 and 20/1/2020) by Patriarch Bartholomew.\n\n== Churches in the city==\nIn Triyle there were seven churches, three monasteries and three holy springs in Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 however only four of these churches have survived up until now and are Ayios Stefanos or Moni Hinolakou (Fatih Camii since 1661), Panagia Pantovasilissa (Kemer Kilise), Ayios Georgios Ano (known as Dundar's House) and Virgin Mary-Metropolis. Of the monasteries, only Ayios Ioannis Theologos (Pelekete) Monastery has even partially survived among the three monasteries. On one of the demolished churches (Ayios Yoannis) has been built the Trilye Town Hall. The ruins of the three monasteries, which were built during the Byzantine era, are out of Trilye. One of these is the Medikion Monastery (Hagios Sergios Monastery) located on the road to E\u015fkel Village. The monastery was built during the 8th century and is now operated as a farm. Today, all that remains are the perimeter walls, and the magnificent entrance doors, being{{convert|200|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The ruin of the second monastery is {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} far from the town and is called Hagios Ioannis Theologos (Pelekete) Aya Yani Monastery, which is known as the Ayani Ranch by the public. The monastery was built in 709 and used until 1922; only some ruins of the church and walls are remaining today. The third ruin is the one of the Rhyakos Soteros Monastery known as the Aya Sotiri by the public. Most of the buildings of the monastery are ruined. However, their owners still use some buildings as shelters. Turks, who settled in the area during Yavuz Sultan Selim Time, also built a Turkish bath and a School in 1907. Those structures are regarded as important historical locations, which have also survived into modern day.\n\n==Panagia Pantobasilissa (Lady Queen of All) Church==\n\n{{main|Panagia Pantobasilissa church, Tirilye}}\nPanagia Pantobasilissa or Arched Church as it is called in the region is known to be the first church where the walls were decorated with [[fresco]]es.\n\nIt is indicated in some handwritten scripts that the church was dedicated to [[Panagia]] Pantobasillissa (Mary Queen of All). The church is based on a [[Greek cross]] plan to in the east and west directions. Although the building is not used currently it has still survived. According to the construction style of its walls, it is believed that the building was constructed at the end of the 13th century. The church has pictures on its walls at different layers and is considered to be very important for Christians. The first layer of frescos were made at the start of the 14th century, the second layer of frescos were made in 1723. It is believed that the columns were brought from [[Alexandria]]. There are support pillars at the fa\u00e7ades and the public calls the building as the Arched Church.\n\n==D\u00fcndar House==\n{{main|Agios Ioannis church, Tirilye}}\n\nThe Hagios Ioannes Greek Church (Yuannes Church), which is known as the D\u00fcndar House in the region, has been transferred to private property after Greeks abandoned the region. Three-floored western part of the church, which was constructed in the 19th century, is currently being used as a residence. The main entrance is through a stone door. There are Byzantine decorations and stone ornaments on its walls.\n\n==Monastery of Hagios Sergios==\n{{main|Medikion monastery}}\n\nIt is located at the beginning of the road that leaves the main road in the south of Tirilye and leads to the land with olive groves. The monastery was established in the late 8th century, and produced some important [[iconodule]] figures during the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]]. After that, its history is obscure; it is mentioned in 1054, and it is known that it burned down and was rebuilt in 1800\u201301, but had fallen into disuse by the end of the 19th century, Today, only the outer wall of the complex survives.\n\n==Pelekete monastery==\n{{main|Pelekete monastery}}\n\nThe ruin of the  monastery is {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} far from the town and is called Hagios Ioannes Theologos (Pelekete) Aya Yani Monastery, which is known as the Ayani Ranch by the public. The monastery was built in 709 and used until 1922; only the ruins of the church and walls are remaining today.\n\n==Batheos Rhyakos Soteros Monastery==\n{{main|Batheos Rhyakos Soteros Monastery}}\n\nThe ruins of the monastery belong to Batheos Rhyakos Soteros Monastery known as the Aya Sotiri by the public. Most of the buildings of the monastery are ruined however their owners use some buildings as shelters.\n\n==Christ-Sauveur / Ruissau-Profond Monastery==\n{{main|Christ-Sauveur / Ruissau-Profond Monastery}}\nIt was built in 956.<ref>http://www.yesilbursadergisi.com/mobil/haber.php?id=321</ref>\n\n==Kapanca Port==\nThe antic port, which is in Kapanca Districts of Trilye, dates back to the Roman era; it was the most important port for transportation during its time. It has been understood that the Genoese have used Trilye and Apemeia (Mudanya) ports for transporting the salt extracted from the northern part of the Appolonia Lake. Trilye was an important port for exporting the goods produced in the fertile lands to the center of the Byzantine Empire.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Swallow's Nest (Historical Pine Teahouse) (Tarihi \u00c7aml\u0131 Kahve)==\n{{main|Swallow's Nest, Tirilye}}\n\nThe Historical Pine Coffee lies on a high hill past the Stone School and is referred as the balcony of Trilye. This area is used as a teahouse and overlooks the sea and olive orchards.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Turkish bath==\n\nThe exact name and construction date is not known of hamam (Turkish Bath) which is located at the same building lot with the Fatih Mosque and in the southern side of it; however, there is information to the effect that it was built by Turks brought from Kastamonu and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar during Yavuz Sultan Selim's era in the first half of the 16th century.\n\nThe building features a rectangular plan schema consisting of five spaces. Its walls were laid with rough stone and brick; in the laying system, typical lighting gaps peculiar to baths were allowed. The space above the g\u00f6bek ta\u015f\u0131 (heated marble platform on which one lies to sweat in a Turkish bath) is covered with two small domes. Other spaces are covered with broken-roof. Despite its quite well preserved condition in physical terms, it is not being used today.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkey}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 sister cities===\nTirilye is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Rafina]], [[Greece]] <ref>[http://www.mudanya.gen.tr/guncel-haber/77-mudanya-kent-haberleri/199-zeytinbagi-trilye-rum-misafirlerini-agirladi.html Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 (Trilye) Rum Misafirlerini A\u011f\u0131rlad\u0131] {{in lang|tr}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Triglia]], [[Greece]]\n*{{flagicon|UKR}} [[Gaspra]], [[Ukraine]]\n\n== Notable people ==\n*[[Ismail Akbay]] (October 17, 1930 \u2013 2003) was the first [[Turkish people|Turk]] who worked for [[NASA]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Zeytinba\u011f\u0131|Tirilye}}\n{{external media\n|video1=http://video.bursa.bel.tr/belgeseller/trilye-6524.html\n}}\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20130810165039/http://www.zeytinbagi.bel.tr/\n* http://www.pbase.com/sabbilsel/zeytinbag\n* http://www.agbursa.com/tirilye/album2.shtml\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20120206010926/http://www.istanbulguide.net/picture/triglia.jpg\n\n{{coord|40|23|32|N|28|47|40|E|display=title|region:TR_type:city}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zeytinbagi}}\n[[Category:Towns in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Bursa Province]]\n[[Category:Fishing communities in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Bithynian colonies]]\n", "name_user": "Makap09", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFatih Mosque", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirilye"}

Both had competed at Miss Universe until this time.\n\nThe pageant aired on [[CBS]] from [[1963 in television|1963]] until [[2002 in television|2002]], and for many years was known for having a CBS game show host as pageant host. [[John Charles Daly]] hosted the show from 1963\u20131966, [[Bob Barker]] from 1967 (he was not a regular for the CBS network until 1972 when he became host of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' which he hosted until 2007) until 1987 (at which point he quit in a dispute over [[fur coat]]s), [[Alan Thicke]] in 1988, [[Dick Clark]] from 1989 to 1993, and [[Bob Goen]] from 1994 to 1996.

Since its inception, eight Miss USA titleholders have gone on to win Miss Universe. In the mid-1960s, the organization established a rule that when a Miss USA wins the [[Miss Universe]] title, the first runner-up assumes the Miss USA title for the remainder of the year. This occurred in 1980, 1995, 1997, and 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=News anchor shuns beauty queen past |publisher=St. Petersburg Times|date=1989-10-27|first=Janis|last=Froelich|page=1D}}</ref><ref name=\"sherwood\">{{cite news|title= USA Sherwood |agency=Associated Press|date=1997-05-18}}</ref> In 1967, the first runner-up Susan Bradley of California declined the title and the crown went to the second runner-up [[Cheryl Patton]] of [[Florida]]. The only instance when a first runner-up assumed the title of Miss USA prior to this period was in 1957, when [[Mary Leona Gage]] of [[Maryland]] resigned after it was discovered she was married.<ref>{{cite news|title=Are Trump's Beauties at Home With the Camera?

Aside from the job, the winner also receives a cash allowance for her entire reign, a modelling portfolio, beauty products, clothes, shoes, as well as styling, healthcare, and fitness services by different sponsors of the pageant. She also gains exclusive access to events such as fashion shows and opening galas, as well as access to casting calls and modeling opportunities throughout New York City. When Donald Trump owned the pageant, the winner was given the use of a Trump Place apartment in New York City during her reign, which she shared with the Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA titleholders. If the winner, for any reason, cannot fulfill her duties as Miss USA, including if she wins the title of Miss Universe, the 1st runner-up takes over.\n\n{{see also|Miss USA 2015#Controversy}}\nIn late-June 2015, both NBC and Spanish-language network [[Univision]] (which was to begin a new five-year contract for Spanish rights) announced that they would cut their ties with Donald Trump and the Miss Universe Organization in response to remarks Trump made relating to undocumented immigrants during the launch of his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]].

delegates, and recognizes those who are the friendliest and make the pageant experience the most enjoyable. From 1952 to 1964, when the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants were concurrent events, the award could be won by a contestant competing either for Miss USA or Miss Universe. In fact, in 1960, there was a tie, with the award going to [[Miss Universe Myanmar|Miss Universe Burma]], Myint Myint May, and [[Miss Louisiana USA]], Rebecca Fletcher. In 2015, [[Miss Alaska USA|Alaska]] and [[Miss Delaware USA|Delaware]] tied for the Miss Congeniality award. [[Miss Vermont USA|Vermont]] and [[Miss Wyoming USA|Wyoming]] have won five Miss Amity/Congeniality awards, two more than any other state.\n\nThe Miss Photogenic prize was first awarded in 1965 and was chosen by journalists until 1996 when it was chosen by an internet vote for the first time. There has been only one tie in this award's history: in 1980, when it was shared between [[Jineane Ford]] of [[Miss Arizona USA|Arizona]] and Elizabeth Kim Thomas of [[Miss Ohio USA|Ohio]]. The state that has won the most Photogenic awards is [[Miss Virginia USA|Virginia]].\n\n[[Miss Louisiana USA|Louisiana]] won both the first Miss Amity and Photogenic awards given to a Miss USA contestant.\n\nOther awards that have been presented include Best State Costume (1962\u20131993), Style (1995\u20132001) and Most Beautiful Eyes (1993). In 1998, a special Distinguished Achievement award was given to [[Halle Berry]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Shawnae Jebbia of Massachusetts Crowned \"Miss USA 1998\" |publisher=Business Wire|date=2007-03-11}}</ref> Berry was [[Miss Ohio USA]] 1986 and placed 1st runner-up to [[Christy Fichtner]] of [[Miss Texas USA|Texas]]. She later went on to become an acclaimed actress and [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] winner.\n\n==Locations==\nIn the first eight years of competition (1952\u20131959), the Miss USA pageant was held in [[Long Beach, California]]. The competition moved to [[Miami Beach, Florida]] in 1960 and stayed there until 1971. In 1972, the pageant was held in [[Puerto Rico]], the only time the pageant has been held outside the continental United States. That pageant was rocked by an explosion at the host hotel.<ref>{{cite news|title=Explosion of undetermined cause rocks site of Miss USA pageant|publisher=New York Times Abstracts|date=1972-05-21|page=35}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1972 onwards, the pageant has been held in various locations, generally being held in each location for two to three years.\n\nAs of 2019, the pageant has been held in the following states:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*'''[[Alabama]]'''\n**[[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] (1989)\n*'''[[California]]'''\n**[[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] (1952\u20131959)\n**[[Los Angeles]] (2004, 2007) \n*'''[[Florida]]'''\n**[[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] (1960\u20131971)\n**[[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]] (1984\u20131985)\n**[[Miami]] (1986)\n*'''[[Indiana]]'''\n**[[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] (2001\u20132002)\n*'''[[Kansas]]'''\n**[[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] (1990\u20131993)\n{{col-3}}\n*'''[[Louisiana]]'''\n**[[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] (1997\u20131998, 2018)\n**[[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] (2014\u20132015)\n*'''[[Maryland]]'''\n**[[Baltimore]] (2005\u20132006)\n*'''[[Missouri]]'''\n**[[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] (1999\u20132000)\n*'''[[Mississippi]]'''\n**[[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] (1979\u20131982)\n*'''[[Nevada]]'''\n**[[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] (2008\u20132013, 2016\u20132017)\n**[[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] (2019)\n{{col-3}}\n*'''[[New Mexico]]'''\n**[[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] (1987)\n*'''[[New York (state)|New York]]'''\n**[[New York City]] (1973)\n**[[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] (1974\u20131976)\n*'''[[South Carolina]]'''\n**[[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] (1977\u20131978)\n*'''[[Tennessee]]'''\n**[[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] (1983)\n*'''[[Texas]]'''\n**[[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] (1988)\n**[[South Padre Island, Texas|South Padre Island]] (1994\u20131996)\n**[[San Antonio]] (2003)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Special feature episodes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nSince 2003, a number of delegates have been involved in special episodes of regular programs broadcast by [[NBC]]. From 2003\u20132005, six delegates each year were chosen to participate in a special Miss USA edition of ''[[Fear Factor]]'', with the victorious contestant taking the title \"Miss Fear Factor USA\" and a prize of [[United States dollar|$]]50,000 ($25,000 of which was to be donated to a charity of the winner's choice).

From the 1970s, each state and the District of Columbia have sent a delegate each year. [[Miss Alaska USA|Alaska]] first competed in 1959 and [[Miss Hawaii USA|Hawaii]] in 1960. Both had competed at Miss Universe until this time.\n\nThe pageant aired on [[CBS]] from [[1963 in television|1963]] until [[2002 in television|2002]], and for many years was known for having a CBS game show host as pageant host. [[John Charles Daly]] hosted the show from 1963\u20131966, [[Bob Barker]] from 1967 (he was not a regular for the CBS network until 1972 when he became host of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' which he hosted until 2007) until 1987 (at which point he quit in a dispute over [[fur coat]]s), [[Alan Thicke]] in 1988, [[Dick Clark]] from 1989 to 1993, and [[Bob Goen]] from 1994 to 1996.

Since its inception, eight Miss USA titleholders have gone on to win Miss Universe. In the mid-1960s, the organization established a rule that when a Miss USA wins the [[Miss Universe]] title, the first runner-up assumes the Miss USA title for the remainder of the year. This occurred in 1980, 1995, 1997, and 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=News anchor shuns beauty queen past |publisher=St. Petersburg Times|date=1989-10-27|first=Janis|last=Froelich|page=1D}}</ref><ref name=\"sherwood\">{{cite news|title= USA Sherwood |agency=Associated Press|date=1997-05-18}}</ref> In 1967, the first runner-up Susan Bradley of California declined the title and the crown went to the second runner-up [[Cheryl Patton]] of [[Florida]]. The only instance when a first runner-up assumed the title of Miss USA prior to this period was in 1957, when [[Mary Leona Gage]] of [[Maryland]] resigned after it was discovered she was married.<ref>{{cite news|title=Are Trump's Beauties at Home With the Camera? They'll Have to Be|publisher=Washington Post|date=2007-06-21|last=de Moraes |first=Lisa|page=C07}}</ref>\n\nThe winner is assigned a one-year contract with the Miss Universe Organization, traveling across the United States, and in some cases overseas, to spread messages about their chosen causes. Aside from the job, the winner also receives a cash allowance for her entire reign, a modelling portfolio, beauty products, clothes, shoes, as well as styling, healthcare, and fitness services by different sponsors of the pageant. She also gains exclusive access to events such as fashion shows and opening galas, as well as access to casting calls and modeling opportunities throughout New York City. When Donald Trump owned the pageant, the winner was given the use of a Trump Place apartment in New York City during her reign, which she shared with the Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA titleholders. If the winner, for any reason, cannot fulfill her duties as Miss USA, including if she wins the title of Miss Universe, the 1st runner-up takes over.\n\n{{see also|Miss USA 2015#Controversy}}\nIn late-June 2015, both NBC and Spanish-language network [[Univision]] (which was to begin a new five-year contract for Spanish rights) announced that they would cut their ties with Donald Trump and the Miss Universe Organization in response to remarks Trump made relating to undocumented immigrants during the launch of his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]].

delegates, and recognizes those who are the friendliest and make the pageant experience the most enjoyable. From 1952 to 1964, when the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants were concurrent events, the award could be won by a contestant competing either for Miss USA or Miss Universe. In fact, in 1960, there was a tie, with the award going to [[Miss Universe Myanmar|Miss Universe Burma]], Myint Myint May, and [[Miss Louisiana USA]], Rebecca Fletcher. In 2015, [[Miss Alaska USA|Alaska]] and [[Miss Delaware USA|Delaware]] tied for the Miss Congeniality award. [[Miss Vermont USA|Vermont]] and [[Miss Wyoming USA|Wyoming]] have won five Miss Amity/Congeniality awards, two more than any other state.\n\nThe Miss Photogenic prize was first awarded in 1965 and was chosen by journalists until 1996 when it was chosen by an internet vote for the first time. There has been only one tie in this award's history: in 1980, when it was shared between [[Jineane Ford]] of [[Miss Arizona USA|Arizona]] and Elizabeth Kim Thomas of [[Miss Ohio USA|Ohio]]. The state that has won the most Photogenic awards is [[Miss Virginia USA|Virginia]].\n\n[[Miss Louisiana USA|Louisiana]] won both the first Miss Amity and Photogenic awards given to a Miss USA contestant.\n\nOther awards that have been presented include Best State Costume (1962\u20131993), Style (1995\u20132001) and Most Beautiful Eyes (1993). In 1998, a special Distinguished Achievement award was given to [[Halle Berry]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Shawnae Jebbia of Massachusetts Crowned \"Miss USA 1998\" |publisher=Business Wire|date=2007-03-11}}</ref> Berry was [[Miss Ohio USA]] 1986 and placed 1st runner-up to [[Christy Fichtner]] of [[Miss Texas USA|Texas]]. She later went on to become an acclaimed actress and [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] winner.\n\n==Locations==\nIn the first eight years of competition (1952\u20131959), the Miss USA pageant was held in [[Long Beach, California]]. The competition moved to [[Miami Beach, Florida]] in 1960 and stayed there until 1971. In 1972, the pageant was held in [[Puerto Rico]], the only time the pageant has been held outside the continental United States. That pageant was rocked by an explosion at the host hotel.<ref>{{cite news|title=Explosion of undetermined cause rocks site of Miss USA pageant|publisher=New York Times Abstracts|date=1972-05-21|page=35}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1972 onwards, the pageant has been held in various locations, generally being held in each location for two to three years.\n\nAs of 2019, the pageant has been held in the following states:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*'''[[Alabama]]'''\n**[[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] (1989)\n*'''[[California]]'''\n**[[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] (1952\u20131959)\n**[[Los Angeles]] (2004, 2007) \n*'''[[Florida]]'''\n**[[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] (1960\u20131971)\n**[[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]] (1984\u20131985)\n**[[Miami]] (1986)\n*'''[[Indiana]]'''\n**[[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] (2001\u20132002)\n*'''[[Kansas]]'''\n**[[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] (1990\u20131993)\n{{col-3}}\n*'''[[Louisiana]]'''\n**[[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] (1997\u20131998, 2018)\n**[[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] (2014\u20132015)\n*'''[[Maryland]]'''\n**[[Baltimore]] (2005\u20132006)\n*'''[[Missouri]]'''\n**[[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] (1999\u20132000)\n*'''[[Mississippi]]'''\n**[[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] (1979\u20131982)\n*'''[[Nevada]]'''\n**[[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] (2008\u20132013, 2016\u20132017)\n**[[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] (2019)\n{{col-3}}\n*'''[[New Mexico]]'''\n**[[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] (1987)\n*'''[[New York (state)|New York]]'''\n**[[New York City]] (1973)\n**[[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] (1974\u20131976)\n*'''[[South Carolina]]'''\n**[[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] (1977\u20131978)\n*'''[[Tennessee]]'''\n**[[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] (1983)\n*'''[[Texas]]'''\n**[[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] (1988)\n**[[South Padre Island, Texas|South Padre Island]] (1994\u20131996)\n**[[San Antonio]] (2003)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Special feature episodes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nSince 2003, a number of delegates have been involved in special episodes of regular programs broadcast by [[NBC]]. From 2003\u20132005, six delegates each year were chosen to participate in a special Miss USA edition of ''[[Fear Factor]]'', with the victorious contestant taking the title \"Miss Fear Factor USA\" and a prize of [[United States dollar|$]]50,000 ($25,000 of which was to be donated to a charity of the winner's choice). These were broadcast immediately prior to the live pageant broadcast.\n\nIn 2006, [[Chelsea Cooley]] and twenty-six delegates participated as briefcase models in a Miss USA special of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]''.\n\nIn 2010, ten Miss USA and Miss Universe winners competed for charity on a special \"Last Beauty Standing\" edition of ''[[Minute to Win It]]''.\n\n==Reality television==\nMany Miss USA and Miss Teen USA delegates have participated in [[reality television]] shows and other television [[game show]]s.

Like several other villages, when the railroad company placed the name on the station, the name was spelled Eldorado, instead of Elderedo, and it has been known by that name since that time.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe city provided relief efforts to neighboring communities affected by the [[Ohio River flood of 1937|Ohio River Flood of 1937.]] Shelter was provided at the city hall, and food provided by the Calvary Baptist Church, led by the Red Cross with local help.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyregister.com/news/20170208/river-ravaged-region|title=River-ravaged region|last=DENEAL|first=BY TRAVIS|date=2017-02-08|website=The Daily Register|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref> When the [[2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak|Leap Day Tornado]] of 2012 struck nearby Harrisburg, Eldorado immediately provided emergency assistance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyregister.com/article/20170228/news/170229765/|title=Leap Day Tornado remembered|last=DENEAL|first=BY TRAVIS|date=2017-02-28|website=The Daily Register|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref>\n\nCurrent and former residents often reflect with nostalgia growing up in Eldorado, and doing business in the downtown area.
