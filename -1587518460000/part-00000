At age 13 he left his home and joined a theatrical company at [[Fulham]], where he played Altamont in the ''Fair Penitent'', receiving three shillings as a share in the profits. For some years, in [[Kent]] and [[Surrey]], he played Romeo, George Barnewell, Hamlet, Jaffier, Tancred, and other tragic characters, and in 1767 was at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] under the management of [[Samuel Foote]], with [[Edward Shuter]], [[John Bannister (actor)|John Bannister]], and [[John Palmer (actor)|John Palmer]]. His performance, for Shuter's benefit, of Mordecai in ''Love \u00e0 la Mode'' commended him to [[Covent Garden]], where, on 7 November 1767, he was the original Postboy in Colman's ''Oxonian in Town''; on 14 December the First Ferret in the ''Royal Merchant'', an operatic version of the ''Beggar's Bush''; and on 29 January 1768 the original Postboy in [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''Good-natured Man''. At Covent Garden, with occasional visits to [[Liverpool]], [[Portsmouth]], and other towns, and to [[Bristol]], where he was for a time manager of the King Street Theatre, Quick remained during most of his career.\n\nQuick's performances were at first as clowns, rustics, or comic servants. He was seen as Peter in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Simon Pure in ''A Bold Stroke for a Wife'', Third Witch in ''[[Macbeth (play)|Macbeth]]'', Gripe in the ''Cheats of Scapin'', the First Gravedigger in ''[[Hamlet]]'', and many similar characters. His original parts at this period included Ostler in Colman's ''Man and Wife, or the Shakespeare Jubilee'', Skiff in [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]]'s ''Brothers'' on 2 December 1769, and clown to the harlequin of [[Charles Lee Lewes]] in the pantomime of ''Mother Shipton'' on 26 December 1770. On 5 June 1772 Quick was playing a theatre in Liverpool as Prattle in ''The Deuce is in him''. At Covent Garden he was, on 8 December 1772, the original Consol in O'Brien's ''Cross Purposes'', and on 6 February 1773 the original Momus in O'Hara's ''Golden Pippin''.\n\nThese performances paved the way for his triumph, on 14 March, as the original Tony Lumpkin in ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]''. The character had been refused by [[Henry Woodward (English actor)|Henry Woodward]]. The following season (1773\u20134) saw him promoted to Mawworm in the ''Hypocrite'', Grumio, Varland in the ''West Indian'', and Autolycus Mufti in ''Don Sebastian''. On 31 January 1774 he played Old Rents in the ''Jovial Crew,'' Foresight and Town Clerk in ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]''; and on 17 January 1775 he was the first Bob Acres in ''[[The Rivals]]''. Scores of comic characters were then assigned to him.\n\n[[File:DewildeQuick.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel De Wilde]], Portrait of the actor John Quick as Vellum, 1792.]]\nOn 6 April 1790, for his benefit, Quick appeared as Richard III. He took the character seriously at the outset, until the laughter of the audience proved irresistible. On 14 March 1791 Quick created the part of Cockletop, an antiquary, in O'Keeffe's ''Modern Antiques'', and on 16 April that of Sir George Thunder in his ''Wild Oats''. On 18 February 1792 he was the first Silky in Holcroft's ''Road to Ruin'', on 23 January 1793 the first Solus in Mrs. Inchbald's ''Every one has his Fault'', on 5 February 1794. He created many further parts in the years that followed. On 11 April 1798, for his benefit, he gave a description of the Roman puppet show. On 13 April he played his last original part, probably Admiral Delroy, in Cumberland's ''Eccentric Lover''.\n\nAround this time, in declining health, he resigned his long engagement at Covent Garden. To his disappointment he was not engaged the following season. On 9 May 1799, for the benefit of Miss Leak, he appeared for the first time at [[Drury Lane]], and played Hardy in the ''Belle's Stratagem'', and Lovegold in the ''Miser''. On 12 June 1800, for O'Keeffe's benefit, he played at Covent Garden Alibi in the ''Lie of the Day'', and Drugget in ''Three Weeks after Marriage''; and for another benefit appeared next day as Isaac in ''[[The Duenna]]''.\n\nIn 1809 he took a tour in the north, appearing in Edinburgh, 25 January, as Sir Benjamin Dove in the ''Brothers.'' In 1809, in the same character, he made his first appearance at the Lyceum. On 24 May 1813 he came again out of retirement, taking part at the Haymarket Opera House in a benefit to Mrs. Mattocks, in which he played Don Felix in the ''Wonder''.\n\nOut of his earnings he saved \u00a310,000, on the interest of which he lived, residing during his later years in Hornsey Row, subsequently Will's Row, [[Islington]]. He used to preside over a gathering held at the King's Head tavern, Islington. He died on 4 April 1831, and was buried beneath the old chapel-of-ease at [[Lower Holloway]]. In early life he married at Bristol the daughter of a clergyman named Parker, and had by her a son, William, and a daughter, Mrs. Mary Anne Davenport. He was so small in frame that [[Anthony Pasquin]] calls him \"the smart tiny Quick\".

{"title_page": "List of home video game consoles", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{VG history|expandmenu=2}}\n\nThis is a '''list of home video game consoles''' in chronological order, which includes all known [[home video game console]]s after the first generation, from the first console, [[Magnavox Odyssey]], to the first ever [[ROM cartridge]]-based console [[Fairchild Channel F]], ranging from the major video game companies such as [[Magnavox]], [[Atari]], [[Fairchild]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, [[Intellivision|Intellivision Entertainment]], [[Coleco]], [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]], [[NEC]], [[The 3DO Company|3DO]], [[SNK]], [[Sony]], and [[Microsoft]] to modern market consoles.\n\nThis list is divided into eras which are named based on the dominant console type of the era, though not all consoles of those eras are of the same type. Some eras are referred to based on how many bits a major console could process. The \"128-bit era\" ([[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]]) was the final era in which this practice was widespread.\n\nThis list does not include other types of [[video game console]]s such as [[handheld game console]]s, which are usually of lower computational power than [[home console]]s due to their smaller size, [[microconsoles]], which are usually low-cost Android-based devices that rely on downloading, or [[dedicated console]]s past the first generation, which have games built in and do not use any form of physical media. Consoles have been redesigned from time to time to improve their market appeal. Redesigned models are not listed on their own.\n\n== Map key ==\nThere are a total of '''{{#expr:{{table row counter|id=2gencon|ignore=2}}+{{table row counter|id=3gencon|ignore=3}}+{{table row counter|id=4gencon|ignore=5}}+{{table row counter|id=5gencon|ignore=1}}+{{table row counter|id=6gencon|ignore=3}}+{{table row counter|id=7gencon|ignore=2}}+{{table row counter|id=8gencon|ignore=1}}}}''' video game platforms released since the second generation, and '''10''' canceled platforms.\n\nThis list only counts the first iteration of each console's hardware, because several systems have had slim, enhanced or other hardware revisions, but they aren't individually listed here. The list also includes unreleased systems. If a series of home video game consoles begins in a generation and lasts to another generation, it is listed in the generation the series began. This list does not claim to be complete.\n\n:{{legend|{{{1|#b6fcb6}}}|size=50%| ''Background shading indicates the [[List of best-selling game consoles|best-selling console]] of each respective generation.'' }}\n:{{legend|{{{1|#FFE8E8}}}|size=50%| ''Background shading indicates canceled systems that either stopped being developed at any stage or were canceled.'' }}\n:{{Legend|| outline = #FFFFFF|size=50%|{{Hash-tag}} ''Hash-tags indicate console series/platforms that have different hardware revisions.''}}\n\n== First generation (1972\u20131984) ==\n{{Main article|List of first generation home video game consoles}}{{See also|First generation of video game consoles}}\n\nThere were '''{{table row counter|id=genonecon|page=List of first generation home video game consoles|ignore=1}}''' home video game consoles known to have been released in the first generation of video game consoles.

Some eras are referred to based on how many bits a major console could process. The \"128-bit era\" ([[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]]) was the final era in which this practice was widespread.\n\nThis list does not include other types of [[video game console]]s such as [[handheld game console]]s, which are usually of lower computational power than [[home console]]s due to their smaller size, [[microconsoles]], which are usually low-cost Android-based devices that rely on downloading, or [[dedicated console]]s past the first generation, which have games built in and do not use any form of physical media. Consoles have been redesigned from time to time to improve their market appeal.
