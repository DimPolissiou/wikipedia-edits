Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled \"Antarctica\", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size. Integral to the story of the origin of Antarctica's name is that it was not named ''Terra Australis''\u2014this name was [[Australia#Etymology|given to Australia instead]], because of the misconception that no significant landmass could exist further south. Explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name ''Terra Australis'' to Australia. He justified the titling of his book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' (1814) by writing in the introduction:\n\n{{quote|There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.<ref>Flinders, Matthew.

Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.\n\n====Palaeozoic era (540\u2013250 Ma)====\nDuring the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416 [[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.<ref name=\"Stonehouse\">{{cite book|editor-last=Stonehouse|editor-first=B.|title=Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans|date=June 2002|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-98665-2 }}</ref>\n\n====Mesozoic era (250\u201366 Ma)====\nAs a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, [[seed fern]]s or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as \"mammal-like reptiles\", were common in Antarctica during the [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206\u2013146 Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean.

This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to East Antarctica.\n\nEast Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[fault (geology)|faulting]] has occurred.\n\nThe main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.<ref name=\"Trewby2002\" /> It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains.

The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas field]]s found in the Ross Sea in 1973.

In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the [[equator]] because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.<ref name=\"CIAfactbook-People\" />\n\nAntarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the [[troposphere]]. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at [[aphelion]] in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at [[perihelion]] in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.<ref>[http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/orbitsun.htm The Earth's Elliptical Orbit Around the Sun \u2013 Aphelion and Perihelion].

The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the [[Adelie Land meteorite]]. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.

This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. [[Precipitation]] is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice stream]]s, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.\n\nSea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica (in terms of square kilometers of coverage) has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the amount of variation it has experienced in its thickness is unclear.<ref name=\"United Nations Environment Programme\">{{cite web|title=Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.grida.no/resources/5268}}</ref><ref name=\"National Snow and Ice Data Center\">{{cite web|title=All About Sea Ice: Characteristics: Arctic vs. Antarctic|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317034609/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archivedate=17 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nMelting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However, it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.<ref name=\"RignotCasassa2004\">{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL020697| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Casassa | first2 = G.| last3 = Gogineni | first3 = P.| last4 = Krabill | first4 = W.| last5 = Rivera | first5 = A.| last6 = Thomas | first6 = R.| date = 2004| title = Accelerated ice discharge from the Antarctic Peninsula following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 31| issue = 18| pages = L18401| url = http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2011| bibcode = 2004GeoRL..3118401R| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123070917/http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| archivedate=23 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\" /> This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.\n\nSheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changing in mass by +14 \u00b1 43, \u221265 \u00b1 26, and \u221220 \u00b1 14 [[gigatonnes]] (Gt) per year.<ref name=\"IMBIE2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 338 | issue=6111 | pages = 1183\u20131189 | date = 30 November 2012 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228102| pmid = 23197528 | bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1183S | hdl = 2060/20140006608 | url = https://escholarship.org/content/qt0vq404h7/qt0vq404h7.pdf?t=nuixw6 }}</ref> The same group's 2018 [[systematic review]] study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.<ref name=\"IMBIE2018\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 558 | issue = 7709 | pages = 219\u2013222 | date = 13 June 2018 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y | pmid = 29899482 | lay-url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/latest-estimate-shows-how-much-antarctic-ice-has-fallen-into-the-sea/ | lay-source = [[Ars Technica]] | lay-date = 13 June 2018| bibcode = 2018Natur.558..219I | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132373/8/IMBIE2_accepted_v16.pdf }}</ref> NASA's Climate Change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.<ref name=\"landice\">{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/ |title=Land Ice |publisher=NASA Global Climate Change |accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nA single 2015 study by H.

Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6&nbsp;\u00b0C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the [[polar vortex]]) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.<ref name=\"schiermeier2009\"/> Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Turner J.|author2=Comiso J.C.|author3=Marshall G.J.|author4=Lachlan-Cope T.A.|author5=Bracegirdle T.|author6=Maksym T.|author7=Meredith M.P., Wang Z.|author8= Orr A.|title=Non-annular atmospheric circulation change induced by stratospheric ozone depletion and its role in the recent increase of Antarctic sea ice extent|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=36|pages=L08502|date=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037524|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.8502T|issue=8|url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/8058/1/grl25793.pdf}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Geography}}\n* [[Antarctica Weather Danger Classification]]\n* [[Antarctic Plate]]\n* [[Crime in Antarctica]]\n* [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age|Holarctic-Antarctic Ice Age]]\n* [[List of mountain ranges#Antarctica|List of mountain ranges in Antarctica]]\n* [[List of volcanoes in Antarctica]]\n* [[Lists of places in Antarctica]]\n* [[North Pole]]\n* [[Religion in Antarctica]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Antarctica|n=Portal:Antarctica|m=no|mw=no}}\n* High resolution map (2018) \u2013 [https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/ Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica] ([[REMA]])\n* {{In Our Time|Antarctica.|b00ss2th|Antarctica. }}\n* {{curlie|Regional/Polar_Regions/Antarctic/|Antarctic region}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|ay|Antarctica}}\n* [http://www.bsae2012.co.uk/ British Services Antarctic Expedition 2012]\n* [http://www.ats.aq/ Antarctic Treaty Secretariat], ''de facto'' government\n* [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/ British Antarctic Survey (BAS)]\n* [http://www.usap.gov/ U.S. Antarctic Program Portal]\n* [http://www.antarctica.gov.au/ Australian Antarctic Division]\n* [https://www.loc.gov/rr/international/frd/antarctica/antarctica.html Portals on the World \u2013 Antarctica] from the [[Library of Congress]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150214121701/http://lima.nasa.gov/ NASA's LIMA] (Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica) ([http://lima.usgs.gov/ USGS mirror])\n* [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov The Antarctic Sun] (Online newspaper of the U.S. Antarctic Program)\n* [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/antarctica-and-nz Antarctica and New Zealand (NZHistory.net.nz)]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/08/23/science/23saw_antarctica.html Journey to Antarctica in 1959]\n* Listen to Ernest Shackleton describing his 1908 [http://aso.gov.au/titles/spoken-word/my-south-polar-expedition South Pole Expedition]\n* [http://cdn.antarcticglaciers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Antarctic_subglacial_lakes.jpg Map of Antarctican subglacial lakes]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_om9h7vQXh0 Video: The Bedrock Beneath Antarctica]\n* [https://www.coolantarctica.com/Community/antarctic_slang.php Slang used in Antarctica]\n* [https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/310 The Papers of Henry Francis Jr.] at Dartmouth College Library\n{{Antarctica |expanded}}\n{{Continents of the world}}\n{{Deserts}}\n{{Polar exploration |state=collapsed}}\n{{Countries and territories bordering the Indian Ocean}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{coord|-90|0|region:AQ_scale:60000000|display=title}}\n{{Featured article}}\n\n[[Category:Antarctica| ]]\n[[Category:Antarctic region]]\n[[Category:Continents]]\n[[Category:Demilitarized zones]]\n[[Category:Extreme points of Earth]]\n[[Category:Polar regions of the Earth]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the continent}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Continent}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox continent\n|title = Antarctica\n|image = Antarctica (orthographic projection).svg <!--Please see discussion or contribute to discussion if you are considering replacing this image-->\n|image_size = 256px\n|alt = This map uses an orthographic projection, near-polar aspect.

Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled \"Antarctica\", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.

Explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name ''Terra Australis'' to Australia. He justified the titling of his book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' (1814) by writing in the introduction:\n\n{{quote|There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.<ref>Flinders, Matthew.

Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.\n\n====Palaeozoic era (540\u2013250 Ma)====\nDuring the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416 [[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.<ref name=\"Stonehouse\">{{cite book|editor-last=Stonehouse|editor-first=B.|title=Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans|date=June 2002|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-98665-2 }}</ref>\n\n====Mesozoic era (250\u201366 Ma)====\nAs a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, [[seed fern]]s or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as \"mammal-like reptiles\", were common in Antarctica during the [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206\u2013146 Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees, conifers, bennettites, horsetails, ferns and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period.

This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period.

The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to East Antarctica.\n\nEast Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[fault (geology)|faulting]] has occurred.\n\nThe main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.<ref name=\"Trewby2002\" /> It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains.

Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods.

In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the [[equator]] because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.<ref name=\"CIAfactbook-People\" />\n\nAntarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the [[troposphere]]. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at [[aphelion]] in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at [[perihelion]] in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.<ref>[http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/orbitsun.htm The Earth's Elliptical Orbit Around the Sun \u2013 Aphelion and Perihelion].

The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the [[Adelie Land meteorite]]. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.<ref name=\"meteorite\">{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|title=Meteorites from Antarctica|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306122117/http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|archivedate=6 March 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThis large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets.

These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies.

This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. [[Precipitation]] is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice stream]]s, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.\n\nSea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica (in terms of square kilometers of coverage) has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the amount of variation it has experienced in its thickness is unclear.<ref name=\"United Nations Environment Programme\">{{cite web|title=Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.grida.no/resources/5268}}</ref><ref name=\"National Snow and Ice Data Center\">{{cite web|title=All About Sea Ice: Characteristics: Arctic vs. Antarctic|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317034609/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archivedate=17 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nMelting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However, it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.<ref name=\"RignotCasassa2004\">{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL020697| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Casassa | first2 = G.| last3 = Gogineni | first3 = P.| last4 = Krabill | first4 = W.| last5 = Rivera | first5 = A.| last6 = Thomas | first6 = R.| date = 2004| title = Accelerated ice discharge from the Antarctic Peninsula following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 31| issue = 18| pages = L18401| url = http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2011| bibcode = 2004GeoRL..3118401R| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123070917/http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| archivedate=23 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\" /> This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.\n\nSheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changing in mass by +14 \u00b1 43, \u221265 \u00b1 26, and \u221220 \u00b1 14 [[gigatonnes]] (Gt) per year.<ref name=\"IMBIE2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 338 | issue=6111 | pages = 1183\u20131189 | date = 30 November 2012 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228102| pmid = 23197528 | bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1183S | hdl = 2060/20140006608 | url = https://escholarship.org/content/qt0vq404h7/qt0vq404h7.pdf?t=nuixw6 }}</ref> The same group's 2018 [[systematic review]] study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.<ref name=\"IMBIE2018\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 558 | issue = 7709 | pages = 219\u2013222 | date = 13 June 2018 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y | pmid = 29899482 | lay-url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/latest-estimate-shows-how-much-antarctic-ice-has-fallen-into-the-sea/ | lay-source = [[Ars Technica]] | lay-date = 13 June 2018| bibcode = 2018Natur.558..219I | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132373/8/IMBIE2_accepted_v16.pdf }}</ref> NASA's Climate Change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.<ref name=\"landice\">{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/ |title=Land Ice |publisher=NASA Global Climate Change |accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nA single 2015 study by H.

Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6&nbsp;\u00b0C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the [[polar vortex]]) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.<ref name=\"schiermeier2009\"/> Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Turner J.|author2=Comiso J.C.|author3=Marshall G.J.|author4=Lachlan-Cope T.A.|author5=Bracegirdle T.|author6=Maksym T.|author7=Meredith M.P., Wang Z.|author8= Orr A.|title=Non-annular atmospheric circulation change induced by stratospheric ozone depletion and its role in the recent increase of Antarctic sea ice extent|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=36|pages=L08502|date=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037524|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.8502T|issue=8|url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/8058/1/grl25793.pdf}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Geography}}\n* [[Antarctica Weather Danger Classification]]\n* [[Antarctic Plate]]\n* [[Crime in Antarctica]]\n* [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age|Holarctic-Antarctic Ice Age]]\n* [[List of mountain ranges#Antarctica|List of mountain ranges in Antarctica]]\n* [[List of volcanoes in Antarctica]]\n* [[Lists of places in Antarctica]]\n* [[North Pole]]\n* [[Religion in Antarctica]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Antarctica|n=Portal:Antarctica|m=no|mw=no}}\n* High resolution map (2018) \u2013 [https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/ Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica] ([[REMA]])\n* {{In Our Time|Antarctica.|b00ss2th|Antarctica. }}\n* {{curlie|Regional/Polar_Regions/Antarctic/|Antarctic region}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|ay|Antarctica}}\n* [http://www.bsae2012.co.uk/ British Services Antarctic Expedition 2012]\n* [http://www.ats.aq/ Antarctic Treaty Secretariat], ''de facto'' government\n* [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/ British Antarctic Survey (BAS)]\n* [http://www.usap.gov/ U.S. Antarctic Program Portal]\n* [http://www.antarctica.gov.au/ Australian Antarctic Division]\n* [https://www.loc.gov/rr/international/frd/antarctica/antarctica.html Portals on the World \u2013 Antarctica] from the [[Library of Congress]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150214121701/http://lima.nasa.gov/ NASA's LIMA] (Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica) ([http://lima.usgs.gov/ USGS mirror])\n* [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov The Antarctic Sun] (Online newspaper of the U.S. Antarctic Program)\n* [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/antarctica-and-nz Antarctica and New Zealand (NZHistory.net.nz)]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/08/23/science/23saw_antarctica.html Journey to Antarctica in 1959]\n* Listen to Ernest Shackleton describing his 1908 [http://aso.gov.au/titles/spoken-word/my-south-polar-expedition South Pole Expedition]\n* [http://cdn.antarcticglaciers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Antarctic_subglacial_lakes.jpg Map of Antarctican subglacial lakes]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_om9h7vQXh0 Video: The Bedrock Beneath Antarctica]\n* [https://www.coolantarctica.com/Community/antarctic_slang.php Slang used in Antarctica]\n* [https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/310 The Papers of Henry Francis Jr.] at Dartmouth College Library\n{{Antarctica |expanded}}\n{{Continents of the world}}\n{{Deserts}}\n{{Polar exploration |state=collapsed}}\n{{Countries and territories bordering the Indian Ocean}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{coord|-90|0|region:AQ_scale:60000000|display=title}}\n{{Featured article}}\n\n[[Category:Antarctica| ]]\n[[Category:Antarctic region]]\n[[Category:Continents]]\n[[Category:Demilitarized zones]]\n[[Category:Extreme points of Earth]]\n[[Category:Polar regions of the Earth]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "DePiep", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:linked to in TFA nominations, so check for MOS and typos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica"}
