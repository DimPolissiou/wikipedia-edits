The government began to enact legislation for the preservation of sites and objects deemed significant to the nation\u2019s history. In 1872, an [[Act of Congress]] established the first [[National Park]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]].<ref name=\"Mulloy, Elizabeth 1976 p.6\">{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=6}}</ref> In 1906, the [[Antiquities Act]] enabled the President to declare landmarks or objects as a [[National monument (United States)|national monument]].<ref name=\"Mulloy, Elizabeth 1976 p.6\"/> Then in 1935, during the Great Depression, Congress passed the [[Historic Sites Act]], which outlined programs for research and inventory of historic sites.<ref>{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=8}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, historic preservation initiatives existed on local and state levels. In 1931, [[Charleston, South Carolina]] created the first [[historic district]] for protection.<ref>{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=7}}</ref> However, efforts to save and maintain historic sites were still largely limited to private citizens or local groups.\n\nIn the late 1940s, leaders in American historic preservation saw the need for a national organization to support local preservation efforts. In 1946, [[David E. Finley, Jr.]], [[George McAneny]], Christopher Crittenden, and Ronald Lee met at the [[National Gallery of Art]] to discuss the formation of such a national organization.<ref name=\"Finley, David E 1965 p.2\">{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=2}}</ref> This meeting was followed by a larger gathering on April 15, 1947, attended by representatives from a number of art, architectural, and [[historical societies]], which culminated in the creation of the National Council for Historic Sites and Buildings.<ref name=\"Finley, David E 1965 p.2\"/> The meeting\u2019s attendants became the first charter members of the Council.<ref name=\"Finley, David E 1965 p.3\">{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=3}}</ref> The organization\u2019s first headquarters was in the offices of [[Ford\u2019s Theatre|Ford\u2019s Theatre (Lincoln Museum)]] in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Council pursued the formation of a National Trust for Historic Preservation, somewhat modeled on the British [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], which would be tasked with the acquisition and maintenance of historic properties.<ref name=\"Finley, David E 1965 p.3\"/> The creation of the National Trust was proposed as a bill to Congress, H.R. 5170, introduced by Congressman J.

The government began to enact legislation for the preservation of sites and objects deemed significant to the nation\u2019s history. In 1872, an [[Act of Congress]] established the first [[National Park]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]].<ref name=\"Mulloy, Elizabeth 1976 p.6\">{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=6}}</ref> In 1906, the [[Antiquities Act]] enabled the President to declare landmarks or objects as a [[National monument (United States)|national monument]].<ref name=\"Mulloy, Elizabeth 1976 p.6\"/> Then in 1935, during the Great Depression, Congress passed the [[Historic Sites Act]], which outlined programs for research and inventory of historic sites.<ref>{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=8}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, historic preservation initiatives existed on local and state levels. In 1931, [[Charleston, South Carolina]] created the first [[historic district]] for protection.<ref>{{harvp|Mulloy|1976|p=7}}</ref> However, efforts to save and maintain historic sites were still largely limited to private citizens or local groups.\n\nIn the late 1940s, leaders in American historic preservation saw the need for a national organization to support local preservation efforts. In 1946, [[David E. Finley, Jr.]], [[George McAneny]], Christopher Crittenden, and Ronald Lee met at the [[National Gallery of Art]] to discuss the formation of such a national organization.<ref name=\"Finley, David E 1965 p.2\">{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=2}}</ref> This meeting was followed by a larger gathering on April 15, 1947, attended by representatives from a number of art, architectural, and [[historical societies]], which culminated in the creation of the National Council for Historic Sites and Buildings.<ref name=\"Finley, David E 1965 p.2\"/> The meeting\u2019s attendants became the first charter members of the Council.<ref name=\"Finley, David E 1965 p.3\">{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=3}}</ref> The organization\u2019s first headquarters was in the offices of [[Ford\u2019s Theatre|Ford\u2019s Theatre (Lincoln Museum)]] in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvp|Finley|1965|p=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Council pursued the formation of a National Trust for Historic Preservation, somewhat modeled on the British [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], which would be tasked with the acquisition and maintenance of historic properties.<ref name=\"Finley, David E 1965 p.3\"/> The creation of the National Trust was proposed as a bill to Congress, H.R. 5170, introduced by Congressman J.

On the other hand, grain boundaries disrupt the motion of [[dislocation]]s through a material, so reducing crystallite size is a common way to improve mechanical strength, as described by the [[Hall\u2013Petch]] relationship. The study of grain boundaries and their effects on the mechanical, electrical and other properties of materials forms an important topic in [[materials science]].\n\n== High and low angle boundaries ==\n{{more sources|section|date=August 2018}}\nIt is convenient to categorize grain boundaries according to the extent of [[misorientation]] between the two grains. ''Low-angle grain boundaries'' or ''subgrain boundaries'' are those with a misorientation less than about 15 degrees.<ref>Physical Foundations of Materials Science; Gottstein, G\u00fcnter; 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-662-09291-0}}</ref> Generally speaking they are composed of an array of [[dislocation]]s and their properties and structure are a function of the misorientation. In contrast the properties of ''high-angle grain boundaries'', whose misorientation is greater than about 15 degrees (the transition angle varies from 10\u201315 degrees depending on the material), are normally found to be independent of the misorientation. However, there are 'special boundaries' at particular orientations whose interfacial energies are markedly lower than those of general high-angle grain boundaries.\n[[Image:TiltAndTwistBoundaries remade.svg|thumb|Schematic representations of a tilt boundary (top) and a twist boundary between two idealised grains.]]\n\nThe simplest boundary is that of a tilt boundary where the rotation axis is parallel to the boundary plane. This boundary can be conceived as forming from a single, contiguous [[crystallite]] or grain which is gradually bent by some external force. The energy associated with the elastic bending of the lattice can be reduced by inserting a dislocation, which is essentially a half-plane of atoms that act like a wedge, that creates a permanent misorientation between the two sides. As the grain is bent further, more and more dislocations must be introduced to accommodate the deformation resulting in a growing wall of dislocations \u2013 a low-angle boundary. The grain can now be considered to have split into two sub-grains of related crystallography but notably different orientations.\n\nAn alternative is a twist boundary where the misorientation occurs around an axis that is perpendicular to the boundary plane. This type of boundary incorporates two sets of [[dislocation|screw dislocations]]. If the [[Burgers vector]]s of the dislocations are orthogonal, then the dislocations do not strongly interact and form a square network. In other cases, the dislocations may interact to form a more complex hexagonal structure.\n\nThese concepts of tilt and twist boundaries represent somewhat idealized cases. The majority of boundaries are of a mixed type, containing dislocations of different types and Burgers vectors, in order to create the best fit between the neighboring grains.\n\nIf the dislocations in the boundary remain isolated and distinct, the boundary can be considered to be low-angle. If deformation continues, the density of dislocations will increase and so reduce the spacing between neighboring dislocations. Eventually, the cores of the dislocations will begin to overlap and the ordered nature of the boundary will begin to break down. At this point the boundary can be considered to be high-angle and the original grain to have separated into two entirely separate grains.\n\nIn comparison to low-angle grain boundaries, high-angle boundaries are considerably more disordered, with large areas of poor fit and a comparatively open structure. Indeed, they were originally thought to be some form of amorphous or even liquid layer between the grains. However, this model could not explain the observed strength of grain boundaries and, after the invention of [[electron microscopy]], direct evidence of the grain structure meant the hypothesis had to be discarded. It is now accepted that a boundary consists of structural units which depend on both the misorientation of the two grains and the plane of the interface. The types of structural unit that exist can be related to the concept of the ''coincidence site lattice'', in which repeated units are formed from points where the two misoriented lattices happen to coincide.\n\nIn coincident site lattice (CSL) theory, the degree of fit (\u03a3) between the structures of the two grains is described by the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the ratio of coincidence sites to the total number of sites.<ref>{{cite journal \n|last1=Grimmer \n|first1=H. \n|last2=Bollmann \n|first2=W. \n|last3=Warrington \n|first3=D. H. \n|title=Coincidence-site lattices and complete pattern-shift in cubic crystals \n|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A \n|date=1 March 1974 \n|volume=30 \n|issue=2 \n|pages=197\u2013207 \n|doi=10.1107/S056773947400043X|bibcode=1974AcCrA..30..197G \n}}\n</ref>\nIn this framework, it is possible to draw the lattice for the 2 grains and count the number of atoms that are shared (coincidence sites), and the total number of atoms on the boundary (total number of site). For example, when \u03a3=3 there will be one atom of each three that will be shared between the two lattices. Thus a boundary with high \u03a3 might be expected to have a higher energy than one with low \u03a3. Low-angle boundaries, where the distortion is entirely accommodated by dislocations, are \u03a31. Some other low-\u03a3 boundaries have special properties, especially when the boundary plane is one that contains a high density of coincident sites. Examples include coherent [[Crystal twinning|twin]] boundaries (e.g., \u03a33) and high-mobility boundaries in FCC materials (e.g., \u03a37). Deviations from the ideal CSL orientation may be accommodated by local atomic relaxation or the inclusion of dislocations at the boundary.\n\n== Describing a boundary ==\n\nA boundary can be described by the orientation of the boundary to the two grains and the 3-D rotation required to bring the grains into coincidence. Thus a boundary has 5 macroscopic [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. However, it is common to describe a boundary only as the orientation relationship of the neighbouring grains. Generally, the convenience of ignoring the boundary plane orientation, which is very difficult to determine, outweighs the reduced information.\nThe relative orientation of the two grains is described using the [[rotation matrix]]:\n\n[[Image:GrainBoundaryOrientationDistribution.png|thumb|The characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations in a completely randomly oriented set of grains for cubic symmetry materials.]]\n\n:<math> R = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \n                         \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\n                         \\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nUsing this system the rotation angle \u03b8 is:\n\n: <math> 2\\cos\\;\\theta\\;+1 = a_{11} + a_{22} + a_{33} \\,\\! </math>\n\nwhile the direction [uvw] of the rotation axis is:\n\n: <math> [(a_{32}-a_{23}),(a_{13}-a_{31}),(a_{21}-a_{12})] \\,\\! </math>\n\nThe nature of the [[crystallography]] involved limits the misorientation of the boundary. A completely random polycrystal, with no texture, thus has a characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations (see figure). However, such cases are rare and most materials will deviate from this ideal to a greater or lesser degree.\n\n== Boundary energy ==\n\n[[Image:GrainBoundaryEnergy.png|thumb|The energy of a tilt boundary and the energy per dislocation as the misorientation of the boundary increases]]\n\nThe energy of a low-angle boundary is dependent on the degree of misorientation between the neighbouring grains up to the transition to high-angle status. In the case of simple ''tilt boundaries'' the energy of a boundary made up of dislocations with Burgers vector ''b'' and spacing ''h'' is predicted by the '''Read\u2013Shockley equation''':\n\n: <math> \\gamma _s = \\gamma _0 \\theta (A - \\ln \\theta) \\,\\! </math>\n\nwhere:\n\n: <math>\\theta = b / h \\,\\! </math>\n\n: <math>\\gamma_0 = Gb/4\\pi(1-\\nu) \\,\\! </math>\n\n: <math>A = 1 + \\ln(b/2\\pi r_0) \\,\\! </math>\n\nwith <math>G</math> is the [[shear modulus]], <math>\\nu</math> is [[Poisson's ratio]], and <math>r_0</math> is the radius of the dislocation core. It can be seen that as the energy of the boundary increases the energy per dislocation decreases. Thus there is a driving force to produce fewer, more misoriented boundaries (i.e., [[grain growth]]).\n\nThe situation in high-angle boundaries is more complex. Although theory predicts that the energy will be a minimum for ideal CSL configurations, with deviations requiring dislocations and other energetic features, empirical measurements suggest the relationship is more complicated. Some predicted troughs in energy are found as expected while others missing or substantially reduced. \nSurveys of the available experimental data have indicated that simple relationships such as low <math>\\Sigma</math> are misleading:\n\n<blockquote>It is concluded that no general and useful criterion for low energy can be enshrined in a simple geometric framework. Any understanding of the variations of interfacial energy must take account of the atomic structure and the details of the bonding at the interface.<ref>{{citation\n|first=A.

Excess volume was first proposed by Bishop in a private communication to Aaron and Bolling in 1972.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aaron |first1=H. B. |last2=Bolling |first2=G.

Despite the name the excess volume is actually a change in length, this is because of the 2D nature of GBs the length of interest is the expansion normal to the GB plane. The excess volume (<math>\\delta V</math>) is defined in the following way,\n\n: <math>\\delta V = \\left ( \\frac{\\partial V} {\\partial A} \\right)_{T,p,n_i}, </math>\n\nat constant temperature <math>T</math>, pressure <math>p</math> and number of atoms <math>n_i</math>. Although a rough linear relationship between GB energy and excess volume exists the orientations where this relationship is violated can behave significantly differently affecting mechanical and electrical properties.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wolf |first = D. | year = 1989 | title = Correlation between energy and volume expansion for grain boundaries in FCC metals | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1258258| journal = Scripta Metallurgica | volume = 23 | issue = 11| pages = 1913\u20131918 | doi = 10.1016/0036-9748(89)90482-1 }}</ref>\n\nExperimental techniques have been developed which directly probe the excess volume and have been used to explore the properties of nanocrystalline copper and [[nickel]].<ref>{{cite journal |first1=E.

A key observation is that there is an inverse relationship with the bulk modulus meaning that the larger the bulk modulus (the ability to compress a material) the smaller the excess volume will be, there is also direct relationship with the lattice constant, this provides methodology to find materials with a desirable excess volume for a specific application.\n\n== Boundary migration ==\n\nThe movement of grain boundaries (HAGB) has implications for [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] and [[grain growth]] while subgrain boundary (LAGB) movement strongly influences [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] and the nucleation of recrystallization.\n\nA boundary moves due to a pressure acting on it. It is generally assumed that the velocity is directly proportional to the pressure with the constant of proportionality being the mobility of the boundary. The mobility is strongly temperature dependent and often follows an [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius type relationship]]:\n\n: <math> M = M_0 \\exp \\left (- \\frac{Q}{RT} \\right ) \\,\\! </math>\n\nThe apparent activation energy (Q) may be related to the thermally activated atomistic processes that occur during boundary movement. However, there are several proposed mechanisms where the mobility will depend on the driving pressure and the assumed proportionality may break down.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the mobility of low-angle boundaries is much lower than that of high-angle boundaries. The following observations appear to hold true over a range of conditions:\n* The mobility of low-angle boundaries is proportional to the pressure acting on it.\n* The [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] controlling process is that of bulk [[diffusion]]\n* The boundary mobility increases with misorientation.\n\nSince low-angle boundaries are composed of arrays of dislocations and their movement may be related to dislocation theory. The most likely mechanism, given the experimental data, is that of dislocation climb, rate limited by the diffusion of solute in the bulk.<ref>{{citation\n|first=F. J. \n|last=Humphreys\n|first2=M.\n|last2=Hatherly\n|year=2004\n|title=Recrystallisation and related annealing phenomena\n|publisher=[[Elsevier]]\n|pages=xxx+628\n|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780080441641\n|isbn=978-0-08-044164-1\n|url-access=registration \n|via=[[ScienceDirect]]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe movement of high-angle boundaries occurs by the transfer of atoms between the neighbouring grains. The ease with which this can occur will depend on the structure of the boundary, itself dependent on the crystallography of the grains involved, impurity atoms and the temperature. It is possible that some form of diffusionless mechanism (akin to diffusionless phase transformations such as [[martensite]]) may operate in certain conditions. Some defects in the boundary, such as steps and ledges, may also offer alternative mechanisms for atomic transfer.\n\n[[Image:Grain growth inhibition.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Grain growth can be inhibited by second phase particles via [[Zener pinning]].]]\n\nSince a high-angle boundary is imperfectly packed compared to the normal lattice it has some amount of ''free space'' or ''free volume'' where solute atoms may possess a lower energy. As a result, a boundary may be associated with a ''solute atmosphere'' that will retard its movement. Only at higher velocities will the boundary be able to break free of its atmosphere and resume normal motion.\n\nBoth low- and high-angle boundaries are retarded by the presence of particles via the so-called [[Zener pinning]] effect. This effect is often exploited in commercial alloys to minimise or prevent recrystallization or [[grain growth]] during [[Annealing (metallurgy)|heat-treatment]].\n\n== Complexion ==\nGrain boundaries are the preferential site for segregation of impurities, which may form a thin layer with a different composition from the bulk. For example, a thin layer of silica, which also contains impurity cations, is often present in silicon nitride. These grain boundary phases are thermodynamically stable and can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional phase, which may undergo to transition, similar to those of bulk phases. In this case structure and chemistry abrupt changes are possible at a critical value of a thermodynamic parameter like temperature or pressure.<ref>Sutton AP, Balluffi RW. (1995) Interfaces in crystalline materials. Oxford: Oxford Scientific Publications.</ref> This may strongly affect the macroscopic properties of the material, for example the electrical resistance or creep rates.<ref>Hart EW (1972). The nature and behavior of grain boundaries. New York: Plenum; p. 155.</ref> Grain boundaries can be analyzed using equilibrium thermodynamics but cannot be considered as phases, because they do not satisfy Gibbs'definition: they are inhomogeneous, may have a gradient of structure, composition or properties. For this reasons they are defined as complexion: an interfacial material or stata that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its abutting phases, with a finite and stable thickness (that is typically 2\u201320 \u00c5). A complexion need the abutting phase to exist and its composition and structure need to be different from the abutting phase. Contrary to bulk phases, complexions also depend on the abutting phase. For example, silica rich amorphous layer present in Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>, is about 10 \u00c5 thick, but for special boundaries this equilibrium thickness is zero.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cantwell |first1=P.

In the first cases the thickness of the layer will be constant; if extra material is present it will segregate at multiple grain junction, while in the last case there is no equilibrium thickness and this is determined by the amount of secondary phase present in the material. One example of grain boundary complexion transition is the passage from dry boundary to biltilayer in Au-doped Si, which is produced by the increase of Au.<ref>Ma S. et al.

Grain boundaries are 2D [[crystallographic defect|defects]] in the [[crystal]] structure, and tend to decrease the [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of the material. Most grain boundaries are preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of new phases from the solid. They are also important to many of the mechanisms of [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. On the other hand, grain boundaries disrupt the motion of [[dislocation]]s through a material, so reducing crystallite size is a common way to improve mechanical strength, as described by the [[Hall\u2013Petch]] relationship. The study of grain boundaries and their effects on the mechanical, electrical and other properties of materials forms an important topic in [[materials science]].\n\n== High and low angle boundaries ==\n{{more sources|section|date=August 2018}}\nIt is convenient to categorize grain boundaries according to the extent of [[misorientation]] between the two grains. ''Low-angle grain boundaries'' or ''subgrain boundaries'' are those with a misorientation less than about 15 degrees.<ref>Physical Foundations of Materials Science; Gottstein, G\u00fcnter; 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-662-09291-0}}</ref> Generally speaking they are composed of an array of [[dislocation]]s and their properties and structure are a function of the misorientation. In contrast the properties of ''high-angle grain boundaries'', whose misorientation is greater than about 15 degrees (the transition angle varies from 10\u201315 degrees depending on the material), are normally found to be independent of the misorientation. However, there are 'special boundaries' at particular orientations whose interfacial energies are markedly lower than those of general high-angle grain boundaries.\n[[Image:TiltAndTwistBoundaries remade.svg|thumb|Schematic representations of a tilt boundary (top) and a twist boundary between two idealised grains.]]\n\nThe simplest boundary is that of a tilt boundary where the rotation axis is parallel to the boundary plane. This boundary can be conceived as forming from a single, contiguous [[crystallite]] or grain which is gradually bent by some external force. The energy associated with the elastic bending of the lattice can be reduced by inserting a dislocation, which is essentially a half-plane of atoms that act like a wedge, that creates a permanent misorientation between the two sides. As the grain is bent further, more and more dislocations must be introduced to accommodate the deformation resulting in a growing wall of dislocations \u2013 a low-angle boundary. The grain can now be considered to have split into two sub-grains of related crystallography but notably different orientations.\n\nAn alternative is a twist boundary where the misorientation occurs around an axis that is perpendicular to the boundary plane. This type of boundary incorporates two sets of [[dislocation|screw dislocations]]. If the [[Burgers vector]]s of the dislocations are orthogonal, then the dislocations do not strongly interact and form a square network. In other cases, the dislocations may interact to form a more complex hexagonal structure.\n\nThese concepts of tilt and twist boundaries represent somewhat idealized cases. The majority of boundaries are of a mixed type, containing dislocations of different types and Burgers vectors, in order to create the best fit between the neighboring grains.\n\nIf the dislocations in the boundary remain isolated and distinct, the boundary can be considered to be low-angle. If deformation continues, the density of dislocations will increase and so reduce the spacing between neighboring dislocations. Eventually, the cores of the dislocations will begin to overlap and the ordered nature of the boundary will begin to break down. At this point the boundary can be considered to be high-angle and the original grain to have separated into two entirely separate grains.\n\nIn comparison to low-angle grain boundaries, high-angle boundaries are considerably more disordered, with large areas of poor fit and a comparatively open structure. Indeed, they were originally thought to be some form of amorphous or even liquid layer between the grains. However, this model could not explain the observed strength of grain boundaries and, after the invention of [[electron microscopy]], direct evidence of the grain structure meant the hypothesis had to be discarded. It is now accepted that a boundary consists of structural units which depend on both the misorientation of the two grains and the plane of the interface. The types of structural unit that exist can be related to the concept of the ''coincidence site lattice'', in which repeated units are formed from points where the two misoriented lattices happen to coincide.\n\nIn coincident site lattice (CSL) theory, the degree of fit (\u03a3) between the structures of the two grains is described by the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the ratio of coincidence sites to the total number of sites.<ref>{{cite journal \n|last1=Grimmer \n|first1=H. \n|last2=Bollmann \n|first2=W. \n|last3=Warrington \n|first3=D.

For example, when \u03a3=3 there will be one atom of each three that will be shared between the two lattices. Thus a boundary with high \u03a3 might be expected to have a higher energy than one with low \u03a3. Low-angle boundaries, where the distortion is entirely accommodated by dislocations, are \u03a31. Some other low-\u03a3 boundaries have special properties, especially when the boundary plane is one that contains a high density of coincident sites. Examples include coherent [[Crystal twinning|twin]] boundaries (e.g., \u03a33) and high-mobility boundaries in FCC materials (e.g., \u03a37). Deviations from the ideal CSL orientation may be accommodated by local atomic relaxation or the inclusion of dislocations at the boundary.\n\n== Describing a boundary ==\n\nA boundary can be described by the orientation of the boundary to the two grains and the 3-D rotation required to bring the grains into coincidence. Thus a boundary has 5 macroscopic [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. However, it is common to describe a boundary only as the orientation relationship of the neighbouring grains. Generally, the convenience of ignoring the boundary plane orientation, which is very difficult to determine, outweighs the reduced information.\nThe relative orientation of the two grains is described using the [[rotation matrix]]:\n\n[[Image:GrainBoundaryOrientationDistribution.png|thumb|The characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations in a completely randomly oriented set of grains for cubic symmetry materials.]]\n\n:<math> R = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \n                         \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\n                         \\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nUsing this system the rotation angle \u03b8 is:\n\n: <math> 2\\cos\\;\\theta\\;+1 = a_{11} + a_{22} + a_{33} \\,\\! </math>\n\nwhile the direction [uvw] of the rotation axis is:\n\n: <math> [(a_{32}-a_{23}),(a_{13}-a_{31}),(a_{21}-a_{12})] \\,\\! </math>\n\nThe nature of the [[crystallography]] involved limits the misorientation of the boundary. A completely random polycrystal, with no texture, thus has a characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations (see figure). However, such cases are rare and most materials will deviate from this ideal to a greater or lesser degree.\n\n== Boundary energy ==\n\n[[Image:GrainBoundaryEnergy.png|thumb|The energy of a tilt boundary and the energy per dislocation as the misorientation of the boundary increases]]\n\nThe energy of a low-angle boundary is dependent on the degree of misorientation between the neighbouring grains up to the transition to high-angle status. In the case of simple ''tilt boundaries'' the energy of a boundary made up of dislocations with Burgers vector ''b'' and spacing ''h'' is predicted by the '''Read\u2013Shockley equation''':\n\n: <math> \\gamma _s = \\gamma _0 \\theta (A - \\ln \\theta) \\,\\! </math>\n\nwhere:\n\n: <math>\\theta = b / h \\,\\! </math>\n\n: <math>\\gamma_0 = Gb/4\\pi(1-\\nu) \\,\\! </math>\n\n: <math>A = 1 + \\ln(b/2\\pi r_0) \\,\\! </math>\n\nwith <math>G</math> is the [[shear modulus]], <math>\\nu</math> is [[Poisson's ratio]], and <math>r_0</math> is the radius of the dislocation core. It can be seen that as the energy of the boundary increases the energy per dislocation decreases. Thus there is a driving force to produce fewer, more misoriented boundaries (i.e., [[grain growth]]).\n\nThe situation in high-angle boundaries is more complex. Although theory predicts that the energy will be a minimum for ideal CSL configurations, with deviations requiring dislocations and other energetic features, empirical measurements suggest the relationship is more complicated. Some predicted troughs in energy are found as expected while others missing or substantially reduced. \nSurveys of the available experimental data have indicated that simple relationships such as low <math>\\Sigma</math> are misleading:\n\n<blockquote>It is concluded that no general and useful criterion for low energy can be enshrined in a simple geometric framework. Any understanding of the variations of interfacial energy must take account of the atomic structure and the details of the bonding at the interface.<ref>{{citation\n|first=A.

Despite the name the excess volume is actually a change in length, this is because of the 2D nature of GBs the length of interest is the expansion normal to the GB plane. The excess volume (<math>\\delta V</math>) is defined in the following way,\n\n: <math>\\delta V = \\left ( \\frac{\\partial V} {\\partial A} \\right)_{T,p,n_i}, </math>\n\nat constant temperature <math>T</math>, pressure <math>p</math> and number of atoms <math>n_i</math>. Although a rough linear relationship between GB energy and excess volume exists the orientations where this relationship is violated can behave significantly differently affecting mechanical and electrical properties.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wolf |first = D. | year = 1989 | title = Correlation between energy and volume expansion for grain boundaries in FCC metals | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1258258| journal = Scripta Metallurgica | volume = 23 | issue = 11| pages = 1913\u20131918 | doi = 10.1016/0036-9748(89)90482-1 }}</ref>\n\nExperimental techniques have been developed which directly probe the excess volume and have been used to explore the properties of nanocrystalline copper and [[nickel]].<ref>{{cite journal |first1=E.

A key observation is that there is an inverse relationship with the bulk modulus meaning that the larger the bulk modulus (the ability to compress a material) the smaller the excess volume will be, there is also direct relationship with the lattice constant, this provides methodology to find materials with a desirable excess volume for a specific application.\n\n== Boundary migration ==\n\nThe movement of grain boundaries (HAGB) has implications for [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] and [[grain growth]] while subgrain boundary (LAGB) movement strongly influences [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] and the nucleation of recrystallization.\n\nA boundary moves due to a pressure acting on it. It is generally assumed that the velocity is directly proportional to the pressure with the constant of proportionality being the mobility of the boundary. The mobility is strongly temperature dependent and often follows an [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius type relationship]]:\n\n: <math> M = M_0 \\exp \\left (- \\frac{Q}{RT} \\right ) \\,\\! </math>\n\nThe apparent activation energy (Q) may be related to the thermally activated atomistic processes that occur during boundary movement. However, there are several proposed mechanisms where the mobility will depend on the driving pressure and the assumed proportionality may break down.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the mobility of low-angle boundaries is much lower than that of high-angle boundaries. The following observations appear to hold true over a range of conditions:\n* The mobility of low-angle boundaries is proportional to the pressure acting on it.\n* The [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] controlling process is that of bulk [[diffusion]]\n* The boundary mobility increases with misorientation.\n\nSince low-angle boundaries are composed of arrays of dislocations and their movement may be related to dislocation theory. The most likely mechanism, given the experimental data, is that of dislocation climb, rate limited by the diffusion of solute in the bulk.<ref>{{citation\n|first=F.

The ease with which this can occur will depend on the structure of the boundary, itself dependent on the crystallography of the grains involved, impurity atoms and the temperature. It is possible that some form of diffusionless mechanism (akin to diffusionless phase transformations such as [[martensite]]) may operate in certain conditions. Some defects in the boundary, such as steps and ledges, may also offer alternative mechanisms for atomic transfer.\n\n[[Image:Grain growth inhibition.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Grain growth can be inhibited by second phase particles via [[Zener pinning]].]]\n\nSince a high-angle boundary is imperfectly packed compared to the normal lattice it has some amount of ''free space'' or ''free volume'' where solute atoms may possess a lower energy. As a result, a boundary may be associated with a ''solute atmosphere'' that will retard its movement. Only at higher velocities will the boundary be able to break free of its atmosphere and resume normal motion.\n\nBoth low- and high-angle boundaries are retarded by the presence of particles via the so-called [[Zener pinning]] effect. This effect is often exploited in commercial alloys to minimise or prevent recrystallization or [[grain growth]] during [[Annealing (metallurgy)|heat-treatment]].\n\n== Complexion ==\nGrain boundaries are the preferential site for segregation of impurities, which may form a thin layer with a different composition from the bulk. For example, a thin layer of silica, which also contains impurity cations, is often present in silicon nitride. These grain boundary phases are thermodynamically stable and can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional phase, which may undergo to transition, similar to those of bulk phases. In this case structure and chemistry abrupt changes are possible at a critical value of a thermodynamic parameter like temperature or pressure.<ref>Sutton AP, Balluffi RW.

Oxford: Oxford Scientific Publications.</ref> This may strongly affect the macroscopic properties of the material, for example the electrical resistance or creep rates.<ref>Hart EW (1972). The nature and behavior of grain boundaries. New York: Plenum; p. 155.</ref> Grain boundaries can be analyzed using equilibrium thermodynamics but cannot be considered as phases, because they do not satisfy Gibbs'definition: they are inhomogeneous, may have a gradient of structure, composition or properties. For this reasons they are defined as complexion: an interfacial material or stata that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its abutting phases, with a finite and stable thickness (that is typically 2\u201320 \u00c5). A complexion need the abutting phase to exist and its composition and structure need to be different from the abutting phase. Contrary to bulk phases, complexions also depend on the abutting phase. For example, silica rich amorphous layer present in Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>, is about 10 \u00c5 thick, but for special boundaries this equilibrium thickness is zero.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cantwell |first1=P.

In the first cases the thickness of the layer will be constant; if extra material is present it will segregate at multiple grain junction, while in the last case there is no equilibrium thickness and this is determined by the amount of secondary phase present in the material. One example of grain boundary complexion transition is the passage from dry boundary to biltilayer in Au-doped Si, which is produced by the increase of Au.<ref>Ma S. et al.

He previously played for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] from 2008 through 2015, and the [[Kansas City Royals]] in 2015. He was traded from the Reds to the Royals during the 2015 season, where he helped the Royals beat the [[New York Mets]] in the [[2015 World Series]]. \n\nCueto made his major league debut in 2008, delivering an outstanding performance, but struggling with consistency in his rookie year and 2009. By 2010 though, Cueto began to become a more consistent starting pitcher, and by 2011 he had emerged as the ace of the Reds pitching staff and one of the top pitchers in the [[National League]]. He won 19 games and posted a 2.78 [[Earned run average|ERA]] in 2012, finishing fourth in the voting for the National League [[Cy Young Award]] and helping lead the Reds to the [[NL Central]] title. In 2014, he won 20 games with a 2.25 ERA and tied for the NL lead in [[strikeout]]s with 242, finishing as the runner up for the Cy Young. In 2016, he won 18 games with the San Francisco Giants while posting a 2.79 ERA, helping lead them to the postseason, where they lost in the [[NLDS]], and achieving another top-10 finish in the Cy Young voting. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] in 2014 and 2016, and was chosen as the [[starting pitcher]] for the [[2016 MLB All-Star Game]]. From 2011 to 2017, Cueto accumulated the second-lowest ERA of all pitchers with at least 750 innings pitched (behind [[Clayton Kershaw]]), managing a 2.94 ERA alongside a 90\u201351 (.638) record in {{frac|1,256|1|3}} [[inning]]s.\n\n==Minor league career==\nCueto signed in 2004 as an undrafted amateur [[free agent]] for a $35,000 [[signing bonus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/profile.asp?ID=101154 |title=Johnny Cueto |publisher=The Baseball Cube |date= |accessdate=2019-11-20}}</ref> He was in the [[Minor League Baseball|Minor Leagues]] for three seasons, and has excelled at many levels, but really turned heads during the 2007 season. Cueto started his career for the [[Gulf Coast Reds]] of the [[Rookie League|Rookie]] [[Gulf Coast League]], posting a 5.02 [[earned run average]] (ERA), before being promoted to the [[Class A-Advanced|High-A]] [[Sarasota Reds]] of the [[Florida State League]], where he finished his 2005 season. Johnny has had progressively better seasons since. In 2006, Cueto was assigned to the [[Class A (baseball)|Low A]] [[Dayton Dragons]], posting a 2.61 ERA, and a 0.88 [[walks plus hits per inning pitched]] (WHIP) ratio. While with Dayton, on May 13, 2006, he threw a rain-shortened no-hitter against [[Wisconsin Timber Rattlers|Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondragons.com/pressbox/pressrelease/index.html?article_id=68|title=The Official Site of The Dayton Dragons \u2013 daytondragons.com Homepage|work=Dayton Dragons|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}</ref> He was later promoted back to Sarasota, where he finished his season for the second consecutive year. In 2007, Cueto was placed, once again, in Sarasota. He pitched 14 games in Sarasota, before going on a hot streak, and advancing through three levels in one season. He played for the [[Double-A (baseball)|AA]] [[Chattanooga Lookouts]], and [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]] [[Louisville Bats]] throughout the rest of his 2007 campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minors.baseball-reference.com/players.cgi?pid=18931|title=404 \u2013 File Not Found|work=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=July 26, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622083315/http://minors.baseball-reference.com/players.cgi?pid=18931|archivedate=June 22, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He was named the Reds' Minor League Pitcher of the Year for the second consecutive season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=456501|title=Johnny Cueto: Biography and Career Highlights|work=Cincinnati Reds|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Major league career==\n\n===Cincinnati Reds (2008\u20132015)===\n\n====2008: Rookie season====\nCueto made his Major League debut on April 3, 2008, for the Reds at home against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], where he carried a perfect game through five innings before surrendering a home run to [[Justin Upton]] in the top of the sixth inning. The home runner was the only baserunner he allowed, striking out 10 in 7 innings. Cueto was credited with the win in his debut, as the Reds hung on to win 3\u20132. Cueto was the first Red since 1900 to throw ten strikeouts in his Major League debut. He was also the first MLB pitcher to have 10 strikeouts and 0 walks in his debut.

Despite his impressive debut, Cueto was inconsistent for the most part on the season. In his first two starts of the season, Cueto was 1-0 with a 2.02 ERA in {{frac|13|1|3}} innings with 18 strikeouts, while he went 1-5 in {{frac|43|1|3}} innings with a 6.65 ERA across his next eight. Cueto struck out several batters in his starts, but found himself unable to pitch himself deep into games rather frequently due to high pitch counts and giving up lots of home runs. At the end of the 2008 campaign, he finished with a 9\u201314 record with an ERA of 4.81 in 31 starts (14 quality starts). While he pitched only 174 innings, Cueto struck 158 batters (the most of all NL rookies), good for a K/9 ratio of 8.17, the eighth best in the National League.\n\n====2009: Hot and Cold====\n[[File:Johnny Cueto1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cueto with the [[2009 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds in 2009]]]]\nCueto started 2009 as the Reds #4 starter. Cueto gave up four earned runs in six innings in his season debut in a 10-2 loss to the Pirates, despite striking out nine. Over his next three starts, however, Cueto posted a sub 1.00 ERA, allowing just two earned runs in 18 innings. Cueto pitched a career high eight shutout innings on May 3, allowing four hits and a walk while striking out in a 5-0 win over the Pirates. Between April 22 and May 29, Cueto had a nine start span where he pitched at least seven innings and allowed three earned runs or fewer in all but one of those starts. Cueto's ERA continued to be one of the strongest in the National League through the first three months of the season. On June 14, he took the lead for the lowest NL ERA, with a mark of 2.17 in 87 innings. His BB/9 lowered as the 2009 season progressed. Two weeks before the All-Star game, Cueto was 8-4 with a 2.69 ERA, a major improvement from the previous season. On July 6, 2009, Cueto suffered the worst defeat in his young career. Taking the mound against the Phillies, he allowed nine earned runs on five hits, walking three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=456501|title=Johnny Cueto Stats, Fantasy & News|work=Cincinnati Reds|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}</ref> To top it off, all this happened in the first inning, and Cueto was taken out of the game after only recording two outs. The Phillies scored 10 runs that inning. Cueto struggled following that defeat, turning in a 5.91 ERA over his final 13 starts while only managing a 3-6 record, although the final six starts (3-1 with a 3.63 ERA) were more promising. Cueto finished the season with a record of 11\u201311, and an ERA of 4.41 in 30 starts. In {{frac|171|1|3}} innings, Cueto struck out 132 batters and walked 61 batters, which despite a lower BB/9 ratio (3.20 versus 3.52) resulted in a lower K/BB ratio than his rookie season (2.32 versus 2.16) due to a decrease in strikeouts per nine innings (6.93 versus 8.17).{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n====2010: Increasing Consistency====\nCueto started the 2010 season as the Reds' third starter.

In Game 3 of the NLDS, he allowed 2 runs (1 earned) in 5 innings and took the loss as [[Cole Hamels]] pitched a shutout.

He returned on May 8, pitching six scoreless innings against the [[Chicago Cubs]]. Since he missed a lot of starts from being on the disabled list, Cueto didn't become eligible for the ERA race until his start against the [[San Francisco Giants]] on July 31, where he pitched a three-hit, complete game [[Shutouts in baseball|shutout]]. He then took the [[Major League Baseball]] lead with a 1.72 ERA. He lost eligibility, twice, due to lack of innings since, but retook the [[National League]] lead in ERA after throwing seven innings of shutout ball against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on August 11. As the season progressed, Cueto began incorporating more and more of a turn to his windup. At the start of the season, his windup featured a conventional step, keeping his body pointed at third base before delivering to the plate. However, by late July, Cueto's torso faces second base and he pauses for a brief moment. Many people have compared this turn to [[Boston Red Sox]] great [[Luis Tiant]]'s famous turn. As of August 25, he was tied with Jered Weaver for the best ERA in all of Major League Baseball at 2.03. On August 28, Cueto struck out a career-high 11 batters against the Washington Nationals, receiving a no-decision as he threw seven innings of two-run ball.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nCueto's bid for the ERA title and season came to an end after he strained a muscle in his back on September 15, while pitching vs the [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]. On September 20, the team decided to shut down Cueto for the year without risking further injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110920&content_id=24965124&notebook_id=24965322&vkey=notebook_cin&c_id=cin|title=Cueto done for season with lat strain|work=Cincinnati Reds|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}</ref> Cueto finished the season with a 9-5 record and a 2.31 ERA in 156 innings across 24 starts \u2013 six innings short of qualifying for the ERA title.

Cueto established career bests in BB/9 and K/BB ratio with 2.03 and 3.47 respectively, while his 7.05 K/9 ratio was his best since his rookie year in 2008. It was the first time in his career he pitched 200 plus innings in a single season. Cueto also threw two complete games. In his first one, on May 4 against the Pirates, Cueto allowed just one run on seven hits, striking out four and giving up no walks. Cueto threw another complete game against the Cleveland Indians on June 12, giving up just one run on six hits, with seven strikeouts and no walks. During an eleven start stretch between May 30 and July 28, Cueto threw {{frac|81|1|3}} innings without allowing a home run, a stretch in which he posted an 8-3 record with a 2.27 ERA. His streak came to an end on August 2, when Eddy Rodriguez hit a home run off Cueto in a game versus the Brewers. Cueto threw 23 quality starts, and ranked third in wins and ERA, fourth in complete games, fifth in innings pitched, eighth in hits allowed and ninth in winning percentage in the National League, while breaking his career bests in all of those categories. Controversially, he was left off the All-Star team by the National League and former Cardinals team manager [[Tony La Russa]], despite having a 10\u20135 record and a 2.39 ERA in {{frac|120|1|3}} innings pitched in the first half of the season, a decision many baseball experts criticized. The Reds clinched the NL Central Division title for the second time in three years, and the second best record in baseball (97-65) behind the Washington Nationals.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nCueto started Game 1 of the National League Division Series against San Francisco, but left after only eight pitches because of a strained muscle in his back. After the Giants won Game 3, forcing a fourth game of the NLDS, the Reds replaced Cueto on the playoff roster with [[Mike Leake]], who was their fifth starter during the season. Cueto finished fourth in the voting for the National League [[Cy Young Award]], behind winner [[R.A. Dickey]], [[Clayton Kershaw]] and [[Gio Gonz\u00e1lez]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n====2013: Injury Plagued Season====\nCueto suffered from a variety of injuries in 2013, including a lat strain, a shoulder strain and tightness in his lat, limiting him to only 11 starts on the season. In those 11 starts, Cueto had a record of 5\u20132 with a 2.82 ERA and 51 strikeouts over {{frac|60|2|3}} innings, holding opponents to a .209 batting average. He gave up no more than three earned runs in ten of his 11 starts, and no more than one earned run in eight of them.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nDespite his limited season, Cueto was chosen to start the [[2013 NL Wild Card Game]] against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Cueto was met by a raucous, loud Pittsburgh crowd who had not seen a playoff game in 20 years. [[The Drop Seen 'Round the World: The Cueto Chant|The Pirates fans chanted Cueto's name loudly]] the entire game, attempting to rattle him. After already giving up a second-inning home run to Pirates outfielder [[Marlon Byrd]], Cueto, who was having his name mockingly chanted by over 40,000 people, dropped the ball off the mound, much to the delight of the Pittsburgh crowd. On the next pitch he threw, Cueto gave up another home run to Pirates catcher [[Russell Martin]], giving Pittsburgh an early 2\u20130 lead. Cueto allowed two more runs, and was pulled after {{frac|3|1|3}} innings, having already given up 4 earned runs on 8 hits. The Reds would show little resistance the rest of the way, and the Pirates won the game 6\u20132, advancing to an [[NLDS]] series with other division rival the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Cueto took the loss in the game, which ended the season for both Cueto and the Reds.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n====2014: First All-Star Selection and Cy Young Runner Up====\nAfter a disappointing finish to an injury-riddled 2013 season, Cueto not only opened the season in excellent fashion, but produced one of the most dominant performances by a starter in years. In his first nine starts of the season, he pitched at least seven innings, giving up no more than two earned runs and five hits per outing. Making his third consecutive opening day start, Cueto permitted just one run on three hits in seven innings, striking out eight batters. Despite allowing only five earned runs and 13 hits in his first three starts (21 innings) Cueto had accumulated two losses and a no decision due to poor run support from his offense. On April 16, Cueto threw a complete game, three-hit shutout versus the Pittsburgh Pirates, striking out a career-high 12 batters without issuing a single walk. It was the seventh career complete game and third career shutout for Cueto and his first complete game in nearly two years.<ref name=\"allstar14\">{{cite news |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_04_16_pitmlb_cinmlb_1#game=2014_04_16_pitmlb_cinmlb_1,game_state=Wrapup,game_tab=wrap |title=Johnny Be Great: Cueto whiffs 12, blanks Pirates |first=Mark |last=Sheldon |date=April 16, 2014 |work=MLB.com}}</ref> Cueto threw another complete game versus his Pirates in his next start on April 22, in which he had a shutout going until he gave up a home run to [[Andrew McCutchen]] in the ninth with one out.

Cueto returned to form on May 28 against the [[Atlanta Braves]], allowing one earned run in six strong innings striking out eight batters, while tacking on a RBI sac fly and a sac bunt at the plate. Cueto then went winless in his next five starts, before posting his sixth victory of the season after allowing two runs in five innings against the Pirates on June 30. He was placed on the DL on July 15 following his first start after the All-Star Break with blisters on his right hand, while later suffering a slight forearm injury in his rehab assignment. At the time he was placed on the DL Cueto was 6-7 with a 4.59 ERA in 115\u2154 innings (he had struck out 103), his worst ERA in a single season by that point since he was a rookie in 2008. Cueto finished the season 8-8 with a 4.52 ERA and 1.45 WHIP in {{frac|147|1|3|}} innings (25 starts), striking out 136 batters as the Giants slumped to the worst record in baseball, finishing the season an abysmal 34 games under .500 (64-98).\n\n====2018: Tommy John surgery====\nIn his season debut on March 30 against the Dodgers, Cueto carried a perfect game through six innings before giving up a single to [[Chris Taylor (baseball)|Chris Taylor]] to lead off the seventh inning. Cueto finished his outing facing the minimum of 21 batters through seven scoreless innings, giving up the one hit while striking out four and walking none as he received a no-decision in a 1\u20130 Giants victory. Through his first four starts, Cueto led the major leagues with a 0.35 ERA, giving up just one earned run in 26 innings. On May 7, Cueto was diagnosed with a right elbow sprain.

He previously played for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] from 2008 through 2015, and the [[Kansas City Royals]] in 2015. He was traded from the Reds to the Royals during the 2015 season, where he helped the Royals beat the [[New York Mets]] in the [[2015 World Series]]. \n\nCueto made his major league debut in 2008, delivering an outstanding performance, but struggling with consistency in his rookie year and 2009. By 2010 though, Cueto began to become a more consistent starting pitcher, and by 2011 he had emerged as the ace of the Reds pitching staff and one of the top pitchers in the [[National League]]. He won 19 games and posted a 2.78 [[Earned run average|ERA]] in 2012, finishing fourth in the voting for the National League [[Cy Young Award]] and helping lead the Reds to the [[NL Central]] title. In 2014, he won 20 games with a 2.25 ERA and tied for the NL lead in [[strikeout]]s with 242, finishing as the runner up for the Cy Young. In 2016, he won 18 games with the San Francisco Giants while posting a 2.79 ERA, helping lead them to the postseason, where they lost in the [[NLDS]], and achieving another top-10 finish in the Cy Young voting. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] in 2014 and 2016, and was chosen as the [[starting pitcher]] for the [[2016 MLB All-Star Game]]. From 2011 to 2017, Cueto accumulated the second-lowest ERA of all pitchers with at least 750 innings pitched (behind [[Clayton Kershaw]]), managing a 2.94 ERA alongside a 90\u201351 (.638) record in {{frac|1,256|1|3}} [[inning]]s.\n\n==Minor league career==\nCueto signed in 2004 as an undrafted amateur [[free agent]] for a $35,000 [[signing bonus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/profile.asp?ID=101154 |title=Johnny Cueto |publisher=The Baseball Cube |date= |accessdate=2019-11-20}}</ref> He was in the [[Minor League Baseball|Minor Leagues]] for three seasons, and has excelled at many levels, but really turned heads during the 2007 season. Cueto started his career for the [[Gulf Coast Reds]] of the [[Rookie League|Rookie]] [[Gulf Coast League]], posting a 5.02 [[earned run average]] (ERA), before being promoted to the [[Class A-Advanced|High-A]] [[Sarasota Reds]] of the [[Florida State League]], where he finished his 2005 season. Johnny has had progressively better seasons since. In 2006, Cueto was assigned to the [[Class A (baseball)|Low A]] [[Dayton Dragons]], posting a 2.61 ERA, and a 0.88 [[walks plus hits per inning pitched]] (WHIP) ratio. While with Dayton, on May 13, 2006, he threw a rain-shortened no-hitter against [[Wisconsin Timber Rattlers|Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondragons.com/pressbox/pressrelease/index.html?article_id=68|title=The Official Site of The Dayton Dragons \u2013 daytondragons.com Homepage|work=Dayton Dragons|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}</ref> He was later promoted back to Sarasota, where he finished his season for the second consecutive year. In 2007, Cueto was placed, once again, in Sarasota. He pitched 14 games in Sarasota, before going on a hot streak, and advancing through three levels in one season.

Cueto was the first Red since 1900 to throw ten strikeouts in his Major League debut. He was also the first MLB pitcher to have 10 strikeouts and 0 walks in his debut.

Despite his impressive debut, Cueto was inconsistent for the most part on the season. In his first two starts of the season, Cueto was 1-0 with a 2.02 ERA in {{frac|13|1|3}} innings with 18 strikeouts, while he went 1-5 in {{frac|43|1|3}} innings with a 6.65 ERA across his next eight. Cueto struck out several batters in his starts, but found himself unable to pitch himself deep into games rather frequently due to high pitch counts and giving up lots of home runs. At the end of the 2008 campaign, he finished with a 9\u201314 record with an ERA of 4.81 in 31 starts (14 quality starts). While he pitched only 174 innings, Cueto struck 158 batters (the most of all NL rookies), good for a K/9 ratio of 8.17, the eighth best in the National League.\n\n====2009: Hot and Cold====\n[[File:Johnny Cueto1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cueto with the [[2009 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds in 2009]]]]\nCueto started 2009 as the Reds #4 starter. Cueto gave up four earned runs in six innings in his season debut in a 10-2 loss to the Pirates, despite striking out nine. Over his next three starts, however, Cueto posted a sub 1.00 ERA, allowing just two earned runs in 18 innings. Cueto pitched a career high eight shutout innings on May 3, allowing four hits and a walk while striking out in a 5-0 win over the Pirates. Between April 22 and May 29, Cueto had a nine start span where he pitched at least seven innings and allowed three earned runs or fewer in all but one of those starts. Cueto's ERA continued to be one of the strongest in the National League through the first three months of the season. On June 14, he took the lead for the lowest NL ERA, with a mark of 2.17 in 87 innings. His BB/9 lowered as the 2009 season progressed. Two weeks before the All-Star game, Cueto was 8-4 with a 2.69 ERA, a major improvement from the previous season. On July 6, 2009, Cueto suffered the worst defeat in his young career. Taking the mound against the Phillies, he allowed nine earned runs on five hits, walking three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=456501|title=Johnny Cueto Stats, Fantasy & News|work=Cincinnati Reds|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}</ref> To top it off, all this happened in the first inning, and Cueto was taken out of the game after only recording two outs. The Phillies scored 10 runs that inning. Cueto struggled following that defeat, turning in a 5.91 ERA over his final 13 starts while only managing a 3-6 record, although the final six starts (3-1 with a 3.63 ERA) were more promising. Cueto finished the season with a record of 11\u201311, and an ERA of 4.41 in 30 starts. In {{frac|171|1|3}} innings, Cueto struck out 132 batters and walked 61 batters, which despite a lower BB/9 ratio (3.20 versus 3.52) resulted in a lower K/BB ratio than his rookie season (2.32 versus 2.16) due to a decrease in strikeouts per nine innings (6.93 versus 8.17).{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n====2010: Increasing Consistency====\nCueto started the 2010 season as the Reds' third starter.

In Game 3 of the NLDS, he allowed 2 runs (1 earned) in 5 innings and took the loss as [[Cole Hamels]] pitched a shutout.

He returned on May 8, pitching six scoreless innings against the [[Chicago Cubs]]. Since he missed a lot of starts from being on the disabled list, Cueto didn't become eligible for the ERA race until his start against the [[San Francisco Giants]] on July 31, where he pitched a three-hit, complete game [[Shutouts in baseball|shutout]]. He then took the [[Major League Baseball]] lead with a 1.72 ERA. He lost eligibility, twice, due to lack of innings since, but retook the [[National League]] lead in ERA after throwing seven innings of shutout ball against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on August 11. As the season progressed, Cueto began incorporating more and more of a turn to his windup. At the start of the season, his windup featured a conventional step, keeping his body pointed at third base before delivering to the plate. However, by late July, Cueto's torso faces second base and he pauses for a brief moment. Many people have compared this turn to [[Boston Red Sox]] great [[Luis Tiant]]'s famous turn. As of August 25, he was tied with Jered Weaver for the best ERA in all of Major League Baseball at 2.03. On August 28, Cueto struck out a career-high 11 batters against the Washington Nationals, receiving a no-decision as he threw seven innings of two-run ball.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nCueto's bid for the ERA title and season came to an end after he strained a muscle in his back on September 15, while pitching vs the [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]].

Cueto established career bests in BB/9 and K/BB ratio with 2.03 and 3.47 respectively, while his 7.05 K/9 ratio was his best since his rookie year in 2008. It was the first time in his career he pitched 200 plus innings in a single season. Cueto also threw two complete games. In his first one, on May 4 against the Pirates, Cueto allowed just one run on seven hits, striking out four and giving up no walks. Cueto threw another complete game against the Cleveland Indians on June 12, giving up just one run on six hits, with seven strikeouts and no walks. During an eleven start stretch between May 30 and July 28, Cueto threw {{frac|81|1|3}} innings without allowing a home run, a stretch in which he posted an 8-3 record with a 2.27 ERA. His streak came to an end on August 2, when Eddy Rodriguez hit a home run off Cueto in a game versus the Brewers. Cueto threw 23 quality starts, and ranked third in wins and ERA, fourth in complete games, fifth in innings pitched, eighth in hits allowed and ninth in winning percentage in the National League, while breaking his career bests in all of those categories. The Reds clinched the NL Central Division title for the second time in three years, and the second best record in baseball (97-65) behind the Washington Nationals.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nCueto started Game 1 of the National League Division Series against San Francisco, but left after only eight pitches because of a strained muscle in his back. After the Giants won Game 3, forcing a fourth game of the NLDS, the Reds replaced Cueto on the playoff roster with [[Mike Leake]], who was their fifth starter during the season. Cueto finished fourth in the voting for the National League [[Cy Young Award]], behind winner [[R.A. Dickey]], [[Clayton Kershaw]] and [[Gio Gonz\u00e1lez]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n====2013: Injury Plagued Season====\nCueto suffered from a variety of injuries in 2013, including a lat strain, a shoulder strain and tightness in his lat, limiting him to only 11 starts on the season. In those 11 starts, Cueto had a record of 5\u20132 with a 2.82 ERA and 51 strikeouts over {{frac|60|2|3}} innings, holding opponents to a .209 batting average. He gave up no more than three earned runs in ten of his 11 starts, and no more than one earned run in eight of them.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nDespite his limited season, Cueto was chosen to start the [[2013 NL Wild Card Game]] against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Cueto was met by a raucous, loud Pittsburgh crowd who had not seen a playoff game in 20 years. [[The Drop Seen 'Round the World: The Cueto Chant|The Pirates fans chanted Cueto's name loudly]] the entire game, attempting to rattle him. After already giving up a second-inning home run to Pirates outfielder [[Marlon Byrd]], Cueto, who was having his name mockingly chanted by over 40,000 people, dropped the ball off the mound, much to the delight of the Pittsburgh crowd. On the next pitch he threw, Cueto gave up another home run to Pirates catcher [[Russell Martin]], giving Pittsburgh an early 2\u20130 lead. Cueto allowed two more runs, and was pulled after {{frac|3|1|3}} innings, having already given up 4 earned runs on 8 hits. The Reds would show little resistance the rest of the way, and the Pirates won the game 6\u20132, advancing to an [[NLDS]] series with other division rival the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Cueto took the loss in the game, which ended the season for both Cueto and the Reds.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n====2014: First All-Star Selection and Cy Young Runner Up====\nAfter a disappointing finish to an injury-riddled 2013 season, Cueto not only opened the season in excellent fashion, but produced one of the most dominant performances by a starter in years. In his first nine starts of the season, he pitched at least seven innings, giving up no more than two earned runs and five hits per outing. Making his third consecutive opening day start, Cueto permitted just one run on three hits in seven innings, striking out eight batters. Despite allowing only five earned runs and 13 hits in his first three starts (21 innings) Cueto had accumulated two losses and a no decision due to poor run support from his offense. On April 16, Cueto threw a complete game, three-hit shutout versus the Pittsburgh Pirates, striking out a career-high 12 batters without issuing a single walk. It was the seventh career complete game and third career shutout for Cueto and his first complete game in nearly two years.<ref name=\"allstar14\">{{cite news |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_04_16_pitmlb_cinmlb_1#game=2014_04_16_pitmlb_cinmlb_1,game_state=Wrapup,game_tab=wrap |title=Johnny Be Great: Cueto whiffs 12, blanks Pirates |first=Mark |last=Sheldon |date=April 16, 2014 |work=MLB.com}}</ref> Cueto threw another complete game versus his Pirates in his next start on April 22, in which he had a shutout going until he gave up a home run to [[Andrew McCutchen]] in the ninth with one out.

On April 4, Cueto made his season debut versus the Diamondbacks at Chase Field. Despite giving up four earned runs on two walks and six hits (two home runs) across five innings, he was able to come away with the win in his season debut. In his outing he notched five strikeouts and helped tremendously with the Giants offense, contributing a single, an RBI and reaching base twice in the Giants 8-4 win. After pitching seven innings of two-run ball against the Rockies on April 14, Cueto became the first Giants pitcher to win his first three starts of the season in back to back years since [[Rick Reuschel]] did so in 1988 and 1989.{{cn|date=April 2017}}. After revealing he had been suffering a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand since the culmination of spring training, Cueto struck out 10 batters and allowed just two earned runs in seven innings in his second start at Great American Ballpark since leaving the Reds, his fourteenth (fifteenth counting the postseason) double digit strikeout game, and he established the record for the most double digit strikeout games by a pitcher at the stadium (eight). Cueto returned to form on May 28 against the [[Atlanta Braves]], allowing one earned run in six strong innings striking out eight batters, while tacking on a RBI sac fly and a sac bunt at the plate. Cueto then went winless in his next five starts, before posting his sixth victory of the season after allowing two runs in five innings against the Pirates on June 30. He was placed on the DL on July 15 following his first start after the All-Star Break with blisters on his right hand, while later suffering a slight forearm injury in his rehab assignment. At the time he was placed on the DL Cueto was 6-7 with a 4.59 ERA in 115\u2154 innings (he had struck out 103), his worst ERA in a single season by that point since he was a rookie in 2008. Cueto finished the season 8-8 with a 4.52 ERA and 1.45 WHIP in {{frac|147|1|3|}} innings (25 starts), striking out 136 batters as the Giants slumped to the worst record in baseball, finishing the season an abysmal 34 games under .500 (64-98).\n\n====2018: Tommy John surgery====\nIn his season debut on March 30 against the Dodgers, Cueto carried a perfect game through six innings before giving up a single to [[Chris Taylor (baseball)|Chris Taylor]] to lead off the seventh inning. Cueto finished his outing facing the minimum of 21 batters through seven scoreless innings, giving up the one hit while striking out four and walking none as he received a no-decision in a 1\u20130 Giants victory.

Thompson disagreed with Wills about many aspects, as he thought that Wills was trying to implement more [[Rugby School]] rules into the game.<ref name=\"Sean Fagan\">Fagan, Sean.

Retrieved 25 July 2010.</ref> Wills, however, did manage to implement many of the Rugby School rules, such as place kicks and marks. The disagreements culminated in 1860, when Melbourne, whom Thompson was captaining, played Richmond, whom Wills was captaining, and Wills used his position as captain to declare that he and his team would not play unless they used the oval shaped, Rugby School-styled ball, as opposed to a round ball, such as is used in [[association football]], which had been used in all matches up to this point. In the end the game was played with an oval-shaped ball and to this day Australian rules football still uses that particular shape of ball.<ref name=\"Sean Fagan\"/>\n\n=== Journalist ===\nThompson wrote for Melbourne-based newspaper, ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', for many years, contributing a weekly sports column, generally writing about cricket in the summer and football in the winter. After his falling out with Wills he used the column to criticise Wills for not turning up to a Victorian cricket team practice and for failing to provide an excuse.\n\nThompson was editor of ''The Victorian Cricketer's Guide for 1859\u201360''.<ref name=\"Sean Fagan\"/>\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nThompson died in Melbourne, on 18 July 1877, at the age of 48, from a combination of excessive alcohol consumption and [[bronchopneumonia]].\n\nFormer Chief Executive of the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), [[Andrew Demetriou]], wrote in the introduction of ''The Australian Game of Football'', \"Our game does not belong to an idea by Tom Wills or dedicated management by H.C.A.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]].

North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=PowleslandA>{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R.

Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=Miller/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Gill>Gill, F. and D.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]].

The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

He co-founded the [[SS]]-organization ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'' but was later pushed out by [[Heinrich Himmler]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Utrecht]] on 6 May 1885, Wirth studied [[Flemish Dutch]] philology, literature, history and musicology at Utrecht and Leipzig, receiving his doctorate in 1911 from the [[University of Basel]] with a dissertation on the demise of the Dutch folk song.<ref name=\"Katalog1\">{{Citation | last =Mahsarski | first =Dirk | contribution = \"Schwarmgeister und Phantasten\" - die v\u00f6lkische Laienforschung | year =2013 | title = Graben f\u00fcr Germanien - Arch\u00e4ologie unterm Hakenkreuz| editor-last = Focke-Museum, Bremen| editor-first = | volume = | pages = 50\u201356| place = | publisher =Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft | isbn=978-3-534-25919-9}}</ref> He taught Dutch language at the [[University of Berlin]] since 1909.\n\nIn 1914, at the outbreak of [[World War I]], Wirth volunteered for military service in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], where he was assigned to monitor the Flemish separatists in German-occupied [[Belgium]]. In 1916 he was decorated, dismissed from the service, and subsequently appointed by [[Wilhelm II]] as a professor (''Titularprofessor'').<ref name=\"Katalog1\"/> In 1918 he became professor at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] After the war ended, he and his wive moved to the Netherlands, where they founded a nationalist [[Wandervogel]]-organization, dedicated to traditional folk-music. By then, Wirth accepted a temporary job as teacher at the gymnasium of [[Baarn]].\n\nAugust 1922 he became honorary professor in [[Marburg]], Germany, but he took a another job as a teacher in Sneek (Netherlands) until Februar 1924. This gave him the opportunity do dive into Frisian folk culture and the history of the apparently age-old ''[[Oera Linda Book]]''. In 1925 he joined the [[NSDAP]]. However, his membership was discontinued in 1926, apparently because he did not want to scare off jewish sponsors.<ref name=\"Katalog1\"/>\n\n===Nazi Pre-history===\nWirth then published a book about the \"Prehistory of the Atlantic Nordic race\" ''(German: Urgeschichte der atlantisch-nordischen Rasse)'', which found appeal in [[v\u00f6lkisch movement|v\u00f6lkisch circles]]. From October 1932, Wirth attempted to set up a ''Forschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Urgeschichte'' in [[Bad Doberan]] associated with a professorship at [[Rostock]] university, supported by the NSDAP state government of [[Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. Headed by Wirth, it was extremely controversial in professional circles as well as among noted NSDAP intellectuals. Due to a lack of funds and Wirth's expensive way of life, the institute folded within a year. The ''Hermann-Wirth-Gesellschaft'', founded in 1928, also suffered.<ref name=\"Katalog1\"/>\n\nAfter the rise to power of the NSDAP, he rejoined the party in 1934 and shortly thereafter became a member of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]''<ref name=\"Katalog1\"/> (SS, membership number 258.776). He was re-awarded his former NSDAP number (20.151) personally by [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nIn early summer 1933, friends within the NSDAP helped Wirth to be appointed to an extraordinary professorship without teaching responsibilities at the theological faculty of [[Berlin University]]. He also negotiated with the Prussian Ministry of Education about the establishment of an open-air museum ''Deutsches Ahnenerbe'' near Berlin. Wirth also re-founded his organization as ''Gesellschaft f\u00fcr germanische Ur- und Vorgeschichte'', with assistance from the journalist and Nazi functionary [[Johann von Leers]] and the industrialist [[Ludwig Roselius]]. The latter had supported Wirth since the 1920s and paid for the publication of ''Der Aufgang der Menschheit''.<ref name=\"Katalog1\"/>\n\nBetween 1933 and 1935, there was a large philosophical clash encouraged by the Nazi party between the churches, and neo-paganism supported by v\u00f6lkisch theories.<ref name=her>Die Missionsanstalt Hermannsburg und der Nationalsozialismus: der Weg einer lutherischen Milieuinstitution zwischen Weimarer Republik und Nachkriegszeit, Gunther Schendel, LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster, 2008 pp.300\n</ref> Wirth was among those who tried to reinterpret [[Christianity]] in terms of ethnic Nordic origin of original monotheism.<ref name=her/> The free-thinking neo-pagans founded a supporting group in 1933, and included Wirth, [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]], and until 1934 [[Ernst Bergmann (philosopher)|Ernst Bergmann]] and numerous ex-[[Communist]]s.<ref name=ks>Die Nation vor Gott.

Although he was supported by Roselius, the ''[[Eingetragener Verein|Verein]]'' was seemingly never set up.

Feeling unwelcome in the Netherlands, he then moved to [[Sweden]], before returning to Marburg in 1954, where he lived as a private scholar.\n\nAlthough he continued to defend National Socialist principles, Wirth's teachings about \"Urkulturen\" found resonance in the evolving alternative scene, and in the 1970s gained support from North American native groups. In the late 1970s, politicians in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] including the state government and delegates from [[Kusel]] supported a project to set up a museum to show Wirth's ethnographic collection in the tithe barn of [[Lichtenberg Castle (Palatinate)|Lichtenberg Castle]].

According to Serrano, Wirth complained to him that his magnum opus ''[[Palestinabuch]]'' had recently been stolen. There are, indeed, indications that Wirth has worked between 1933 and 1969 on an antisemitic text, which could serve as a counterpart to the ''Ura Linda Chronicle''. Since then, due to the publications of Serrano and the Russian philosopher [[Aleksandr Dugin]], the idea of a lost major manuscript has gained some kind of cult status in extreme rightwing circles.\n\nWirth died in 1981 in Kusel.\n\n==Philosophy==\n\nWirth claimed that civilization is a curse that only a simpler way of life, as documented in archaeological findings and historical records, could lift.

Its inhabitants supposedly were pure [[Aryan race|Aryans]], influencing the cultures not just of Europeans but also of the natives of North America and the wider \"Old World\" beyond Europe. According to Wirth, these Atlanteans worshipped a single deity whose aspect changed with the seasons and its son, the ''Heilsbringer''. In their religion, priestesses played a key role. Wirth thought that both the Jewish and the Christian faith were perversions of this original religion. He considered himself a symbologist and thought the Germanic people to be direct descendants of these inhabitants of Atlantis. Researching the Germanic culture thus was a way of reconstructing the original culture of the ancients. All of this research was considered explicitly political as well as religious.<ref name=\"Katalog1\"/>\n\nWirth's ideas inspired the design of ''[[Atlantis House|Haus Atlantis]]'' in the [[B\u00f6ttcherstra\u00dfe]] in [[Bremen]].

Its inhabitants supposedly were pure [[Aryan race|Aryans]], influencing the cultures not just of Europeans but also of the natives of North America and the wider \"Old World\" beyond Europe. According to Wirth, these Atlanteans worshipped a single deity whose aspect changed with the seasons and its son, the ''Heilsbringer''. In their religion, priestesses played a key role. Wirth thought that both the Jewish and the Christian faith were perversions of this original religion. He considered himself a symbologist and thought the Germanic people to be direct descendants of these inhabitants of Atlantis. Researching the Germanic culture thus was a way of reconstructing the original culture of the ancients. All of this research was considered explicitly political as well as religious.<ref name=\"Katalog1\"/>\n\nWirth's ideas inspired the design of ''[[Atlantis House|Haus Atlantis]]'' in the [[B\u00f6ttcherstra\u00dfe]] in [[Bremen]].
