The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown [[Macy's]] (formerly the [[Burdine's]] headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have \"NW\" in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown, which is close to the coast, the \"NW\" and \"SW\" quadrants are much larger than the \"SE\" and \"NE\" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., [[Tamiami Trail|Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St]]), although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals.\n\nWith few exceptions, within this grid north/south roads are designated as Courts, Roads, Avenues or Places (often remembered by their acronym), while east/west roads are Streets, Terraces, Drives or occasionally Ways.  Major roads in each direction are located at one mile intervals. There are 16 [[City block|blocks]] to each mile on north/south avenues, and 10 blocks to each mile on east/west streets.  Major north/south avenues generally end in \"7\" \u2013 e.g., 17th, 27th, 37th/Douglas Aves., 57th/Red Rd., 67th/Ludlam, 87th/Galloway, etc., all the way west beyond 177th/Krome Avenue.  (One prominent exception is 42nd Avenue, LeJeune Road, located at the half-mile point instead.)  Major east/west streets to the south of downtown are multiples of 16, though the beginning point of this system is at SW 8th St, one half mile south of Flagler (\"zeroth\") Street.  Thus, major streets are at 8th St., 24th St./Coral Way, 40th St./Bird, 56th/Miller, 72nd/ Sunset, 88th/N. Kendall, 104th (originally S. Kendall), 120th/Montgomery, 136th/Howard, 152nd/Coral Reef, 168th/Richmond, 184th/Eureka, 200th/Quail Roost, 216th/Hainlin Mill, 232nd/Silver Palm, 248th/Coconut Palm, etc., well into the 300s.  Within the grid, odd-numbered addresses are generally on the north or east side, and even-numbered addresses are on the south or west side.\n\nAll streets and avenues in [[Miami-Dade County]] follow the Miami grid, with a few exceptions, most notably in [[Coral Gables]], [[Hialeah]], Coconut Grove and [[Miami Beach]]. One neighborhood, [[The Roads]], is named as such because its streets run off the Miami grid at a 45-degree angle, and therefore are all named roads.\n\n[[Miami-Dade County]] is served by four Interstate Highways ([[Interstate 75 (Florida)|I-75]], [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]], [[Interstate 195 (Florida)|I-195]], [[Interstate 395 (Florida)|I-395]]) and several U.S. Highways including [[U.S. Route 1 (Florida)|U.S. Route 1]], [[U.S. Route 27 (Florida)|U.S. Route 27]], [[U.S. Route 41 (Florida)|U.S. Route 41]], and [[U.S. Route 441 (Florida)|U.S. Route 441]].\n\nSome of the major [[Florida State Roads]] (and their common names) serving Miami are:<!--these don't all serve Miami!-->\n* [[State Road 112 (Florida)|SR 112]] (Airport Expressway): [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]] to [[Miami International Airport|MIA]]\n* [[Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike]] (SR 821): [[Florida's Turnpike]] mainline (SR 91)/[[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]] to [[U.S. Route 1 (Florida)|U.S. Route 1]]/[[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]]\n* [[State Road 826 (Florida)|SR 826]] (Palmetto Expressway): [[Golden Glades Interchange]] to U.S. Route 1/[[Pinecrest, Florida|Pinecrest]]\n* [[State Road 836 (Florida)|SR 836]] (Dolphin Expressway): Downtown to SW 137th Ave via [[Miami International Airport|MIA]]\n* [[State Road 874 (Florida)|SR 874]] (Don Shula Expressway): 826/Bird Road to Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike/[[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]]\n* [[State Road 878 (Florida)|SR 878]] (Snapper Creek Expressway): SR 874/[[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] to U.S. Route 1/Pinecrest & [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]]\n* [[State Road 924 (Florida)|SR 924]] (Gratigny Parkway) [[Miami Lakes, Florida|Miami Lakes]] to [[Opa-locka, Florida|Opa-locka]]\n\n<div style=\"float:right;\" class=\"center\">\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Miami Causeways\n|-\n!

A free, elevated [[people mover]], [[Metromover]], operates 21 stations on three different lines in greater Downtown Miami, with a station at roughly every two blocks of Downtown and Brickell. Several expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County.\n\n[[Tri-Rail]], a commuter rail system operated by the [[South Florida Regional Transportation Authority]] (SFRTA), runs from [[Miami International Airport]] northward to [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], making eighteen stops throughout [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade]], [[Broward County|Broward]], and [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]] counties.\n\nThe [[Miami Intermodal Center]] is a massive transportation hub servicing [[Metrorail (Miami-Dade County)|Metrorail]], [[Amtrak]], [[Tri-Rail]], [[Miami-Dade Transit#Metrobus|Metrobus]], [[Greyhound Lines]], [[Taxicab|taxis]], [[rental cars]], [[MIA Mover]], private automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians adjacent to Miami International Airport. Miami Intermodal Center was completed in 2010, and is serving about 150,000 commuters and travelers in the Miami area. Phase I of [[Virgin MiamiCentral|MiamiCentral]] Station was completed in 2012, and the Tri-Rail part of Phase II was completed in 2015, but the construction of the Amtrak part remains delayed.\n\nTwo new light rail systems, Baylink and the Miami Streetcar, have been proposed and are currently in the planning stage.

A Spanish [[mission (station)|mission]] was constructed one year later. Spain and [[British Empire|Britain]] successively ruled Florida until Spain ceded it to the United States in 1821. In 1836, the U.S. built [[Fort Dallas]] on the banks of the Miami River as part of its development of the [[Florida Territory]] and its attempt to suppress and remove the [[Seminole]]s.

When landlords began to rent homes to African-Americans around Avenue J (what would later become NW Fifth Avenue), a gang of white men with torches marched through the neighborhood and warned the residents to move or be bombed.<ref name=Concrete />{{rp|33}}\n\nMiami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and infrastructure as northerners moved to the city. The legacy of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] was embedded in these developments. Miami's chief of police at the time, H. Leslie Quigg, did not hide the fact that he, like many other white Miami police officers, was a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Unsurprisingly, these officers enforced social codes far beyond the written law. Quigg, for example, \"personally and publicly beat a colored bellboy to death for speaking directly to a white woman\".<ref name=Concrete />{{rp|53}}\n\nThe collapse of the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]], the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]], and the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s slowed development. When [[World War II]] began, Miami became a base for U.S. defense against [[U-boat|German submarines]] due to its prime location on the southern coast of Florida. This brought an increase in Miami's population; 172,172 people lived in the city by 1940.

The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown [[Macy's]] (formerly the [[Burdine's]] headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have \"NW\" in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown, which is close to the coast, the \"NW\" and \"SW\" quadrants are much larger than the \"SE\" and \"NE\" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., [[Tamiami Trail|Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St]]), although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals.\n\nWith few exceptions, within this grid north/south roads are designated as Courts, Roads, Avenues or Places (often remembered by their acronym), while east/west roads are Streets, Terraces, Drives or occasionally Ways.  Major roads in each direction are located at one mile intervals. There are 16 [[City block|blocks]] to each mile on north/south avenues, and 10 blocks to each mile on east/west streets.  Major north/south avenues generally end in \"7\" \u2013 e.g., 17th, 27th, 37th/Douglas Aves., 57th/Red Rd., 67th/Ludlam, 87th/Galloway, etc., all the way west beyond 177th/Krome Avenue.  (One prominent exception is 42nd Avenue, LeJeune Road, located at the half-mile point instead.)  Major east/west streets to the south of downtown are multiples of 16, though the beginning point of this system is at SW 8th St, one half mile south of Flagler (\"zeroth\") Street.  Thus, major streets are at 8th St., 24th St./Coral Way, 40th St./Bird, 56th/Miller, 72nd/ Sunset, 88th/N. Kendall, 104th (originally S. Kendall), 120th/Montgomery, 136th/Howard, 152nd/Coral Reef, 168th/Richmond, 184th/Eureka, 200th/Quail Roost, 216th/Hainlin Mill, 232nd/Silver Palm, 248th/Coconut Palm, etc., well into the 300s.  Within the grid, odd-numbered addresses are generally on the north or east side, and even-numbered addresses are on the south or west side.\n\nAll streets and avenues in [[Miami-Dade County]] follow the Miami grid, with a few exceptions, most notably in [[Coral Gables]], [[Hialeah]], Coconut Grove and [[Miami Beach]]. One neighborhood, [[The Roads]], is named as such because its streets run off the Miami grid at a 45-degree angle, and therefore are all named roads.\n\n[[Miami-Dade County]] is served by four Interstate Highways ([[Interstate 75 (Florida)|I-75]], [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]], [[Interstate 195 (Florida)|I-195]], [[Interstate 395 (Florida)|I-395]]) and several U.S. Highways including [[U.S. Route 1 (Florida)|U.S. Route 1]], [[U.S. Route 27 (Florida)|U.S. Route 27]], [[U.S. Route 41 (Florida)|U.S. Route 41]], and [[U.S. Route 441 (Florida)|U.S. Route 441]].\n\nSome of the major [[Florida State Roads]] (and their common names) serving Miami are:<!--these don't all serve Miami!-->\n* [[State Road 112 (Florida)|SR 112]] (Airport Expressway): [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]] to [[Miami International Airport|MIA]]\n* [[Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike]] (SR 821): [[Florida's Turnpike]] mainline (SR 91)/[[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]] to [[U.S. Route 1 (Florida)|U.S. Route 1]]/[[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]]\n* [[State Road 826 (Florida)|SR 826]] (Palmetto Expressway): [[Golden Glades Interchange]] to U.S. Route 1/[[Pinecrest, Florida|Pinecrest]]\n* [[State Road 836 (Florida)|SR 836]] (Dolphin Expressway): Downtown to SW 137th Ave via [[Miami International Airport|MIA]]\n* [[State Road 874 (Florida)|SR 874]] (Don Shula Expressway): 826/Bird Road to Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike/[[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]]\n* [[State Road 878 (Florida)|SR 878]] (Snapper Creek Expressway): SR 874/[[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] to U.S. Route 1/Pinecrest & [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]]\n* [[State Road 924 (Florida)|SR 924]] (Gratigny Parkway) [[Miami Lakes, Florida|Miami Lakes]] to [[Opa-locka, Florida|Opa-locka]]\n\n<div style=\"float:right;\" class=\"center\">\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Miami Causeways\n|-\n!

The second christian name \"Johann\" mentioned by Link (2006, 132) is possibly a confusion with composer [[Wenzel Johann Trnka]] (born 1782; died after 1849)</ref> (Czech: V\u00e1clav Trnka z K\u0159ovic;<ref>[http://errol.oclc.org/laf/n%20%2088622477.html Record] at [[Library of Congress]] authority file</ref> 1739\u20131791) was a physician, professor, and amateur composer of the 18th century.{{sfn|Berke et al.|2007|loc=69}}\n\n==Life==\n\nHe was born 16 October 1739 in [[T\u00e1bor]] in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]].{{sfn|Borchling|1902|loc=119}} In 1769, during his medical studies, the famous physician [[Gerard van Swieten]] named him to serve as his assistant in the military hospital (Milit\u00e4rkrankenhaus).<ref name=\"De Luca\">De Luca (1778:228)</ref> He received his doctorate 19 February 1770 with a treatise entitled \"De morbo coxario\";<ref name=\"ADB\">{{harvnb|Pagel|1894}}</ref> (\"On disease of the hip\"). In June of the same year he was appointed to a professorial chair in anatomy at the University of [[Nagyszombat]].<ref name=\"De Luca\" /><ref name=\"Borchling-119-120\">{{harvnb|Borchling|1902|loc=119\u2013120}}</ref> Trnka thus became one of five who first formed the medical faculty there.<ref name=\"Borchling-119-120\" /> He continued his service when the [[University of Pest|university]] was moved, first to [[Buda]] in 1777<ref name=\"ADB\" /> and later to [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], in 1784.<ref name=\"Borchling-120\">{{harvnb|Borchling|1902|loc=120}}</ref> He switched academic chairs twice, becoming the professor of general pathology in 1781 and of special pathology in 1786.<ref name=\"Borchling-120\" />\n\n19th-century sources describe Trnka's medical career as a distinguished one; for instance {{harvtxt|Baas|1876}} lists him among the eminent physicians of the \"older Vienna School\". He was a prolific author.\n\nTrnka composed music, but apparently composition was only a hobby for him, and he was not judged sufficiently important as a composer to merit an article in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''. According to Link, Trnka was a friend of the famous musical patron and organizer [[Gottfried van Swieten]], son of Gerhard.<ref name=\"Link-132\">Link (2006:132)</ref>\n\nHe died in Pest on 12 May 1791.<ref>Hecker (1839:552)</ref>\n\n==The Mozart misattribution==\n\nTrnka emerged into public view in 1988 when it was revealed by [[Wolfgang Plath]] that he was the composer of two minor works previously attributed to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. Trnka's compositional specialization appears to have been [[Canon (music)|canon]]s, a form of music at the time often sung recreationally among friends. According to Link, at least 61 canons by Trnka survive, and all but one are to lyrics by the famous librettist [[Metastasio]].<ref name=\"Link-132\" /> Mozart enjoyed singing canons with his friends (see [[Difficile lectu (Mozart)#First performance|\"Difficile lectu\"]]), and particularly liked canons with humorous scatological lyrics, of which he composed several himself (see [[Mozart and scatology]]). In the present case, Mozart evidently took two canons by Trnka and gave them new lyrics, which he probably wrote himself. Trnka's \"Tu sei gelosa, \u00e8 vero\" became Mozart's \"[[Leck mir den Arsch fein recht sch\u00f6n sauber]]\" (\"Lick me in the ass right well and clean\"), and Trnka's \"So che vanti un cor ingrato\" became Mozart's \"[[Bei der Hitz im Sommer e\u00df ich]]\" (\"In the heat of summer I eat\"<ref>Ochs (1991) translates the first verse of Mozart's words thus: \"In the heat of summer I like eating beetroot and kraut, also butter and radish, making splendid wind that cools me right off.\"</ref>). These works were mistaken as Mozart's compositions when his widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]] sent them as part of a bundle of canons in 1800 to the publisher [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]], who four years later duly published them as Mozart's work.<ref>Zaslaw (2006:113)</ref> They entered the standard [[K\u00f6chel catalogue]] as K.&nbsp;233 and K.&nbsp;234 (K<sup>6</sup> 382e).\n\nThe musicologist Albert Dunning anticipated Plath's findings: in his prefatory remarks to the 1974 ''[[Neue Mozart-Ausgabe]]'' edition of the canons he suggested (based on stylistic grounds and the lack of primary sources) that the two canons (and one other) were not by Mozart.<ref>Link (2006,133)</ref>\n\n==Works (partial)==\n*(1775) ''Historia febrium intermittentium, omnis aevi observata et inventa illustriora medica ad has febres pertinentia complectens'' [on malaria].

He was a prolific author.\n\nTrnka composed music, but apparently composition was only a hobby for him, and he was not judged sufficiently important as a composer to merit an article in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''. According to Link, Trnka was a friend of the famous musical patron and organizer [[Gottfried van Swieten]], son of Gerhard.<ref name=\"Link-132\">Link (2006:132)</ref>\n\nHe died in Pest on 12 May 1791.<ref>Hecker (1839:552)</ref>\n\n==The Mozart misattribution==\n\nTrnka emerged into public view in 1988 when it was revealed by [[Wolfgang Plath]] that he was the composer of two minor works previously attributed to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. Trnka's compositional specialization appears to have been [[Canon (music)|canon]]s, a form of music at the time often sung recreationally among friends. According to Link, at least 61 canons by Trnka survive, and all but one are to lyrics by the famous librettist [[Metastasio]].<ref name=\"Link-132\" /> Mozart enjoyed singing canons with his friends (see [[Difficile lectu (Mozart)#First performance|\"Difficile lectu\"]]), and particularly liked canons with humorous scatological lyrics, of which he composed several himself (see [[Mozart and scatology]]). In the present case, Mozart evidently took two canons by Trnka and gave them new lyrics, which he probably wrote himself. Trnka's \"Tu sei gelosa, \u00e8 vero\" became Mozart's \"[[Leck mir den Arsch fein recht sch\u00f6n sauber]]\" (\"Lick me in the ass right well and clean\"), and Trnka's \"So che vanti un cor ingrato\" became Mozart's \"[[Bei der Hitz im Sommer e\u00df ich]]\" (\"In the heat of summer I eat\"<ref>Ochs (1991) translates the first verse of Mozart's words thus: \"In the heat of summer I like eating beetroot and kraut, also butter and radish, making splendid wind that cools me right off.\"</ref>). These works were mistaken as Mozart's compositions when his widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]] sent them as part of a bundle of canons in 1800 to the publisher [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]], who four years later duly published them as Mozart's work.<ref>Zaslaw (2006:113)</ref> They entered the standard [[K\u00f6chel catalogue]] as K.&nbsp;233 and K.&nbsp;234 (K<sup>6</sup> 382e).\n\nThe musicologist Albert Dunning anticipated Plath's findings: in his prefatory remarks to the 1974 ''[[Neue Mozart-Ausgabe]]'' edition of the canons he suggested (based on stylistic grounds and the lack of primary sources) that the two canons (and one other) were not by Mozart.<ref>Link (2006,133)</ref>\n\n==Works (partial)==\n*(1775) ''Historia febrium intermittentium, omnis aevi observata et inventa illustriora medica ad has febres pertinentia complectens'' [on malaria].

The [[Snout|muzzle]] is pale coloured, and the lower part of the legs are pure white or tan. The cows and young bulls are paler, and in some instances have a rufous tinge, which is most marked in groups inhabiting dry and open areas.

They have a distinct ridge running from the shoulders to the middle of the back; the shoulders may be as much as {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} higher than the rump.

In other areas, they have become largely [[nocturnal]] due to forest molestation caused by humans. In central India, they are most active at night, and are rarely seen in the open after 8 o'clock in the morning. During the dry season, herds congregate and remain in small areas, dispersing into the hills with the arrival of the [[monsoon]]. While gaur depend on water for drinking, they do not seem to bathe or wallow.<ref name=Nowak1999 />\n\nIn January and February, gaur live in small herds of eight to 11 individuals, one of which is a bull. In April or May, more bulls may join the herd for mating, and individual bulls may move from herd to herd, each mating with many cows. In May or June, they leave the herd and may form herds of bulls only or live alone. Herds wander {{Convert|2|-|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} each day. Each herd has a nonexclusive home range, and sometimes herds may join in groups of 50 or more.<ref name=\"Burton\" />\n\nGaur herds are led by an old adult female, the matriarch. Adult males may be solitary. During the peak of the breeding season, unattached males wander widely in search of receptive females. No serious fighting between males has been recorded, with size being the major factor in determining dominance. Males make a [[mating call]] of clear, resonant tones which may carry for more than {{Convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

When alarmed, gaur crash into the jungle at a surprising speed. However, in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South India]], where they are used to the presence of humans, gaur are said by locals to be very bold and aggressive. They are frequently known to go into fields and graze alongside domestic cattle, sometimes killing them in fights. Gaur bulls may charge without provocation, especially during summer, when the intense heat and parasitic insects make them more short-tempered than usual. To warn other members of its herd of approaching danger, the gaur lets out a high whistle for help.<ref name=Sanderson1907 />\n\n=== Feeding ecology ===\n\nWild gaur [[Grazing (behaviour)|graze]] and [[browsing (herbivory)|browse]] on a wider variety of plants than any other ungulate species of India, with a preference for the upper portions of plants, such as leaf blades, stems, seeds and flowers of grass species, including ''[[Adina cordifolia|kadam]]''.<ref>Shukla, R., Khare, P.

They consume herbs, young shoots, flowers, fruits of [[Dillenia|elephant apple]] (''Dillenia'' ssp.) with a high preference for leaves. Food preference varies by season. In winter and [[monsoon]], they feed on preferably fine and fresh [[True grass|grasses]] and herb species of the [[Fabaceae|legume family]], such as [[Desmodium triflorum|tick clover]] (''Desmodium triflorum''), but also browse on leaves of shrub species such as [[Strobilanthes callosus|karvy]] (''Strobilanthes callosus''), [[Gardenia latifolia|Indian boxwood]] (''Gardenia latifolia''), [[Grewia abutifolia|mallow-leaved crossberry]] (''Grewia abutifolia''), [[Helicteres|East-Indian screw tree]] (''Helicteres'' ssp.) and the [[Vitex negundo|chaste tree]] (''Vitex negundo''). In summer, they also feed on bark of [[Tectona grandis|teak]] (''Tectona grandis''), on fruit of [[Cassia fistula|golden shower tree]] (''Cassia fistula''), and on the bark and fruit of [[Anacardium occidentale|cashew]] (''Anacardium occidentale''). Gaur spent most of their daily time feeding. Peak feeding activity was observed between 6:30 and 8:30&nbsp;am and between 5:30 and 6:45&nbsp;pm.

They may turn to available browse species and fibrous teak bark in summer as green grass and herbaceous resources dry up. High concentrations of calcium (22400 ppm) and phosphorus (400 ppm) have been reported in teak bark, so consumption of teak bark may help animals to satisfy both mineral and other food needs. Long-term survival and conservation of these herbivores depend on the availability of preferred plant species for food. Hence, protection of the historically preferred habitats used by gaur is a significant factor in [[conservation biology]].<ref name=\"Gad\" />\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Gaur with calf.jpg|thumb|A cow with calf]]\nSexual maturity occurs in the gaur's second or third year. Females have one calf, rarely two, after a [[gestation]] period of about 275 days, a few days less than domestic cattle. Calves are typically weaned after seven to 12 months.

There is a prominent ridge on the back. The ears are very large; the tail only just reaches the [[Hock (anatomy)|hocks]], and in old bulls the hair becomes very thin on the back. The adult male is dark brown, approaching black in very old individuals. The upper part of the head, from above the eyes to the nape of the neck, is ashy grey, or occasionally dirty white. The [[Snout|muzzle]] is pale coloured, and the lower part of the legs are pure white or tan. The cows and young bulls are paler, and in some instances have a rufous tinge, which is most marked in groups inhabiting dry and open areas. The tail is shorter than in the typical [[oxen]], reaching only to the hocks. They have a distinct ridge running from the shoulders to the middle of the back; the shoulders may be as much as {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} higher than the rump. This ridge is caused by the great length of the spinous processes of the [[vertebra]]e of the fore-part of the trunk as compared with those of the [[loin]]s. The hair is short, fine and glossy; the hooves are narrow and pointed.<ref name=Lydekker1888>{{cite book |last=Lydekker |first=R. |author-link=Richard Lydekker |year=1888\u20131890 |chapter=The Gaur (''Bos gaurus'') |pages=175\u2013180 |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/newnatuhist02lyderich#page/174/mode/2up |title=The new natural history |volume=2 |publisher=Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History) |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe gaur does not have a distinct [[dewlap]] on the throat and chest. Both sexes have horns, which grow from the sides of the head, curving upwards. Between the horns is a high convex ridge on the forehead. At their bases they present an elliptical cross-section, a characteristic that is more strongly marked in bulls than in cows. The horns are decidedly flattened at the base and regularly curved throughout their length, and are bent inward and slightly backward at their tips. The colour of the horns is some shade of pale green or yellow throughout the greater part of their length, but the tips are black.<ref name=\"Lydekker1888\" /> The horns, of medium size by large bovid standards, grow to a length of {{Convert|60|to|115|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Nowak1999 />\nThe cow is considerably lighter in colour than the bull.

While gaur depend on water for drinking, they do not seem to bathe or wallow.<ref name=Nowak1999 />\n\nIn January and February, gaur live in small herds of eight to 11 individuals, one of which is a bull. In April or May, more bulls may join the herd for mating, and individual bulls may move from herd to herd, each mating with many cows. In May or June, they leave the herd and may form herds of bulls only or live alone. Herds wander {{Convert|2|-|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} each day. Each herd has a nonexclusive home range, and sometimes herds may join in groups of 50 or more.<ref name=\"Burton\" />\n\nGaur herds are led by an old adult female, the matriarch. Adult males may be solitary. During the peak of the breeding season, unattached males wander widely in search of receptive females. No serious fighting between males has been recorded, with size being the major factor in determining dominance. Males make a [[mating call]] of clear, resonant tones which may carry for more than {{Convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Gaur have also been known to make a whistling snort as an alarm call, and a low, cow-like moo.<ref name=\"Huffman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Bos_frontalis.html |title=Bos frontalis \u2013 Gaur |last=Huffman |first=B. |year=2004 |publisher=ultimateungulate.com}}</ref>\n\nIn some regions in India where human disturbance is minor, the gaur is very timid and shy despite their great size and power. When alarmed, gaur crash into the jungle at a surprising speed. However, in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South India]], where they are used to the presence of humans, gaur are said by locals to be very bold and aggressive. They are frequently known to go into fields and graze alongside domestic cattle, sometimes killing them in fights. Gaur bulls may charge without provocation, especially during summer, when the intense heat and parasitic insects make them more short-tempered than usual. To warn other members of its herd of approaching danger, the gaur lets out a high whistle for help.<ref name=Sanderson1907 />\n\n=== Feeding ecology ===\n\nWild gaur [[Grazing (behaviour)|graze]] and [[browsing (herbivory)|browse]] on a wider variety of plants than any other ungulate species of India, with a preference for the upper portions of plants, such as leaf blades, stems, seeds and flowers of grass species, including ''[[Adina cordifolia|kadam]]''.<ref>Shukla, R., Khare, P. K. (1998). ''Food habits of wild ungulates and their competition with live stock in Pench Wildlife Reserve central India''. Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 95(3): 418\u2013421.</ref>\n\nDuring a survey in the [[Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park]], 32 species of plants were identified as food for gaur. They consume herbs, young shoots, flowers, fruits of [[Dillenia|elephant apple]] (''Dillenia'' ssp.) with a high preference for leaves. Food preference varies by season. In winter and [[monsoon]], they feed on preferably fine and fresh [[True grass|grasses]] and herb species of the [[Fabaceae|legume family]], such as [[Desmodium triflorum|tick clover]] (''Desmodium triflorum''), but also browse on leaves of shrub species such as [[Strobilanthes callosus|karvy]] (''Strobilanthes callosus''), [[Gardenia latifolia|Indian boxwood]] (''Gardenia latifolia''), [[Grewia abutifolia|mallow-leaved crossberry]] (''Grewia abutifolia''), [[Helicteres|East-Indian screw tree]] (''Helicteres'' ssp.) and the [[Vitex negundo|chaste tree]] (''Vitex negundo''). In summer, they also feed on bark of [[Tectona grandis|teak]] (''Tectona grandis''), on fruit of [[Cassia fistula|golden shower tree]] (''Cassia fistula''), and on the bark and fruit of [[Anacardium occidentale|cashew]] (''Anacardium occidentale''). Gaur spent most of their daily time feeding. Peak feeding activity was observed between 6:30 and 8:30&nbsp;am and between 5:30 and 6:45&nbsp;pm. During the hottest hours of the day, 1:30 to 3:30&nbsp;pm, they rest in the shade of big trees.<ref name=\"Gad\">{{cite journal |author=Gad, S. D. |author2=Shyama, S.

They may turn to available browse species and fibrous teak bark in summer as green grass and herbaceous resources dry up. High concentrations of calcium (22400 ppm) and phosphorus (400 ppm) have been reported in teak bark, so consumption of teak bark may help animals to satisfy both mineral and other food needs. Long-term survival and conservation of these herbivores depend on the availability of preferred plant species for food. Hence, protection of the historically preferred habitats used by gaur is a significant factor in [[conservation biology]].<ref name=\"Gad\" />\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Gaur with calf.jpg|thumb|A cow with calf]]\nSexual maturity occurs in the gaur's second or third year. Females have one calf, rarely two, after a [[gestation]] period of about 275 days, a few days less than domestic cattle. Calves are typically weaned after seven to 12 months. Breeding takes place year-round, but typically peaks between December and June. The lifespan of a gaur in captivity is up to 30 years.<ref name=\"Burton\">{{cite book |last=Burton |first=R. |title=International Wildlife Encyclopedia |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year=2002 |edition=3rd |pages=936\u2013938 |isbn=978-0-7614-7266-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0_AD0v7vl0C&lpg=PA937&pg=PA937#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural predators ===\nDue to their formidable size and power, gaur have few natural predators besides humans.

The film is a British and American venture distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Eddie Redmayne]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nThe film takes place in France during the early 19th century and tells the story of [[Jean Valjean]] who, while being hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman [[Javert]] after breaking parole, agrees to care for a factory worker's daughter. The story reaches resolution against the background of the [[June Rebellion]].\n\nFollowing the release of the 1980 musical, a [[film adaptation]] was mired in \"development hell\" for over ten years, as the rights were passed on to several major studios, and various directors and actors considered. In 2011, producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] sold the film rights to [[Eric Fellner]], who financed the film through his Working Title Films. In June 2011, production of the film officially began, with Hooper and Mackintosh serving as director and producer, and the main characters were cast later that year. [[Principal photography]] commenced in March 2012, with a budget of $61{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"FirstDay\"/> Filming took place on locations in Greenwich, London, Chatham, Winchester, Bath, and Portsmouth, England; in [[Gourdon, Alpes-Maritimes|Gourdon, France]]; and on soundstages in [[Pinewood Studios]].\n\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' held its [[world premiere]] at [[Leicester Square]] in London on 5 December 2012, and was released 25 December 2012 in the [[United States]] and 11 January 2013 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"premiere\"/><ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lesmiserables2012.htm |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012) |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"usreleasedate\"/> It grossed over $441{{nbsp}}million worldwide.

His [[parole]]d status prevents him from finding work or accommodation, but he is sheltered by the kindly [[Bishop of Digne]]. Stealing his silverware, Valjean is captured by [[National Gendarmerie|police]], but the Bishop claims he gave Valjean the silver, telling him to use it to do something worthwhile with his life. Moved, Valjean breaks his parole to start a new life.\n\nEight years later, Valjean is a respected factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais]]. He is shocked when [[Javert]], formerly a Toulon prison guard, arrives as his new chief of police. Javert suspects Valjean's real identity when he rescues a worker trapped under a cart. One of Valjean's workers, [[Fantine]], is dismissed by the factory foreman upon learning she has an illegitimate daughter [[Cosette]], who lives with greedy innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], to whom Fantine sends her earnings.\n\nTo support her daughter, Fantine sells her hair and teeth, and becomes a [[prostitute]]. Javert arrests her when she attacks an abusive customer, but Valjean rescues her and takes her to the hospital. Learning that a man has been wrongly identified as him, Valjean reveals his identity to the court before returning to the dying Fantine, promising to care for Cosette. Javert arrives to arrest Valjean but he escapes. Paying Fantine's debts to the Th\u00e9nardiers, Valjean flees from Javert with Cosette. They hide in a [[convent]], aided by the worker Valjean rescued.\n\nNine years later, Valjean has become a [[philanthropist]] to the poor in [[Paris]]. [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only government official sympathetic to the poor, dies, and revolutionists called the [[Friends of the ABC]] plot against the [[July Monarchy|monarchy]]. [[Marius Pontmercy]], a member of the Friends, falls in love with Cosette and asks [[\u00c9ponine]], the Th\u00e9nardiers' daughter, to help find her. He and Cosette meet and confess their love; \u00c9ponine, also in love with Marius, is heartbroken.\n\nTh\u00e9nardier attempts to rob Valjean's house, but is stopped by \u00c9ponine. Valjean, afraid Javert is near, plans to flee to [[England]] with Cosette. She leaves Marius a letter, which \u00c9ponine hides from him. During Lamarque's [[funeral procession]], the revolt begins and barricades are built across Paris. Javert poses as an ally to spy on the rebels, but the street urchin [[Gavroche]] exposes him as a policeman. During the first skirmish against the soldiers, \u00c9ponine takes a bullet for Marius and dies in his arms, giving him Cosette's letter and confessing her love. Marius' answer to Cosette is intercepted by Valjean, who joins the revolution to guard Marius.\n\nValjean offers to execute Javert but releases him instead, faking the policeman\u2019s death. By dawn, the soldiers storm the barricade and kill everyone except Marius and Valjean, who escape into the sewers. Th\u00e9nardier comes across Valjean and the unconscious Marius, stealing the latter's ring before pointing a way out. Valjean finds Javert waiting for him, but ignores his threats. Javert, morally confused by the mercy of his nemesis, commits [[suicide]] by throwing himself in the [[Seine]]. Marius recovers, traumatized by the death of his friends.\n\nMarius and Cosette are reunited but Valjean, concerned his presence would threaten their happiness, makes plans to leave and reveals his story to Marius, who promises to remain silent. Cosette and Marius marry, but the Th\u00e9nardiers crash the wedding reception to [[blackmail]] Marius. Th\u00e9nardier claims that he witnessed Valjean carrying a murdered corpse and shows the stolen ring, which Marius recognises as his own. Realizing that Valjean saved him that night, Marius forces Th\u00e9nardier to reveal where Valjean is before leaving with Cosette, and the Th\u00e9nardiers are thrown out of the wedding. At the convent, Cosette and Marius find the dying Valjean, who gives them letters of confession before dying peacefully, and his spirit is guided by the spirits of Fantine and the Bishop to join Eponine, Gavroche, and the Friends of the ABC in the afterlife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Jean Valjean]], a Frenchman released from [[Toulon]] [[Bagne of Toulon|prison]] after 19 years of imprisonment for stealing bread and failed attempts at escaping from the prison.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\"/> Around June 2011, Jackman met with producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] to audition in New York.<ref name=\"THR\"/> To prepare for the role, Jackman lost {{convert|15|lbs}} and later regained {{convert|30|lbs}} to mirror his character's success.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/les-miserables-anne-hathaway-russell-398099?page=2 |title=Inside the Fight to Bring 'Les Mis' to the Screen |last=Galloway |first=Stephen |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> He avoided drinking [[coffee]], warmed up at least 15 minutes every day, kept [[Ricola]] lozenges, drank as much as seven litres of water per day, sat in steam three times a day, took cold baths and used a wet washcloth over his face while flying, citing the musical's original co-director [[Trevor Nunn]] for his training.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-en-les-miserables-hugh-jackman-20121227,0,3437263.story |title='Les Miz': Hugh Jackman prepped with weights, washcloths, desire |last=Dawn |first=Randie |date=27 December 2012 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref> He worked extensively with vocal coach Joan Lader, and managed to extend his vocal range, which he originally categorised a high [[baritone]], up to [[tenor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/hugh-jackman-on-les-miz-and-his-javert-past.html |title=Hugh Jackman on Les Mis\u00e9rables, His Brutal Training Regimen, and His Javert Past |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Javert]], a police inspector dedicating his life to imprisoning Valjean once again.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=81882 |title=Russell Crowe Joins Les Mis\u00e9rables |work=ComingSoon.net |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> Before being cast as Javert, Crowe was initially dissatisfied with the character.

The film is a British and American venture distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Eddie Redmayne]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nThe film takes place in France during the early 19th century and tells the story of [[Jean Valjean]] who, while being hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman [[Javert]] after breaking parole, agrees to care for a factory worker's daughter. The story reaches resolution against the background of the [[June Rebellion]].\n\nFollowing the release of the 1980 musical, a [[film adaptation]] was mired in \"development hell\" for over ten years, as the rights were passed on to several major studios, and various directors and actors considered. In 2011, producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] sold the film rights to [[Eric Fellner]], who financed the film through his Working Title Films. In June 2011, production of the film officially began, with Hooper and Mackintosh serving as director and producer, and the main characters were cast later that year. [[Principal photography]] commenced in March 2012, with a budget of $61{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"FirstDay\"/> Filming took place on locations in Greenwich, London, Chatham, Winchester, Bath, and Portsmouth, England; in [[Gourdon, Alpes-Maritimes|Gourdon, France]]; and on soundstages in [[Pinewood Studios]].\n\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' held its [[world premiere]] at [[Leicester Square]] in London on 5 December 2012, and was released 25 December 2012 in the [[United States]] and 11 January 2013 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"premiere\"/><ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lesmiserables2012.htm |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012) |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"usreleasedate\"/> It grossed over $441{{nbsp}}million worldwide.

His [[parole]]d status prevents him from finding work or accommodation, but he is sheltered by the kindly [[Bishop of Digne]]. Stealing his silverware, Valjean is captured by [[National Gendarmerie|police]], but the Bishop claims he gave Valjean the silver, telling him to use it to do something worthwhile with his life. Moved, Valjean breaks his parole to start a new life.\n\nEight years later, Valjean is a respected factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais]]. He is shocked when [[Javert]], formerly a Toulon prison guard, arrives as his new chief of police. Javert suspects Valjean's real identity when he rescues a worker trapped under a cart. One of Valjean's workers, [[Fantine]], is dismissed by the factory foreman upon learning she has an illegitimate daughter [[Cosette]], who lives with greedy innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], to whom Fantine sends her earnings.\n\nTo support her daughter, Fantine sells her hair and teeth, and becomes a [[prostitute]]. Javert arrests her when she attacks an abusive customer, but Valjean rescues her and takes her to the hospital. Learning that a man has been wrongly identified as him, Valjean reveals his identity to the court before returning to the dying Fantine, promising to care for Cosette. Javert arrives to arrest Valjean but he escapes. Paying Fantine's debts to the Th\u00e9nardiers, Valjean flees from Javert with Cosette. They hide in a [[convent]], aided by the worker Valjean rescued.\n\nNine years later, Valjean has become a [[philanthropist]] to the poor in [[Paris]]. [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only government official sympathetic to the poor, dies, and revolutionists called the [[Friends of the ABC]] plot against the [[July Monarchy|monarchy]]. [[Marius Pontmercy]], a member of the Friends, falls in love with Cosette and asks [[\u00c9ponine]], the Th\u00e9nardiers' daughter, to help find her. He and Cosette meet and confess their love; \u00c9ponine, also in love with Marius, is heartbroken.\n\nTh\u00e9nardier attempts to rob Valjean's house, but is stopped by \u00c9ponine. Valjean, afraid Javert is near, plans to flee to [[England]] with Cosette. She leaves Marius a letter, which \u00c9ponine hides from him. During Lamarque's [[funeral procession]], the revolt begins and barricades are built across Paris. Javert poses as an ally to spy on the rebels, but the street urchin [[Gavroche]] exposes him as a policeman. During the first skirmish against the soldiers, \u00c9ponine takes a bullet for Marius and dies in his arms, giving him Cosette's letter and confessing her love. Marius' answer to Cosette is intercepted by Valjean, who joins the revolution to guard Marius.\n\nValjean offers to execute Javert but releases him instead, faking the policeman\u2019s death. By dawn, the soldiers storm the barricade and kill everyone except Marius and Valjean, who escape into the sewers. Th\u00e9nardier comes across Valjean and the unconscious Marius, stealing the latter's ring before pointing a way out. Valjean finds Javert waiting for him, but ignores his threats. Javert, morally confused by the mercy of his nemesis, commits [[suicide]] by throwing himself in the [[Seine]]. Marius recovers, traumatized by the death of his friends.\n\nMarius and Cosette are reunited but Valjean, concerned his presence would threaten their happiness, makes plans to leave and reveals his story to Marius, who promises to remain silent. Cosette and Marius marry, but the Th\u00e9nardiers crash the wedding reception to [[blackmail]] Marius. Th\u00e9nardier claims that he witnessed Valjean carrying a murdered corpse and shows the stolen ring, which Marius recognises as his own. Realizing that Valjean saved him that night, Marius forces Th\u00e9nardier to reveal where Valjean is before leaving with Cosette, and the Th\u00e9nardiers are thrown out of the wedding.

It is mostly made of [[molecular hydrogen]] and [[helium]] in roughly [[Sun#Composition|solar proportions]]; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and include [[methane]], [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[water]]. Although water is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere, its directly measured concentration is very low. The [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], and [[noble gas]] abundances in Jupiter's atmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three.{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}}\n\nThe atmosphere of [[Jupiter]] lacks a clear lower boundary and gradually transitions into the liquid interior of the planet.<ref name=Guillot1999/> From lowest to highest, the atmospheric layers are the [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], [[thermosphere]] and [[exosphere]].  Each layer has characteristic [[temperature gradient]]s.<ref name=Sieff1998/> The lowest layer, the troposphere, has a complicated system of clouds and hazes, comprising layers of ammonia, [[ammonium hydrosulfide]] and water.{{sfn|Atreya|Wong|2005}} The upper ammonia clouds visible at Jupiter's surface are organized in a dozen [[zonal and meridional|zonal]] bands parallel to the [[equator]] and are bounded by powerful zonal atmospheric flows (winds) known as ''jets''. The bands alternate in color: the dark bands are called ''belts'', while light ones are called ''zones''. Zones, which are colder than belts, correspond to upwellings, while belts mark descending gas.<ref name=Ingersoll1/>  The zones' lighter color is believed to result from ammonia ice; what gives the belts their darker colors is uncertain.<ref name=Ingersoll1/>  The origins of the banded structure and jets are not well understood, though a \"shallow model\" and a \"deep model\" exist.<ref name=1942Vasavada/>\n\nThe Jovian atmosphere shows a wide range of active phenomena, including band instabilities, vortices ([[cyclone]]s and [[anticyclone]]s), storms and lightning.<ref name=1974Vasavada/> The vortices reveal themselves as large red, white or brown spots (ovals). The largest two spots are the [[#Great Red Spot|Great Red Spot]] (GRS)<ref name=1978bVasavada/> and [[#Oval BA|Oval BA]],<ref name=1980Vasavada/> which is also red. These two and most of the other large spots are anticyclonic.  Smaller [[anticyclone]]s tend to be white.  Vortices are thought to be relatively shallow structures with depths not exceeding several hundred kilometers. Located in the southern hemisphere, the GRS is the largest known vortex in the Solar System. It could engulf two or three Earths and has existed for at least three hundred years. Oval BA, south of GRS, is a red spot a third the size of GRS that formed in 2000 from the merging of three white ovals.<ref name=1976Vasavada/>\n\nJupiter has powerful storms, often accompanied by lightning strikes. The storms are a result of moist convection in the atmosphere connected to the evaporation and condensation of water. They are sites of strong upward motion of the air, which leads to the formation of bright and dense clouds. The storms form mainly in belt regions. The lightning strikes on Jupiter are hundreds of times more powerful than those seen on Earth, and are assumed to be associated with the water clouds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bradford A.|last2=Soderblom|first2=Laurence A.|last3=Johnson|first3=Torrence V.|last4=Ingersoll|first4=Andrew P.|last5=Collins|first5=Stewart A.|last6=Shoemaker|first6=Eugene M.|last7=Hunt|first7=G.

Unlike the [[Earth's atmosphere]], Jupiter's lacks a [[mesosphere]].<ref name=Ingersoll7/> Jupiter does not have a solid surface, and the lowest atmospheric layer, the troposphere, smoothly transitions into the planet's fluid interior.<ref name=Guillot1999/> This is a result of having temperatures and the pressures well above those of the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]s for hydrogen and helium, meaning that there is no sharp boundary between gas and liquid phases. Hydrogen becomes a [[supercritical fluid]] at a pressure of around 12 bar.<ref name=Guillot1999>[[#Guillot|Guillot (1999)]]</ref>\n\nSince the lower boundary of the atmosphere is ill-defined, the pressure level of 10&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]]s, at an altitude of about 90&nbsp;km below 1&nbsp;bar  with a temperature of around 340&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], is commonly treated as the base of the troposphere.<ref name=Sieff1998/> In scientific literature, the 1&nbsp;bar pressure level is usually chosen as a zero point for altitudes\u2014a \"surface\" of Jupiter.<ref name=Guillot1999/> As with Earth, the top atmospheric layer, the exosphere, does not have a well defined upper boundary.<ref name=Yelle1>[[#Yelle|Yelle (2004)]], p. 1</ref> The density gradually decreases until it smoothly transitions into the [[interplanetary medium]] approximately 5,000&nbsp;km above the \"surface\".{{sfn|Miller Aylward et al.|2005|p=}}\n\nThe vertical temperature gradients in the Jovian atmosphere are similar to those of the [[atmosphere of Earth]]. The temperature of the troposphere decreases with height until it reaches a minimum at the [[tropopause]],<ref name=Ingersoll4/> which is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere. On Jupiter, the tropopause is approximately 50&nbsp;km above the visible clouds (or 1&nbsp;bar level), where the pressure and temperature are about 0.1&nbsp;bar and 110&nbsp;K.<ref name=Sieff1998/><ref name=Ingersoll3/> In the stratosphere, the temperatures rise to about 200&nbsp;K at the transition into the thermosphere, at an altitude and pressure of around 320&nbsp;km and 1&nbsp;\u03bcbar.<ref name=Sieff1998>[[#Sieff|Sieff ''et al.''

This can also explain the severe depletion of neon (see Table), an element that easily dissolves in helium droplets and would be transported in them towards the core as well.<ref name=Sanders2010>{{cite web|last=Sanders|first=Robert|title=Helium rain on Jupiter explains lack of neon in atmosphere|url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2010/03/22/helium_rain/|publisher=University of Berkeley|accessdate=24 July 2012|date=22 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe atmosphere contains various simple compounds such as [[water]], [[methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>), [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S), [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) and [[phosphine]] (PH<sub>3</sub>).{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}} Their abundances in the deep (below 10&nbsp;bar) troposphere imply that the atmosphere of Jupiter is enriched in the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]] and possibly [[oxygen]]{{ref label|B|b|none}} by factor of 2\u20134 relative to the Sun.{{ref label|C|c|none}}{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}} The noble gases [[argon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] also appear in abundance relative to solar levels (see table), while [[neon]] is scarcer.{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}} Other chemical compounds such as [[arsine]] (AsH<sub>3</sub>) and [[germane]] (GeH<sub>4</sub>) are present only in trace amounts.{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}} The upper atmosphere of Jupiter contains small amounts of simple [[hydrocarbon]]s such as [[ethane]], [[acetylene]], and [[diacetylene]], which form from methane under the influence of the solar [[ultraviolet radiation]] and charged particles coming from [[Jupiter#Magnetosphere|Jupiter's magnetosphere]].{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}} The [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]] and water present in the upper atmosphere are thought to originate from impacting [[comet]]s, such as [[comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]].

As of July 2003, the accepted value for the [[deuterium]] abundance is {{nowrap|(2.25 \u00b1 0.35){{E-sp|\u22125}}}},{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}} which probably represents the primordial value in the [[Nebular hypothesis|protosolar nebula]] that gave birth to the Solar System.{{sfn|Encrenaz|2003}} The ratio of nitrogen isotopes in the Jovian atmosphere, [[nitrogen-15|<sup>15</sup>N]] to [[nitrogen-14|<sup>14</sup>N]], is 2.3{{E-sp|\u22123}}, a third lower than that in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] (3.5{{E-sp|\u22123}}).{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}} The latter discovery is especially significant since the previous theories of [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formation]] considered the terrestrial value for the ratio of nitrogen isotopes to be primordial.{{sfn|Encrenaz|2003}}\n\n== Zones, belts and jets ==\n[[File:Map of Jupiter.jpg|thumb|An [[azimuthal equidistant projection]] of Jupiter's atmosphere centered about Jupiter's north pole]]\nThe visible surface of Jupiter is divided into several bands parallel to the equator. There are two types of bands: lightly colored ''zones'' and relatively dark ''belts.''<ref name=Ingersoll1>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], pp. 2\u20135</ref> The wider [[equator|Equatorial Zone]] (EZ) extends between [[latitude]]s of approximately 7\u00b0S to 7\u00b0N. Above and below the EZ, the North and South Equatorial belts (NEB and SEB) extend to 18\u00b0N and 18\u00b0S, respectively. Farther from the equator lie the North and South Tropical zones (NtrZ and STrZ).<ref name=Ingersoll1/> The alternating pattern of belts and zones continues until the polar regions at approximately 50&nbsp;degrees latitude, where their visible appearance becomes somewhat muted.<ref name=\"Rogers1\">[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 81.</ref> The basic belt-zone structure probably extends well towards the poles, reaching at least to 80\u00b0 North or South.<ref name=Ingersoll1/>\n\nThe difference in the appearance between zones and belts is caused by differences in the opacity of the clouds. Ammonia concentration is higher in zones, which leads to the appearance of denser clouds of ammonia ice at higher altitudes, which in turn leads to their lighter color.<ref name=Ingersoll4/> On the other hand, in belts clouds are thinner and are located at lower altitudes.<ref name=Ingersoll4>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], pp. 5\u20137</ref> The upper troposphere is colder in zones and warmer in belts.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> The exact nature of chemicals that make Jovian zones and bands so colorful is not known, but they may include complicated compounds of [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]] and [[carbon]].<ref name=Ingersoll1/>\n\nThe Jovian bands are bounded by zonal atmospheric flows (winds), called ''jets''. The eastward ([[Direct motion|prograde]]) jets are found at the transition from zones to belts (going away from the equator), whereas westward ([[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]]) jets mark the transition from belts to zones.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> Such flow velocity patterns mean that the zonal winds decrease in belts and increase in zones from the equator to the pole. Therefore, [[wind shear]] in belts is [[cyclone|cyclonic]], while in zones it is [[anticyclone|anticyclonic]].<ref name=1937Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1937</ref> The EZ is an exception to this rule, showing a strong eastward (prograde) jet and has a local minimum of the wind speed exactly at the equator. The jet speeds are high on Jupiter, reaching more than 100&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> These speeds correspond to ammonia clouds located in the pressure range 0.7\u20131&nbsp;bar. The prograde jets are generally more powerful than the retrograde jets.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> The vertical extent of jets is not known. They decay over two to three [[scale height]]s{{ref label|A|a|none}} above the clouds, while below the cloud level, winds increase slightly and then remain constant down to at least 22&nbsp;bar\u2014the maximum operational depth reached by the [[Galileo Probe]].<ref name=Ingersoll3>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], p. 12</ref>\n\n[[File:Wind speeds on Jupiter.png|thumb|left|Zonal wind speeds in the atmosphere of Jupiter]]\n\nThe origin of Jupiter's banded structure is not completely clear, though it may be similar to that driving the Earth's [[Hadley cell]]s. The simplest interpretation is that zones are sites of atmospheric [[upwelling]], whereas belts are manifestations of [[downwelling]].<ref name=Ingersoll2/> When air enriched in ammonia rises in zones, it expands and cools, forming high and dense clouds. In belts, however, the air descends, warming [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]]ally as in a [[convergence zone]] on Earth, and white ammonia clouds evaporate, revealing lower, darker clouds. The location and width of bands, speed and location of jets on Jupiter are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly between 1980 and 2000. One example of change is a decrease of the speed of the strongest eastward jet located at the boundary between the North Tropical zone and North Temperate belts at 23\u00b0N.<ref name=1942Vasavada/><ref name=Ingersoll2>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], p. 5</ref> However bands vary in coloration and intensity over time (see below).  These variations were first observed in the early seventeenth century.<ref>[[#Graney|Graney]] (2010)</ref>\n\n=== Specific bands ===\n[[File:Jupiter cloud bands.svg|thumb|300px|Idealized illustration of Jupiter's cloud bands, labeled with their official abbreviations. Lighter zones are indicated to the right, darker belts to the left. The Great Red Spot and Oval BA are shown in the South Tropical Zone and South Temperate Belt, respectively.]]\n\nThe belts and zones that divide Jupiter's atmosphere each have their own names and unique characteristics. They begin below the North and South Polar Regions, which extend from the poles to roughly 40\u201348\u00b0 N/S. These bluish-gray regions are usually featureless.<ref name=\"Rogers1\" />\n\nThe North North Temperate Region rarely shows more detail than the polar regions, due to [[limb darkening]], [[foreshortening]], and the general diffuseness of features. However, the North-North Temperate Belt (NNTB) is the northernmost distinct belt, though it occasionally disappears. Disturbances tend to be minor and short-lived. The North-North Temperate Zone (NNTZ) is perhaps more prominent, but also generally quiet. Other minor belts and zones in the region are occasionally observed.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 85, 91\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe North Temperate Region is part of a latitudinal region easily observable from Earth, and thus has a superb record of observation.<ref name=\"Rogers2\">[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 101\u2013105.</ref> It also features the strongest [[Direct motion|prograde]] [[jet stream]] on the planet\u2014a westerly current that forms the southern boundary of the North Temperate Belt (NTB).<ref name=\"Rogers2\" /> The NTB fades roughly once a decade (this was the case during the ''Voyager'' encounters), making the North Temperate Zone (NTZ) apparently merge into the North Tropical Zone (NTropZ).<ref name=\"Rogers2\" /> Other times, the NTZ is divided by a narrow belt into northern and southern components.<ref name=\"Rogers2\" />\n\nThe North Tropical Region is composed of the NTropZ and the North Equatorial Belt (NEB). The NTropZ is generally stable in coloration, changing in tint only in tandem with activity on the NTB's southern jet stream. Like the NTZ, it too is sometimes divided by a narrow band, the NTropB. On rare occasions, the southern NTropZ plays host to \"Little Red Spots\". As the name suggests, these are northern equivalents of the Great Red Spot. Unlike the GRS, they tend to occur in pairs and are always short-lived, lasting a year on average; one was present during the ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' encounter.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp.113\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe NEB is one of the most active belts on the planet. It is characterized by anticyclonic white ovals and cyclonic \"barges\" (also known as \"brown ovals\"), with the former usually forming farther north than the latter; as in the NTropZ, most of these features are relatively short-lived. Like the South Equatorial Belt (SEB), the NEB has sometimes dramatically faded and \"revived\". The timescale of these changes is about 25 years.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 125\u2013130.</ref>\n\n[[File:PIA02863 - Jupiter surface motion animation.gif|thumb|500px|Zones, belts and vortices on Jupiter. The wide equatorial zone is visible in the center surrounded by two dark equatorial belts (SEB and NEB). The large grayish-blue irregular \"hot spots\" at the northern edge of the white Equatorial Zone change over the course of time as they march eastward across the planet. The Great Red Spot is at the southern margin of the SEB. Strings of small storms rotate around northern-hemisphere ovals. Small, very bright features, possible lightning storms, appear quickly and randomly in turbulent regions. The smallest features visible at the equator are about 600 kilometers across. This 14-frame animation spans 24 Jovian days, or about 10 Earth days. The passage of time is accelerated by a factor of 600,000. The occasional black spots in the image are [[moons of Jupiter]] getting into the field of view.]]\n\nThe Equatorial Region (EZ) is one of the most stable regions of the planet, in latitude and in activity. The northern edge of the EZ hosts spectacular plumes that trail southwest from the NEB, which are bounded by dark, warm (in [[infrared]]) features known as festoons (hot spots).<ref name=1987Vasavada/> Though the southern boundary of the EZ is usually quiescent, observations from the late 19th into the early 20th century show that this pattern was then reversed relative to today. The EZ varies considerably in coloration, from pale to an [[ochre]], or even coppery hue; it is occasionally divided by an Equatorial Band (EB).<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 133, 145\u2013147.</ref> Features in the EZ move roughly 390&nbsp;km/h relative to the other latitudes.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 133.</ref><ref>[[#Beebe|Beebe (1997)]], p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe South Tropical Region includes the South Equatorial Belt (SEB) and the South Tropical Zone. It is by far the most active region on the planet, as it is home to its strongest [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] jet stream. The SEB is usually the broadest, darkest belt on Jupiter; it is sometimes split by a zone (the SEBZ), and can fade entirely every 3 to 15 years before reappearing in what is known as an SEB Revival cycle. A period of weeks or months following the belt's disappearance, a white spot forms and erupts dark brownish material which is stretched into a new belt by Jupiter's winds. The belt most recently disappeared in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jupiter, It Is A-Changing|author=Nancy Atkinson|publisher=Universe Today|url=http://www.universetoday.com/2010/05/13/jupiter-it-is-a-changing/|date=2010|accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref>  Another characteristic of the SEB is a long train of cyclonic disturbances following the Great Red Spot. Like the NTropZ, the STropZ is one of the most prominent zones on the planet; not only does it contain the GRS, but it is occasionally rent by a South Tropical Disturbance (STropD), a division of the zone that can be very long-lived; the most famous one lasted from 1901 to 1939.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 159\u2013160</ref>\n[[File:Jupiter at a glance.jpg|thumb|This image from the HST reveals a rare wave structure just north of the planet's equator.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hubble's planetary portrait captures changes in Jupiter's Great Red Spot|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1522/|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref>]]\nThe South Temperate Region, or South Temperate Belt (STB), is yet another dark, prominent belt, more so than the NTB; until March 2000, its most famous features were the long-lived white ovals BC, DE, and FA, which have since merged to form Oval BA (\"Red Jr.\").

The interior of Jupiter is fluid and lacks any solid surface. Therefore, [[convection]] may occur throughout the planet's outer molecular envelope. As of 2008, a comprehensive theory of the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere has not been developed. Any such theory needs to explain the following facts: the existence of narrow stable bands and jets that are symmetric relative to Jupiter's equator, the strong prograde jet observed at the equator, the difference between zones and belts, and the origin and persistence of large vortices such as the Great Red Spot.<ref name=1942Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1942\u20131974</ref>\n\nThe theories regarding the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere can be broadly divided into two classes: shallow and deep. The former hold that the observed circulation is largely confined to a thin outer (weather) layer of the planet, which overlays the stable interior. The latter hypothesis postulates that the observed atmospheric flows are only a surface manifestation of deeply rooted circulation in the outer molecular envelope of Jupiter.<ref name=1943Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1943\u20131945</ref> As both theories have their own successes and failures, many planetary scientists think that the true theory will include elements of both models.<ref name=Heimpel2005>[[#Heimpel2005|Heimpel ''et al.'' (2005)]]</ref>\n\n=== Shallow models ===\nThe first attempts to explain Jovian atmospheric dynamics date back to the 1960s.<ref name=1943Vasavada/><ref name=Ingersoll1969>See, e. g., [[#Ingersoll1969|Ingersoll ''et al.'' (1969)]]</ref> They were partly based on terrestrial [[meteorology]], which had become well developed by that time. Those shallow models assumed that the jets on Jupiter are driven by small scale [[turbulence]], which is in turn maintained by moist convection in the outer layer of the atmosphere (above the water clouds).<ref name=1947Vasavada/><ref name=Ingersoll5>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], pp. 16\u201317</ref> The moist convection is a phenomenon related to the condensation and evaporation of water and is one of the major drivers of terrestrial weather.<ref name=Ingersoll6>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], pp. 14\u201315</ref> The production of the jets in this model is related to a well-known property of two dimensional turbulence\u2014the so-called inverse cascade, in which small turbulent structures (vortices) merge to form larger ones.<ref name=1947Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1947\u20131958</ref> The finite size of the planet means that the cascade can not produce structures larger than some characteristic scale, which for Jupiter is called the Rhines scale. Its existence is connected to production of [[Rossby wave]]s. This process works as follows: when the largest turbulent structures reach a certain size, the energy begins to flow into Rossby waves instead of larger structures, and the inverse cascade stops.<ref name=1949Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1949</ref> Since on the spherical rapidly rotating planet the [[dispersion relation]] of the Rossby waves is [[anisotropic]], the Rhines scale in the direction parallel to the equator is larger than in the direction orthogonal to it.<ref name=1949Vasavada/> The ultimate result of the process described above is production of large scale elongated structures, which are parallel to the equator. The meridional extent of them appears to match the actual width of jets.<ref name=1947Vasavada/> Therefore, in shallow models vortices actually feed the jets and should disappear by merging into them.\n\nWhile these weather\u2013layer models can successfully explain the existence of a dozen narrow jets, they have serious problems.<ref name=1947Vasavada/> A glaring failure of the model is the prograde (super-rotating) equatorial jet: with some rare exceptions shallow models produce a strong retrograde (subrotating) jet, contrary to observations. In addition, the jets tend to be unstable and can disappear over time.<ref name=1947Vasavada/> Shallow models cannot explain how the observed atmospheric flows on Jupiter violate stability criteria.<ref name=1945Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1945\u20131947</ref> More elaborated multilayer versions of weather\u2013layer models produce more stable circulation, but many problems persist.<ref name=1962Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1962\u20131966</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Galileo Probe]] found that the winds on Jupiter extend well below the water clouds at 5\u20137&nbsp;bar and do not show any evidence of decay down to 22&nbsp;bar pressure level, which implies that circulation in the Jovian atmosphere may in fact be deep.<ref name=Ingersoll3/>\n\n=== Deep models ===\nThe deep model was first proposed by Busse in 1976.<ref name=1966Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1966</ref><ref name=Busse1976>[[#Busse|Busse (1976)]]</ref> His model was based on another well-known feature of fluid mechanics, the [[Taylor\u2013Proudman theorem]]. It holds that in any fast-rotating [[barotropic]] ideal liquid, the flows are organized in a series of cylinders parallel to the rotational axis. The conditions of the theorem are probably met in the fluid Jovian interior. Therefore, the planet's molecular hydrogen mantle may be divided into cylinders, each cylinder having a circulation independent of the others.<ref name=1966-1Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1966\u20131972</ref> Those latitudes where the cylinders' outer and inner boundaries intersect with the visible surface of the planet correspond to the jets; the cylinders themselves are observed as zones and belts.\n[[File:Thermal emission of Jupiter.jpg|thumb|Thermal image of Jupiter obtained by [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility]]]]\nThe deep model easily explains the strong prograde jet observed at the equator of Jupiter; the jets it produces are stable and do not obey the 2D stability criterion.<ref name=1966-1Vasavada/> However it has major difficulties; it produces a very small number of broad jets, and realistic simulations of 3D flows are not possible as of 2008, meaning that the simplified models used to justify deep circulation may fail to catch important aspects of the [[fluid mechanics|fluid dynamics]] within Jupiter.<ref name=1966-1Vasavada/> One model published in 2004 successfully reproduced the Jovian band-jet structure.<ref name=Heimpel2005/> It assumed that the molecular hydrogen mantle is thinner than in all other models; occupying only the outer 10% of Jupiter's radius. In standard models of the Jovian interior, the mantle comprises the outer 20\u201330%.<ref name=1970Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1970</ref> The driving of deep circulation is another problem. The deep flows can be caused both by shallow forces (moist convection, for instance) or by deep planet-wide convection that transports heat out of the Jovian interior.<ref name=1947Vasavada/> Which of these mechanisms is more important is not clear yet.\n\n=== Internal heat ===\nAs has been known since 1966,<ref name=Low>[[#Low|Low (1966)]]</ref> Jupiter radiates much more heat than it receives from the Sun. It is estimated that the ratio between the power emitted by the planet and that absorbed from the Sun is {{nowrap|1.67 \u00b1 0.09}}. The internal [[heat flux]] from Jupiter is {{nowrap|5.44 \u00b1 0.43 W/m<sup>2</sup>}}, whereas the total emitted power is {{nowrap|335 \u00b1 26 [[petawatt]]s}}. The latter value is approximately equal to one billionth of the total power radiated by the Sun. This excess heat is mainly the primordial heat from the early phases of Jupiter's formation, but may result in part from the precipitation of helium into the core.{{sfn|Pearl Conrath et al.|1990|pp=12, 26}}\n\nThe [[internal heat]] may be important for the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere. While Jupiter has a small obliquity of about 3\u00b0, and its poles receive much less solar radiation than its equator, the tropospheric temperatures do not change appreciably from the equator to poles. One explanation is that Jupiter's convective interior acts like a thermostat, releasing more heat near the poles than in the equatorial region. This leads to a uniform temperature in the troposphere. While heat is transported from the equator to the poles mainly [[Atmospheric circulation|via the atmosphere]] on Earth, on Jupiter deep convection [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Thermal equilibrium|equilibrates]] heat. The convection in the Jovian interior is thought to be driven mainly by the internal heat.<ref name=Ingersoll9>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], pp. 11, 17\u201318</ref>\n\n== Discrete features ==\n=== Vortices ===\n[[File:NH Jupiter IR (contrast enhanced).jpg|thumb|right|''[[New Horizons]]'' IR view of Jupiter's atmosphere]]\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter is home to hundreds of [[vortex|vortices]]\u2014circular rotating structures that, as in the Earth's atmosphere, can be divided into two classes: [[cyclone]]s and [[anticyclone]]s.<ref name=1974Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1974</ref> Cyclones rotate in the direction similar to the rotation of the planet ([[counterclockwise]] in the northern hemisphere and [[clockwise]] in the southern); anticyclones rotate in the reverse direction. However, unlike in the [[Earth's atmosphere|terrestrial atmosphere]], anticyclones predominate over cyclones on Jupiter\u2014more than 90% of vortices larger than 2000&nbsp;km in diameter are anticyclones.<ref name=1978Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1978</ref> The lifetime of Jovian vortices varies from several days to hundreds of years, depending on their size. For instance, the average lifetime of an anticyclone between 1000 and 6000&nbsp;km in diameter is 1\u20133 years.<ref name=1977Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1977</ref> Vortices have never been observed in the equatorial region of Jupiter (within 10\u00b0 of latitude), where they are unstable.<ref name=1976Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1976</ref> As on any rapidly rotating planet, Jupiter's anticyclones are high [[pressure]] centers, while cyclones are low pressure.<ref name=1987Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1987\u20131989</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Cold Spot discovered on Jupiter.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Great Cold Spot on Jupiter<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Cold Spot discovered on Jupiter|url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1716a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>]]\n[[File:PIA21972 Jupiter Blues.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jupiter clouds<br />(''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]''; October 2017)]]\nThe anticyclones in Jupiter's atmosphere are always confined within zones, where the wind speed increases in direction from the [[equator]] to the poles.<ref name=1977Vasavada/> They are usually bright and appear as white ovals.<ref name=1974Vasavada/> They can move in [[longitude]], but stay at approximately the same latitude as they are unable to escape from the confining zone.<ref name=1976Vasavada/> The wind speeds at their periphery are about 100&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=1980Vasavada/> Different anticyclones located in one zone tend to merge when they approach each other.<ref>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1975</ref> However Jupiter has two anticyclones that are somewhat different from all others. They are the Great Red Spot (GRS)<ref name=1978bVasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1978\u20131980</ref> and the Oval BA;<ref name=1980Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1980\u20131982</ref> the latter formed only in 2000. In contrast to white ovals, these structures are red, arguably due to dredging up of red material from the planet's depths.<ref name=1978bVasavada/> On Jupiter the anticyclones usually form through merges of smaller structures including convective storms (see below),<ref name=1977Vasavada/> although large ovals can result from the instability of jets. The latter was observed in 1938\u20131940, when a few white ovals appeared as a result of instability of the southern temperate zone; they later merged to form Oval BA.<ref name=1980Vasavada/><ref name=1977Vasavada/>\n\nIn contrast to anticyclones, the Jovian cyclones tend to be small, dark and irregular structures. Some of the darker and more regular features are known as brown ovals (or badges).<ref name=1978Vasavada/> However the existence of a few long\u2013lived large cyclones has been suggested. In addition to compact cyclones, Jupiter has several large irregular filamentary patches, which demonstrate [[cyclonic rotation]].<ref name=1974Vasavada/> One of them is located to the west of the GRS (in its [[wake]] region) in the southern equatorial belt.<ref name=1979Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1979</ref> These patches are called cyclonic regions (CR). The cyclones are always located in the belts and tend to merge when they encounter each other, much like anticyclones.<ref name=1977Vasavada/>\n\nThe deep structure of vortices is not completely clear. They are thought to be relatively thin, as any thickness greater than about 500&nbsp;km will lead to instability. The large anticyclones are known to extend only a few tens of kilometers above the visible clouds. The early hypothesis that the vortices are deep [[convection|convective plume]]s (or convective columns) as of 2008 is not shared by the majority of [[planetary science|planetary scientist]]s.<ref name=1976Vasavada/>\n\n====Great Red Spot====\n{{main|Great Red Spot}}\n<!--DO NOT split this section into a separate article without first discussing the issue on the talk page.

They reveal themselves via bright clumpy clouds about 1000&nbsp;km in size, which appear from time to time in the belts' cyclonic regions, especially within the strong westward (retrograde) jets.<ref name=1982Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1982, 1985\u20131987</ref> In contrast to vortices, storms are short-lived phenomena; the strongest of them may exist for several months, while the average lifetime is only 3\u20134 days.<ref name=1982Vasavada/> They are believed to be due mainly to moist convection within Jupiter's troposphere. Storms are actually tall convective columns ([[Plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]]s), which bring the wet air from the depths to the upper part of the troposphere, where it condenses in clouds. A typical vertical extent of Jovian storms is about 100&nbsp;km; as they extend from a pressure level of about 5\u20137&nbsp;bar, where the base of a hypothetical water cloud layer is located, to as high as 0.2\u20130.5&nbsp;bar.<ref name=Sanchez-Lavega2008-437>[[#Sanchez2008|Sanchez-Lavega ''et al.'' (2008)]], pp. 437\u2013438</ref>\n\nStorms on Jupiter are always associated with [[lightning]]. The imaging of the night\u2013side hemisphere of Jupiter by ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' and ''[[Cassini (spacecraft)|Cassini]]'' spacecraft revealed regular light flashes in Jovian belts and near the locations of the westward jets, particularly at 51\u00b0N, 56\u00b0S and 14\u00b0S latitudes.<ref name=1983Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1983\u20131985</ref> On Jupiter lightning strikes are on average a few times more powerful than those on Earth. However, they are less frequent; the light [[power (physics)|power]] emitted from a given area is similar to that on Earth.<ref name=1983Vasavada/> A few flashes have been detected in polar regions, making Jupiter the second known planet after Earth to exhibit polar lightning.{{sfn|Baines Simon-Miller et al.|2007|p=226}} A [[Microwave Radiometer (Juno)|Microwave Radiometer (''Juno'')]] detected many more in 2018.\n\nEvery 15\u201317 years Jupiter is marked by especially powerful storms. They appear at 23\u00b0N latitude, where the strongest eastward jet, that can reach 150&nbsp;m/s, is located. The last time such an event was observed was in March\u2013June 2007.<ref name=Sanchez-Lavega2008-437/> Two storms appeared in the northern temperate belt 55\u00b0 apart in longitude. They significantly disturbed the belt. The dark material that was shed by the storms mixed with clouds and changed the belt's color. The storms moved with a speed as high as 170&nbsp;m/s, slightly faster than the jet itself, hinting at the existence of strong winds deep in the atmosphere.<ref name=Sanchez-Lavega2008-437/>\n[[File:Jupiter equatorial hot spot.jpg|thumb|right|False color image of an equatorial hot spot]]\n\n=== Disturbances ===\nThe normal pattern of bands and zones is sometimes disrupted for periods of time. One particular class of disruption are long-lived darkenings of the South Tropical Zone, normally referred to as \"South Tropical Disturbances\" (STD). The longest lived STD in recorded history was followed from 1901 until 1939, having been first seen by [[Percy B. Molesworth]] on February 28, 1901. It took the form of darkening over part of the normally bright South Tropical zone. Several similar disturbances in the South Tropical Zone have been recorded since then.<ref>[[#McKim|McKim (1997)]]</ref>\n\n=== Hot spots ===\nOne of the most mysterious features in the atmosphere of Jupiter are hot spots. In them, the air is relatively free of clouds and heat can escape from the depths without much absorption. The spots look like bright spots in the infrared images obtained at the wavelength of about 5&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=1987Vasavada/> They are preferentially located in the belts, although there is a train of prominent hot spots at the northern edge of the Equatorial Zone. The [[Galileo Probe|''Galileo'' Probe]] descended into one of those equatorial spots. Each equatorial spot is associated with a bright cloudy [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] located to the west of it and reaching up to 10,000&nbsp;km in size.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> Hot spots generally have round shapes, although they do not resemble vortexes.<ref name=1987Vasavada/>\n\nThe origin of hot spots is not clear. They can be either [[downdraft]]s, where the descending air is [[adiabatic]]ally heated and dried  or, alternatively, they can be a manifestation of planetary scale waves. The latter hypotheses explains the periodical pattern of the equatorial spots.<ref name=Ingersoll1/><ref name=1987Vasavada/>\n\n== Observational history ==\n{{main|Exploration of Jupiter}}\n[[File:790106-0203 Voyager 58M to 31M reduced.gif|thumb|Time-lapse sequence from the approach of ''[[Voyager 1]]'' to Jupiter]]\nEarly modern astronomers, using small telescopes, recorded the changing appearance of Jupiter's atmosphere.<ref name=Ingersoll8/> Their descriptive terms\u2014belts and zones, brown spots and red spots, plumes, barges, festoons, and streamers\u2014are still used.<ref name=Ingersoll10>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], p. 2</ref> Other terms such as vorticity, vertical motion, cloud heights have entered in use later, in the 20th century.<ref name=Ingersoll8/>\n\nThe first observations of the Jovian atmosphere at higher resolution than possible with Earth-based telescopes were taken by the ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]'' ''[[Pioneer 10|10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11|11]]'' spacecraft. The first truly detailed images of Jupiter's atmosphere were provided by the ''[[Voyager program|Voyagers]]''.<ref name=Ingersoll8/> The two spacecraft were able to image details at a resolution as low as 5&nbsp;km in size in various spectra, and also able to create \"approach movies\" of the atmosphere in motion.<ref name=Ingersoll8/> The [[Galileo Probe]], which suffered an antenna problem, saw less of Jupiter's atmosphere but at a better average resolution and a wider spectral bandwidth.<ref name=Ingersoll8/>\n\nToday, astronomers have access to a continuous record of Jupiter's atmospheric activity thanks to telescopes such as Hubble Space Telescope. These show that the atmosphere is occasionally wracked by massive disturbances, but that, overall, it is remarkably stable.<ref name=Ingersoll8/> The vertical motion of Jupiter's atmosphere was largely determined by the identification of trace gases by ground-based telescopes.<ref name=Ingersoll8/> [[Astronomical spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] studies after the collision of [[Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9]] gave a glimpse of the Jupiter's composition beneath the cloud tops. The presence of diatomic [[sulfur]] (S<sub>2</sub>) and [[carbon disulfide]] (CS<sub>2</sub>) was recorded\u2014the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S<sub>2</sub> in any [[astronomical object]]\u2014 together with other molecules such as [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) and [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S), while [[oxygen]]-bearing molecules such as [[sulfur dioxide]] were not detected, to the surprise of astronomers.<ref name=\"Noll1995\">[[#Noll1995|Noll (1995)]], p. 1307</ref>\n\nThe [[Galileo Probe|''Galileo'' atmospheric probe]], as it plunged into Jupiter, measured the wind, temperature, composition, clouds, and radiation levels down to 22&nbsp;bar. However, below 1&nbsp;bar elsewhere on Jupiter there is uncertainty in the quantities.<ref name=Ingersoll8/>\n\n=== Great Red Spot studies ===\n[[File:Great Red Spot From Voyager 1.jpg|thumb|A narrower view of Jupiter and the Great Red Spot as seen from ''[[Voyager 1]]'' in 1979]]\nThe first sighting of the [[#Great Red Spot|GRS]] is often credited to [[Robert Hooke]], who described a spot on the planet in May 1664; however, it is likely that Hooke's spot was in the wrong belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, versus the current location in the South Equatorial Belt). Much more convincing is [[Giovanni Cassini]]'s description of a \"permanent spot\" in the following year.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 6.</ref> With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713.<ref name=Rogers2008b>[[#Rogers2008b|Rogers (2008)]], pp.111\u2013112</ref>\n\nA minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted around 1700 on a canvas by [[Donato Creti]], which is exhibited in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].<ref name=Rogers188>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 188</ref><ref name=\"Hockey1\">[[#Hockey1999|Hockey, 1999]], pp. 40\u201341.</ref> It is a part of a series of panels in which different (magnified) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes, the creation of all of them overseen by the astronomer [[Eustachio Manfredi]] for accuracy.

It is mostly made of [[molecular hydrogen]] and [[helium]] in roughly [[Sun#Composition|solar proportions]]; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and include [[methane]], [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[water]]. Although water is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere, its directly measured concentration is very low. The [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], and [[noble gas]] abundances in Jupiter's atmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three.{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}}\n\nThe atmosphere of [[Jupiter]] lacks a clear lower boundary and gradually transitions into the liquid interior of the planet.<ref name=Guillot1999/> From lowest to highest, the atmospheric layers are the [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], [[thermosphere]] and [[exosphere]].  Each layer has characteristic [[temperature gradient]]s.<ref name=Sieff1998/> The lowest layer, the troposphere, has a complicated system of clouds and hazes, comprising layers of ammonia, [[ammonium hydrosulfide]] and water.{{sfn|Atreya|Wong|2005}} The upper ammonia clouds visible at Jupiter's surface are organized in a dozen [[zonal and meridional|zonal]] bands parallel to the [[equator]] and are bounded by powerful zonal atmospheric flows (winds) known as ''jets''. The bands alternate in color: the dark bands are called ''belts'', while light ones are called ''zones''. Zones, which are colder than belts, correspond to upwellings, while belts mark descending gas.<ref name=Ingersoll1/>  The zones' lighter color is believed to result from ammonia ice; what gives the belts their darker colors is uncertain.<ref name=Ingersoll1/>  The origins of the banded structure and jets are not well understood, though a \"shallow model\" and a \"deep model\" exist.<ref name=1942Vasavada/>\n\nThe Jovian atmosphere shows a wide range of active phenomena, including band instabilities, vortices ([[cyclone]]s and [[anticyclone]]s), storms and lightning.<ref name=1974Vasavada/> The vortices reveal themselves as large red, white or brown spots (ovals). The largest two spots are the [[#Great Red Spot|Great Red Spot]] (GRS)<ref name=1978bVasavada/> and [[#Oval BA|Oval BA]],<ref name=1980Vasavada/> which is also red. These two and most of the other large spots are anticyclonic.  Smaller [[anticyclone]]s tend to be white.  Vortices are thought to be relatively shallow structures with depths not exceeding several hundred kilometers. Located in the southern hemisphere, the GRS is the largest known vortex in the Solar System. It could engulf two or three Earths and has existed for at least three hundred years. Oval BA, south of GRS, is a red spot a third the size of GRS that formed in 2000 from the merging of three white ovals.<ref name=1976Vasavada/>\n\nJupiter has powerful storms, often accompanied by lightning strikes. The storms are a result of moist convection in the atmosphere connected to the evaporation and condensation of water. They are sites of strong upward motion of the air, which leads to the formation of bright and dense clouds. The storms form mainly in belt regions. The lightning strikes on Jupiter are hundreds of times more powerful than those seen on Earth, and are assumed to be associated with the water clouds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bradford A.|last2=Soderblom|first2=Laurence A.|last3=Johnson|first3=Torrence V.|last4=Ingersoll|first4=Andrew P.|last5=Collins|first5=Stewart A.|last6=Shoemaker|first6=Eugene M.|last7=Hunt|first7=G.

Unlike the [[Earth's atmosphere]], Jupiter's lacks a [[mesosphere]].<ref name=Ingersoll7/> Jupiter does not have a solid surface, and the lowest atmospheric layer, the troposphere, smoothly transitions into the planet's fluid interior.<ref name=Guillot1999/> This is a result of having temperatures and the pressures well above those of the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]s for hydrogen and helium, meaning that there is no sharp boundary between gas and liquid phases. Hydrogen becomes a [[supercritical fluid]] at a pressure of around 12 bar.<ref name=Guillot1999>[[#Guillot|Guillot (1999)]]</ref>\n\nSince the lower boundary of the atmosphere is ill-defined, the pressure level of 10&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]]s, at an altitude of about 90&nbsp;km below 1&nbsp;bar  with a temperature of around 340&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], is commonly treated as the base of the troposphere.<ref name=Sieff1998/> In scientific literature, the 1&nbsp;bar pressure level is usually chosen as a zero point for altitudes\u2014a \"surface\" of Jupiter.<ref name=Guillot1999/> As with Earth, the top atmospheric layer, the exosphere, does not have a well defined upper boundary.<ref name=Yelle1>[[#Yelle|Yelle (2004)]], p. 1</ref> The density gradually decreases until it smoothly transitions into the [[interplanetary medium]] approximately 5,000&nbsp;km above the \"surface\".{{sfn|Miller Aylward et al.|2005|p=}}\n\nThe vertical temperature gradients in the Jovian atmosphere are similar to those of the [[atmosphere of Earth]]. The temperature of the troposphere decreases with height until it reaches a minimum at the [[tropopause]],<ref name=Ingersoll4/> which is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere. On Jupiter, the tropopause is approximately 50&nbsp;km above the visible clouds (or 1&nbsp;bar level), where the pressure and temperature are about 0.1&nbsp;bar and 110&nbsp;K.<ref name=Sieff1998/><ref name=Ingersoll3/> In the stratosphere, the temperatures rise to about 200&nbsp;K at the transition into the thermosphere, at an altitude and pressure of around 320&nbsp;km and 1&nbsp;\u03bcbar.<ref name=Sieff1998>[[#Sieff|Sieff ''et al.''

Ammonia concentration is higher in zones, which leads to the appearance of denser clouds of ammonia ice at higher altitudes, which in turn leads to their lighter color.<ref name=Ingersoll4/> On the other hand, in belts clouds are thinner and are located at lower altitudes.<ref name=Ingersoll4>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], pp. 5\u20137</ref> The upper troposphere is colder in zones and warmer in belts.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> The exact nature of chemicals that make Jovian zones and bands so colorful is not known, but they may include complicated compounds of [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]] and [[carbon]].<ref name=Ingersoll1/>\n\nThe Jovian bands are bounded by zonal atmospheric flows (winds), called ''jets''. The eastward ([[Direct motion|prograde]]) jets are found at the transition from zones to belts (going away from the equator), whereas westward ([[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]]) jets mark the transition from belts to zones.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> Such flow velocity patterns mean that the zonal winds decrease in belts and increase in zones from the equator to the pole. Therefore, [[wind shear]] in belts is [[cyclone|cyclonic]], while in zones it is [[anticyclone|anticyclonic]].<ref name=1937Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1937</ref> The EZ is an exception to this rule, showing a strong eastward (prograde) jet and has a local minimum of the wind speed exactly at the equator. The jet speeds are high on Jupiter, reaching more than 100&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> These speeds correspond to ammonia clouds located in the pressure range 0.7\u20131&nbsp;bar. The prograde jets are generally more powerful than the retrograde jets.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> The vertical extent of jets is not known. They decay over two to three [[scale height]]s{{ref label|A|a|none}} above the clouds, while below the cloud level, winds increase slightly and then remain constant down to at least 22&nbsp;bar\u2014the maximum operational depth reached by the [[Galileo Probe]].<ref name=Ingersoll3>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], p. 12</ref>\n\n[[File:Wind speeds on Jupiter.png|thumb|left|Zonal wind speeds in the atmosphere of Jupiter]]\n\nThe origin of Jupiter's banded structure is not completely clear, though it may be similar to that driving the Earth's [[Hadley cell]]s. The simplest interpretation is that zones are sites of atmospheric [[upwelling]], whereas belts are manifestations of [[downwelling]].<ref name=Ingersoll2/> When air enriched in ammonia rises in zones, it expands and cools, forming high and dense clouds. In belts, however, the air descends, warming [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]]ally as in a [[convergence zone]] on Earth, and white ammonia clouds evaporate, revealing lower, darker clouds. The location and width of bands, speed and location of jets on Jupiter are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly between 1980 and 2000. One example of change is a decrease of the speed of the strongest eastward jet located at the boundary between the North Tropical zone and North Temperate belts at 23\u00b0N.<ref name=1942Vasavada/><ref name=Ingersoll2>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], p. 5</ref> However bands vary in coloration and intensity over time (see below).  These variations were first observed in the early seventeenth century.<ref>[[#Graney|Graney]] (2010)</ref>\n\n=== Specific bands ===\n[[File:Jupiter cloud bands.svg|thumb|300px|Idealized illustration of Jupiter's cloud bands, labeled with their official abbreviations. Lighter zones are indicated to the right, darker belts to the left. The Great Red Spot and Oval BA are shown in the South Tropical Zone and South Temperate Belt, respectively.]]\n\nThe belts and zones that divide Jupiter's atmosphere each have their own names and unique characteristics. They begin below the North and South Polar Regions, which extend from the poles to roughly 40\u201348\u00b0 N/S. These bluish-gray regions are usually featureless.<ref name=\"Rogers1\" />\n\nThe North North Temperate Region rarely shows more detail than the polar regions, due to [[limb darkening]], [[foreshortening]], and the general diffuseness of features. However, the North-North Temperate Belt (NNTB) is the northernmost distinct belt, though it occasionally disappears. Disturbances tend to be minor and short-lived. The North-North Temperate Zone (NNTZ) is perhaps more prominent, but also generally quiet. Other minor belts and zones in the region are occasionally observed.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 85, 91\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe North Temperate Region is part of a latitudinal region easily observable from Earth, and thus has a superb record of observation.<ref name=\"Rogers2\">[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 101\u2013105.</ref> It also features the strongest [[Direct motion|prograde]] [[jet stream]] on the planet\u2014a westerly current that forms the southern boundary of the North Temperate Belt (NTB).<ref name=\"Rogers2\" /> The NTB fades roughly once a decade (this was the case during the ''Voyager'' encounters), making the North Temperate Zone (NTZ) apparently merge into the North Tropical Zone (NTropZ).<ref name=\"Rogers2\" /> Other times, the NTZ is divided by a narrow belt into northern and southern components.<ref name=\"Rogers2\" />\n\nThe North Tropical Region is composed of the NTropZ and the North Equatorial Belt (NEB). The NTropZ is generally stable in coloration, changing in tint only in tandem with activity on the NTB's southern jet stream. Like the NTZ, it too is sometimes divided by a narrow band, the NTropB. On rare occasions, the southern NTropZ plays host to \"Little Red Spots\". As the name suggests, these are northern equivalents of the Great Red Spot. Unlike the GRS, they tend to occur in pairs and are always short-lived, lasting a year on average; one was present during the ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' encounter.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp.113\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe NEB is one of the most active belts on the planet. It is characterized by anticyclonic white ovals and cyclonic \"barges\" (also known as \"brown ovals\"), with the former usually forming farther north than the latter; as in the NTropZ, most of these features are relatively short-lived. Like the South Equatorial Belt (SEB), the NEB has sometimes dramatically faded and \"revived\". The timescale of these changes is about 25 years.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 125\u2013130.</ref>\n\n[[File:PIA02863 - Jupiter surface motion animation.gif|thumb|500px|Zones, belts and vortices on Jupiter. The wide equatorial zone is visible in the center surrounded by two dark equatorial belts (SEB and NEB). The large grayish-blue irregular \"hot spots\" at the northern edge of the white Equatorial Zone change over the course of time as they march eastward across the planet. The Great Red Spot is at the southern margin of the SEB. Strings of small storms rotate around northern-hemisphere ovals. Small, very bright features, possible lightning storms, appear quickly and randomly in turbulent regions. The smallest features visible at the equator are about 600 kilometers across. This 14-frame animation spans 24 Jovian days, or about 10 Earth days. The passage of time is accelerated by a factor of 600,000. The occasional black spots in the image are [[moons of Jupiter]] getting into the field of view.]]\n\nThe Equatorial Region (EZ) is one of the most stable regions of the planet, in latitude and in activity. The northern edge of the EZ hosts spectacular plumes that trail southwest from the NEB, which are bounded by dark, warm (in [[infrared]]) features known as festoons (hot spots).<ref name=1987Vasavada/> Though the southern boundary of the EZ is usually quiescent, observations from the late 19th into the early 20th century show that this pattern was then reversed relative to today. The EZ varies considerably in coloration, from pale to an [[ochre]], or even coppery hue; it is occasionally divided by an Equatorial Band (EB).<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 133, 145\u2013147.</ref> Features in the EZ move roughly 390&nbsp;km/h relative to the other latitudes.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 133.</ref><ref>[[#Beebe|Beebe (1997)]], p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe South Tropical Region includes the South Equatorial Belt (SEB) and the South Tropical Zone. It is by far the most active region on the planet, as it is home to its strongest [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] jet stream. The SEB is usually the broadest, darkest belt on Jupiter; it is sometimes split by a zone (the SEBZ), and can fade entirely every 3 to 15 years before reappearing in what is known as an SEB Revival cycle. A period of weeks or months following the belt's disappearance, a white spot forms and erupts dark brownish material which is stretched into a new belt by Jupiter's winds. The belt most recently disappeared in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jupiter, It Is A-Changing|author=Nancy Atkinson|publisher=Universe Today|url=http://www.universetoday.com/2010/05/13/jupiter-it-is-a-changing/|date=2010|accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref>  Another characteristic of the SEB is a long train of cyclonic disturbances following the Great Red Spot. Like the NTropZ, the STropZ is one of the most prominent zones on the planet; not only does it contain the GRS, but it is occasionally rent by a South Tropical Disturbance (STropD), a division of the zone that can be very long-lived; the most famous one lasted from 1901 to 1939.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 159\u2013160</ref>\n[[File:Jupiter at a glance.jpg|thumb|This image from the HST reveals a rare wave structure just north of the planet's equator.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hubble's planetary portrait captures changes in Jupiter's Great Red Spot|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1522/|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref>]]\nThe South Temperate Region, or South Temperate Belt (STB), is yet another dark, prominent belt, more so than the NTB; until March 2000, its most famous features were the long-lived white ovals BC, DE, and FA, which have since merged to form Oval BA (\"Red Jr.\"). The ovals were part of South Temperate Zone, but they extended into STB partially blocking it.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> The STB has occasionally faded, apparently due to complex interactions between the white ovals and the GRS. The appearance of the South Temperate Zone (STZ)\u2014the zone in which the white ovals originated\u2014is highly variable.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 219\u2013221, 223, 228\u2013229.</ref>\n\nThere are other features on Jupiter that are either temporary or difficult to observe from Earth. The South South Temperate Region is harder to discern even than the NNTR; its detail is subtle and can only be studied well by large telescopes or spacecraft.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 235.</ref> Many zones and belts are more transient in nature and are not always visible. These include the ''Equatorial band'' (EB),<ref name=Rogers2003>[[#Rogers2003|Rogers ''et al.''

When a disturbance divides a normally singular belt or zone, an ''N'' or an ''S'' is added to indicate whether the component is the northern or southern one; e.g., NEB(N) and NEB(S).<ref>[[#Ridpath|Ridpath (1998)]]</ref>\n\n== Dynamics ==\n{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|image1=Jupiter on 2009-07-23 (captured by the Hubble Space Telescope).jpg|image2=Jupiter on 2010-06-07 (captured by the Hubble Space Telescope).jpg|width=200|caption1=<center>2009</center> |caption2=<center>2010</center> <!--initial images for this came from Hubble WFC3-->}}\n\nCirculation in Jupiter's atmosphere is markedly different from that [[Atmospheric circulation|in the atmosphere of Earth]]. The interior of Jupiter is fluid and lacks any solid surface. Therefore, [[convection]] may occur throughout the planet's outer molecular envelope. As of 2008, a comprehensive theory of the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere has not been developed. Any such theory needs to explain the following facts: the existence of narrow stable bands and jets that are symmetric relative to Jupiter's equator, the strong prograde jet observed at the equator, the difference between zones and belts, and the origin and persistence of large vortices such as the Great Red Spot.<ref name=1942Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1942\u20131974</ref>\n\nThe theories regarding the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere can be broadly divided into two classes: shallow and deep. The former hold that the observed circulation is largely confined to a thin outer (weather) layer of the planet, which overlays the stable interior. The latter hypothesis postulates that the observed atmospheric flows are only a surface manifestation of deeply rooted circulation in the outer molecular envelope of Jupiter.<ref name=1943Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1943\u20131945</ref> As both theories have their own successes and failures, many planetary scientists think that the true theory will include elements of both models.<ref name=Heimpel2005>[[#Heimpel2005|Heimpel ''et al.'' (2005)]]</ref>\n\n=== Shallow models ===\nThe first attempts to explain Jovian atmospheric dynamics date back to the 1960s.<ref name=1943Vasavada/><ref name=Ingersoll1969>See, e. g., [[#Ingersoll1969|Ingersoll ''et al.'' (1969)]]</ref> They were partly based on terrestrial [[meteorology]], which had become well developed by that time. Those shallow models assumed that the jets on Jupiter are driven by small scale [[turbulence]], which is in turn maintained by moist convection in the outer layer of the atmosphere (above the water clouds).<ref name=1947Vasavada/><ref name=Ingersoll5>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], pp. 16\u201317</ref> The moist convection is a phenomenon related to the condensation and evaporation of water and is one of the major drivers of terrestrial weather.<ref name=Ingersoll6>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], pp. 14\u201315</ref> The production of the jets in this model is related to a well-known property of two dimensional turbulence\u2014the so-called inverse cascade, in which small turbulent structures (vortices) merge to form larger ones.<ref name=1947Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1947\u20131958</ref> The finite size of the planet means that the cascade can not produce structures larger than some characteristic scale, which for Jupiter is called the Rhines scale. Its existence is connected to production of [[Rossby wave]]s. This process works as follows: when the largest turbulent structures reach a certain size, the energy begins to flow into Rossby waves instead of larger structures, and the inverse cascade stops.<ref name=1949Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1949</ref> Since on the spherical rapidly rotating planet the [[dispersion relation]] of the Rossby waves is [[anisotropic]], the Rhines scale in the direction parallel to the equator is larger than in the direction orthogonal to it.<ref name=1949Vasavada/> The ultimate result of the process described above is production of large scale elongated structures, which are parallel to the equator. The meridional extent of them appears to match the actual width of jets.<ref name=1947Vasavada/> Therefore, in shallow models vortices actually feed the jets and should disappear by merging into them.\n\nWhile these weather\u2013layer models can successfully explain the existence of a dozen narrow jets, they have serious problems.<ref name=1947Vasavada/> A glaring failure of the model is the prograde (super-rotating) equatorial jet: with some rare exceptions shallow models produce a strong retrograde (subrotating) jet, contrary to observations. In addition, the jets tend to be unstable and can disappear over time.<ref name=1947Vasavada/> Shallow models cannot explain how the observed atmospheric flows on Jupiter violate stability criteria.<ref name=1945Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1945\u20131947</ref> More elaborated multilayer versions of weather\u2013layer models produce more stable circulation, but many problems persist.<ref name=1962Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1962\u20131966</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Galileo Probe]] found that the winds on Jupiter extend well below the water clouds at 5\u20137&nbsp;bar and do not show any evidence of decay down to 22&nbsp;bar pressure level, which implies that circulation in the Jovian atmosphere may in fact be deep.<ref name=Ingersoll3/>\n\n=== Deep models ===\nThe deep model was first proposed by Busse in 1976.<ref name=1966Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1966</ref><ref name=Busse1976>[[#Busse|Busse (1976)]]</ref> His model was based on another well-known feature of fluid mechanics, the [[Taylor\u2013Proudman theorem]]. It holds that in any fast-rotating [[barotropic]] ideal liquid, the flows are organized in a series of cylinders parallel to the rotational axis. The conditions of the theorem are probably met in the fluid Jovian interior. Therefore, the planet's molecular hydrogen mantle may be divided into cylinders, each cylinder having a circulation independent of the others.<ref name=1966-1Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1966\u20131972</ref> Those latitudes where the cylinders' outer and inner boundaries intersect with the visible surface of the planet correspond to the jets; the cylinders themselves are observed as zones and belts.\n[[File:Thermal emission of Jupiter.jpg|thumb|Thermal image of Jupiter obtained by [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility]]]]\nThe deep model easily explains the strong prograde jet observed at the equator of Jupiter; the jets it produces are stable and do not obey the 2D stability criterion.<ref name=1966-1Vasavada/> However it has major difficulties; it produces a very small number of broad jets, and realistic simulations of 3D flows are not possible as of 2008, meaning that the simplified models used to justify deep circulation may fail to catch important aspects of the [[fluid mechanics|fluid dynamics]] within Jupiter.<ref name=1966-1Vasavada/> One model published in 2004 successfully reproduced the Jovian band-jet structure.<ref name=Heimpel2005/> It assumed that the molecular hydrogen mantle is thinner than in all other models; occupying only the outer 10% of Jupiter's radius. In standard models of the Jovian interior, the mantle comprises the outer 20\u201330%.<ref name=1970Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1970</ref> The driving of deep circulation is another problem. The deep flows can be caused both by shallow forces (moist convection, for instance) or by deep planet-wide convection that transports heat out of the Jovian interior.<ref name=1947Vasavada/> Which of these mechanisms is more important is not clear yet.\n\n=== Internal heat ===\nAs has been known since 1966,<ref name=Low>[[#Low|Low (1966)]]</ref> Jupiter radiates much more heat than it receives from the Sun. It is estimated that the ratio between the power emitted by the planet and that absorbed from the Sun is {{nowrap|1.67 \u00b1 0.09}}. The internal [[heat flux]] from Jupiter is {{nowrap|5.44 \u00b1 0.43 W/m<sup>2</sup>}}, whereas the total emitted power is {{nowrap|335 \u00b1 26 [[petawatt]]s}}. The latter value is approximately equal to one billionth of the total power radiated by the Sun. This excess heat is mainly the primordial heat from the early phases of Jupiter's formation, but may result in part from the precipitation of helium into the core.{{sfn|Pearl Conrath et al.|1990|pp=12, 26}}\n\nThe [[internal heat]] may be important for the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere. While Jupiter has a small obliquity of about 3\u00b0, and its poles receive much less solar radiation than its equator, the tropospheric temperatures do not change appreciably from the equator to poles. One explanation is that Jupiter's convective interior acts like a thermostat, releasing more heat near the poles than in the equatorial region. This leads to a uniform temperature in the troposphere. While heat is transported from the equator to the poles mainly [[Atmospheric circulation|via the atmosphere]] on Earth, on Jupiter deep convection [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Thermal equilibrium|equilibrates]] heat. The convection in the Jovian interior is thought to be driven mainly by the internal heat.<ref name=Ingersoll9>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], pp. 11, 17\u201318</ref>\n\n== Discrete features ==\n=== Vortices ===\n[[File:NH Jupiter IR (contrast enhanced).jpg|thumb|right|''[[New Horizons]]'' IR view of Jupiter's atmosphere]]\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter is home to hundreds of [[vortex|vortices]]\u2014circular rotating structures that, as in the Earth's atmosphere, can be divided into two classes: [[cyclone]]s and [[anticyclone]]s.<ref name=1974Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1974</ref> Cyclones rotate in the direction similar to the rotation of the planet ([[counterclockwise]] in the northern hemisphere and [[clockwise]] in the southern); anticyclones rotate in the reverse direction.

They are the Great Red Spot (GRS)<ref name=1978bVasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1978\u20131980</ref> and the Oval BA;<ref name=1980Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1980\u20131982</ref> the latter formed only in 2000. In contrast to white ovals, these structures are red, arguably due to dredging up of red material from the planet's depths.<ref name=1978bVasavada/> On Jupiter the anticyclones usually form through merges of smaller structures including convective storms (see below),<ref name=1977Vasavada/> although large ovals can result from the instability of jets. The latter was observed in 1938\u20131940, when a few white ovals appeared as a result of instability of the southern temperate zone; they later merged to form Oval BA.<ref name=1980Vasavada/><ref name=1977Vasavada/>\n\nIn contrast to anticyclones, the Jovian cyclones tend to be small, dark and irregular structures. Some of the darker and more regular features are known as brown ovals (or badges).<ref name=1978Vasavada/> However the existence of a few long\u2013lived large cyclones has been suggested. In addition to compact cyclones, Jupiter has several large irregular filamentary patches, which demonstrate [[cyclonic rotation]].<ref name=1974Vasavada/> One of them is located to the west of the GRS (in its [[wake]] region) in the southern equatorial belt.<ref name=1979Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], p. 1979</ref> These patches are called cyclonic regions (CR). The cyclones are always located in the belts and tend to merge when they encounter each other, much like anticyclones.<ref name=1977Vasavada/>\n\nThe deep structure of vortices is not completely clear. They are thought to be relatively thin, as any thickness greater than about 500&nbsp;km will lead to instability. The large anticyclones are known to extend only a few tens of kilometers above the visible clouds.

Theories supported by laboratory experiments suppose that the color may be caused by complex organic molecules, red phosphorus, or yet another sulfur compound.

They reveal themselves via bright clumpy clouds about 1000&nbsp;km in size, which appear from time to time in the belts' cyclonic regions, especially within the strong westward (retrograde) jets.<ref name=1982Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1982, 1985\u20131987</ref> In contrast to vortices, storms are short-lived phenomena; the strongest of them may exist for several months, while the average lifetime is only 3\u20134 days.<ref name=1982Vasavada/> They are believed to be due mainly to moist convection within Jupiter's troposphere. Storms are actually tall convective columns ([[Plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]]s), which bring the wet air from the depths to the upper part of the troposphere, where it condenses in clouds. A typical vertical extent of Jovian storms is about 100&nbsp;km; as they extend from a pressure level of about 5\u20137&nbsp;bar, where the base of a hypothetical water cloud layer is located, to as high as 0.2\u20130.5&nbsp;bar.<ref name=Sanchez-Lavega2008-437>[[#Sanchez2008|Sanchez-Lavega ''et al.'' (2008)]], pp. 437\u2013438</ref>\n\nStorms on Jupiter are always associated with [[lightning]]. The imaging of the night\u2013side hemisphere of Jupiter by ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' and ''[[Cassini (spacecraft)|Cassini]]'' spacecraft revealed regular light flashes in Jovian belts and near the locations of the westward jets, particularly at 51\u00b0N, 56\u00b0S and 14\u00b0S latitudes.<ref name=1983Vasavada>[[#Vasavada|Vasavada (2005)]], pp. 1983\u20131985</ref> On Jupiter lightning strikes are on average a few times more powerful than those on Earth. However, they are less frequent; the light [[power (physics)|power]] emitted from a given area is similar to that on Earth.<ref name=1983Vasavada/> A few flashes have been detected in polar regions, making Jupiter the second known planet after Earth to exhibit polar lightning.{{sfn|Baines Simon-Miller et al.|2007|p=226}} A [[Microwave Radiometer (Juno)|Microwave Radiometer (''Juno'')]] detected many more in 2018.\n\nEvery 15\u201317 years Jupiter is marked by especially powerful storms. They appear at 23\u00b0N latitude, where the strongest eastward jet, that can reach 150&nbsp;m/s, is located. The last time such an event was observed was in March\u2013June 2007.<ref name=Sanchez-Lavega2008-437/> Two storms appeared in the northern temperate belt 55\u00b0 apart in longitude. They significantly disturbed the belt. The dark material that was shed by the storms mixed with clouds and changed the belt's color.

One particular class of disruption are long-lived darkenings of the South Tropical Zone, normally referred to as \"South Tropical Disturbances\" (STD). The longest lived STD in recorded history was followed from 1901 until 1939, having been first seen by [[Percy B. Molesworth]] on February 28, 1901. It took the form of darkening over part of the normally bright South Tropical zone. Several similar disturbances in the South Tropical Zone have been recorded since then.<ref>[[#McKim|McKim (1997)]]</ref>\n\n=== Hot spots ===\nOne of the most mysterious features in the atmosphere of Jupiter are hot spots. In them, the air is relatively free of clouds and heat can escape from the depths without much absorption. The spots look like bright spots in the infrared images obtained at the wavelength of about 5&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=1987Vasavada/> They are preferentially located in the belts, although there is a train of prominent hot spots at the northern edge of the Equatorial Zone. The [[Galileo Probe|''Galileo'' Probe]] descended into one of those equatorial spots. Each equatorial spot is associated with a bright cloudy [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] located to the west of it and reaching up to 10,000&nbsp;km in size.<ref name=Ingersoll1/> Hot spots generally have round shapes, although they do not resemble vortexes.<ref name=1987Vasavada/>\n\nThe origin of hot spots is not clear. They can be either [[downdraft]]s, where the descending air is [[adiabatic]]ally heated and dried  or, alternatively, they can be a manifestation of planetary scale waves. The latter hypotheses explains the periodical pattern of the equatorial spots.<ref name=Ingersoll1/><ref name=1987Vasavada/>\n\n== Observational history ==\n{{main|Exploration of Jupiter}}\n[[File:790106-0203 Voyager 58M to 31M reduced.gif|thumb|Time-lapse sequence from the approach of ''[[Voyager 1]]'' to Jupiter]]\nEarly modern astronomers, using small telescopes, recorded the changing appearance of Jupiter's atmosphere.<ref name=Ingersoll8/> Their descriptive terms\u2014belts and zones, brown spots and red spots, plumes, barges, festoons, and streamers\u2014are still used.<ref name=Ingersoll10>[[#Ingersoll|Ingersoll (2004)]], p. 2</ref> Other terms such as vorticity, vertical motion, cloud heights have entered in use later, in the 20th century.<ref name=Ingersoll8/>\n\nThe first observations of the Jovian atmosphere at higher resolution than possible with Earth-based telescopes were taken by the ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]'' ''[[Pioneer 10|10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11|11]]'' spacecraft.

These show that the atmosphere is occasionally wracked by massive disturbances, but that, overall, it is remarkably stable.<ref name=Ingersoll8/> The vertical motion of Jupiter's atmosphere was largely determined by the identification of trace gases by ground-based telescopes.<ref name=Ingersoll8/> [[Astronomical spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] studies after the collision of [[Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9]] gave a glimpse of the Jupiter's composition beneath the cloud tops. The presence of diatomic [[sulfur]] (S<sub>2</sub>) and [[carbon disulfide]] (CS<sub>2</sub>) was recorded\u2014the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S<sub>2</sub> in any [[astronomical object]]\u2014 together with other molecules such as [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) and [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S), while [[oxygen]]-bearing molecules such as [[sulfur dioxide]] were not detected, to the surprise of astronomers.<ref name=\"Noll1995\">[[#Noll1995|Noll (1995)]], p. 1307</ref>\n\nThe [[Galileo Probe|''Galileo'' atmospheric probe]], as it plunged into Jupiter, measured the wind, temperature, composition, clouds, and radiation levels down to 22&nbsp;bar. However, below 1&nbsp;bar elsewhere on Jupiter there is uncertainty in the quantities.<ref name=Ingersoll8/>\n\n=== Great Red Spot studies ===\n[[File:Great Red Spot From Voyager 1.jpg|thumb|A narrower view of Jupiter and the Great Red Spot as seen from ''[[Voyager 1]]'' in 1979]]\nThe first sighting of the [[#Great Red Spot|GRS]] is often credited to [[Robert Hooke]], who described a spot on the planet in May 1664; however, it is likely that Hooke's spot was in the wrong belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, versus the current location in the South Equatorial Belt). Much more convincing is [[Giovanni Cassini]]'s description of a \"permanent spot\" in the following year.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 6.</ref> With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713.<ref name=Rogers2008b>[[#Rogers2008b|Rogers (2008)]], pp.111\u2013112</ref>\n\nA minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted around 1700 on a canvas by [[Donato Creti]], which is exhibited in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].<ref name=Rogers188>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 188</ref><ref name=\"Hockey1\">[[#Hockey1999|Hockey, 1999]], pp. 40\u201341.</ref> It is a part of a series of panels in which different (magnified) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes, the creation of all of them overseen by the astronomer [[Eustachio Manfredi]] for accuracy. Creti's painting is the first known to depict the GRS as red. No Jovian feature was officially described as red before the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Hockey1\" />\n\nThe present GRS was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied only after a prominent apparition in 1879. A 118-year gap separates the observations made after 1830 from its 17th-century discovery; whether the original spot dissipated and re-formed, whether it faded, or even if the observational record was simply poor are unknown.<ref name=\"Beebe1\" /> The older spots had a short observational history and slower motion than that of the modern spot, which make their identity unlikely.<ref name=Rogers188/>\n\n[[File:Jupiter and its shrunken Great Red Spot.jpg|thumb|left|Hubble's [[Wide Field Camera 3]] took the GRS region at its smallest size ever.]]\n\nOn February 25, 1979, when the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft was 9.2 million kilometers from Jupiter it transmitted the first detailed image of the Great Red Spot back to Earth. Cloud details as small as 160&nbsp;km across were visible. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern seen to the west (left) of the GRS is the spot's wake region, where extraordinarily complex and variable cloud motions are observed.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith ''et al.''

They covered almost 90 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s of [[longitude]] shortly after their formation, but contracted rapidly during their first decade; their length stabilized at 10 degrees or less after 1965.<ref name=\"Rogers3\">[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], pp. 224\u20135.</ref> Although they originated as segments of the STZ, they evolved to become completely embedded in the South Temperate Belt, suggesting that they moved north, \"digging\" a niche into the STB.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 226\u2013227.</ref> Indeed, much like the GRS, their circulations were confined by two opposing [[jet stream]]s on their northern and southern boundaries, with an eastward jet to their north and a retrograde westward one to the south.<ref name=\"Rogers3\" />\n\nThe longitudinal movement of the ovals seemed to be influenced by two factors: Jupiter's position in its [[orbit]] (they became faster at [[aphelion]]), and their proximity to the GRS (they accelerated when within 50 degrees of the Spot).<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 226.</ref> The overall trend of the white oval drift rate was deceleration, with a decrease by half between 1940 and 1990.<ref>[[#Rogers|Rogers (1995)]], p. 225.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Voyager'' fly-bys, the ovals extended roughly 9000&nbsp;km from east to west, 5000&nbsp;km from north to south, and rotated every five days (compared to six for the GRS at the time).<ref>[[#Beebe|Beebe (1997)]], p. 43.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9]]\n* [[Extrasolar planet]] (many [[List of extrasolar planets#Planet data table|larger than Jupiter]])\n* [[Galileo Spacecraft]] (a mission that included both an orbiter and an [[Galileo Probe|atmospheric-entry probe]])\n* [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]] probe\n* [[2009 Jupiter impact event]]\n* [[2010 Jupiter impact event]]\n* [[Ulysses (spacecraft)]]\n* [[Voyager 1]], [[Voyager 2]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{refbegin}}\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>{{note label|A|a|none}} The scale height ''sh'' is defined as {{nowrap|1=''sh'' = ''RT''/(''Mg<sub>j</sub>'')}}, where {{nowrap|1=''R'' = 8.31 J/mol/K}} is the [[gas constant]], {{nowrap|1=''M'' \u2248 0.0023 kg/mol}} is the average molar mass in the Jovian atmosphere,<ref name=Sieff1998/> ''T'' is temperature and {{nowrap|1=g<sub>j</sub> \u2248 25 m/s<sup>2</sup>}} is the gravitational acceleration at the surface of Jupiter.

While the actually measured oxygen abundances are much lower than the solar value, the observed rapid increase of water content of the atmosphere with depth makes it highly likely that the deep abundance of oxygen indeed exceeds the solar value by a factor of about 3\u2014much like other elements.{{sfn|Atreya Mahaffy Niemann et al.|2003}}\n<li>{{note label|C|c|none}} Various explanations of the overabundance of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and other elements have been proposed. The leading one is that Jupiter captured a large number of icy [[planetesimal]]s during the later stages of its accretion.
