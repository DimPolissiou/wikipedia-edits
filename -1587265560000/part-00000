Gerard, an [[aristocrat]], is in [[mourning]] over the death of his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] Leonora. He listens to tape recordings of them having sex and records his recollections of the day he met Leonora for the first time at the [[Carnival of Venice|carnival of Venice]] many years ago, on a day he felt sexually adventurous. In a flashback, we see him meet her on the streets and introducing himself as [[Giacomo Casanova]]. After chasing her through the city, he finds her waiting for him behind a column in a passageway, where he lifts her dress and has sex with her. Later that day in an [[Opium den|opium den]], after having a smoke, they are initiated by Haunani into the cosmic secrets of pleasure and join in a [[threesome]] with her.\n\nBack in the present, Gerard and Fiorella dress Leonora's naked body for her funeral. When Ursula and Edmund, Leonora's children from another man, arrive for the funeral, Gerard, who has not seen either of them for ten years, at first mistakes Ursula for Leonora. Gerard is now legal guardian to both until they come of age. In a sudden fit, Edmund cries out that his mother was only a whore and suffers an [[epilepsy|epileptic attack]]. He is calmed down by his sister [[Breastfeeding|breastfeeding]] him like their mother did. Later, it is Fiorella who repeatedly breastfeeds him and with whom he has his first sex.\n\nUrsula eavesdrops on Gerard listening to his recordings of her mother's voice during sex. Later, she dresses exactly like her mother used to and dances with both Edmund and then Gerard, to whom she cites her mother's words from the recording, outraging him. At night, while Gerard is asleep, Ursula enters his room and listens to the tapes herself. She decides she wants to lose her [[virginity]] to him and makes the offer directly by feigning her mother wanted him to do so. Gerard, however, is unwilling to comply, which encourages Ursula to start acting like her mother. At the movies with Gerard, she [[fondling|fondles]] a stranger next to her. Going for a ride with Gerard, she incites the well endowed [[stable master]] Boris to have sex with her when Gerard interrupts them and whips him away. Finally, she visits a [[brothel]] run by Rosa, a friend of Leonora's. She starts to work there, planning to give away her virginity in order to take revenge on Gerard for not doing so himself. However, her customers are such that it never happens. \n\nOne night, Ursula and Edmund disappear, Ursula having vandalised Gerard's [[Souvenir|mementos]] of Leonora and rerecorded the tapes with her own voice. Gerard, upset, has sex with Fiorella on the couch. They then go to the police to initiate a search but are not given proper attention because Gerard's father was a well-known [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]]. Later, Gerard and Fiorella visit the opium den to get help, where after a smoke they have a threesome with Haunani.\n\nAt Rosa's, Ursula's virginity is auctioned off to the highest bidder. In the meantime, Haunani helps Gerard track down Ursula at Rosa's. When he tries get the police to intervene due to Ursula and Edmund still being [[Underage sex|underage]], they refuse. They admit they have already known about Ursula and the auction for a few days, claiming that all of Venice has heard of it. However, the highest bidder is the commander of the Venetian fascist militia. Gerard and Fiorella therefore visit Rosa by themselves and Gerard pays Rosa more than the highest bidder in order to save Ursula's virginity. When Ursula consequently offers her virginity to him again, he refuses, but by threatening to deflower herself with a candle, she finally convinces Gerard to have sex with her.\n\nIn the final scene, Gerard and Ursula walk towards the passageway where Leonora and he first had sex. She walks ahead, and when he follows, she waits for him behind a column to offer herself by lifting her dress, addressing him as Casanova.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Andrea Guzon]] as Leonora / Ursula\n* [[Gabriele Tinti (actor)|Gabriele Tinti]] as Gerard Villeneuve\n* [[Marco Mattioli]] as Edmund\n* [[Lilli Carati]] as Fiorella\n* [[Laura Gemser]] as Haunani\n* [[Dagmar Lassander]] as Rosa\n* [[Maurice Poli]] as Boris the stableman (uncredited)\n* [[Domiziano Arcangeli]] (uncredited)\t\t\n\n==Release==\nThe film passed Italian censorship on 12 June 1985.<ref name=\"archiv\">{{cite web |url=http://www.archiviodelcinemaitaliano.it./index.php/scheda.html?codice=AG5191 |website=www.archiviodelcinemaitaliano.it.|title=Il piacere (1985)|language=Italian|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIt grossed over 3 million [[Italian lira]] on its release.<ref name=\"TELLUS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tellusfolio.it/index.php?prec=%2Findex.php&cmd=v&id=3614 |title=Lilli Carati|publisher=TELLUS folio|accessdate=May 1, 2016|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn 1986, [[Kim Newman]] (''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'') described the film as an \"ill-advised imitation of [[Tinto Brass]]' already soporific and offensive ''La Chiave'' (''[[The Key (1983 film)|The Key]]'')\"<ref name=\"mfb-review2\" />\nNewman noted that D'Amato's [[cinematography]] was \"more careful than usual even attempting some genuine artiness\" but that his \"porno style hasn't changed since the days when he would churn out ten Em(m)anuelle films a year.\"<ref name=\"mfb-review2\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n==External links==\n* {{imdb title|0089807}}\n\n{{Joe D'Amato}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pleasure}}\n\n[[Category:Films directed by Joe D'Amato]]\n[[Category:Italian films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Venice]]\n[[Category:Italian erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s erotic drama films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Pleasure\n| image          = Il piacere-poster.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = Italian theatrical release poster\n| film name      = <!--(for non-English films: film's name in its native language)-->\n| director       = [[Joe D'Amato]]\n| producer       = \n| writer         = <!-- or: | writers = -->\n| screenplay     = {{plainlist|*Franco Valobra\n*[[Claudio Fragasso]]<ref name=\"mfb-review1\">{{cite magazine|title=Il piacere (The Pleasure)|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=1986|volume=53|issue=624|page=180|last=Newman|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Newman}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=I registi: dal 1930 ai giorni nostri|last=Poppi|first=Roberto|publisher=Gremese Editore|year=2002|page=183|ISBN=8884401712|language=Italian}}</ref><ref name=\"archiv\" />}}\n| story          = {{plainlist|*Franco Valobra\n*Claudio Fragasso<ref name=\"archiv\" />}}\n| based on       = <!-- {{based on|title of the original work|writer of the original work}} -->\n| starring       = \n| narrator       = <!-- or: | narrators = -->\n| music          = Cluster<ref name=\"mfb-review1\" />\n| cinematography = Joe D'Amato<ref name=\"mfb-review1\" />\n| editing        = Franco Alessandri<ref name=\"mfb-review1\" />\n| production companies = Filmirage<ref name=\"mfb-review1\" />\n| distributor    = <!-- or: | distributors = -->\n| released       = <!-- {{film date|year|month|day|location}} -->\n| runtime        = 94 minutes<ref name=\"mfb-review2\">{{cite magazine|title=''Il piacere'' (''The Pleasure'')|magazine=Monthly Film Bulletin|publisher=British Film Institute|date=1986|volume=53|issue=624|page=181|last=Newman|first=Kim}}</ref>\n| country        = [[Italy]]<ref name=\"mfb-review1\" />\n| language       = \n| budget         = \n| gross          = <!--(please use condensed and rounded values, e.g. \"\u00a311.6 million\" not \"\u00a311,586,221\")-->\n}}\n\n'''''The Pleasure''''' ({{lang-it|'''Il piacere'''}}) is an Italian [[sex film|erotic]] [[Drama Film|drama film]] [[Film director|directed]] by [[Joe D'Amato]].\n\n==Plot==\nItaly in the early 1930s.

In 1946, he started carrying locals on the trip, and then due to increasing demand installed a wooden trestle bench. The service proved so popular, that Trathen's bought a second-hand 1933 [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] WLB 20 seater for \u00a3100, with which they also ran weekend trips to [[Torquay]].<ref name=BusMus>[http://www.busmuseum.org.uk/webnews/news048.htm Web News 48]  West Country Historic Omnibus & Transport Trust</ref>\n\nBy 1950 and now based in [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]], the company had six Bedford coaches, and had bought its first new chassis, a [[Bedford OB]]. Expanding locally in the 1950s with at least one new chassis per year, from 1960 they ran their first holiday service to the [[Netherlands]]. The business now existed in three divisions: bus and coach services; excursion; and private hire, including services for [[Plymouth Argyle Football Club]].<ref name=BusMus/>\n\nFrom the 1970s, Eric\u2019s sons Mike and David began running the business, which was by now expanding with four new chassis per year. The business at this time was mainly expanding through its excursion services, which used continental-style coach bodies build on traditional British chassis.<ref name=BusMus/> However, by the late 1970s the company had bought its first [[Neoplan]] chassis, which prepared it for the expansion possibilities brought about by the [[Transport Act 1980]].\n\nWith deregulation of coach services in the UK, and introduction of the new [[InterCity 125]] service from 1976 by [[British Rail]], Trathens began an executive high-speed express coach service from Plymouth direct to London. Running mainly up the [[M5 motorway]] to [[Bristol]], the coaches then turned east along the [[M4 motorway]] to London via [[Swindon]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Using mainly the new [[Neoplan Skyliner]] double decker, the service offered on-board light refreshments and newspapers, a hostess and toilets. The relatively low-priced service compared to the rival [[National Express Coaches|National Express]], in a style more akin to the new InterCity 125 trains, brought about fast expansion for the family-owned firm.\n\nIn October 1982, the company bought Roborough House on the edge of Dartmoor, which became its new headquarters and operational base.

The company also opened a new London depot in [[Brentford]], allowing both: expansion into the international tourist market, for those coming into the UK via [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] and [[Gatwick Airport]]s; as well as the founding of StarRiders a well known [[sleeper bus]] operator.\n\nHaving beaten National Express on price and service grounds, the two companies now signed a co-operation agreement, with National Express marketing Trathens services under a joint-brand.
