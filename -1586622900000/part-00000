She first came to public notice as a [[Blonde stereotype#Blondebombshell|blonde bombshell]] in the style of American [[Marilyn Monroe]], as promoted by her first husband, Dennis Hamilton, mostly via sex film-comedies and risqu\u00e9 modelling. After it turned out that Hamilton had been defrauding her, she continued to play up to her established image, and she made [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines with the parties reportedly held at her house. Later, she showed a genuine talent as a performer on TV, in recordings, and in [[cabaret]], and gained new popularity as a regular chat-show guest. She also gave some well-regarded performances in worthwhile films at different points in her career.\n\nAccording to [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], \"Dors represented that period between the end of the [[World War II|war]] and the coming of [[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Lady Chatterley]] in paperback, a time when sexuality was naughty, repressed and fit to burst.\" <ref>FILM STUDIES: She could have been a contender.

In December 1958 RKO terminated its contract with Dors alleging she \"has become an object of disgrace, obloquy, ill will and ridicule.\" Dors sued the studio for $1,250,000 in damages.<ref name=\"rko\"/> She later settled for $200,000.<ref>\"Diana Dors to Get $200,000 in Studio Suit\", ''Los Angeles Times'' 11 July 1960: B3. </ref>\n\nDors played an American in the French-Italian ''[[The Love Specialist]]'' (1958) and was a prostitute in ''[[Passport to Shame]]'' (1958). Joseph Kaufman announced he wanted to make a film starring her called ''Stopover'' but it was never made.

Details about the affair were reportedly leaked to the press by Yeardye.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1460720/Tommy-Yeardye.html Obituary: Tommy Yeardye], ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 1 May 2004</ref> Hamilton discovered the relationship, and another period of separation began that led to divorce proceedings.<ref name=Bret/>\n\nFollowing her final separation from Hamilton in 1958, Dors discovered that her company Diana Dors Ltd was in serious debt. Hamilton had steered the company toward the dual purpose of publicising his wife and helping himself, overpaying tax bills and establishing financial stability.<ref name=DDStar5/>\n\nHaving been forced by Hamilton to sign over all of her assets on their separation, and in need of money to pay her divorce lawyers and their accountants, she agreed to the suggestion of agent Joseph Collins to undertake a theatre-based cabaret tour titled \"The Diana Dors Show\".\n\nYeardye suggested that they hire the comedian Dickie Dawson, later known as [[Richard Dawson]]. Dawson subsequently scripted the show and wrote most of the material. Dors started a relationship with Dawson and ended the relationship with Yeardye, who subsequently emptied her cash box at [[Harrods]] of \u00a318,000 and sold his story to the media.<ref name=Bret/> This brought negative publicity to the show, but audience numbers remained high, which allowed Dors extra time to explain her affairs to a subsequent [[Inland Revenue]] investigation of her cash holdings.<ref name=DDStar5>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/1_the_star_5_36.html|title=The Diana Dors Story -The Star 5|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref> In 1959, Hamilton died, and Dors married Dawson in New York while making an appearance on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''. \"The Diana Dors Show\" was commissioned for two studio-based series on television at [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref name=Bret/>\n\n===Hollywood once more===\nAfter the birth of her first child in February 1960, and wishing to stay in the United States with Dawson, Dors undertook a cabaret contract to headline at the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes hotel and casino]] in Las Vegas.<ref name=Bret/>\n\nShe appeared in some American films: ''[[On the Double (film)|On the Double]]'' (1961), a [[Danny Kaye]] comedy, and ''[[The Big Bankroll]]'' (1962), a crime film also known as ''King of the Roaring 20's: The Story of Arnold Rothstein''.

Dors also starred in a 1963 episode of ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' titled \"Run for Doom\", co-starring [[John Gavin]], and an episode of ''[[Straightaway]]''.\n\nDors returned to Britain. In 1961 she narrowly escaped death at a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] party in [[Wraysbury]] where fireworks were accidentally ignited indoors. The house was destroyed, three people died in the fire and another one had a fatal heart attack, and Dors was slightly injured while escaping through a window.<ref>Diana Dors Leaps Out Window as Blast and Blaze Kill 3 at Party\n''Los Angeles Times'' 6 Nov 1961: 1. </ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Diana Dors Injured, 3 Killed in Party Blast|periodical=Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=1961-11-06|page=37}}</ref>\n\nShe appeared in ''[[Mrs. Gibbons' Boys (film)|Mrs. Gibbons' Boys]]'' (1962), ''[[West 11]]'' (1963), ''[[The Counterfeit Constable]]'' (1964), and ''[[The Sandwich Man (1966 film)|The Sandwich Man]]'' (1966).\n\nShe did return to America to guest star on episodes of ''[[Burke's Law (1960s TV series)|Burke's Law]]'' and ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', and was on ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'' in Britain.

She became a regular on ''[[Jokers Wild (TV series)|Jokers Wild]]'', ''[[Blankety Blank]]'' and ''[[Celebrity Squares]]'', and was a regular guest on [[BBC Radio 2]]'s ''The Law Game''. She also had a recurring role in ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/content/image_galleries/diana_dors_gallery.shtml?27|title=Diana Dors: A Life in Pictures|publisher=BBC}}</ref>  A popular chat-show guest, an entire show&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Russell Harty]]: At Home with Dors''&nbsp;\u2013 came from the pool room of her home, Orchard Manor.<ref name=DDTwilight/> Younger musical artists engaged her persona, brought about after the 1981 [[Adam and the Ants]] music video \"[[Prince Charming (Adam and the Ants song)|Prince Charming]]\", where she played the [[fairy godmother]] opposite [[Adam Ant]], who played a male [[Cinderella]] figure.\n\nDors' other final appearances were in ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1980 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1980), ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' (1981), ''[[Dick Turpin (TV series)|Dick Turpin]]'' (1981),  and ''[[Cannon and Ball]]'' (1981).\n\nHaving turned her life story into a cash flow through interviews and leaked tabloid stories, like many celebrities in their later careers, she turned to the autobiography to generate retirement cash. In 1960 she wrote and published ''Swingin' Dors'' and between 1978 and 1984, she published four autobiographical books under her own name: ''For Adults Only'', ''Behind Closed Dors'', ''Dors by Diana'', and ''A. to Z. of Men''.\n\nDiana Dors was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions, in April 1957 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC Television Theatre, and in October 1982, when Andrews surprised her at London's Royalty Theatre.\n\nHaving gone through her first round of cancer treatment, by the early 1980s Dors' hour-glass figure had become plumper, and she addressed the issue through co-authoring a diet book,<ref>{{cite book|title=X-Cel diet|author=Diana Dors & Michael Waterfield|publisher=Julian P.|date=May 1983|isbn=0-901943-20-7}}</ref> and creating a diet and exercise [[videocassette]]. This resulted in her working for [[TV-am]], ITV's breakfast station, in the summer of 1983, in a regular slot focusing on diet and nutrition, which later developed into an [[Advice column|agony aunt]] segment. As the cancer treatment took its toll again, though, her appearances became less frequent.<ref name=DDTwilight>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/twilight_years_13.html|title=The Diana Dors Story &ndash; Twilight Years|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref>  She sued the show for withholding her fan mail.<ref>Diana Dors in row over TV-am 'fan mail', Barker, Dennis.

The tracks were \"I Feel So Mmmm\" and \"A Kiss and a Cuddle (and a Few Kind Words From You)\". HMV also released sheet music featuring sultry photos of Dors on the cover. She also sang \"The Hokey Pokey Polka\" on the 1954 soundtrack for the film ''As Long As They're Happy''.\n\nDors recorded only one complete album, the [[Swing music|swing]]-themed ''Swingin' Dors'', in 1960. The LP was originally released on red vinyl and with a gatefold sleeve. The accompanying orchestra was conducted by [[Angela Morley|Wally Stott]].\n\nShe also sang as a special guest for the Italian TV show ''Un, due, tre'' (''One, two, three'', starring [[Ugo Tognazzi]] and [[Raimondo Vianello]]) on 31 May 1959, at the Teatro della Fiera in [[Milan]], with orchestra conducted by Mario Bertolazzi and recorded singles on various record labels from the 1960s through the early 1980s, including a single for the Nomis label, \"[[Where Did They Go]]?\" / \"It's You Again\" (the latter being a duet with her son, Gary Dawson), while she was battling cancer. While promoting the single on TV, Dors claimed \"Where Did They Go?\" had been especially written for her, but in fact, the track had been recorded originally by [[Peggy Lee]] in 1971 and in 1972 by [[Sandie Shaw]].\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCC\"\n!

During the short relationship, Dors became pregnant, but Caborn-Waterfield paid for a back-street abortion, which took place on a kitchen table in [[Battersea]]. The relationship continued for a time, before Dors met Dennis Hamilton Gittins on the set of ''Lady Godiva Rides Again'', with whom she had a second abortion in 1951.<ref name=DDStar2>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/1_the_star_2_33.html|title=The Diana Dors Story &ndash; The Star 2|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is said that Dors became a close friend of [[Ruth Ellis]], the last woman to be hanged in Britain, after Ellis had a bit part in ''Lady Godiva Rides Again'', four years before she was executed by [[Albert Pierrepoint]], having admitted to and been found guilty of shooting her lover. However Diana never mentioned having known Ruth either in interviews or in her memoirs. Through her husband Hamilton, Dors was close friends with the notorious [[Kray twins]] and their mother Violet.<ref name=Bret/>\n\n===Parties===\nDuring her relationship with Hamilton and until a few months before her death, Dors regularly held adult parties at her home.

She first came to public notice as a [[Blonde stereotype#Blondebombshell|blonde bombshell]] in the style of American [[Marilyn Monroe]], as promoted by her first husband, Dennis Hamilton, mostly via sex film-comedies and risqu\u00e9 modelling. After it turned out that Hamilton had been defrauding her, she continued to play up to her established image, and she made [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines with the parties reportedly held at her house. Later, she showed a genuine talent for TV, recordings, and [[cabaret]], and gained new popularity as a regular chat-show guest.\n\nAccording to [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], \"Dors represented that period between the end of the [[World War II|war]] and the coming of [[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Lady Chatterley]] in paperback, a time when sexuality was naughty, repressed and fit to burst.\" <ref>FILM STUDIES: She could have been a contender.

While promoting the single on TV, Dors claimed \"Where Did They Go?\" had been especially written for her, but in fact, the track had been recorded originally by [[Peggy Lee]] in 1971 and in 1972 by [[Sandie Shaw]].\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCC\"\n!

She was buried in Sunningdale Catholic Cemetery.\n===Alan Lake suicide===\nAfter her death, Alan Lake burned all of Dors' remaining clothes and fell into a depression. On 10 October 1984, Lake did a telephone interview with ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist [[Jean Rook]] and then he walked into their son's bedroom and took his own life by firing a shotgun into his mouth.<ref name=Express208200>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/208200|title=Men who destroyed Diana Dors|author=Neil Norman|work=Express.co.uk|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> He was 43.

The house's contents were bulk-sold by [[Sotheby's]], which sold her jewellery collection in an auction. After solicitors' bills, outstanding tax payments, death duties, and other distributions, the combined estates of Dors and Lake left little for the upkeep of their son Jason (aged 14), who was subsequently made a [[ward of court]] to his half-brother Gary Dawson in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianadors.co.uk/orchard_manor_41.html|title=Orchard Manor, Diana's last home.|work=dianadors.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn 14th September 2019, Jason Dors Lake, the son of Diana Dors and Alan Lake, was reported to have died several days after his 50th birthday at his flat in Notting Hill Gate, London. <ref>[https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/15/diana-dors-youngest-son-jason-dies-just-days-50th-birthday-10745943/ Diana Dors\u2019 youngest son Jason Dors Lake dies just days after his 50th birthday]. ''[[Metro News]]'', 15 September 2019. Retrieved 16 September 2019.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nDors was portrayed by [[Keeley Hawes]] (younger) and [[Amanda Redman]] (older) in the TV biographical film ''[[The Blonde Bombshell]]'' (1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2011/11/the-british-marilyn-blonde-bombshell-diana-dors|title=The British Marilyn: Blonde Bombshell Diana Dors |work=BBC America}}</ref>\n\nOn the cover of the 1967 album ''[[Sgt.

In 1982, she gave her son Mark Dawson a sheet of paper on which, she told him, was a code that would reveal the whereabouts of the money.<ref name=Bret/> His stepfather Alan Lake supposedly knew the key that would crack the code, but he committed suicide soon after her death and Dawson was left with an apparently unsolvable puzzle.<ref name=Bret/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/5104063.Secret_code_of_Diana_Dors__millions/|title=Secret code of Diana Dors' millions|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref>\n\nHe sought out computer [[forensic]] specialists Inforenz, who recognised the encryption as the [[Vigen\u00e8re cipher]]. Inforenz then used their own cryptanalysis software to suggest a 10-letter [[decryption]] key, DMARYFLUCK (short for Diana Mary Fluck, Dors's real name).<ref name=Bret/> With the aid of a bank statement found among Alan Lake's papers, Inforenz was then able to decode the existing material to reveal a list of surnames and towns only &ndash; suggesting that there must be a second page that would reveal first names and bank details, to complete the message. As this has never come to light, no money has ever been traced. In 2003, [[Channel 4]] made a television programme about the mystery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b89e6eeef|title=Who Got Diana Dors&#039; Millions?

This struck a new alliance between their tribes, after which they successfully attacked Rangit\u0101ne in the [[Wairau River|Wairau Valley]]. For this Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe then ceded the east coast regions north of the Clarence River to Ng\u0101i Tahu, and T\u016bteurutira and Hinerongo married and settled at the p\u0101. Ng\u0101i Tahu continued to push south, conquering [[Kaik\u014dura]].<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nBy the 1690s Ng\u0101i Tahu had settled in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], including Ng\u0101ti Irakehu peaceably settling among [[Banks Peninsula]]'s Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/> From there they spread further south and into the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]].

After a three-month siege, a fire in the p\u0101 allowed Ng\u0101ti Toa to overcome it. Ng\u0101ti Toa then attacked Ng\u0101i Tahu on [[Banks Peninsula]] and took the p\u0101 at [[Onawe]]. In 1832\u201333 Ng\u0101i Tahu retaliated under the leadership of [[Tuhawaiki]], Taiaroa, Karetai, and Haereroa, attacking Ng\u0101ti Toa at [[Lake Grassmere]]. Ng\u0101i Tahu prevailed, and killed many Ng\u0101ti Toa, although Te Rauparaha again escaped. Fighting continued for a year or so, with Ng\u0101i Tahu maintaining the upper hand. Ng\u0101ti Toa never again made a major incursion into Ng\u0101i Tahu territory. By 1839 Ng\u0101i Tahu and Ng\u0101ti Toa established peace and Te Rauparaha released the Ng\u0101i Tahu captives he held.

One of the Act's provisions covered the use of dual (M\u0101ori and English) names for geographical locations in the Ng\u0101i Tahu tribal area. The recognised tribal authority, Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu, is based in [[Christchurch]] and in [[Invercargill]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\" />\n\n==Dialect==\n\nIn the nineteenth century many Ng\u0101i Tahu, particularly in the southern reaches of Te Wai Pounamu, spoke a distinct [[dialect]] of the [[M\u0101ori language]], sometimes referred to as ''Southern M\u0101ori'', which was so different from the northern version of the language that missionary Rev. [[James Watkin]], based at [[Karitane]] found materials prepared by [[North Island]] missions couldn't be used in [[Otago]].<ref name=\"harlow87\">Harlow, R. (1987). ''A word-list of South Island Maori''. Auckland: Linguistic Society of New Zealand. {{ISBN|0-9597603-2-6}}</ref> However, from the 20th century until the early 21st century the dialect came close to extinction and was officially discouraged.<ref>Harlow, R.B. (1979). \"\"Regional Variation in Maori\". ''New Zealand Journal of Archaeology'', 1, 123\u2013138.</ref>\n\nSouthern M\u0101ori contains almost all the same [[phonemes]] as other M\u0101ori dialects (namely: {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u, f, h, k, m, n, p, r, t, w/}}), along with the same [[diphthong]]s. But it lacks {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (\"ng\") \u2014 this sound merged with {{IPA|/k/}} in prehistoric times: for example: ''Ng\u0101i Tahu'' as opposed to ''K\u0101i Tahu''). This change did not occur in the northern part of the Ng\u0101i Tahu area, and the possible presence of additional phonemes ({{IPA|/b, p, l, r/}}) has been debated. Non-standard consonants are sometimes identified in the spellings of South Island place names, such as ''g'' (as distinct from ''k'', e.g., Katigi, Otago), ''v'' (e.g., Mavora), ''l'' instead of ''r'' (e.g., Little Akaloa, Kilmog, Waihola, Rakiula), and ''w'' or ''u'' instead of ''wh'' as reflecting dialect difference, but similar spellings and pronunciations also occur in the North Island (e.g. Tolaga Bay, Booai (P\u016bhoi)).<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\nThe [[apocope]] (the dropping of the final vowel of words) resulting from pronunciations like 'Wacky-white' for \"[[Waikouaiti]]\" have been identified with Southern M\u0101ori. However, the devoicing (rather than apocope) of final vowels occurs in the speech of native speakers of the M\u0101ori language throughout New Zealand, and the pronunciation of the names of North Island towns by locals often omits final vowels as well, like in the pronunciation of \"Paraparam\" or \"Waiuk\".<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTe R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is the governance entity of Ng\u0101i Tahu, following the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] settlement between the iwi and the [[New Zealand Government]] under Ng\u0101i Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.<ref>For example: {{cite web|url=http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/research/|title=Research|website=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|publisher=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|accessdate=16 June 2014|quote=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is regularly approached by researchers and organisations seeking engagement, advice or support for various research projects.}}</ref> It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 and a T\u016bhono organisation.

One of the Act's provisions covered the use of dual (M\u0101ori and English) names for geographical locations in the Ng\u0101i Tahu tribal area. The recognised tribal authority, Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu, is based in [[Christchurch]] and in [[Invercargill]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\" />\n\n==Dialect==\n\nIn the nineteenth century many Ng\u0101i Tahu, particularly in the southern reaches of Te Wai Pounamu, spoke a distinct [[dialect]] of the [[M\u0101ori language]], sometimes referred to as ''Southern M\u0101ori'', which was so different from the northern version of the language that missionary Rev. [[James Watkin]], based at [[Karitane]] found materials prepared by [[North Island]] missions couldn't be used in [[Otago]].<ref name=\"harlow87\">Harlow, R. (1987). ''A word-list of South Island Maori''. Auckland: Linguistic Society of New Zealand. {{ISBN|0-9597603-2-6}}</ref> However, from the 20th century until the early 21st century the dialect came close to extinction and was officially discouraged.<ref>Harlow, R.B. (1979). \"\"Regional Variation in Maori\". ''New Zealand Journal of Archaeology'', 1, 123\u2013138.</ref>\n\nSouthern M\u0101ori contains almost all the same [[phonemes]] as other M\u0101ori dialects (namely: {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u, f, h, k, m, n, p, r, t, w/}}), along with the same [[diphthong]]s. But it lacks {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (\"ng\") \u2014 this sound merged with {{IPA|/k/}} in prehistoric times: for example: ''Ng\u0101i Tahu'' as opposed to ''K\u0101i Tahu''). This change did not occur in the northern part of the Ng\u0101i Tahu area, and the possible presence of additional phonemes ({{IPA|/b, p, l, r/}}) has been debated. Non-standard consonants are sometimes identified in the spellings of South Island place names, such as ''g'' (as distinct from ''k'', e.g., Katigi, Otago), ''v'' (e.g., Mavora), ''l'' instead of ''r'' (e.g., Little Akaloa, Kilmog, Waihola, Rakiula), and ''w'' or ''u'' instead of ''wh'' as reflecting dialect difference, but similar spellings and pronunciations also occur in the North Island (e.g. Tolaga Bay, Booai (P\u016bhoi)).<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\nThe [[apocope]] (the dropping of the final vowel of words) resulting from pronunciations like 'Wacky-white' for \"[[Waikouaiti]]\" have been identified with Southern M\u0101ori. However, the devoicing (rather than apocope) of final vowels occurs in the speech of native speakers of the M\u0101ori language throughout New Zealand, and the pronunciation of the names of North Island towns by locals often omits final vowels as well, like in the pronunciation of \"Paraparam\" or \"Waiuk\".<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTe R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is the governance entity of Ng\u0101i Tahu, following the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] settlement between the iwi and the [[New Zealand Government]] under Ng\u0101i Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.<ref>For example: {{cite web|url=http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/research/|title=Research|website=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|publisher=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|accessdate=16 June 2014|quote=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is regularly approached by researchers and organisations seeking engagement, advice or support for various research projects.}}</ref> It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 and a T\u016bhono organisation.
