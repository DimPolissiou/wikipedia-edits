{"title_page": "Bristol Yachts", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}\n[[File:Bristol Healing.jpg|thumb|Bristol under full sail]]\n'''Bristol Yachts''' was a [[United States]]-based company which was among the first commercially successful production fiberglass [[sailboat]] boat builders. The company was founded in 1966 and closed in 1997.\n\n==History==\nBristol Yacht Company was founded by Clinton Pearson. Clint and his cousin Everett Pearson began building fiberglass dinghies in 1955 in their garage on County Street in Seekonk, MA, just over the MA/RI state line.  Within a year the newly founded [[Pearson Yachts]] employed hundreds of people. Fast corporate expansion resulted in cash flow problems, so the cousins raised capital by selling equity in Pearson to Grumman Allied Industries in 1961.  Clinton left in 1964 and bought out a troubled sailboat-maker, Sailstar, in [[West Warwick]], [[Rhode Island]], and moved into the abandoned Herreshoff boatyard.  [[Carl Alberg]] designed the company's first boat, the Bristol 27. Clinton changed the company\u2019s name to Bristol Yacht Company in 1966, and the Sailstar brand was phased out. The boat yard was eventually located on Popasquash Road, in Bristol, Rhode Island. The facilities included a giant barn on land owned by Clinton and where his home was located as well. Across the road from the barn was a small marina and travellift. Due to bankruptcy the company closed in 1997.\n\n==Models and designers==\nEarly Bristol models aimed at the mass market and often were cutaway full [[keel]] or keel-centerboard designs. Among the first models were the Alberg designed 27 and the Herreshoff designed 29.\n[[Halsey Chase Herreshoff|Halsey Herreshoff]], the grandson of the brilliant yacht designer and innovator [[Nathanael Herreshoff]] and a renowned yacht designer in his own right, designed a number of first generation models, including the Bristol 22 \u201cCaravel\u201d, the 26 \"Courier\", 28, 29, 30, 33 and 34. His early designs made the most of the CCA rules with cutaway keels and long overhangs. His later designs were generally performance oriented fin and skeg or fin keel designs. Carl Alberg was responsible for the first generation Bristol models Corinthian 19 (one of the original Sailstar models that Bristol took over) and the Bristol 27 (a boat very similar in design to the [[Pearson Triton|Pearson Triton 28]], also an Alberg design). [[Paul Coble (Naval Architect)|Paul Coble]] designed the Corsair (another Sailstar model later identified as the Bristol 24)--a very stout and roomy 24 footer. The Bristol 32 and 39 (40) were designed by [[Ted Hood]].\n\nEarly Bristols offered a lot for their modest prices, including encapsulated lead keels on many models, but with iron punchings and concrete on many of the boats that joined the Bristol line when Bristol acquired the molds from Sailstar. The boats features large galleys for their day, large cockpits with seats you could sleep on, fiberglass cabin headliners on some models, and interiors with a nice blend of white formica and mahogany trim. The early boats had keel-hung rudders, cut away full keels and were moderately stout boats with an relatively comfortable motion for their day. The second generation Bristol yachts carried a decimal and a repeat of the second model number (27.7, 29.9, 31.1, 33.3, 35.5, 38.8, 41.1, 43.3, 45.5, 47.7, 51.1). They came from the design team of [[Ted Hood]], an America's Cup designer. Hood designs generally were [[centerboard]] boats which aimed for performance without deep draft, although some models offered the option of a deeper fixed keel. The hull designs were a development of Ted Hood's \"whale bottom\" delta hull form, with a steep deadrise allowing the ballast to be placed low in the hull (compensating for the lack of ballast in the centreboard), and improving interior space. This hull design is known for its comfortable motion in a seaway. Several of the second generation boats were designed by Dieter Empacher, who, at the time, was employed by Hood design group.\n\nLater on, numerous options were available making the boats essentially semi-custom. For example, in 1985 the options list included a choice of interior wood, counter material, cabin floor, exterior rubbing rails, higher/deeper toe rails, teak swim ladder, a choice of engines, instrumentation options, and so on. Bristols were typically built more heavily than many comparable production sailboats, with features such as skeg-hung rudders, keel-stepped masts, fully encapsulated keel ballast, interior cabinetry bonded to the hull for strength, heavy-duty bronze seacocks, and heavy fibreglass lay-up. Most Bristols can be raced using the [[PHRF]] handicap system, despite being designed more for cruising and comfort.\n\nThe company built, or at least advertised, two models of motor yacht, one designated the 42 foot Bristol Offshore Trawler and the other advertised as a 38 foot model available in both an aft cabin and sedan configuration. Bristol trawlers were sold during the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Bristol Yacht Co. laid up the hull for the early 42 foot model which was a round-bilge design by the famed Eldridge-McGinnis naval architecture firm. The 42 foot model displaced somewhere between 26 and 30,000 pounds. The hulls were shipped off to another builder for epoxy laminated plywood decks and interiors. Production of the Bristol trawlers shifted to India during the 1970s, adding provenance to the Bristol-built trawlers. Numerous Bristol 42 trawlers remain in service as of November 2011.\n\nThe company began building custom designed sailboats in the 50-plus foot range in the early 1990s but eventually folded in 1997. The yard built more than 4400 boats, the largest being 72' long.\n\n==Notable voyages and sailors==\n\n* Bill Wolfram, born 1950, sailed a Bristol 22, We-Tu, from Port Townsend, Washington, to Australia and back, around 2002-2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill's Story|url=http://www.laurig.com/articles/bill/frameset.html|accessdate=19 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624161553/http://laurig.com/articles/bill/frameset.html|archivedate=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n*John Atkisson sailed his 1976 Bristol 32 \"Kestrel\" in the spring of 2005 single-handed from New England to Britain, spent time cruising in Europe and eventually round-tripping back to the US.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Bart|title=John Atkisson; After law career, he sailed across Atlantic|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/06/AR2010030602169.html|accessdate=19 April 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=7 March 2010}}</ref>\n*Ken and Katie Stuber, sailed their 1980 Bristol 32 \"Sand Dollar\", hull #298, most of the way around the world, departing San Francisco in 2008 and arriving in Florida in 2016 via Hawaii, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, the Philippines, Borneo, Southeast Asia, Thailand, the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, and the West Indies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Joe|date=November\u2013December 2018|title=Bristol 32 A lovely full-keel cruiser in the classic CCA style|url=|journal=Good Old Boat|volume=Issue 123|pages=8-13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=sanddollarn4ks.blogspot.com|title=Ken and Katie's Voyages Aboard Sand Dollar|last=Stuber|first=Katie|date=|website=Ken and Katie's Voyages Aboard Sand Dollar|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n*Steve Davis, sailed his 1966 Bristol 24 Corsair starting from Portland, Maine on June, 2014, crossing the North Atlantic Ocean single-handed to the Azores, Canary Islands and Portugal, down to Northwestern Africa and back across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean and finally up to Naples, Florida in June, 2015.

As early as 10,000 to 20,000 years ago during the late [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period of the [[Stone Age]] (also known as the Old Stone Age) there were already human beings living and multiplying here. In 282, the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] government established magistrate rule here.\n\n===Mongol-Manchu===\nDuring the first twenty-three years of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1206\u22121368), Funingzhou ({{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5be7\u5dde}} H\u00f3k-n\u00ecng-ci\u016d) Administration was set up. In 1736, during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], Ningde was promoted to Funingfu ({{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5be7\u5e9c}} H\u00f3k-n\u00ecng-h\u016b) Administration.\n\n===Republican===\nIn 1934, an Administration Supervision Zone was set up here under the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, the Fu'an Special Administration Zone was established. Finally in June 1971 the Zone was promoted to Ningde Prefecture. [[Xi Jinping]] served as party chief of Ningde between 1988 and 1990.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nSituated roughly {{convert|300|km}} north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the prefecture of Ningde spans {{convert|13500|km\u00b2}} in land area. Like the rest of the province, Ningde sits in a mountainous region but it also enjoys almost {{convert|200|km}} of [[coastline]] facing the [[East China Sea]].\n\nIt is subjected to a [[humid subtropical climate]], with occasional threat of [[typhoon]]s. Within the prefecture, the mean annual temperature ranges from {{convert|13.4|to|20.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, while mean annual [[rainfall]] ranges from {{convert|1250|to|2350|mm|in}}. The region also enjoys a [[frost]]-free period of 235 to 300 days per year, which is highly beneficial for soil agriculture.\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|collapsed = Y\n|location = Ningde (1981\u22122010)\n|Jan high C = 14.2\n|Feb high C = 14.9\n|Mar high C = 17.4\n|Apr high C = 22.0\n|May high C = 26.2\n|Jun high C = 29.8\n|Jul high C = 33.4\n|Aug high C = 32.5\n|Sep high C = 30.0\n|Oct high C = 26.0\n|Nov high C = 21.4\n|Dec high C = 16.6\n|Jan mean C = 10.6\n|Feb mean C = 11.2\n|Mar mean C = 13.5\n|Apr mean C = 17.9\n|May mean C = 22.4\n|Jun mean C = 26.1\n|Jul mean C = 29.3\n|Aug mean C = 28.7\n|Sep mean C = 26.3\n|Oct mean C = 22.3\n|Nov mean C = 17.7\n|Dec mean C = 12.7\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 8.2\n|Feb low C = 8.7\n|Mar low C = 10.7\n|Apr low C = 15.0\n|May low C = 19.5\n|Jun low C = 23.3\n|Jul low C = 26.2\n|Aug low C = 25.8\n|Sep low C = 23.5\n|Oct low C = 19.3\n|Nov low C = 14.9\n|Dec low C = 9.9\n|Jan record high C = 25.4 |Jan record low C = -0.3\n|Feb record high C = 28.7 |Feb record low C = 1.4\n|Mar record high C = 30.9 |Mar record low C = 2.2\n|Apr record high C = 33.9 |Apr record low C = 7.3\n|May record high C = 36.1 |May record low C = 13.4\n|Jun record high C = 38.2 |Jun record low C = 16.4\n|Jul record high C = 40.2 |Jul record low C = 21.2\n|Aug record high C = 37.8 |Aug record low C = 21.5\n|Sep record high C = 37.5 |Sep record low C = 15.6\n|Oct record high C = 32.7 |Oct record low C = 10.7\n|Nov record high C = 32.4 |Nov record low C = 5.5\n|Dec record high C = 26.2 |Dec record low C = -1.4\n|year high C=  |year low C= \n|year high F = |year low F =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 77.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 110.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 175.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 169.8\n|May precipitation mm = 223.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 283.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 196.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 295.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 243.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 83.7\n|Nov precipitation mm = 75.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 62.5\n|Jan humidity = 76\n|Feb humidity = 79\n|Mar humidity = 79\n|Apr humidity = 78\n|May humidity = 78\n|Jun humidity = 80\n|Jul humidity = 75\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 71\n|Nov humidity = 73\n|Dec humidity = 74\n|source 1 = [http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBk.html China Meteorological Data Service Center]\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nThe warm and moist climate and fertile land in the prefecture of Ningde provide it with favorable conditions for agriculture. The largest agricultural exports from Ningde include [[mushroom]] and [[tea]]. The area also produces large quantities of various fruits, such as [[Pomelo|shaddocks]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]]s, [[plum]]s, [[honey peach]]es, [[lychee]]s and [[longan]]s.\n\nTea cultivation has long been an important industry of Ningde. By 1999 statistics, the total area of tea plantations in Ningde had reached {{convert|463|km\u00b2}} and the output of [[green tea]] took up 10.5 percent of that of the entire country. More than 1.2 million jobs were created directly and indirectly in different stages of the tea industry. Famous brands include the Tianshan Silver-Needle Tea, Baihao Silver-Needle Tea, Fenghuangshe, Lianyue Flower Tea and Xianyan Snow Peak.\n\nThe mountainous landscape and advantageous climate conditions are also beneficial to the development of [[forestry]]. Up to 1999, {{convert|8482|km\u00b2}}, or 65.2 percent of the entire prefecture, are forested. Out of this area, [[bamboo]] groves occupy {{convert|600|km\u00b2}}, producing an annual output of six million bamboo products. In [[Fu'an]] alone, the green bamboo base has extended to {{convert|34|km\u00b2}} and its output of green [[bamboo shoot]]s takes up more than 60 percent of the entire provincial output.\n\n====Aquaculture====\n\nThe prefecture of Ningde is blessed with vast area of shallow sea, which is suitable for [[aquaculture]]. In 2000, aquatic products take up 41.3 percent of the total output value of agriculture from Ningde, with an exporting value of US$82,170,000 and an annual [[net income]] exceeding [[Renminbi|RMB]] 3,500 for local fishermen. Major products include [[Sciaenidae|yellow croaker]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[Pacific Razor Clam|razor clam]]s, [[prawn]]s and freshwater [[eel]]s.\n\nLocal government is attempting to use aquaculture as a springboard to eliminate poverty and improve the local economy. Up to 2000, aquaculture had created 370,000 jobs directly and indirectly; a total of RMB 4.5 billion had been invested, drawing an annual output value of RMB 2 billion.\n\n===Industry===\n\n====Primary====\n\nNingde is the producer of many nonmetallic mineral resources, such as [[granite]], [[diorite]] and [[basalt]]. The confirmed volume of granite reserves extends to 1,140 million cubic meters, while estimated amount of deposits undiscovered stands at several thousand million cubic meters. The mining area for basalt in Bailin, [[Fuding]], known as Fuding Black, covers {{convert|0.21|km2}} with a total deposit of up to 50 million cubic meters.\n\n====Secondary====\n\nNingde's rich hydropower resources give it a headstart in metallurgical industries. Products such as [[magnesium]], [[zirconium oxide]], [[aluminum]], high-purity [[silicon carbide]], and a series of other [[silicon]] products from plants in the prefecture enjoy high reputation and are exempted from examination when exported to [[Japan]]. Advances in metallurgical technology also aids the [[shipbuilding]] industry, a traditional trade in Ningde. In recent years, local shipyards have been capable of constructing 10,000-ton steamships.\n\nFrom its many agricultural produces sprouted the long-running [[food processing]] industry in Ningde. New techniques and formula adopted in recent years have allowed products such as tea, fruits and vegetables, mushrooms and marine products to be exported to the international market.\n\n[[Ningde Nuclear Power Plant]]\n\n[[Image:Old Houses Jiaocheng District Ningde.jpg|thumb|260px|An old district in urban Ningde City.

Among them ''bantieji'' parade ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u642c\u94c1\u6280}}), [[puppet lion dance]], and [[Chinese paper art|paper art]] are the most representative.\n\nThe ''bantieji'' parade, mostly seen during the [[Chinese new year]], is a folk art performance popularized in Ningde since the [[Qing Dynasty]]. During the parade, children dressed as characters from various [[Chinese folklore]] sit or stand on parade vehicles, which were also decorated to resemble classic scenes such as the Heavenly Palace. The vehicles then cruise along the streets in the company of jovial music.\n\nThe puppet lion dance, popular in [[Huotong Town]] and [[Jiaocheng District]], originated from toys of the local children. The lions, made of colorful fabrics, are connected to wooden racks by ropes. Each individual rope controls a part of the lion's body, such as the head, tail or foot. The racks are set on vehicles moving through the streets. Performers on the vehicles pull on the ropes to make the lions dance or perform various tricks.\n\nPaper art, mainly practised by women, is a specialty of [[Zherong County]]. Common forms of the art include traditional flower patterns, words and daily life objects. Because of her paper art achievements, Zherong County was named \"Home of Chinese Folk Arts\" by the Ministry of Culture in 2000.\n\nThe [[She people]] have also created and left many precious cultural heritages in their long historical practice. Owing to projects in recent years to protect the She heritage, three volumes of She folk tales, songs and proverbs have been published. In total, 184 tales, 330,000 words in songs, and 6,000 proverbs have been included. Art works have also been produced out of She folklore, which reflects their way of life.\n\nThere are many [[covered bridge]]s in Ningde, particularly in Pingnan.<ref>[http://amoymagic.mts.cn/Mysticquanzhou/bridges.htm Fujian Bridges] amoymagic Retrieved 2010-05-02.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External

As early as 10,000 to 20,000 years ago during the late [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period of the [[Stone Age]] (also known as the Old Stone Age) there were already human beings living and multiplying here. In 282, the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] government established magistrate rule here.\n\n===Mongol-Manchu===\nDuring the first twenty-three years of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1206\u22121368), Funingzhou ({{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5be7\u5dde}} H\u00f3k-n\u00ecng-ci\u016d) Administration was set up. In 1736, during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]], Ningde was promoted to Funingfu ({{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5be7\u5e9c}} H\u00f3k-n\u00ecng-h\u016b) Administration.\n\n===Republican===\nIn 1934, an Administration Supervision Zone was set up here under the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, the Fu'an Special Administration Zone was established. Finally in June 1971 the Zone was promoted to Ningde Prefecture. [[Xi Jinping]] served as party chief of Ningde between 1988 and 1990.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nSituated roughly {{convert|300|km}} north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the prefecture of Ningde spans {{convert|13500|km\u00b2}} in land area. Like the rest of the province, Ningde sits in a mountainous region but it also enjoys almost {{convert|200|km}} of [[coastline]] facing the [[East China Sea]].\n\nIt is subjected to a [[humid subtropical climate]], with occasional threat of [[typhoon]]s. Within the prefecture, the mean annual temperature ranges from {{convert|13.4|to|20.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, while mean annual [[rainfall]] ranges from {{convert|1250|to|2350|mm|in}}. The region also enjoys a [[frost]]-free period of 235 to 300 days per year, which is highly beneficial for soil agriculture.\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|collapsed = Y\n|location = Ningde (1981\u22122010)\n|Jan high C = 14.2\n|Feb high C = 14.9\n|Mar high C = 17.4\n|Apr high C = 22.0\n|May high C = 26.2\n|Jun high C = 29.8\n|Jul high C = 33.4\n|Aug high C = 32.5\n|Sep high C = 30.0\n|Oct high C = 26.0\n|Nov high C = 21.4\n|Dec high C = 16.6\n|Jan mean C = 10.6\n|Feb mean C = 11.2\n|Mar mean C = 13.5\n|Apr mean C = 17.9\n|May mean C = 22.4\n|Jun mean C = 26.1\n|Jul mean C = 29.3\n|Aug mean C = 28.7\n|Sep mean C = 26.3\n|Oct mean C = 22.3\n|Nov mean C = 17.7\n|Dec mean C = 12.7\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 8.2\n|Feb low C = 8.7\n|Mar low C = 10.7\n|Apr low C = 15.0\n|May low C = 19.5\n|Jun low C = 23.3\n|Jul low C = 26.2\n|Aug low C = 25.8\n|Sep low C = 23.5\n|Oct low C = 19.3\n|Nov low C = 14.9\n|Dec low C = 9.9\n|Jan record high C = 25.4 |Jan record low C = -0.3\n|Feb record high C = 28.7 |Feb record low C = 1.4\n|Mar record high C = 30.9 |Mar record low C = 2.2\n|Apr record high C = 33.9 |Apr record low C = 7.3\n|May record high C = 36.1 |May record low C = 13.4\n|Jun record high C = 38.2 |Jun record low C = 16.4\n|Jul record high C = 40.2 |Jul record low C = 21.2\n|Aug record high C = 37.8 |Aug record low C = 21.5\n|Sep record high C = 37.5 |Sep record low C = 15.6\n|Oct record high C = 32.7 |Oct record low C = 10.7\n|Nov record high C = 32.4 |Nov record low C = 5.5\n|Dec record high C = 26.2 |Dec record low C = -1.4\n|year high C=  |year low C= \n|year high F = |year low F =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 77.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 110.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 175.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 169.8\n|May precipitation mm = 223.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 283.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 196.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 295.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 243.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 83.7\n|Nov precipitation mm = 75.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 62.5\n|Jan humidity = 76\n|Feb humidity = 79\n|Mar humidity = 79\n|Apr humidity = 78\n|May humidity = 78\n|Jun humidity = 80\n|Jul humidity = 75\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 71\n|Nov humidity = 73\n|Dec humidity = 74\n|source 1 = [http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBk.html China Meteorological Data Service Center]\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nThe warm and moist climate and fertile land in the prefecture of Ningde provide it with favorable conditions for agriculture. The largest agricultural exports from Ningde include [[mushroom]] and [[tea]]. The area also produces large quantities of various fruits, such as [[Pomelo|shaddocks]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]]s, [[plum]]s, [[honey peach]]es, [[lychee]]s and [[longan]]s.\n\nTea cultivation has long been an important industry of Ningde. By 1999 statistics, the total area of tea plantations in Ningde had reached {{convert|463|km\u00b2}} and the output of [[green tea]] took up 10.5 percent of that of the entire country. More than 1.2 million jobs were created directly and indirectly in different stages of the tea industry. Famous brands include the Tianshan Silver-Needle Tea, Baihao Silver-Needle Tea, Fenghuangshe, Lianyue Flower Tea and Xianyan Snow Peak.\n\nThe mountainous landscape and advantageous climate conditions are also beneficial to the development of [[forestry]]. Up to 1999, {{convert|8482|km\u00b2}}, or 65.2 percent of the entire prefecture, are forested. Out of this area, [[bamboo]] groves occupy {{convert|600|km\u00b2}}, producing an annual output of six million bamboo products. In [[Fu'an]] alone, the green bamboo base has extended to {{convert|34|km\u00b2}} and its output of green [[bamboo shoot]]s takes up more than 60 percent of the entire provincial output.\n\n====Aquaculture====\n\nThe prefecture of Ningde is blessed with vast area of shallow sea, which is suitable for [[aquaculture]]. In 2000, aquatic products take up 41.3 percent of the total output value of agriculture from Ningde, with an exporting value of US$82,170,000 and an annual [[net income]] exceeding [[Renminbi|RMB]] 3,500 for local fishermen. Major products include [[Sciaenidae|yellow croaker]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[Pacific Razor Clam|razor clam]]s, [[prawn]]s and freshwater [[eel]]s.\n\nLocal government is attempting to use aquaculture as a springboard to eliminate poverty and improve the local economy. Up to 2000, aquaculture had created 370,000 jobs directly and indirectly; a total of RMB 4.5 billion had been invested, drawing an annual output value of RMB 2 billion.\n\n===Industry===\n\n====Primary====\n\nNingde is the producer of many nonmetallic mineral resources, such as [[granite]], [[diorite]] and [[basalt]]. The confirmed volume of granite reserves extends to 1,140 million cubic meters, while estimated amount of deposits undiscovered stands at several thousand million cubic meters. The mining area for basalt in Bailin, [[Fuding]], known as Fuding Black, covers {{convert|0.21|km2}} with a total deposit of up to 50 million cubic meters.\n\n====Secondary====\n\nNingde's rich hydropower resources give it a headstart in metallurgical industries. Products such as [[magnesium]], [[zirconium oxide]], [[aluminum]], high-purity [[silicon carbide]], and a series of other [[silicon]] products from plants in the prefecture enjoy high reputation and are exempted from examination when exported to [[Japan]]. Advances in metallurgical technology also aids the [[shipbuilding]] industry, a traditional trade in Ningde. In recent years, local shipyards have been capable of constructing 10,000-ton steamships.\n\nFrom its many agricultural produces sprouted the long-running [[food processing]] industry in Ningde. New techniques and formula adopted in recent years have allowed products such as tea, fruits and vegetables, mushrooms and marine products to be exported to the international market.\n\n[[Ningde Nuclear Power Plant]]\n\n[[Image:Old Houses Jiaocheng District Ningde.jpg|thumb|260px|An old district in urban Ningde City. Like many other [[China|Chinese]] cities, Ningde is developing fast economically and old houses like these are giving way to new, modern buildings.]]\n\n==Demographics==\n\nAccording to the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 Census]], Ningde has a [[Permanent residency|registered population]] of 3,393,698 inhabitants, although 2,821,996 persons declared to be permanent residents.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} Compilation by LianXin website. [http://www.luqyu.cn/tongjishow.asp?tid=1013 Data from the Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China]</ref> It is also the primary residential region for the [[She people|She minority people]], who take up to 25% of the total population.\nA majority of the population speak [[Eastern Min]].\n\n==Culture==\nThe folk arts in Ningde are varied and colorful. Among them ''bantieji'' parade (\u642c\u94c1\u6280), [[puppet lion dance]], and [[Chinese paper art|paper art]] are the most representative.\n\nThe ''bantieji'' parade, mostly seen during the [[Chinese new year]], is a folk art performance popularized in Ningde since the [[Qing Dynasty]]. During the parade, children dressed as characters from various [[Chinese folklore]] sit or stand on parade vehicles, which were also decorated to resemble classic scenes such as the Heavenly Palace. The vehicles then cruise along the streets in the company of jovial music.\n\nThe puppet lion dance, popular in [[Huotong Town]] and [[Jiaocheng District]], originated from toys of the local children. The lions, made of colorful fabrics, are connected to wooden racks by ropes. Each individual rope controls a part of the lion's body, such as the head, tail or foot. The racks are set on vehicles moving through the streets. Performers on the vehicles pull on the ropes to make the lions dance or perform various tricks.\n\nPaper art, mainly practised by women, is a specialty of [[Zherong County]]. Common forms of the art include traditional flower patterns, words and daily life objects. Because of her paper art achievements, Zherong County was named \"Home of Chinese Folk Arts\" by the Ministry of Culture in 2000.\n\nThe [[She people]] have also created and left many precious cultural heritages in their long historical practice. Owing to projects in recent years to protect the She heritage, three volumes of She folk tales, songs and proverbs have been published. In total, 184 tales, 330,000 words in songs, and 6,000 proverbs have been included. Art works have also been produced out of She folklore, which reflects their way of life.\n\nThere are many [[covered bridge]]s in Ningde, particularly in Pingnan.<ref>[http://amoymagic.mts.cn/Mysticquanzhou/bridges.htm Fujian Bridges] amoymagic Retrieved 2010-05-02.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070812121039/http://www.nds.gov.cn/  Ningde Government Website]\n*[http://www.stats-fjnd.gov.cn/index.asp Ningde Bureau of Statistics]\n{{Commons category|Ningde|position=left}}\n\n{{Fujian topics}}\n{{Fujian}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ningde| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Fujian]]\n[[Category:Prefecture-level divisions of Fujian]]\n", "name_user": "CaradhrasAiguo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningde"}

Public''' (and several similar names; see the [[#Variations|Variations]] section below) is a generic name in the [[United States]], to denote a hypothetical member of society deemed a \"[[commoner|common man]].\" He is presumed to represent the randomly selected \"man on the street.\"\n\nThe equivalent term used in the [[United Kingdom]] is '''Joe Public'''.\n\n==Variations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nThere are various similar terms including '''John Q. Citizen''' and '''John Q. Taxpayer''', or '''Jane Q. Public''', '''Jane Q. Citizen''', and '''Jane Q. Taxpayer''' for a woman. The name '''[[John Doe]]''' is used in a similar manner. The term '''[[Tom, Dick and Harry]]''' is often used to denote multiple hypothetical persons. An equivalent term is '''Joe Public''' which is used in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nRoughly equivalent are the names '''Joe Blow''', '''Joe Six-pack''', and the nowadays rather less popular '''Joe Doakes''' and '''[[Joe Shmoe]]''', the last of which implies a lower-class citizen (from the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] ''schmo'': simpleton, or possibly [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''sh'mo'': (what's)-his-name). On a higher plane, the [[Talmud]]ic generic place-marker name '''Plony''' (which can be translated to Mr. X. or Anonymous) is used as a reference in any case which is applicable to anyone - [[Sanhedrin]] 43a provides an example <ref name=\"Talmudic Plony\">{{Cite web |url=https://coffeeshoprabbi.com/2015/12/27/is-the-talmud-full-of-lies/ |title=Is the Talmud Full of Lies? |last=Adar |first=Ruth |date=2019-12-27 |website=Coffee Shop Rabbi |access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nIn the United States, the term ''John Q. Public'' is used by law enforcement officers to refer to an individual with no criminal bent, as opposed to terms like ''perp'' (short for perpetrator) or ''[[skell]]'' to qualify unsavory individuals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n2008 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]ial nominee [[Sarah Palin]] infamously referred to \"Joe Sixpack and [[Hockey mom]]s\" during a debate. Presidential candidate [[John McCain]] referenced a similar symbol, this time represented by an actual person, saying that Senator [[Barack Obama|Obama]]'s tax plan would hurt [[Joe the Plumber]]'s bottom line. A fifteen-minute debate on this issue ensued, with both candidates speaking directly to \"Joe\".<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/15/debate.transcript/index.html | work=CNN | title=McCain, Obama go head to head in last debate - CNN.com | date=October 15, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nJohn, Quisquam and \"The Public\" first appears in the formation of the United States as a nation where English and German were being discussed as the official language of the new United States in the later 1700s.

The terms of union required that within two years, the federal government was to start the construction of a railway from the \"seaboard of British Columbia\" joining the new province and Victoria with the railway system of Canada.  On its part, British Columbia was to grant a band of public land of up to {{convert|32|km}} in width along either side of the railway line to the federal government for it to use in furtherance of the construction of the railway.  The Pacific terminus of the railway was not specific but the proposed plan would have the railway cross the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] by the [[Yellowhead Pass]] and reach the BC coast at [[Bute Inlet]].  It would cross [[Sonora Island (British Columbia)|Sonora Island]] and [[Quadra Island]] and reach Vancouver Island by a bridge across [[Seymour Narrows]].  Through the influence of then BC Premier [[Amor de Cosmos]], this plan was adopted by [[Order in Council]] by the federal government on 7 June 1873.  Two shipments of rail were even delivered to Victoria from the United Kingdom.  In 1873, [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]] had stated that [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]], the site of a [[naval base]], would be the terminus of the \"Pacific Railway\".  However, both the federal government and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] placed a low priority on construction of an island railway, as it had low traffic potential and would duplicate an existing steamer service.\n\n[[Image:Port Alberni Station.jpg|thumb|left|Port Alberni Station is today only used by the heritage [[Alberni Pacific Railway]]]]\nIn 1874 British Columbia threatened to withdraw from Confederation and Premier [[George Anthony Walkem|Walkem]] petitioned the Queen for relief from these delays. Then Prime Minister [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]]\nand Walkem agreed to accept arbitration of the dispute by the [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Earl of Carnarvon]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]]. His award, given 17 November 1874 gave an extension of time for the construction and required that a railway be built from Esquimalt to Nanaimo. Despite the promises of both parties to be bound by his ruling, the federal government bill approving the award failed in the [[Senate of Canada]]. British Columbians were indignant and withdrawal from Confederation was raised again.\n\nIn 1879 [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]] was sent to BC to assess the situation.  His efforts produced no resolution.  Governor General Dufferin arriving in Victoria had to take an alternate route rather than pass below an arch across the main street that bore a banner reading \"Carnarvon Terms or Separation.\"<ref>[http://knowbc.com/limited/Books/Encyclopedia-of-BC/C/Carnarvon-Terms Carnarvon Terms - KnowBC - the leading source of BC information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Walkem, although no longer premier, was sent to Ottawa to press for the Esquimalt to Nanaimo section. This issue was pressed again in 1880 by Amor de Cosmos and when that failed another petition to London was presented in 1881.\n\nThe father of Canadian Confederation Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] in the House of Commons in 1881 gave a speech on the CPR and criticized [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] for tinkering with the preconditions of British Columbia and Vancouver Island uniting with Canada.<ref>[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/r-e-r-edward-gosnell/a-history-british-columbia-hci/page-21-a-history-british-columbia-hci.shtml Read the ebook A history; British Columbia by R.

It was a matter of Colonial policy and Imperial policy in England that the road should be constructed.\"<ref>http://canadachannel.ca/HCO/index.php/John_A._Macdonald,_Speech_on_the_CPR</ref>\n\n===The Land Grants===\n\n====Coal Baron Robert Dunsmuir====\n[[Robert Dunsmuir]], the [[Nanaimo, British Columbia|Nanaimo]] [[coal]] baron and a member of the provincial legislature, was interested in owning the railway project and in the province's coal reserves.  The fact that Dunsmuir was a member of the provincial government that was making the deal aroused some suspicion about corruption.  Dunsmuir and three partners ([[Charles Crocker]], [[Collis Potter Huntington|Collis P. Huntington]] and [[Leland Stanford]] of California) incorporated the Esquimalt & Nanaimo Railway with Dunsmuir president and owner of one half of the shares. The company estimated that it would cost $1.5 million to construct.  Dunsmuir planned to integrate the railway with the systems being built in Washington and Oregon with a ferry link from Victoria.\n\n[[Image:Lewis M Clement.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Lewis M. Clement]]The [[John Alexander Macdonald|first Prime Minister]] gave [[British Columbia]] the choice of Dunsmuir or Lewis M. Clement<ref>[http://cprr.org/Museum/Lewis_Metzler_Clement.html Lewis M. Clement]</ref> of San Francisco, Chief Engineer of the Western Division of the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]], for the contract. Dusmuir travelled to Ottawa in 1882 with letters of introduction from [[John Hamilton Gray (New Brunswick politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], one of the [[Fathers of Confederation]] and [[Joseph Trutch]] the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, both men in favour with Macdonald.<ref>Reksten, p 58.</ref>  After a visit to Ottawa, to present himself directly for this project, Dunsmuir went off to Scotland.  While in Scotland, Dunsmuir received the news that the provincial government had chosen the Vancouver Land and Railway Company controlled by Clement for the job. Dunsmuir was surprised that Clement would take the contract without a cash grant in addition to the land and commit to building the railway to Seymour Narrows, near [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]].<ref>Reksten p 59.</ref> When Clement and his company failed to come up with the necessary financial security, Macdonald quickly moved to accept Dunsmuir's terms.\n\n==== Settler Rights ====\nThe court ruled that this grant did not entitle the railway to dispossess existing settlers, the company applied for compensation and received a further grant of {{convert|86763|acre|ha}} between Crown Mountain and Seymour Narrows.  In 1883, the British Columbia provincial government signed a contract with Dunsmuir to build a railway between Esquimalt and Nanaimo in exchange for the same grant of land that Clement had negotiated, amounting to {{convert|800000|acre|ha|0}} plus a cash grant of $750,000 from the federal government.  Based on an average value of $10 per acre for the land the E&N received, it cost the government $626,660 per mile to build the railway, which, when complete, was in private hands.  The railway was given a massive amount of [[old-growth forests]].<ref>MacLachlin, p 55.</ref>  Proceeds from the land grants helped build [[Craigdarroch Castle]]. The grant amounted to almost 10% of [[Vancouver Island]] and included mineral rights and all known coal deposits.  All the land grants to the E&N railroad from 1884 to 1925 amounted to 20% of Vancouver Island.<ref>[http://www.ltsa.ca/data/img/publication/Crown-Land-Grants-A-History-of-the-E-and-N.pdf Home | LTSA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The company was to receive a grant with the following boundaries:<blockquote>\n:On the south by a straight line drawn from the head of Saanich Inlet to Muir Creek, on the Straits of Fuca:\n:On the west, by a straight line drawn from Muir Creek, aforesaid, to [[Crown Mountain (Vancouver Island, British Columbia)|Crown Mountain]]:\n:On the north, by a straight line drawn from Crown Mountain to [[Seymour Narrows]]: and\n:On the east, by the coast line of Vancouver Island to the point of commencement.<ref>MacLachlin, p 15.\n</ref>\n</blockquote>The grant was facilitated by BC's introduction of the Settlement Act (An Act relating to the Island Railway, the Graving Dock and the Railway Lands of the Province) in December 1883, in which surface rights of existing \"squatters\" were acknowledged and protected.<ref>Black, Kelly.

Construction of the island railway took three and a half years. Prime Minister Macdonald drove the last spike, during his only visit to British Columbia. The railway was extended to Dunsmuir's mine at [[Wellington, British Columbia|Wellington]] in 1887, and into [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] in 1888. It was extended west to [[Port Alberni]] in 1911, west to [[Lake Cowichan, British Columbia|Lake Cowichan]] in 1912, and north to [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay]] in 1914. The E&N Railway was originally to have been built all the way to [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]], but that plan fell through due to the outbreak of [[World War I]].\n\nThe present day bridge {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Victoria, BC, over Niagara Creek Canyon ({{Coord|48.4825|-123.5574|display=inline|type:landmark_region:CA}}), formerly [[Cisco bridges#Canadian Pacific Railway|crossed the Fraser River]] at [[Cisco, British Columbia|Cisco, BC]], and was moved here {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} ca.1910.

The CPR built the railroad to Lake Cowichan, Port Alberni, Parksville, Qualicum Beach, and Courtenay. At its peak, the railroad had 45 stations on the main line, 36 stations on the Cowichan line, and 8 stations on the Port Alberni line.<ref>http://www.islandrail.ca/archives/history-of-the-en-railway/</ref>\n\nBetween 1905 and 1999, the E&N Railway was owned and operated by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. [[Via Rail]] took over operation of CPR's passenger train service, called ''[[Victoria \u2013 Courtenay train|The Malahat]]'', in 1978, while CPR demarketed its freight operation, claiming that freight traffic was declining. In 1996, CPR reorganized the E&N as an \"internal short line\" named E&N Railfreight while the [[Car float|railbarge]] operations were sold to [[Seaspan Intermodal]]. In early 1999, shortline operator [[RailAmerica]] purchased the route from Nanaimo to Port Alberni, and leased the balance of the line.  At that time approximately 8,500 carloads of forest and paper products, minerals, and chemicals were transported by the Southern Vancouver Island Railway each year.\n\n===RailAmerica===\n[[Image:Qualicum Beach Station 3.jpg|thumb|A [[Budd RDC]] train operated by [[Via Rail]] at [[Qualicum Beach]]]]\nIn 1998, CPR sold the middle part of the corridor to RailAmerica. Despite the purchase by RailAmerica, freight traffic continued to decline and the future of the E&N was still in doubt.  RailAmerica sought a sale for its acquisition due to unprofitably and deferred maintenance issues. Restrictions from Canadian Pacific on the lease/sale agreement, and major reconstruction of [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]] from Victoria to Nanaimo and [[British Columbia Highway 19|the new freeway]] from Nanaimo to Campbell River, led to reduced driving times for the full length of the E&N.  This development also affected the privately owned rail line, which did not have the benefit of the provincial subsidies accorded to its competing highways. Freight traffic dropped to about 2000 carloads a year after the loss of their largest freight customer, a [[Catalyst Paper]] [[pulp mill]] in Port Alberni. RailAmerica ceased to operate the E&N on 30 June 2006, with the Washington Group's [[Southern Railway of British Columbia]] taking over operations the following day under the name Southern Railway of Vancouver Island.\n\n==== Pacific Wilderness tourist train ====\nIn  the summers of 2000 and 2001, Ross Rowland managed on Vancouver Island the Pacific Wilderness Railway, which operated on the tracks of the E&N Railway from Victoria, BC to the top of the nearby Malahat summit. The operation consisted of a few coach cars, which were moved through Esquimalt, View Royal and Langford by a couple of GP 20s, which would then make their way up to the top of the Malahat, before turning around and heading back to Victoria.\n\nDespite PAW's ad campaign promising grand views and stunning scenery, riders were often disappointed to discover {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} that the views of Saanich Inlet were largely obscured by thick old growth forest along most of the route's right of way. Rowland attempted to remedy this situation by chopping down large portions of old growth trees along the Malahat portion of the right of way, but this only succeeded in incurring the wrath of area residents {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, without having much effect on the overall view. Questions were also raised about the Malahat being chosen as the northern terminus, due to its isolation {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. Apart from a crude shelter/platform that Rowland built in the wilderness with untreated lumber, the terminus lacked even basic service such as refreshments or washrooms. The nearest location that offered these services was a tiny gas station over 10 kilometers away.\n\n===Via Rail===\nIn 1978, [[Via Rail]] assumed operational responsibility for the E&N Railway passenger service.  Post ICF ownership, the rail operator agreement had the private company Southern Railway operate the daily inter-city passenger service from Victoria to Courtenay on behalf of Via Rail. Train tickets had to be purchased three days in advance to avoid an increase in the cost of the fare. In 2011, due to the disrepair of the railroad, Via Rail and Southern Railway suspended indefinitely the Dayliner passenger service, the [[Victoria \u2013 Courtenay train]]. The train had scheduled stops at [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan]], [[Nanaimo]], and [[Parksville, British Columbia|Parksville]], with many other [[flag stop]]s (stops on request) along the way. VIA and Southern Railway did offer a bus service for a several months after the closure, but the service was discontinued August 7, 2011. VIA's bus tickets had to be bought three days in advance and fewer than ten people a day used their temporary bus service.<ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/July2011/07/c3969.html VIA Rail Canada Inc. | Travel Advisory - Temporary Bus Replacing VIA's Victoria to Courtenay Train Service To Make Last Trip August 7<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The VIA passenger service used [[Budd Company|Budd]]-built [[Budd Rail Diesel Car|Rail Diesel Cars]].

It then spent three years as '''E & N Railfreight''', an internal short line within then owner [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].  Operations were then sold to [[RailAmerica]]. The RailAmerica subsidiary was named '''E&N Railway Co (1998) Ltd'''. {{reporting mark|ENR}}, thus maintaining the historic name associations for the Vancouver Island line.\n\n==Island Corridor Foundation==\n[[Image:Nanaimo Station with Budd RDC.jpg|thumb|A Via Rail RDC in Nanaimo]]\n\n===Tax gift===\nThe not for profit [[Island Corridor Foundation]] is a partnership between the Cowichan Tribes and local governments along the SVI line. After years of work and negotiations, the ICF came to agreements with both the Canadian Pacific Railway and RailAmericia, to hand over its Island rail assets to the foundation for tax credits.<ref>http://www.islandrail.ca/the-owner/en-line-donated-to-islanders/</ref>\n\nIn February 2006, the Canadian Pacific Railway donated its {{convert|234|km|mi|abbr=in}} portion of the SVI [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]], which averages {{convert|30.48|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in width between Victoria and Courtenay, to the Island Corridor Foundation. The donation tax credit exchange was estimated to be valued at $236(C) million and encompasses {{convert|6.51|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land, six historic railway stations and a number of trestles. In addition, CPR also supplied $2.3-million in \"seed money\" to the Foundation.  Lands were also given that produce non-rail revenue generated by property leases and encroachments on the line.<ref>http://www.islandrail.ca/land-inquiries/</ref>\n\nOn 22 March 2006, RailAmerica donated ownership of the Port Alberni to Nanaimo portion of the SVI to the Island Corridor Foundation.\n\n=== No trespassing policy ===\nMore people are starting to walk, hike and use off-road vehicles on the right of way<ref>[http://www.bclocalnews.com/vancouver_island_central/parksville_qualicumbeachnews/business/123272753.html?mobile=true Parksville Qualicum News - Railway officials, police, warn pedestrians - Mobile Edition<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Railway and ICF officials are asking people to stay off the tracks for their own safety.\n\n=== Freight business ===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\nICF chose Southern Railway of Vancouver Island (SVI) to operate the Island railway on Vancouver Island, after ICF\u2019s acquisition of the railroad.<ref>http://www.islandrail.ca/freight/fact-sheets/the-operator/</ref> The operator agreement started on July 1, 2006. In January 2010, the [[Southern Railway of British Columbia]] new train ferry terminal started operating in the [[Fraser River]] on [[Annacis Island]] shipping to Nanaimo via the [[Seaspan]] [[train ferry]].  The new train marine terminal was built with the help of $4.6 million in federal funding and\ncost $11 million.  It increases the mainland's capacity and speed to load and unload railcar barges from the island.<ref>[http://www2.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/business/story.html?id=b2bc63d8-8b39-439f-beff-ee5b79de5b5e Terminal aids Island rail system<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe amount of freight traffic in 2008 and 2009 was about 1,000 cars per year. According to the Rule of 100,<ref>[http://www.rblanchard.com/resources/rule100.htm Blanchard Co Rule of 100<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> a generally accepted economic formula for short-line railways, a minimum of 100 freight cars per mile a year is required before a line is profitable due to depreciation accounting. The old E&N route currently averages about 6.6 cars per mile.  The ICF has estimated there is a potential business of 22,000 rail cars of freight each year on Vancouver Island.\n\nAn ICF development strategies report estimated that 35,000 to 40,000 carloads per year, as the amount of business that would be required to bear the full capital cost of upgrading the railroad and maintain operations on a sustainable basis. If the capital costs of upgrading the railway are excluded, the business of 8,000 carloads per year would be required to pay for basic operating and maintenance costs. The most significant potential revenue is the Raven coal mine (located west of Fanny Bay) needing up to 10,000 carloads per year.  The foundation report noted the market potential for sourcing of aggregates like gravel for the Victoria market from alternative reserves up-Island. However, this market would be extremely competitive due to the availability of shipments of aggregate by barge from Lehigh\u2019s facility in Sechelt and the new [[Johnson Street Bridge]] providing barge access to downtown Victoria.<ref>http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/reports_and_studies/Evaluation_ENRailway/Final_Report/Phase_2-Development_Strategies.pdf</ref>\n\nIn November 2014, SVI freight service along the entire Duncan to Parksville segment of the line was suspended following a risk assessment after the disrepair of the track had been continuously slowing train speeds down. No timeline was known for when service will resume.<ref name=\"Island Freight Rail Halted\" />\n\nAs of 2018, the only operational trackage left is a truncated 7 mile strip in the Nanaimo area, servicing the Superior Propane spur in north Nanaimo. \n\nThe ICF is a partnership of the various local governments and First Nations communities along the railway, including 14 municipalities, 5 regional districts and 12 First Nations.\n\n==SVI Rail operator of railway==\nThe Washington company Southern Railway of Vancouver Island (SVI) is the operating railroad for Vancouver Island freight and passenger services, and works under a haulage arrangement with Southern Railway of British Columbia (SRY). SVI provides rail freight services to various customers on Vancouver Island railroad offering connections to the continental railway network. It also operates daily intercity passenger service from Victoria to Courtenay by arrangements with Via Rail Canada. SVI employs 22 people and has a wage bill of 1.25 million a year, as well as spending another 1 million for rail operations as part of the Island economy.<ref>http://www.sryraillink.com/vancouver_isl_service.htm</ref>\n\n==Rail line closure and delayed re-openings==\n[[File:Alberni Pacific June 16 and 17 2013.jpg|thumb|Alberni Pacific excursion train, June 2013]]\nBeginning March 18, 2011 passenger service between Victoria and Courtenay was suspended indefinitely, due to safety concerns about the poor condition of the tracks. In April 2012 the Federal Government announced that it would match a $7.5 million grant offered by the BC Provincial Government, providing the required $15 million for basic repairs and upgrades to reopen the rail line.

The Southern Railway's railroad runs from [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] to [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay]], with a [[branch line]] from [[Parksville, British Columbia|Parksville]] to [[Port Alberni]].  In 2006, the [[Island Corridor Foundation]] acquired the railway's ownership from the Canadian Pacific Railway and RailAmerica.\n\nBoth freight service and the crown corporation [[Via Rail]] passenger service have been suspended indefinitely due to deferred maintenance on the railroad.<ref name=\"Island Freight Rail Halted\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/business/island-freight-rail-halted-over-track-safety-concerns-1.1526515|title=Island freight rail halted over track safety concerns|work=Times Colonist|date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Vancouver Island joining Canada===\nThe history of an island railroad<ref>MacLachlin, p12-16</ref> and a functioning island railway in perpetuity, started with the [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia|colony of Vancouver Island joining British Columbia]] in 1866, and the [[Canadian Confederation]] of 1867, and the incorporation of [[British Columbia]] into Canada in 1871.  The terms of union required that within two years, the federal government was to start the construction of a railway from the \"seaboard of British Columbia\" joining the new province and Victoria with the railway system of Canada.  On its part, British Columbia was to grant a band of public land of up to {{convert|32|km}} in width along either side of the railway line to the federal government for it to use in furtherance of the construction of the railway.  The Pacific terminus of the railway was not specific but the proposed plan would have the railway cross the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] by the [[Yellowhead Pass]] and reach the BC coast at [[Bute Inlet]].  It would cross [[Sonora Island (British Columbia)|Sonora Island]] and [[Quadra Island]] and reach Vancouver Island by a bridge across [[Seymour Narrows]].  Through the influence of then BC Premier [[Amor de Cosmos]], this plan was adopted by [[Order in Council]] by the federal government on 7 June 1873.  Two shipments of rail were even delivered to Victoria from the United Kingdom.  In 1873, [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]] had stated that [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]], the site of a [[naval base]], would be the terminus of the \"Pacific Railway\".  However, both the federal government and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] placed a low priority on construction of an island railway, as it had low traffic potential and would duplicate an existing steamer service.\n\n[[Image:Port Alberni Station.jpg|thumb|left|Port Alberni Station is today only used by the heritage [[Alberni Pacific Railway]]]]\nIn 1874 British Columbia threatened to withdraw from Confederation and Premier [[George Anthony Walkem|Walkem]] petitioned the Queen for relief from these delays. Then Prime Minister [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]]\nand Walkem agreed to accept arbitration of the dispute by the [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Earl of Carnarvon]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]]. His award, given 17 November 1874 gave an extension of time for the construction and required that a railway be built from Esquimalt to Nanaimo. Despite the promises of both parties to be bound by his ruling, the federal government bill approving the award failed in the [[Senate of Canada]]. British Columbians were indignant and withdrawal from Confederation was raised again.\n\nIn 1879 [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]] was sent to BC to assess the situation.  His efforts produced no resolution.  Governor General Dufferin arriving in Victoria had to take an alternate route rather than pass below an arch across the main street that bore a banner reading \"Carnarvon Terms or Separation.\"<ref>[http://knowbc.com/limited/Books/Encyclopedia-of-BC/C/Carnarvon-Terms Carnarvon Terms - KnowBC - the leading source of BC information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Walkem, although no longer premier, was sent to Ottawa to press for the Esquimalt to Nanaimo section. This issue was pressed again in 1880 by Amor de Cosmos and when that failed another petition to London was presented in 1881.\n\nThe father of Canadian Confederation Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] in the House of Commons in 1881 gave a speech on the CPR and criticized [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] for tinkering with the preconditions of British Columbia and Vancouver Island uniting with Canada.<ref>[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/r-e-r-edward-gosnell/a-history-british-columbia-hci/page-21-a-history-british-columbia-hci.shtml Read the ebook A history; British Columbia by R.

It was a matter of Colonial policy and Imperial policy in England that the road should be constructed.\"<ref>http://canadachannel.ca/HCO/index.php/John_A._Macdonald,_Speech_on_the_CPR</ref>\n\n===The Land Grants===\n\n====Coal Baron Robert Dunsmuir====\n[[Robert Dunsmuir]], the [[Nanaimo, British Columbia|Nanaimo]] [[coal]] baron and a member of the provincial legislature, was interested in owning the railway project and in the province's coal reserves.  The fact that Dunsmuir was a member of the provincial government that was making the deal aroused some suspicion about corruption.  Dunsmuir and three partners ([[Charles Crocker]], [[Collis Potter Huntington|Collis P. Huntington]] and [[Leland Stanford]] of California) incorporated the Esquimalt & Nanaimo Railway with Dunsmuir president and owner of one half of the shares. The company estimated that it would cost $1.5 million to construct.  Dunsmuir planned to integrate the railway with the systems being built in Washington and Oregon with a ferry link from Victoria.\n\n[[Image:Lewis M Clement.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Lewis M. Clement]]The [[John Alexander Macdonald|first Prime Minister]] gave [[British Columbia]] the choice of Dunsmuir or Lewis M. Clement<ref>[http://cprr.org/Museum/Lewis_Metzler_Clement.html Lewis M. Clement]</ref> of San Francisco, Chief Engineer of the Western Division of the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]], for the contract. Dusmuir travelled to Ottawa in 1882 with letters of introduction from [[John Hamilton Gray (New Brunswick politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], one of the [[Fathers of Confederation]] and [[Joseph Trutch]] the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, both men in favour with Macdonald.<ref>Reksten, p 58.</ref>  After a visit to Ottawa, to present himself directly for this project, Dunsmuir went off to Scotland.  While in Scotland, Dunsmuir received the news that the provincial government had chosen the Vancouver Land and Railway Company controlled by Clement for the job. Dunsmuir was surprised that Clement would take the contract without a cash grant in addition to the land and commit to building the railway to Seymour Narrows, near [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]].<ref>Reksten p 59.</ref> When Clement and his company failed to come up with the necessary financial security, Macdonald quickly moved to accept Dunsmuir's terms.\n\n==== Settler Rights ====\nThe court ruled that this grant did not entitle the railway to dispossess existing settlers, the company applied for compensation and received a further grant of {{convert|86763|acre|ha}} between Crown Mountain and Seymour Narrows.  In 1883, the British Columbia provincial government signed a contract with Dunsmuir to build a railway between Esquimalt and Nanaimo in exchange for the same grant of land that Clement had negotiated, amounting to {{convert|800000|acre|ha|0}} plus a cash grant of $750,000 from the federal government.  Based on an average value of $10 per acre for the land the E&N received, it cost the government $626,660 per mile to build the railway, which, when complete, was in private hands.  The railway was given a massive amount of [[old-growth forests]].<ref>MacLachlin, p 55.</ref>  Proceeds from the land grants helped build [[Craigdarroch Castle]]. The grant amounted to almost 10% of [[Vancouver Island]] and included mineral rights and all known coal deposits.  All the land grants to the E&N railroad from 1884 to 1925 amounted to 20% of Vancouver Island.<ref>[http://www.ltsa.ca/data/img/publication/Crown-Land-Grants-A-History-of-the-E-and-N.pdf Home | LTSA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The company was to receive a grant with the following boundaries:<blockquote>\n:On the south by a straight line drawn from the head of Saanich Inlet to Muir Creek, on the Straits of Fuca:\n:On the west, by a straight line drawn from Muir Creek, aforesaid, to [[Crown Mountain (Vancouver Island, British Columbia)|Crown Mountain]]:\n:On the north, by a straight line drawn from Crown Mountain to [[Seymour Narrows]]: and\n:On the east, by the coast line of Vancouver Island to the point of commencement.<ref>MacLachlin, p 15.\n</ref>\n</blockquote>The grant was facilitated by BC's introduction of the Settlement Act (An Act relating to the Island Railway, the Graving Dock and the Railway Lands of the Province) in December 1883, in which surface rights of existing \"squatters\" were acknowledged and protected.<ref>Black, Kelly.

Construction of the island railway took three and a half years. Prime Minister Macdonald drove the last spike, during his only visit to British Columbia. The railway was extended to Dunsmuir's mine at [[Wellington, British Columbia|Wellington]] in 1887, and into [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] in 1888. It was extended west to [[Port Alberni]] in 1911, west to [[Lake Cowichan, British Columbia|Lake Cowichan]] in 1912, and north to [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay]] in 1914. The E&N Railway was originally to have been built all the way to [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]], but that plan fell through due to the outbreak of [[World War I]].\n\nThe present day bridge {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Victoria, BC, over Niagara Creek Canyon ({{Coord|48.4825|-123.5574|display=inline|type:landmark_region:CA}}), formerly [[Cisco bridges#Canadian Pacific Railway|crossed the Fraser River]] at [[Cisco, British Columbia|Cisco, BC]], and was moved here {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} ca.1910.

The CPR built the railroad to Lake Cowichan, Port Alberni, Parksville, Qualicum Beach, and Courtenay. At its peak, the railroad had 45 stations on the main line, 36 stations on the Cowichan line, and 8 stations on the Port Alberni line.<ref>http://www.islandrail.ca/archives/history-of-the-en-railway/</ref>\n\nBetween 1905 and 1999, the E&N Railway was owned and operated by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. [[Via Rail]] took over operation of CPR's passenger train service, called ''[[Victoria \u2013 Courtenay train|The Malahat]]'', in 1978, while CPR demarketed its freight operation, claiming that freight traffic was declining. In 1996, CPR reorganized the E&N as an \"internal short line\" named E&N Railfreight while the [[Car float|railbarge]] operations were sold to [[Seaspan Intermodal]]. In early 1999, shortline operator [[RailAmerica]] purchased the route from Nanaimo to Port Alberni, and leased the balance of the line.  At that time approximately 8,500 carloads of forest and paper products, minerals, and chemicals were transported by the Southern Vancouver Island Railway each year.\n\n===RailAmerica===\n[[Image:Qualicum Beach Station 3.jpg|thumb|A [[Budd RDC]] train operated by [[Via Rail]] at [[Qualicum Beach]]]]\nIn 1998, CPR sold the middle part of the corridor to RailAmerica. Despite the purchase by RailAmerica, freight traffic continued to decline and the future of the E&N was still in doubt.  RailAmerica sought a sale for its acquisition due to unprofitably and deferred maintenance issues. Restrictions from Canadian Pacific on the lease/sale agreement, and major reconstruction of [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]] from Victoria to Nanaimo and [[British Columbia Highway 19|the new freeway]] from Nanaimo to Campbell River, led to reduced driving times for the full length of the E&N.  This development also affected the privately owned rail line, which did not have the benefit of the provincial subsidies accorded to its competing highways. Freight traffic dropped to about 2000 carloads a year after the loss of their largest freight customer, a [[Catalyst Paper]] [[pulp mill]] in Port Alberni. RailAmerica ceased to operate the E&N on 30 June 2006, with the Washington Group's [[Southern Railway of British Columbia]] taking over operations the following day under the name Southern Railway of Vancouver Island.\n\n==== Pacific Wilderness tourist train ====\nIn  the summers of 2000 and 2001, Ross Rowland managed on Vancouver Island the Pacific Wilderness Railway, which operated on the tracks of the E&N Railway from Victoria, BC to the top of the nearby Malahat summit. The operation consisted of a few coach cars, which were moved through Esquimalt, View Royal and Langford by a couple of GP 20s, which would then make their way up to the top of the Malahat, before turning around and heading back to Victoria.\n\nDespite PAW's ad campaign promising grand views and stunning scenery, riders were often disappointed to discover {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} that the views of Saanich Inlet were largely obscured by thick old growth forest along most of the route's right of way. Rowland attempted to remedy this situation by chopping down large portions of old growth trees along the Malahat portion of the right of way, but this only succeeded in incurring the wrath of area residents {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, without having much effect on the overall view. Questions were also raised about the Malahat being chosen as the northern terminus, due to its isolation {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. Apart from a crude shelter/platform that Rowland built in the wilderness with untreated lumber, the terminus lacked even basic service such as refreshments or washrooms. The nearest location that offered these services was a tiny gas station over 10 kilometers away.\n\n===Via Rail===\nIn 1978, [[Via Rail]] assumed operational responsibility for the E&N Railway passenger service.  Post ICF ownership, the rail operator agreement had the private company Southern Railway operate the daily inter-city passenger service from Victoria to Courtenay on behalf of Via Rail. Train tickets had to be purchased three days in advance to avoid an increase in the cost of the fare. In 2011, due to the disrepair of the railroad, Via Rail and Southern Railway suspended indefinitely the Dayliner passenger service, the [[Victoria \u2013 Courtenay train]]. The train had scheduled stops at [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan]], [[Nanaimo]], and [[Parksville, British Columbia|Parksville]], with many other [[flag stop]]s (stops on request) along the way. VIA and Southern Railway did offer a bus service for a several months after the closure, but the service was discontinued August 7, 2011. VIA's bus tickets had to be bought three days in advance and fewer than ten people a day used their temporary bus service.<ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/July2011/07/c3969.html VIA Rail Canada Inc. | Travel Advisory - Temporary Bus Replacing VIA's Victoria to Courtenay Train Service To Make Last Trip August 7<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The VIA passenger service used [[Budd Company|Budd]]-built [[Budd Rail Diesel Car|Rail Diesel Cars]].

It then spent three years as '''E & N Railfreight''', an internal short line within then owner [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].  Operations were then sold to [[RailAmerica]]. The RailAmerica subsidiary was named '''E&N Railway Co (1998) Ltd'''. {{reporting mark|ENR}}, thus maintaining the historic name associations for the Vancouver Island line.\n\n==Island Corridor Foundation==\n[[Image:Nanaimo Station with Budd RDC.jpg|thumb|A Via Rail RDC in Nanaimo]]\n\n===Tax gift===\nThe not for profit [[Island Corridor Foundation]] is a partnership between the Cowichan Tribes and local governments along the SVI line. After years of work and negotiations, the ICF came to agreements with both the Canadian Pacific Railway and RailAmericia, to hand over its Island rail assets to the foundation for tax credits.<ref>http://www.islandrail.ca/the-owner/en-line-donated-to-islanders/</ref>\n\nIn February 2006, the Canadian Pacific Railway donated its {{convert|234|km|mi|abbr=in}} portion of the SVI [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]], which averages {{convert|30.48|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in width between Victoria and Courtenay, to the Island Corridor Foundation. The donation tax credit exchange was estimated to be valued at $236(C) million and encompasses {{convert|6.51|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land, six historic railway stations and a number of trestles. In addition, CPR also supplied $2.3-million in \"seed money\" to the Foundation.  Lands were also given that produce non-rail revenue generated by property leases and encroachments on the line.<ref>http://www.islandrail.ca/land-inquiries/</ref>\n\nOn 22 March 2006, RailAmerica donated ownership of the Port Alberni to Nanaimo portion of the SVI to the Island Corridor Foundation.\n\n=== No trespassing policy ===\nMore people are starting to walk, hike and use off-road vehicles on the right of way<ref>[http://www.bclocalnews.com/vancouver_island_central/parksville_qualicumbeachnews/business/123272753.html?mobile=true Parksville Qualicum News - Railway officials, police, warn pedestrians - Mobile Edition<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Railway and ICF officials are asking people to stay off the tracks for their own safety.\n\n=== Freight business ===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\nICF chose Southern Railway of Vancouver Island (SVI) to operate the Island railway on Vancouver Island, after ICF\u2019s acquisition of the railroad.<ref>http://www.islandrail.ca/freight/fact-sheets/the-operator/</ref> The operator agreement started on July 1, 2006. In January 2010, the [[Southern Railway of British Columbia]] new train ferry terminal started operating in the [[Fraser River]] on [[Annacis Island]] shipping to Nanaimo via the [[Seaspan]] [[train ferry]].  The new train marine terminal was built with the help of $4.6 million in federal funding and\ncost $11 million.  It increases the mainland's capacity and speed to load and unload railcar barges from the island.<ref>[http://www2.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/business/story.html?id=b2bc63d8-8b39-439f-beff-ee5b79de5b5e Terminal aids Island rail system<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe amount of freight traffic in 2008 and 2009 was about 1,000 cars per year. According to the Rule of 100,<ref>[http://www.rblanchard.com/resources/rule100.htm Blanchard Co Rule of 100<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> a generally accepted economic formula for short-line railways, a minimum of 100 freight cars per mile a year is required before a line is profitable due to depreciation accounting. The old E&N route currently averages about 6.6 cars per mile.  The ICF has estimated there is a potential business of 22,000 rail cars of freight each year on Vancouver Island.\n\nAn ICF development strategies report estimated that 35,000 to 40,000 carloads per year, as the amount of business that would be required to bear the full capital cost of upgrading the railroad and maintain operations on a sustainable basis. If the capital costs of upgrading the railway are excluded, the business of 8,000 carloads per year would be required to pay for basic operating and maintenance costs. The most significant potential revenue is the Raven coal mine (located west of Fanny Bay) needing up to 10,000 carloads per year.  The foundation report noted the market potential for sourcing of aggregates like gravel for the Victoria market from alternative reserves up-Island. However, this market would be extremely competitive due to the availability of shipments of aggregate by barge from Lehigh\u2019s facility in Sechelt and the new [[Johnson Street Bridge]] providing barge access to downtown Victoria.<ref>http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/reports_and_studies/Evaluation_ENRailway/Final_Report/Phase_2-Development_Strategies.pdf</ref>\n\nIn November 2014, SVI freight service along the entire Duncan to Parksville segment of the line was suspended following a risk assessment after the disrepair of the track had been continuously slowing train speeds down. No timeline was known for when service will resume.<ref name=\"Island Freight Rail Halted\" />\n\nAs of 2018, the only operational trackage left is a truncated 7 mile strip in the Nanaimo area, servicing the Superior Propane spur in north Nanaimo. \n\nThe ICF is a partnership of the various local governments and First Nations communities along the railway, including 14 municipalities, 5 regional districts and 12 First Nations.\n\n==SVI Rail operator of railway==\nThe Washington company Southern Railway of Vancouver Island (SVI) is the operating railroad for Vancouver Island freight and passenger services, and works under a haulage arrangement with Southern Railway of British Columbia (SRY). SVI provides rail freight services to various customers on Vancouver Island railroad offering connections to the continental railway network. It also operates daily intercity passenger service from Victoria to Courtenay by arrangements with Via Rail Canada.
