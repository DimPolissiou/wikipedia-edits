Matthen ('''May 18th 1890\u2013June 2nd 1960)  was a Member of the Indian Parliament in the first Lok Sabha to be constituted in 1952 after India gained Independence from Britain. He represented the Thiruvalla constituency of Kerala. Matthen was appointed the Indian Ambassador to Sudan after his single term in the Lok Sabha. Before his entry into politics, Matthen was  a businessman with interests in cashew, minerals, insurance, plantations and banking. He was responsible for starting the Alleppey Chamber of Commerce. He was Managing Director of  the Travancore National & Quilon (TN&Q) Bank when it suffered a run of unprecedented length that forced it to close. The bank run was said to have been escalated by Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._P._Ramaswami_Iyer|title=Sir|last=Ramaswami Iyer|first=CP|date=|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, the Dewan of Travancore, in an attempt to reduce the power of the Christian Community who were agitating for fair representation in the governing council of this Princely State. C.P. Matthen was extradited from Madras and imprisoned in Trivandrum, allegedly for balance sheet irregularities. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment but offered many chances to walk free if he would acknowledge guilt. C.P. Matthen refused these offers, maintaining his innocence for more than three years. He became something of a folk hero for his uncompromising stand. He was released on January 22nd 1942 without condition or explanation and returned to Madras.  \n\n== Early life ==\nCP Matthen was born into a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in [[Kavumbhagom]], Thiruvalla. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families, to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and did his Bachelor Of History degree at Madras Christian College (MCC). He completed his education with a Bachelor of Law. \n\n== Insurance and Banking ==\nAt the age of 29, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank with its headquarters in Kollum (Quilon), The Quilon Bank headquarter building was then constructed and completed in 1935. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr [[K. C. Mammen Mappillai|K.C.Mammen Mappillai]], whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism. He was the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper, [[Malayala Manorama]]. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the commercial success of this new venture led them to amalgamate their respective banks in 1937. The registered office remained at the Quilon Bank headquarters in Travancore but the main business of the bank was conducted from its central office in Madras where its primary shareholders were based. Sir CP Ramaswami Iyer <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._P._Ramaswami_Iyer|title=Sir|last=Ramaswami Iyer|first=CP|date=|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, encouraged this arrangement by offering to place Rs 7,000,000 of Travancore treasury money with the merged bank but this offer was never fulfilled.   \n\nThe TN&Q Bank was the fourth-largest bank in India and the largest in South India. It had 75 branches in British India, Travancore, Cochin, the Malabar, Coorg, Mysore and Ceylon:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Association|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.218123|title=The Calcutta Stock Exchange Offical Year Book 1938|date=1938}}</ref> Alleppey, Alwaye, Athirampuzha, Bangalore City, Bangalore Cantt.(South Parade Road), Bangalore Cantt.(Central Street), Bombay, Calcutta, Calicut, Changanacherry, Chirayinkil, Cochin, Coimbatore, Colombo, Coonoor, Cuddapah, Devicolam, Dindigul, Ernakulam, Erode, Galle, Hyderabad, Jaffna, Kandy, Karaikudi, Kayamkulam, Kottayam, Kumbakonam, Madras: Anderson Hall, G.T., Flower Bazaar, Mount Road, Triplicane, Mylapore, Vepery, Thyagarayanagar, Royapettah, Madura, Mangalore, Marthandorn, Mercara, Munnar, Mysore, Nagercoil, New Delhi, Ootacamund, Palghat, Parur, Perumpavoor, Pollachi, Poona, Pudukottah, Quilon, Quilon Sub Office, Rajapalayam, Salem, Secunderabad, Shertallai, Srirangam, Tellicherry, Tenkasi, Tinnevelly, Tinnevelly Junction, Tirupur, Thiruvella, Trichinopoly (25 Lascjar Street), Trichinopoly (Chinnakadai Teppakulam), Trichur, Trippunittura, Trivandrum (Main Road), Trivandrum (Chalai Bazaar), Tuticorin, Udumalpet, Vellore, Virudhunagar, Vizagapatam.  \n\n==Imprisonment==\nTN&Q Bank was established in 1937 with a new Quilon headquarters building which Matthen built at a cost of Rs. 140,000 (a very large sum of money at that time). To retain the business and deposits of the Travancore State, Matthen and Mammen had not only agreed to the headquarters in Travancore but that two of the bank\u2019s directors were the Dewan\u2019s appointees and also that the Bank\u2019s General Manager, a confidant of the Dewan named K. S. Ramanujam, was appointed at the specific recommendation of Sir CP. Despite this initial support from the Travancore Government, within a few months of amalgamation being completed, rumors started making its rounds that the bank was insolvent, and by 1938 there was a run on the bank\u2019s assets \u2013 this was instigated not only by the Dewan but was publicized by the Travancore State\u2019s Department of Publicity. The bank\u2019s financial run concluded with 88% of the public\u2019s deposits being returned by the bank, and the bank becoming insolvent. At this point the trap was sprung, by Sir CP\u2019s administration demanding the extradition of Matthen and Mammen from Madras Presidency to Travancore State to stand trial for defrauding the public. Sir CP also convinced the British Government in Madras that the bank and its directors had been financing the Congress party and the Independence movement, so appeals to the Madras High Court and the Privy Council in London to stay the extradition orders were rejected and 3 directors of the bank including Matthen, Mammen and Mammen\u2019s elder brother and Mammen\u2019s son, were transported in chains from Madras to Quilon to stand trial.\n\nAt the trial in Trivandrum, the erstwhile General Manager of the bank - K. S. Ramanujam, who was the nominee of the Maharaja's government - falsely testified that Mammen and Matthen had defrauded the bank and four directors (including Mammen\u2019s brother and son) were then awarded 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The bank\u2019s remaining assets were liquidated by the State, and the bank\u2019s assets were distributed - mainly to confidants of Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer, one of whom acquired the bank headquarters\u2019 building in Quilon for Rs 15,000 - approximately a tenth of what it had cost to build three years earlier. With the first year in jail, Mammen\u2019s imprisoned elder brother died a broken man. Soon afterwards, Sir CP, who had been an astute lawyer in the colonial administration, being keenly aware of the weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case \u2013 which depended on K. S. Ramanujam who vanished abroad after the trial - sent word to Mammen and Matthen that if they admitted their accused guilt and sought the Maharaja\u2019s mercy they could be pardoned. Mammen and his son, had other major family problems, so they agreed to sign the false declaration but Matthen continued to refuse. Sir CP initially declined to agree to the release without all of three of them admitting guilt, but finally released Mammen and his son on receiving their written \u201cconfessions\u201d. Matthen continued to hold out on his refusal to sign any false confession, despite heavy pressure brought on him through the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abdul Karim, visiting him regularly in jail and suggesting that he sign a letter \u2013 which the IG had drafted, requesting the Maharaja to pardon and release him.\nFinally, on 22nd January 1942, Mr. C. P. Matthen was unconditionally released by the Maharaja's Government without any written or verbal false admission of guilt. The IG, Mr. Abdul Karim, took Matthen in his official car from Travancore jail to his house where his family had waited patiently for his release from jail.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nMr. C. P. Matthen was a member of the First [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament) in 1952, representing [[Mavelikara]] Constituency of [[Kerala]].\n\n==Lok Sabha Member and Ambassador==\nHe was elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1953, from Mavelikera constitutioncy in Kerala by one of the largest majorities of that election.  \n\nAfter completing his term in the [[Lok Sabha]], in 1957, he was appointed as the Indian Ambassador to [[Sudan]]. He retired a year later due to health reasons caused by his years of imprisonment in Trivandrum.\n\n==Death==\nDied on 2 June 1960 in [[Paris]], \u00cele-de-France, France and buried at [[Thiruvalla]], Kerala, India.<ref name=\"geni\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Chalakuzhy-Poulose-Matthen-C-P-Matthen/6000000006434764012|title=Matthen (1890 - 1960) - Genealogy|publisher=geni.com|accessdate=2015-11-09}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Hard Copy==\n# N.M.Mathew, ''History of the Mar Thoma Church'', (Malayalam), Vol 3, 2008. page 75\n#''Chalakuzhy Kudumba Charitram'', Thomas Mathew (ed.) 1987.\n\n==External links==\n#{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/10/07/stories/2009100759851300.htm|title=C.P.

It was launched in support of her sixth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007) and ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008), respectively. Rumors of a tour arose as early as October 2007, after ''Blackout'' was released; however, it was canceled due to unknown reasons. The tour was officially announced in December 2008, with dates for American and British venues revealed. The stage was composed of three rings and set in-the-round to resemble an actual circus. Fashion designers [[Dean and Dan Caten]] created the costumes. A giant cylinder screen was set above the stage to showcase videos and backdrops. Effects were provided by Solotech. [[Magician (paranormal)|Magician]] [[Ed Alonzo]] joined Spears during the second act. The setlist was composed generally from her albums ''[[In the Zone]]'', ''Blackout'' and ''Circus''. Spears announced she would tour Australia for the first time in June 2009.\n\nThe tour, described as a \"pop extravaganza\", was divided into five segments: ''[[Circus]]'' featured a metamorphosis of Spears from as a [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] to a slave, while being surrounded by different performers; ''[[Funhouse|House of Fun (Anything Goes)]]'' displayed a series of upbeat numbers with different themes, including magic and military; ''[[Freak show|Freakshow]]\u2014[[Peep show|Peepshow]]'' with dark and sexual performances; and  ''[[Electronic music|Electro Circ]]'' displayed energetic dance routines, and the encore consisted of a video montage of Spears's music videos and a police-themed performance.\n\nThe Circus Starring Britney Spears generated positive to mixed reviews from critics. While some praised its aesthetics and deemed it as an entertaining show, others criticized Spears' lack of involvement during some segments. However, the tour was a commercial success, with a total gross of $131.8&nbsp;million, making it one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours#2000s|highest-grossing tours of the decade]]. A great number of tickets were sold within a week of the tour's announcement, which prompted supporters to add more dates. The tour also broke attendance records in many cities and all the North American shows were sold out. It became the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2009 and Spears' highest-grossing tour. The show generated controversy on the Australian leg after a reporter said that a great number of fans had walked out during the performances.\n\n==Background==\nOn September 9, 2007, Spears performed \"[[Gimme More]]\", the lead single from her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007) at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]].

[[Front of house]] engineer Blake Suib explained that, \"[Me] and Solotech were asked to come up with a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [Spears] expects and that we were looking for\". The [[public address]] (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the [[loudspeaker|speaker]]s were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by [[Meyer Sound Laboratories]], including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with [[amplifier]]s also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 [[subwoofer]]s positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use [[in-ear monitor]]s; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages.

It was launched in support of her sixth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]''(2007) and ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008), respectively. Rumors of a tour arose as early as October 2007, after ''Blackout'' was released; however, it was canceled due to unknown reasons. The tour was officially announced in December 2008, with dates for American and British venues revealed. The stage was composed of three rings and set in-the-round to resemble an actual circus. Fashion designers [[Dean and Dan Caten]] created the costumes. A giant cylinder screen was set above the stage to showcase videos and backdrops. Effects were provided by Solotech. [[Magician (paranormal)|Magician]] [[Ed Alonzo]] joined Spears during the second act. The setlist was composed generally from her albums ''[[In the Zone]]'', ''Blackout'' and ''Circus''. Spears announced she would tour Australia for the first time in June 2009.\n\nThe tour, described as a \"pop extravaganza\", was divided into five segments: ''[[Circus]]'' featured a metamorphosis of Spears from as a [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] to a slave, while being surrounded by different performers; ''[[Funhouse|House of Fun (Anything Goes)]]'' displayed a series of upbeat numbers with different themes, including magic and military; ''[[Freak show|Freakshow]]\u2014[[Peep show|Peepshow]]'' with dark and sexual performances; and  ''[[Electronic music|Electro Circ]]'' displayed energetic dance routines, and the encore consisted of a video montage of Spears's music videos and a police-themed performance.\n\nThe Circus Starring Britney Spears generated positive to mixed reviews from critics. While some praised its aesthetics and deemed it as an entertaining show, others criticized Spears' lack of involvement during some segments. However, the tour was a commercial success, with a total gross of $131.8&nbsp;million, making it one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours#2000s|highest-grossing tours of the decade]]. A great number of tickets were sold within a week of the tour's announcement, which prompted supporters to add more dates. The tour also broke attendance records in many cities and all the North American shows were sold out. It became the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2009 and Spears' highest-grossing tour. The show generated controversy on the Australian leg after a reporter said that a great number of fans had walked out during the performances.\n\n==Background==\nOn September 9, 2007, Spears performed \"[[Gimme More]]\", the lead single from her fifth studio album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007) at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]]. Her last live performance had been during [[The M+M's Tour]] in May of the same year.<ref name=hob>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1558527/20070502/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney's Back!

The backdrops & projection content were designed by Dirk Decloedt. There were three new film sequences shot exclusively for the tour: an opening video featuring Perez Hilton, a video of Spears set to [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s \"[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)#Marilyn Manson cover|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]\" and a final montage. The three videos were created by Veneno. [[Theatrical property|Props]], including swings, couches, unicycles, stripper poles, a gold cage and giant picture frames, were designed by ShowFX Inc.; they also provided custom VIP couch seating that lined the perimeter of the stage. VYV provided the video control, which included two [[Photon]] Show media servers and two Photon Controllers. The servers took timecode for the show and wrapped the images around the Stealth screen. Emric Epstein of VYV explained, \"The servers and software permits us to control a large number of video layers on the 360\u02da [[LED]] screen, composite the layers in realtime, and transform the final output so that everything look seamless after going through the LED controllers.

[[Front of house]] engineer Blake Suib explained that, \"[Me] and Solotech were asked to come up with a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [Spears] expects and that we were looking for\". The [[public address]] (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the [[loudspeaker|speaker]]s were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by [[Meyer Sound Laboratories]], including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with [[amplifier]]s also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 [[subwoofer]]s positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use [[in-ear monitor]]s; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to a [[dance club]].<ref name=fohonline>{{cite news|url=http://fohonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2747&Itemid=69|title=Blake Suib Runs Away and Joins the Circus |date=|accessdate=January 29, 2010|last=Evans|first=Bill|work=[[Front of House Magazine]]}}</ref> Solotech provided the lighting package, including a mostly [[Vari-Lite]] rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck.

Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe [[followspot]] with scroller under [[DMX (music)|DMX]] control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color [[Strobe light|strobes]] and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the lighting package.
