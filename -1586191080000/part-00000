'Mwene Nyaga' in Kikuyu language can also translate as the \"Owner of the Striped one\" where 'Mwene' translates to 'owner', and 'Nyaga' to Stripes. The snow (in Kikuyu: Ira) caps of the mountain symbolically represent a crown on God's habitation .  'Nyaga' can also translate to 'Ostrich'.

The majority of the exploration until after the [[First World War]] was by [[settler]]s in Kenya, who were not on scientific expeditions. A [[Church of Scotland]] [[mission (Christian)|mission]] was set up in [[Chogoria]], and several Scottish missionaries ascended to the peaks, including [[John Arthur|Rev Dr. J. W. Arthur]], G. Dennis and A. R. Barlow. There were other ascents, but none succeeded in summitting Batian or Nelion.<ref name=mck/>\n\nNew approach routes were cleared through the forest, which made access to the peaks area far easier. In 1920, Arthur and Sir Fowell Buxton tried to cut a route in from the south, and other routes came in from [[Nanyuki]] in the north, but the most commonly used was the route from the Chogoria mission in the east, built by Ernest Carr. Carr is also credited with building Urumandi and Top Huts.<ref name=mck/>\n\nOn 6 January 1929 the first ascent of Nelion was made by [[Percy Wyn-Harris]] and [[Eric Shipton]]. They climbed the Normal Route, then descended to the Gate of Mists before ascending Batian. On 8 January they reascended, this time with G. A. Sommerfelt, and in December Shipton made another ascent with R. E. G. Russell. They also made the first ascent of Point John. During this year the [[Mountain Club of East Africa]] was formed.<ref name=mck/>\n\nAt the end of July 1930, Shipton and [[Bill Tilman]] made the first traverse of the peaks. They ascended by the West Ridge of Batian, traversed the Gate of Mists to Nelion, and descended the Normal Route. During this trip, Shipton and Tilman made first ascents of several other peaks, including Point Peter, Point Dutton, Midget Peak, Point Pigott and either Terere or Sendeyo.<ref name=cordee>{{cite book\n|last= Burns\n|first= Cameron\n|title= Kilimanjaro & Mount Kenya; A Climbing and Trekking Guide\n|year= 1998\n|publisher= Cordee\n|location= Leicester\n|isbn= 978-1-871890-98-3}}</ref>\n\n===1931 to present day===\nIn the early 1930s there were several visits to the moorlands around Mount Kenya, with fewer as far as the peaks. Raymond Hook and [[Humphrey Slade]] ascended to map the mountain, and stocked several of the streams with trout. By 1938 there had been several more ascents of Nelion. In February, Miss C Carroll and Mtu Muthara became the first woman and [[Africa]]n respectively to ascend Nelion, in an expedition with Noel Symington, author of ''[[The Night Climbers of Cambridge]]'', and on 5 March Miss Una Cameron became the first woman to ascend Batian.<ref name=mck/>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] there was another drop in ascents of the mountain. The most remarkable ascent during this period was by three [[Italy|Italians]] who were being held in a British [[prisoner of war|POW]] camp at the base of the mountain in Nanyuki. They escaped from camp to climb the mountain's third peak, Point Lenana, before \"escaping\" back into camp.

There is a bolted abseil descent route off Nelion.<ref name=mck/>\n\nMount Kenya's climbing seasons are a result of its location only {{convert|20|km|mi||abbr=on}} from the equator. During the northern summer the rock routes on the north side of the peak are in good summer condition, while at the same time the ice routes on the south side of the peak are prime shape. The situation is reversed during the southern summer. The two seasons are separated by several months of rainy season before and after, during which climbing conditions are generally unfavorable.\n\nMount Kenya is home to several good ice routes, the two most famous being the Diamond Couloir and the Ice Window route. Snow and ice levels on the mountain have been retreating at an accelerated rate in recent years, making these climbs increasingly difficult and dangerous. The Diamond Couloir, a steep ice couloir fed by the fusion of the upper Diamond Glacier and pioneered in 1975 by Yvon Chouinard and Michael Covington, was once climbable in summer or winter but now is virtually unclimbable in summer conditions and is seldom deemed in climbable condition even in winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.climbing.com/news/hotflashes/diamondclimbed/ | title=Diamond Couloir Still Climbable | accessdate=11 July 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119021555/http://www.climbing.com/news/hotflashes/diamondclimbed/ | archive-date=19 January 2011 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Last climbing reports describe the route very difficult, especially in the lower section. The route has changed into a modern ice climb with a very difficult 60m first pitch, starting with 8m of overhanging M7 dry tooling, followed by 50m of USA Grade V ice and by others 6 pitches of moderate climbing on good ice and finally one pitch of water ice USA Grade IV+ ice at the headwall before getting to the Upper Diamond Glacier.\n\nThe satellite peaks around the mountain also provide good climbs. These can be climbed in [[Alpinism|Alpine style]] and vary in difficulty from a scramble to climbing at UIAA grade VI. They are useful for acclimatisation before climbing the higher peaks and as ascents in their own right.<ref name=mck/>\n\n===Walking routes===\n[[File:Mount Kenya Climbing Routes and Huts photomap-en.svg|thumb|right|Map showing the walking routes and huts around Mount Kenya]]\nThere are [[Mountaineering on Mount Kenya#Walking routes|eight walking routes]] up to the main peaks.

'Mwene Nyaga' in Kikuyu language can also translate as the \"Owner of the Striped one\" where 'Mwene' translates to 'owner', and 'Nyaga' to Stripes. The snow (in Kikuyu: Ira) caps of the mountain symbolically represent a crown on God's habitation .  'Nyaga' can also translate to 'Ostrich'.

The north-eastern side of the mountain has many old volcanic plugs and craters. The largest of these, Ithanguni, even had its own ice cap when the main peaks were covered in ice. This can be seen by the smoothed summit of the peak. Circular hills with steep sides are also frequent in this area, which are probably the remains of small plugged [[volcanic vent|vent]]s.

This expedition was traveling from the coast to [[Lake Baringo]] in the Rift Valley, and was led by [[John Walter Gregory|Dr John W Gregory]], a British [[geologist]]. They managed to ascend the mountain to around {{convert|4730|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, and spent several hours on the Lewis Glacier with their [[guide]]. On his return to Britain, Gregory published [[Academic publishing|papers]] and a [[narrative]] account of his achievements.<ref name=mck/>\n\nGeorge Kolb, a German [[physician]], made expeditions in 1894 and 1896<ref name=mck/> and was the first to reach the moorlands on the east side of the mountain.

The country they passed through was full of [[Infectious disease|plague]] and [[famine]]. Many Kikuyu porters tried to desert with women from the villages, and others stole from the villages, which made the [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] very hostile towards the expedition. When they reached the [[base camp]] on 18 August,<ref name=mackinder/> they could not find any food, suffered two of their party killed by the local people, and eventually had to send Saunders to [[Naivasha]] to get help from [[Captain Gorges]], the Government Officer there.<ref name=mackinder/>\n\nMackinder pushed on up the mountain, and established a camp at {{convert|3142|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}<ref name=mackinder/> in the H\u00f6hnel Valley. He made his first attempt on the summit on 30 August with Ollier and Brocherel up the south east face, but they had to retreat when they were within {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} of the summit of Nelion due to nightfall.\n\nOn 5 September, Hausberg, Ollier, and Brocherel made a circuit of the main peaks looking for an easier route to the summit. They could not find one. On 11 September Ollier and Brocherel made an ascent of the Darwin Glacier, but were forced to retreat due to a [[blizzard]].<ref name=mackinder/>\n\nWhen Saunders returned from Naivasha with the relief party, Mackinder had another attempt at the summit with Ollier and Brocherel. They traversed the Lewis Glacier and climbed the south east face of Nelion. They spent the night near the [[gendarme (mountaineering)|gendarme]], and traversed the [[snowfield]] at the head of the Darwin Glacier at dawn before cutting steps up the Diamond Glacier. They reached the summit of Batian at noon on 13 September, and descended by the same route.<ref name=mackinder/>\n\n===1900\u20131930===\n[[Image:Mt kenya point john showing couloir.jpg|thumb|Shipton and Russell made the first ascent of Point John up the south-east gully in 1929]]\nAfter the first ascent of Mount Kenya there were fewer expeditions there for a while. The majority of the exploration until after the [[First World War]] was by [[settler]]s in Kenya, who were not on scientific expeditions. A [[Church of Scotland]] [[mission (Christian)|mission]] was set up in [[Chogoria]], and several Scottish missionaries ascended to the peaks, including [[John Arthur|Rev Dr. J. W. Arthur]], G. Dennis and A. R. Barlow. There were other ascents, but none succeeded in summitting Batian or Nelion.<ref name=mck/>\n\nNew approach routes were cleared through the forest, which made access to the peaks area far easier. In 1920, Arthur and Sir Fowell Buxton tried to cut a route in from the south, and other routes came in from [[Nanyuki]] in the north, but the most commonly used was the route from the Chogoria mission in the east, built by Ernest Carr. Carr is also credited with building Urumandi and Top Huts.<ref name=mck/>\n\nOn 6 January 1929 the first ascent of Nelion was made by [[Percy Wyn-Harris]] and [[Eric Shipton]]. They climbed the Normal Route, then descended to the Gate of Mists before ascending Batian. On 8 January they reascended, this time with G. A. Sommerfelt, and in December Shipton made another ascent with R. E. G. Russell. They also made the first ascent of Point John. During this year the [[Mountain Club of East Africa]] was formed.<ref name=mck/>\n\nAt the end of July 1930, Shipton and [[Bill Tilman]] made the first traverse of the peaks. They ascended by the West Ridge of Batian, traversed the Gate of Mists to Nelion, and descended the Normal Route. During this trip, Shipton and Tilman made first ascents of several other peaks, including Point Peter, Point Dutton, Midget Peak, Point Pigott and either Terere or Sendeyo.<ref name=cordee>{{cite book\n|last= Burns\n|first= Cameron\n|title= Kilimanjaro & Mount Kenya; A Climbing and Trekking Guide\n|year= 1998\n|publisher= Cordee\n|location= Leicester\n|isbn= 978-1-871890-98-3}}</ref>\n\n===1931 to present day===\nIn the early 1930s there were several visits to the moorlands around Mount Kenya, with fewer as far as the peaks. Raymond Hook and [[Humphrey Slade]] ascended to map the mountain, and stocked several of the streams with trout. By 1938 there had been several more ascents of Nelion. In February, Miss C Carroll and Mtu Muthara became the first woman and [[Africa]]n respectively to ascend Nelion, in an expedition with Noel Symington, author of ''[[The Night Climbers of Cambridge]]'', and on 5 March Miss Una Cameron became the first woman to ascend Batian.<ref name=mck/>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] there was another drop in ascents of the mountain. The most remarkable ascent during this period was by three [[Italy|Italians]] who were being held in a British [[prisoner of war|POW]] camp at the base of the mountain in Nanyuki. They escaped from camp to climb the mountain's third peak, Point Lenana, before \"escaping\" back into camp.

During the northern summer the rock routes on the north side of the peak are in good summer condition, while at the same time the ice routes on the south side of the peak are prime shape. The situation is reversed during the southern summer. The two seasons are separated by several months of rainy season before and after, during which climbing conditions are generally unfavorable.\n\nMount Kenya is home to several good ice routes, the two most famous being the Diamond Couloir and the Ice Window route. Snow and ice levels on the mountain have been retreating at an accelerated rate in recent years, making these climbs increasingly difficult and dangerous. The Diamond Couloir, a steep ice couloir fed by the fusion of the upper Diamond Glacier and pioneered in 1975 by Yvon Chouinard and Michael Covington, was once climbable in summer or winter but now is virtually unclimbable in summer conditions and is seldom deemed in climbable condition even in winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.climbing.com/news/hotflashes/diamondclimbed/ | title=Diamond Couloir Still Climbable | accessdate=11 July 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119021555/http://www.climbing.com/news/hotflashes/diamondclimbed/ | archive-date=19 January 2011 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Last climbing reports describe the route very difficult, especially in the lower section. The route has changed into a modern ice climb with a very difficult 60m first pitch, starting with 8m of overhanging M7 dry tooling, followed by 50m of USA Grade V ice and by others 6 pitches of moderate climbing on good ice and finally one pitch of water ice USA Grade IV+ ice at the headwall before getting to the Upper Diamond Glacier.\n\nThe satellite peaks around the mountain also provide good climbs. These can be climbed in [[Alpinism|Alpine style]] and vary in difficulty from a scramble to climbing at UIAA grade VI. They are useful for acclimatisation before climbing the higher peaks and as ascents in their own right.<ref name=mck/>\n\n===Walking routes===\n[[File:Mount Kenya Climbing Routes and Huts photomap-en.svg|thumb|right|Map showing the walking routes and huts around Mount Kenya]]\nThere are [[Mountaineering on Mount Kenya#Walking routes|eight walking routes]] up to the main peaks.
