In 1942 the library became a member of the [[Miami-Dade Public Library System]].

According to historical records, Miss Ada Merritt arrived in Lemon City in the 1890's to serve as a school teacher and establish the first \"school library\" in Lemon City. As Lemon City's population continued to rise, citizens living in Lemon City began to form their own cultural engagement groups in order to bring more life to the city, and to improve life in the city as a whole. One such group was created by Ada Merritt, coined the \"Busy Bees of the Everglades\" this group of young women came together to raise money for the fledgling school library collection. Through the group's efforts, the collection grew over a period of several years to reach the sizable amount of 400 volumes. Between 1892 and 1893, Ada Merritt and the Busy Bees coordinated various functions, from dances to formal dinners, in an effort to raise money and continue funding and supporting the growing library. The Tropical Sun newspaper, the first newspaper published in the area, features an article dated May 6, 1893 that describes Miss Ada Merritt's school library and the delivery of new books for the collection. There is no mention of another library established in Lemon City during the early years of Ada Merritt's school library.\n\nIn 1896, the Village Improvement Association (V.I.A.) came together in the home of Mrs. Cornelia Keys with the aim to improve roads going in and out of Lemon City.  Before the roads were laid, residents and travelers journeying through Lemon City and beyond were forced to traverse rocky roads, mud, and swamps. Paved roads required hard labor and funds; through the V.I.A.'s efforts, fully functional, easily traversable roads started to become a reality. In 1902, Dade County took on the task of overseeing road construction in and out of Lemon City, and funded such projects through the selling of bonds, leaving the V.I.A in need of a new mission.\n\nIn 1902, thirteen women came together once more in the home of Cornelia Keys; the V.I.A. was disbanded and a new group formed a library association. These thirteen women, many of whom were former members of the V.I.A., went on to become the motivating force behind the creation of the first recorded public library in Lemon City. Following the example set by the Busy Bees over a decade before the library association's formation, the group started to host fundraising events to support the library initiative. It was at this time that Cornelia Keys' residence began to serve as the base for the town's library. For the next three years, until 1905, the thirteen members of the library association agreed to pay monthly member dues, donate books, and take books home, much like a traditional circulating library at the time.\n\n[[File:Lemon City Library plaque.jpg|thumb|The Lemon City Library plaque commemorating the location of the original library. The site is currently adjacent to the where the current library is located.]]\n\nDuring this time, the library association's valiant effort served to grow the number of monetary contributions received through fundraising events, as well as the available number of furnishings and books for the collection itself. Construction of the library began in 1904 and found a home at 412 N.E. 61st Street in Lemon City. The formal dedication ceremony for Lemon's City Public Library took place on January 13, 1905. The library served Lemon City residents for several decades, and became part of the Miami-Dade Public Library System in 1942. In 1963, the library was scheduled to close and after a fire caused severe damage to the structure; it was decided that a new Lemon City Public Library would be built. On April 13, 1964, the newly built Lemon City Public Library officially opened and has remained open at its current location ever since.

He is a pioneer in the field of sustainable agriculture, having designed and developed both the [[Science Barge]] in Yonkers, NY and the [http://www.miamisciencebarge.org Miami Science Barge], urban farming prototypes that address vegetable and fish production, respectively. Caplow has also patented a Vertically Integrated Greenhouse. As an academic, Caplow has published a series of peer-reviewed articles on water containment dynamics in the Hudson River Estuary. He has founded or co-founded five companies in the area of applied science and sustainable technology: [[New York Sun Works|NY Sun Works]] (2004), [[BrightFarms]]<ref>[https://www.brightfarms.com/ BrightFarms]</ref> (2008), [http://fishnavy.com/ Fish Navy Films] (2010), CappSci (2014), and [https://www.grayscalemiami.com Grayscale Partners] (2017). Caplow created Grayscale with frequent collaborator Nathalie Manzano to pursue design consulting and development opportunities in sustainable real estate, ecological technology, and long-term risk management.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nTed Caplow was born Theodore Caplow, Jr. in New York City in 1969 to Anne Christine Allen and [[Theodore Caplow (sociologist)|Theodore Caplow]]. His father, also known as Ted Caplow, is a well-known American sociologist and author of over 20 books in the social sciences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Theodore-Caplow/e/B001HOVYQC/|title=Works authored by Theodore Caplow|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nCaplow grew up in central Virginia and attended boarding school in Massachusetts, where he was fascinated by the advent of the personal computer. He entered [[Harvard University]] intending to major in physics but graduated ''cum laude'' with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1992. Following college, Caplow, together with his father and other family members, sailed a 47 foot boat from New York City to Cyprus, further stimulating his interest in nature, science, and engineering.\n\nHe received an M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1998 from [[Princeton University]], where his interest in renewable energy was fostered by [[Robert H. Socolow]] and [[Daniel Kammen]] and where he received a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. Caplow\u2019s thesis at Princeton was an extended design modeling and optimization project for a solar thermal \u201cpower tower\u201d that explored the feasibility of employing gas turbines in these designs.

Similar to the Science Barge in NY, it is off grid and has a focus on sustainability. The Miami Science Barge though, also concentrates on marine ecology and conservation in Biscayne Bay, and emphasized clean aquaculture for the domestic production of seafood.\n\n=== Vertically Integrated Greenhouse ===\nCaplow invented the Vertically Integrated Greenhouse (VIG) with Zakery Ward Adams.  The invention is listed as Patent US20090307973 and was published in December 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US8151518|title=Patent US8151518 - Vertically integrated greenhouse|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>  The VIG consists of vertically stacked plant trays that can be moved to maximize plant light capture and shade as necessary.  In addition to the trays and suspension system, the VIG system includes a water distribution system which consists of a reservoir, a pump, and a water supply tube for growing plants hydroponically.  The reservoir holds excess water for recirculation making the system a closed-loop.  According to the patent abstract, \u201cthe design is particularly well-suited for installation in a double-skin fa\u00e7ade of a building, or in an interior atrium, lobby, or similar structure.\u201d Caplow and Adams built and installed prototypes of the VIG on the [[Science Barge]] (2008), at PS 333 in Manhattan (2010),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ps333.org/greenhouse/|title=NY Sun Works|work=PS 333 MANHATTAN SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN|accessdate=7 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103055143/http://www.ps333.org/greenhouse/|archivedate=3 January 2015}}</ref> and at PS 89 in Brooklyn (2011),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nysunworks.org/projects/the-greenhouse-project-at-ps89|title=New York Sun Works: PS89 Cypress Hills Community School|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> and Caplow built an improved VIG at the Miami Museum of Science (2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamisci.org/blog/hydroponics-grow-plants-without-soil/|title=Hydroponics: Growing Plants without Soil|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> The next VIG is slated for PS 84 in Brooklyn, NY (2015).\n\n=== BrightFarms ===\nCaplow has also assisted in the design of many sustainable greenhouse projects, including the Sun Works Center at PS 333, the first full-scale rooftop greenhouse completed as part of a NY Sun Works campaign to build 100 school greenhouses in New York City between 2010 and 2020.   From 2008 to 2011, through design consultancy BrightFarm Systems, he contributed to the design of a 10,000 sq ft. greenhouse built on top of the Forest Houses apartment complex in South Bronx, NY,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.pitchengine.com/brightfarmsystems/brightfarm-systems-designs-worlds-first-sustainable-rooftop-greenhouse-integrated-on-an-affordable-housing-development-south-bronx-ny-1|title=BrightFarm Systems Designs World's First Sustainable Rooftop Greenhouse Integrated On An Affordable Housing Development, South Bronx, NY|work=PitchEngine|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> an in-store hydroponic greenhouse constructed at Whole Foods Market in Millburn, NJ,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityfarmer.info/2009/06/10/brightfarm-systems-develops-futuristic-urban-agriculture-projects/|title=BrightFarm Systems develops futuristic urban agriculture projects|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> and a rooftop greenhouse at P.S. 89 in Brooklyn, NY. Many other design studies in [[Building Integrated Agriculture|Building-integrated Agriculture]] (a term Caplow coined in 2007) were executed for clients around the world, although many of these remain unbuilt due to downturns in the global real estate market. Prominent architectural and engineering firms who collaborated on design studies with BrightFarms while Caplow led the firm include Kiss + Cathcart, Skidmore Owings & Merrill, Grimshaw, Foster & Co, and Arup, among others.\n\nIn 2011 Caplow partnered with Paul Lightfoot to reformulate [[BrightFarms]] Systems as a full service commercial farming company named BrightFarms. Growing vegetables under long term contract to supermarket clients, BrightFarms designs, finances, builds, owns, and operates greenhouses as large as three acres, nationwide. The company has raised over $50 million in capital as of early 2018 and operates greenhouses in four states.\n\n== Work on Child Mortality ==\n=== The Children\u2019s Prize ===\nIn 2011, Caplow and former New York City Ballet dancer [[Pascale van Kipnis Caplow]] founded the Whole New World Foundation.

His father, also known as Ted Caplow, is a well-known American sociologist and author of over 20 books in the social sciences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Theodore-Caplow/e/B001HOVYQC/|title=Works authored by Theodore Caplow|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nCaplow grew up in central Virginia and attended boarding school in Massachusetts, where he was fascinated by the advent of the personal computer. He entered [[Harvard University]] intending to major in physics but graduated ''cum laude'' with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1992. Following college, Caplow, together with his father and other family members, sailed a 47 foot boat from New York City to Cyprus, further stimulating his interest in nature, science, and engineering.\n\nHe received an M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1998 from [[Princeton University]], where his interest in renewable energy was fostered by [[Robert H. Socolow]] and [[Daniel Kammen]] and where he received a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. Caplow\u2019s thesis at Princeton was an extended design modeling and optimization project for a solar thermal \u201cpower tower\u201d that explored the feasibility of employing gas turbines in these designs. Caplow completed his Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering in 2004 at [[Columbia University]], where he was influenced by Peter Schlosser, Vijay Modi, [[Klaus Lackner]], and Upmanu Lall, among others.

Many other design studies in [[Building Integrated Agriculture|Building-integrated Agriculture]] (a term Caplow coined in 2007) were executed for clients around the world, although many of these remain unbuilt due to downturns in the global real estate market.

Growing vegetables under long term contract to supermarket clients, BrightFarms designs, finances, builds, owns, and operates greenhouses as large as three acres, nationwide. The company has raised over $50 million in capital as of early 2018 and operates greenhouses in four states.\n\n== Work on Child Mortality ==\n=== The Children\u2019s Prize ===\nIn 2011, Caplow and former New York City Ballet dancer [[Pascale van Kipnis Caplow]] founded the Whole New World Foundation.
