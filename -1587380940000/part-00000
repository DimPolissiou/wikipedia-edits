In 1656, the [[Dutch East India company]] conquered [[Portuguese Ceylon]] from the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]], and the name eventually corrupted to \"Comorin\" and was called ''Cape Comorin'' during [[British Raj|British rule in India]]. The city was later renamed ''Kanyakumari'' by the [[Government of India]] and the [[Madras State|Government of Madras]].\n\n===Legend ===\nAccording to a Hindu legend, [[Kanya Devi]], an [[avatar]] of Parvati, was to marry [[Shiva]], who failed to show up on his wedding day. Rice and other grains meant for the wedding feast remained uncooked and unused.<ref name=\"Legends of Kanya Kumari- Amritapuri\"/> As the legend goes, the uncooked grains turned into stones as time went by. Some believe that the small stones on the shore today, which look like rice, are indeed grains from the wedding that was never solemnised. [[Kanya Devi]] is now considered a virgin goddess who blesses pilgrims and tourists who flock the town. Her temple located in Kanyakumari is a [[Shakti Peetha]] or a holy shrine. \nAccording to another Hindu legend, [[Hanuman|Lord Hanuman]] dropped a piece of earth as he was carrying a mountain with his life-saving herb, Mrita Sanjivani, from the Himalayas to Lanka ([[Sri Lanka]]) during the Rama-Ravana war. This chunk of earth is called [[Marunthuvazh Malai]], literally \"hills where medicine lives\".  This is said to be the reason for the abundance of unique native medicinal plants in the area. Marunthuvazh Malai is located near Kottaram about {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Kanyakumari town on the Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway. The sage [[Agasthya]], who was an expert in medicinal herbs, is believed to have lived around this site in ancient days. It is believed to be the reason so many medicinal herbs are found on the hills near Kanyakumari. A nearby village is named [[Agastheeswaram]] after the sage. Today, there is a small [[ashram]] on the middle of the Maruthuvazh Malai hill, which tourists visit (after a short trek from the base of the hill), both to visit the Ashram and also to take a glimpse of the sea near Kanyakumari a few kilometres away, and the greenery below.<ref name=\"Legends of Kanya Kumari- Amritapuri\">{{cite web |url= http://www.amritapuri.org/3687/kanya-kumari.aum |title= Legends of Kanya Kumari |publisher= Amritapuri |date=8 February 2000 |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAs per the Census of 2011, Kanyakumari District had 48.65% [[Hindus]], 4.20% [[Muslims]], 46.85% [[Christians]].<ref name=religion2011>{{cite web|title=Population By Religious Community - Tamil Nadu|year=2011|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/population_enumeration.html|format=XLS|publisher=Office of The Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India}}</ref>\n\n{{bar box|title= Religion Data - Census 2011 - Kanyakumari District|titlebar=#ddd|left1=Religion|right1=Percent(%)|float=left|bars={{bar percent|[[Hinduism|Hindu]]|Orange|48.65}}{{bar percent|[[Islam|Muslim]]|Green|4.20}}{{bar percent|[[Christianity|Christian]]|purple|46.85}}{{bar percent|Other|grey|0.30}}}}\n\nAs of the census of India 2001, Kanyakumari had a population of 19,739, comprising 9,884 males and 9,855 females, making the sex ratio (number of females per thousand males) of the town to 997.

In 1656, the [[Dutch East India company]] conquered [[Portuguese Ceylon]] from the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]], and the name eventually corrupted to \"Comorin\" and was called ''Cape Comorin'' during [[British Raj|British rule in India]]. The city was later renamed ''Kanyakumari'' by the [[Government of India]] and the [[Madras State|Government of Madras]].\n\n===Legend ===\nAccording to a Hindu legend, [[Kanya Devi]], an [[avatar]] of Parvati, was to marry [[Shiva]], who failed to show up on his wedding day. Rice and other grains meant for the wedding feast remained uncooked and unused.<ref name=\"Legends of Kanya Kumari- Amritapuri\"/> As the legend goes, the uncooked grains turned into stones as time went by. Some believe that the small stones on the shore today, which look like rice, are indeed grains from the wedding that was never solemnised. [[Kanya Devi]] is now considered a virgin goddess who blesses pilgrims and tourists who flock the town. Her temple located in Kanyakumari is a [[Shakti Peetha]] or a holy shrine. \nAccording to another Hindu legend, [[Hanuman|Lord Hanuman]] dropped a piece of earth as he was carrying a mountain with his life-saving herb, Mrita Sanjivani, from the Himalayas to Lanka ([[Sri Lanka]]) during the Rama-Ravana war. This chunk of earth is called [[Marunthuvazh Malai]], literally \"hills where medicine lives\".  This is said to be the reason for the abundance of unique native medicinal plants in the area. Marunthuvazh Malai is located near Kottaram about {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Kanyakumari town on the Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway. The sage [[Agasthya]], who was an expert in medicinal herbs, is believed to have lived around this site in ancient days. It is believed to be the reason so many medicinal herbs are found on the hills near Kanyakumari. A nearby village is named [[Agastheeswaram]] after the sage. Today, there is a small [[ashram]] on the middle of the Maruthuvazh Malai hill, which tourists visit (after a short trek from the base of the hill), both to visit the Ashram and also to take a glimpse of the sea near Kanyakumari a few kilometres away, and the greenery below.<ref name=\"Legends of Kanya Kumari- Amritapuri\">{{cite web |url= http://www.amritapuri.org/3687/kanya-kumari.aum |title= Legends of Kanya Kumari |publisher= Amritapuri |date=8 February 2000 |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAs per the Census of 2011, Kanyakumari District had 48.65% [[Hindus]], 4.20% [[Muslims]], 46.85% [[Christians]].<ref name=religion2011>{{cite web|title=Population By Religious Community - Tamil Nadu|year=2011|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/population_enumeration.html|format=XLS|publisher=Office of The Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India}}</ref>\n\n{{bar box|title= Religion Data - Census 2011 - Kanyakumari District|titlebar=#ddd|left1=Religion|right1=Percent(%)|float=left|bars={{bar percent|[[Hinduism|Hindu]]|Orange|48.65}}{{bar percent|[[Islam|Muslim]]|Green|4.20}}{{bar percent|[[Christianity|Christian]]|purple|46.85}}{{bar percent|Other|grey|0.30}}}}\n\nAs of the census of India 2001, Kanyakumari had a population of 19,739, comprising 9,884 males and 9,855 females, making the sex ratio (number of females per thousand males) of the town to 997.
