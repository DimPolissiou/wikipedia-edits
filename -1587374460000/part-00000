This role is important in chronic inflammation, as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils, which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age (see [[CD31]] for a description of this process).<ref name=\"Macro17082013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.corne.mx/estudios/Sportvis/5.pdf|title=Inflammation in Wound Repair: Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms|author=Sabine A.

Within the phagolysosome, [[enzymes]] and toxic peroxides digest the pathogen. However, some bacteria, such as ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', have become resistant to these methods of digestion.

Along with [[dendritic cells]], they are foremost among the cells that [[Antigen presentation|present antigens]], a crucial role in initiating an immune response. As secretory cells, monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ([[monokine]]s) including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as [[interleukin-1]]. At the same time, they carry receptors for [[lymphokine]]s that allow them to be \"activated\" into single-minded pursuit of microbes and tumour cells.\n\nAfter digesting a pathogen, a macrophage will present the [[antigen]] (a molecule, most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen and used by the immune system for identification) of the pathogen to the corresponding [[helper T cell]]. The presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] class II molecule (MHCII), indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen, despite having antigens on its surface.\n\nEventually, the antigen presentation results in the production of [[antibody|antibodies]] that attach to the antigens of pathogens, making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose. In some cases, pathogens are very resistant to adhesion by the macrophages.\n\nThe antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages (in the context of MHC class II) in a lymph node stimulates [[T helper cell|TH1]] (type 1 helper T cells) to proliferate (mainly due to [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]] secretion from the macrophage). When a B-cell in the lymph node recognizes the same unprocessed surface antigen on the bacterium with its surface bound antibody, the antigen is endocytosed and processed. The processed antigen is then presented in MHCII on the surface of the B-cell. T cells that express the T cell receptor which recognizes the antigen-MHCII complex (with co-stimulatory factors- [[CD40]] and [[CD40L]]) cause the B-cell to produce antibodies that help [[opsonisation]] of the antigen so that the bacteria can be better cleared by [[phagocytes]].\n\nMacrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with [[fungus]] or [[parasite]]s. Once a T cell has recognized its particular antigen on the surface of an aberrant cell, the T cell becomes an activated effector cell, producing chemical mediators known as lymphokines that stimulate macrophages into a more aggressive form.\n\n==== Macrophage subtypes ====\nThere are several activated forms of macrophages.<ref name=\"PMC2724991\" /> In spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages, there are two main groups designated M1 and M2.

M2 is the phenotype of resident tissue macrophages, and can be further elevated by [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]]. M2 macrophages produce high levels of IL-10, [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-beta]] and low levels of IL-12. Tumor-associated macrophages are mainly of the M2 phenotype, and seem to actively promote tumor growth.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Galdiero MR, Garlanda C, Jaillon S, Marone G, Mantovani A | title = Tumor associated macrophages and neutrophils in tumor progression | journal = Journal of Cellular Physiology | volume = 228 | issue = 7 | pages = 1404\u201312 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23065796 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.24260 }}</ref>\n\nMacrophages exist in a variety of phenotypes which are determined by the role they play in wound maturation. Phenotypes can be predominantly separated into two major categories; M1 and M2. M1 macrophages are the dominating phenotype observed in the early stages of inflammation and are activated by four key mediators: interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These mediator molecules create a pro-inflammatory response that in return produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin-6 and TNF. Unlike M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of Interleukin-4 or Interleukin-13. They also play a role in wound healing and are needed for revascularization and reepithelialization. M2 macrophages are divided into four major types based on their roles: M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d. How M2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound.<ref name=\"MH1\" />\n\nM2 macrophages are needed for vascular stability. They produce vascular epithelial growth factor-A and TGF-\u03b21.<ref name=MH1/> There is a phenotype shift from M1 to M2 macrophages in acute wounds, however this shift is impaired for chronic wounds. This dysregulation results in insufficient M2 macrophages and its corresponding growth factors that aid in wound repair. With a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner. Normally, after neutrophils eat debris/pathogens they perform apoptosis and are removed. At this point, inflammation is not needed and M1 undergoes a switch to M2 (anti-inflammatory). However, dysregulation occurs as the M1 macrophages are unable/do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation.<ref name=MH1/>\n\nBoth M1 and M2 macrophages play a role in promotion of [[atherosclerosis]].

This role is important in chronic inflammation, as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils, which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age (see [[CD31]] for a description of this process).<ref name=\"Macro17082013\">{{cite web|url=http://www.corne.mx/estudios/Sportvis/5.pdf|title=Inflammation in Wound Repair: Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms|author=Sabine A.

Within the phagolysosome, [[enzymes]] and toxic peroxides digest the pathogen. However, some bacteria, such as ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', have become resistant to these methods of digestion. Typhoidal ''Salmonellae'' induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo, and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action, thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis.<ref>{{cite journal|author=YashRoy R.C.|date=2000|title=Hijacking of Macrophages by Salmonella (310r) Through 'Types III' Secretion Like Exocytotic Signalling : A Mechanism for Infection of Chicken Ileum|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230823526|journal=Indian Journal of Poultry Science|volume=35|issue=3|pages=276\u2013281}}</ref> Macrophages can digest more than 100 bacteria before they finally die due to their own digestive compounds.\n\n=== Role in adaptive immunity ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\nMacrophages are versatile cells that play many roles.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen Y, Zhang X | title = Pivotal regulators of tissue homeostasis and cancer: macrophages | journal = Experimental Hematology & Oncology | volume = 6 | pages = 23 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28804688 | pmc = 5549331 | doi = 10.1186/s40164-017-0083-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goto H, das Gra\u00e7as Prianti M | title = Immunoactivation and immunopathogeny during active visceral leishmaniasis | journal = Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 241\u20136 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19893975 | doi = 10.1590/s0036-46652009000500002 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Velasco-Vel\u00e1zquez MA, Barrera D, Gonz\u00e1lez-Arenas A, Rosales C, Agramonte-Hevia J | title = Macrophage--Mycobacterium tuberculosis interactions: role of complement receptor 3 | journal = Microbial Pathogenesis | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 125\u201331 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12927520 | doi = 10.1016/s0882-4010(03)00099-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matzaraki V, Kumar V, Wijmenga C, Zhernakova A | title = The MHC locus and genetic susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 76 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28449694 | pmc = 5406920 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-017-1207-1 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-\u03baB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology & Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254\u2013270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}</ref> As scavengers, they rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris. Along with [[dendritic cells]], they are foremost among the cells that [[Antigen presentation|present antigens]], a crucial role in initiating an immune response. As secretory cells, monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ([[monokine]]s) including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as [[interleukin-1]]. At the same time, they carry receptors for [[lymphokine]]s that allow them to be \"activated\" into single-minded pursuit of microbes and tumour cells.\n\nAfter digesting a pathogen, a macrophage will present the [[antigen]] (a molecule, most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen and used by the immune system for identification) of the pathogen to the corresponding [[helper T cell]]. The presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] class II molecule (MHCII), indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen, despite having antigens on its surface.\n\nEventually, the antigen presentation results in the production of [[antibody|antibodies]] that attach to the antigens of pathogens, making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose. In some cases, pathogens are very resistant to adhesion by the macrophages.\n\nThe antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages (in the context of MHC class II) in a lymph node stimulates [[T helper cell|TH1]] (type 1 helper T cells) to proliferate (mainly due to [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]] secretion from the macrophage). When a B-cell in the lymph node recognizes the same unprocessed surface antigen on the bacterium with its surface bound antibody, the antigen is endocytosed and processed. The processed antigen is then presented in MHCII on the surface of the B-cell. T cells that express the T cell receptor which recognizes the antigen-MHCII complex (with co-stimulatory factors- [[CD40]] and [[CD40L]]) cause the B-cell to produce antibodies that help [[opsonisation]] of the antigen so that the bacteria can be better cleared by [[phagocytes]].\n\nMacrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with [[fungus]] or [[parasite]]s. Once a T cell has recognized its particular antigen on the surface of an aberrant cell, the T cell becomes an activated effector cell, producing chemical mediators known as lymphokines that stimulate macrophages into a more aggressive form.\n\n==== Macrophage subtypes ====\nThere are several activated forms of macrophages.<ref name=\"PMC2724991\" /> In spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages, there are two main groups designated M1 and M2.

M2 is the phenotype of resident tissue macrophages, and can be further elevated by [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]].  M2 macrophages produce high levels of IL-10, [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-beta]] and low levels of IL-12. Tumor-associated macrophages are mainly of the M2 phenotype, and seem to actively promote tumor growth.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Galdiero MR, Garlanda C, Jaillon S, Marone G, Mantovani A | title = Tumor associated macrophages and neutrophils in tumor progression | journal = Journal of Cellular Physiology | volume = 228 | issue = 7 | pages = 1404\u201312 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23065796 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.24260 }}</ref>\n\nMacrophages exist in a variety of phenotypes which are determined by the role they play in wound maturation. Phenotypes can be predominantly separated into two major categories; M1 and M2. M1 macrophages are the dominating phenotype observed in the early stages of inflammation and are activated by four key mediators:  interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These mediator molecules create a pro-inflammatory response that in return produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin-6 and TNF. Unlike M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of Interleukin-4 or Interleukin-13. They also play a role in wound healing and are needed for revascularization and reepithelialization. M2 macrophages are divided into four major types based on their roles: M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d. How M2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound.<ref name=\"MH1\" />\n\nM2 macrophages are needed for vascular stability. They produce vascular epithelial growth factor-A and TGF-\u03b21.<ref name=MH1/> There is a phenotype shift from M1 to M2 macrophages in acute wounds, however this shift is impaired for chronic wounds. This dysregulation results in insufficient M2 macrophages and its corresponding growth factors that aid in wound repair. With a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner. Normally, after neutrophils eat debris/pathogens they perform apoptosis and are removed. At this point, inflammation is not needed and M1 undergoes a switch to M2 (anti-inflammatory). However, dysregulation occurs as the M1 macrophages are unable/do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation.<ref name=MH1/>\n\nBoth M1 and M2 macrophages play a role in promotion of [[atherosclerosis]]. M1&nbsp;macrophages promote atherosclerosis by inflammation.

Primarily, intestinal macrophages do not induce inflammatory responses.

This change is directly caused by the intestinal macrophages environment.

In a healthy gut, intestinal macrophages limit the inflammatory response in the gut, but in a disease-state, intestinal macrophage numbers and diversity are altered.

His father recalled how as a young boy he used to open his schoolbooks and start his homework as soon as he got home from lessons.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 20\">Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', p. 20.</ref> This commitment to study continued and at the end of secondary school, he was accepted into [[Oxford University]] to study history.\n\nBetween his secondary education and attending university, Bendor-Samuel had to spend two years doing [[National Service]] in the army.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> As he felt [[Calling (religious)|called by God]] to go into mission work in later life, he expressed a desire to spend his period of service overseas, but this request was declined several times due to his usefulness as an instructor in England.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> Eventually, he decided to resign from his position, and was able to spend the second year of his National Service in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=WycliffeBio/>\n\nAfter his National Service was completed, he began studying for his undergraduate degree in history at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He graduated in 1952 and, spurred by a desire to work in a Bible teaching position oversees, he moved to [[London University]] to work towards two postgraduate diplomas, firstly in Education and then in Theology.<ref name=WycliffeBio/><ref name=dacb/>\n\n===Linguistics training and the move abroad===\nIn 1953, while studying for his diploma in theology, he attended a training course run by the Summer Institute of Linguistics at the [[London Bible College]]. The first course of its kind in the UK, it was designed to equip prospective and current missionaries to better acquire proficiency in non-European languages.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> Despite the current pressures on his time, the course appealed to Bendor-Samuel as he was aware of the importance of language learning skills for missionaries. He also had memories of his shortcomings in the discipline earlier in life, remarking that his school language lessons had been \"dismal and depressing\"<ref name=WycliffeBio/> and jokingly admitting that he did not know \"the difference between a glottal stop and a bus stop\".<ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', p. 19.</ref> Unable to afford the residential fee for the course, he lived at his parents' house in West Norwood, cycling to and from the College each day and working on completing his theology diploma when he got home at night.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 20\"/> By the end of the course, he discovered that he enjoyed linguistics,<ref name=Mason/> and was invited to take on a role of organising and publicising the same course for the following year.<ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 24-25.</ref>\n\nAs part of this position, Bendor-Samuel essentially turned his attic bedroom into the UK office of [[Wycliffe Bible Translators (UK & Ireland)|Wycliffe Bible Translators]].<ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', p. 25.</ref> With the help of his brother David, he also bought a motorcycle and [[side-car]], which he used to travel around areas near London promoting the work of Wycliffe and searching for a location for the next year's course.<ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 25-26.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1954 SIL course, which was held in [[Chigwell]], Essex, Bendor-Samuel decided to join Wycliffe Bible Translators.<ref name=dacb/><ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 32-34.</ref> Encouraged to engage in further linguistics study to equip him for work with Wycliffe, he enrolled on a one-year MA course at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] before studying for a [[PhD]] in Linguistics.<ref name=Mason/> Throughout this period, he was also responsible for continued administrative work for Wycliffe from his bedroom.<ref name=T35>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', p. 35.</ref>\n\nIn January 1955, Bendor-Samuel became [[Engagement|engaged]] to fellow Wycliffe member Pamela Moxham.<ref name=T35/> After their first meeting at the SIL course in 1953, Moxham and Bendor-Samuel had remained friends, with her teaching him some phonetics, and him teaching her how to drive.<ref name=T35/> Initially hesitant about marriage, the new certainty about his future had encouraged Bendor-Samuel to propose.<ref name=T35/> The ceremony took place during that year's SIL course.<ref name=T35/>\n\nAs Bendor-Samuel had chosen the [[Jebero language]] of [[Peru]] as the subject of his PhD,<ref name=Mason/> the newly married couple travelled to South America in 1955, where they would spend several years working with SIL International.<ref name=\"sil\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120608162053/http://www.sil.org/sil/news/2011/john-bendor-samuel.htm SIL obituary retrieved Jan 24, 2011, retrieved Aug 2018 from archive.org]</ref> After a year in Peru, collecting phonological and grammatical data on the language and helping to devise an alphabet, they returned to England, where John spent eighteen months working on his thesis.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> Following his [[thesis]] in 1958, he returned to South America with Pam, this time to [[Mato Grosso]], Brazil to study the [[Terena language]].<ref name=WycliffeBio/> During his years in Peru and Brazil, Bendor-Samuel continued to be involved in the annual SIL courses in England.<ref name=T54>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 54-59.</ref>\n\n===The beginning of work in Africa===\nBendor-Samuel's first visit to Africa, where his most extensive and influential work occurred, was in 1960. In response to requests from various African church leaders, and following a particularly emotive plea from a [[Ghana]]ian language assistant who interrupted a Council meeting during the 1959 summer course, SIL president [[George Cowan (linguist)|George Cowan]] decided that linguistic and Bible translation work should commence in Africa.<ref name=T54/> Bendor-Samuel was chosen to conduct the initial survey work, and set off for Africa in June 1960.<ref name=T54/> During this initial six-week journey, he visited language groups in [[Senegal]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]] and [[Ghana]].<ref name=dacb/><ref name=T54/>\n\nThis initial survey work convinced the Wycliffe International Conference about the idea of expanding their work into Africa, and Bendor-Samuel was chosen to direct this initiative.<ref name=T54/> In November 1961, he returned to Africa on a more permanent basis. The Bendor-Samuels spent the next 20 years living in Africa, first in Ghana and then in Nigeria, but returning to the UK for three months each year to run the SIL training course.<ref name=dacb/><ref name=Mason/>\n\nA crucial part of Bendor-Samuel's work during his early years in Africa was making contact with key governmental and educational figures. The flourishing of the scholarly study of linguistics in Africa, with the emergence of new university departments, meant that he was able to forge working relationships with many African scholars.<ref name=WycliffeBio/><ref name=Mason/> The first such agreement came in December 1961, with the Institute of African Studies at the [[University of Ghana]], and a similar agreement was reached with the [[University of Nigeria]] soon afterwards.<ref name=dacb/><ref name=T54/>\n\nWhen Wycliffe teams were forced to temporarily leave Nigeria due to the [[Nigerian Civil War]] in 1967, Bendor-Samuel used this as an opportunity to supervise the start of SIL work in other west African countries. Later that year, Bendor-Samuel reached an agreement with the [[University of Yaound\u00e9|University of Cameroon]], allowing some workers to be re-allocated to that country with official support.<ref name=T91>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 91-97.</ref> An encounter with the Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Abidjan]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], allowed him to initiate linguistics work in that country as well.<ref name=T91/> By 1969, SIL were also working in [[Togo]].<ref name=T91/> During the 1970s, Bendor-Samuel served as SIL's Africa Area Director.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> In this role, he was responsible for initiating and guiding SIL work further afield on the continent, in 13 further countries including [[Ethiopia]], [[Sudan]], [[Kenya]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Senegal]] and the [[Central African Republic]].<ref name=WycliffeBio/><ref name=dacb/>\n\nBendor-Samuel later described the approach he took in exploring possibilities for expansion into new countries:\n\n{{Quotation|In going to a country for the first time, I would contact and gather information from all sorts of sources \u2014 Government officials, university staff and church leaders...I came away with a sketch of the language situation, the relationships between the languages, population details, the religious situation, language attitudes and other sociolinguistic factors which had a bearing on translation needs. Not a full-length portrait but a simple snapshot, sufficient for us to make initial plans which would need to be refined, corrected and expanded later. Besides setting up the basis for the work in a country, I used to visit our new teams twice a year...until there was a nucleus of members in the country and a new administration was in place.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>}}\n\nAs well as his supervisory role, Bendor-Samuel was himself involved in linguistic research in Africa, primarily into several [[Gur languages|Gur]] and [[Benue\u2013Congo languages|Benue\u2013Congo]] languages.<ref name=dacb/> He also founded the West Africa Linguistics Society in 1965, continuing to serve on their council until 1999 and editing their ''[[Journal of West African Languages]]'' (''JWAL'') between 1982 and 1993.<ref name=WycliffeBio/><ref name=dacb/>\n\n===Leadership===\nFrom 1984, Bendor-Samuel held a number of important leadership positions, beginning with a seven-year term as Executive Vice-President of SIL International.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> This role necessitated a move to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], making the 1983 SIL course the last one he directed.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> The position involved him speaking frequently at conferences, as well as visiting various SIL branches worldwide.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> Notably, he was invited to speak at the [[Second International Congress on World Evangelization]] in Manila in 1989.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>\n\nIn 1990 he was a co-founder of the Forum of Bible Agencies, which he established with Fergus MacDonald from the [[United Bible Societies]] in an attempt to promote greater cooperation among agencies working in Bible translation and distribution.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>\n\nIn 1992, he was elected Director of Wycliffe Bible Translators in the UK, but continued to be involved in the running of the Forum of Bible Agencies, as well as participating in several international conferences.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> During his term as Director, Bendor-Samuel introduced a number of initiatives, including a model for institutional funding for literacy and language development work; although this project did not have much of an impact in the UK, it was adopted successfully in other European countries.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> He also introduced a scheme called 'Vision 20', which connected churches in Britain with specific Bible translation projects that they could support. Later operating under the name 'In Focus', this programme continues to be an important part of Wycliffe UK's work.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> Later, Bendor-Samuel simultaneously served as the president of [[Wycliffe Global Alliance | Wycliffe International]]. His terms in both of these roles concluded in 1999.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>\n\nIn 2000, he was appointed to the role of Wycliffe Africa Area director, to encourage African churches and organisations to support Bible translation in their countries and beyond.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>\n\nFor the final few years of his life, Bendor-Samuel was working in SIL\u2019s Africa archives, conducting research into the development of the organisation in that continent.<ref name=WycliffeBio/><ref name=BFP12>{{cite news|title=Tributes paid to 81-year-old who died in Studley Green collision|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/8786183.Tributes_paid_to_81_year_old_who_died_in_Studley_Green_collision/|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=[[Bucks Free Press]]|date=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nBendor-Samuel died in hospital following a car accident near his home in [[Studley Green]] on the evening of 6 January 2011.<ref name=BFP12/><ref name=WycliffeBio2>{{cite web|title=A Short Biography of Dr John Bendor-Samuel 1929-2011|url=http://wycliffe.org.uk/wycliffe/about/history-bendor-samuel.html|publisher=[[Wycliffe UK]]|accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> His wife Pamela Bendor-Samuel survived him by eight years (1930-2019).

Bendor-Samuel's belief in the importance of training nationals in linguistic work was underscored by his experiences during the Nigerian Civil War, later writing:\n<blockquote>\n\"Although from the beginning we had tried to train West Africans, particularly Nigerians, it was the difficulties that we encountered with the civil war and then later in the year following it with getting visas that forced us to give much greater attention and priority to this aspect of our work\".<ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', p. 97.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== Publications ==\nIn total, Bendor-Samuel wrote one book, co-authored another, contributed several articles to academic journals and wrote 14 articles on Niger\u2013Congo language groups for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.<ref>This included the article on [[Niger\u2013Congo languages]], as well as articles for [[Adamawa\u2013Ubangi languages|Adamawa\u2013Ubangi]], [[Akan languages|Akan]], [[Atlantic languages|Atlantic]], [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Benue\u2013Congo languages|Benue\u2013Congo]], [[Gur languages|Gur]], [[Igboid languages|Igboid]], [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]], [[Kordofanian languages|Kordofanian]], [[Kru languages|Kru]], [[Kwa languages|Kwa]], [[Mande languages|Mande]] and [[Yoruba language]]s.</ref>\n\n===Books and monographs===\n\n====As editor====\n* ''Ten Nigerian Tone Systems'' (Jos and Kano: Institute of Linguistics and Centre for the Study of Nigerian Languages, 1974)\n\n====As author====\n*''The Verbal Piece in Jebero'' (New York: Linguistic Circle of New York, 1961)\n* (with Paul E. and Ingeborg Meier) ''[http://www.sil.org/acpub/repository/11699.pdf A Grammar of Izi, an Igbo Language]'' (Norman: Summer Institute of Linguistics of the University of Oklahoma, 1975)\n* (with Keir Hansford and Ronald Stanford) ''An Index of Nigerian Languages'' (Ghana: Summer Institute of Linguistics, 1976)\n*John Bendor-Samuel, Rhonda Hartell, 1989, The Niger\u2013Congo Languages: a classification and description of Africa's largest language family.

The first course of its kind in the UK, it was designed to equip prospective and current missionaries to better acquire proficiency in non-European languages.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> Despite the current pressures on his time, the course appealed to Bendor-Samuel as he was aware of the importance of language learning skills for missionaries. He also had memories of his shortcomings in the discipline earlier in life, remarking that his school language lessons had been \"dismal and depressing\"<ref name=WycliffeBio/> and jokingly admitting that he did not know \"the difference between a glottal stop and a bus stop\".<ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', p. 19.</ref> Unable to afford the residential fee for the course, he lived at his parents' house in West Norwood, cycling to and from the College each day and working on completing his theology diploma when he got home at night.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 20\"/> By the end of the course, he discovered that he enjoyed linguistics,<ref name=Mason/> and was invited to take on a role of organising and publicising the same course for the following year.<ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 24-25.</ref>\n\nAs part of this position, Bendor-Samuel essentially turned his attic bedroom into the UK office of [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]].<ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', p. 25.</ref> With the help of his brother David, he also bought a motorcycle and [[side-car]], which he used to travel around areas near London promoting the work of Wycliffe and searching for a location for the next year's course.<ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 25-26.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1954 SIL course, which was held in [[Chigwell]], Essex, Bendor-Samuel decided to join Wycliffe Bible Translators.<ref name=dacb/><ref>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 32-34.</ref> Encouraged to engage in further linguistics study to equip him for work with Wycliffe, he enrolled on a one-year MA course at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] before studying for a [[PhD]] in Linguistics.<ref name=Mason/> Throughout this period, he was also responsible for continued administrative work for Wycliffe from his bedroom.<ref name=T35>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', p. 35.</ref>\n\nIn January 1955, Bendor-Samuel became [[Engagement|engaged]] to fellow Wycliffe member Pamela Moxham.<ref name=T35/> After their first meeting at the SIL course in 1953, Moxham and Bendor-Samuel had remained friends, with her teaching him some phonetics, and him teaching her how to drive.<ref name=T35/> Initially hesitant about marriage, the new certainty about his future had encouraged Bendor-Samuel to propose.<ref name=T35/> The ceremony took place during that year's SIL course.<ref name=T35/>\n\nAs Bendor-Samuel had chosen the [[Jebero language]] of [[Peru]] as the subject of his PhD,<ref name=Mason/> the newly married couple travelled to South America in 1955, where they would spend several years working with SIL International.<ref name=\"sil\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120608162053/http://www.sil.org/sil/news/2011/john-bendor-samuel.htm SIL obituary retrieved Jan 24, 2011, retrieved Aug 2018 from archive.org]</ref> After a year in Peru, collecting phonological and grammatical data on the language and helping to devise an alphabet, they returned to England, where John spent eighteen months working on his thesis.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> Following his [[thesis]] in 1958, he returned to South America with Pam, this time to [[Mato Grosso]], Brazil to study the [[Terena language]].<ref name=WycliffeBio/> During his years in Peru and Brazil, Bendor-Samuel continued to be involved in the annual SIL courses in England.<ref name=T54>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 54-59.</ref>\n\n===The beginning of work in Africa===\nBendor-Samuel's first visit to Africa, where his most extensive and influential work occurred, was in 1960. In response to requests from various African church leaders, and following a particularly emotive plea from a [[Ghana]]ian language assistant who interrupted a Council meeting during the 1959 summer course, SIL president [[George Cowan (linguist)|George Cowan]] decided that linguistic and Bible translation work should commence in Africa.<ref name=T54/> Bendor-Samuel was chosen to conduct the initial survey work, and set off for Africa in June 1960.<ref name=T54/> During this initial six-week journey, he visited language groups in [[Senegal]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]] and [[Ghana]].<ref name=dacb/><ref name=T54/>\n\nThis initial survey work convinced the Wycliffe International Conference about the idea of expanding their work into Africa, and Bendor-Samuel was chosen to direct this initiative.<ref name=T54/> In November 1961, he returned to Africa on a more permanent basis. The Bendor-Samuels spent the next 20 years living in Africa, first in Ghana and then in Nigeria, but returning to the UK for three months each year to run the SIL training course.<ref name=dacb/><ref name=Mason/>\n\nA crucial part of Bendor-Samuel's work during his early years in Africa was making contact with key governmental and educational figures. The flourishing of the scholarly study of linguistics in Africa, with the emergence of new university departments, meant that he was able to forge working relationships with many African scholars.<ref name=WycliffeBio/><ref name=Mason/> The first such agreement came in December 1961, with the Institute of African Studies at the [[University of Ghana]], and a similar agreement was reached with the [[University of Nigeria]] soon afterwards.<ref name=dacb/><ref name=T54/>\n\nWhen Wycliffe teams were forced to temporarily leave Nigeria due to the [[Nigerian Civil War]] in 1967, Bendor-Samuel used this as an opportunity to supervise the start of SIL work in other west African countries. Later that year, Bendor-Samuel reached an agreement with the [[University of Yaound\u00e9|University of Cameroon]], allowing some workers to be re-allocated to that country with official support.<ref name=T91>Thompson, ''Matched with His Hour'', pp. 91-97.</ref> An encounter with the Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Abidjan]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], allowed him to initiate linguistics work in that country as well.<ref name=T91/> By 1969, SIL were also working in [[Togo]].<ref name=T91/> During the 1970s, Bendor-Samuel served as SIL's Africa Area Director.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> In this role, he was responsible for initiating and guiding SIL work further afield on the continent, in 13 further countries including [[Ethiopia]], [[Sudan]], [[Kenya]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Senegal]] and the [[Central African Republic]].<ref name=WycliffeBio/><ref name=dacb/>\n\nBendor-Samuel later described the approach he took in exploring possibilities for expansion into new countries:\n\n{{Quotation|In going to a country for the first time, I would contact and gather information from all sorts of sources \u2014 Government officials, university staff and church leaders...I came away with a sketch of the language situation, the relationships between the languages, population details, the religious situation, language attitudes and other sociolinguistic factors which had a bearing on translation needs. Not a full-length portrait but a simple snapshot, sufficient for us to make initial plans which would need to be refined, corrected and expanded later. Besides setting up the basis for the work in a country, I used to visit our new teams twice a year...until there was a nucleus of members in the country and a new administration was in place.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>}}\n\nAs well as his supervisory role, Bendor-Samuel was himself involved in linguistic research in Africa, primarily into several [[Gur languages|Gur]] and [[Benue\u2013Congo languages|Benue\u2013Congo]] languages.<ref name=dacb/> He also founded the West Africa Linguistics Society in 1965, continuing to serve on their council until 1999 and editing their ''[[Journal of West African Languages]]'' (''JWAL'') between 1982 and 1993.<ref name=WycliffeBio/><ref name=dacb/>\n\n===Leadership===\nFrom 1984, Bendor-Samuel held a number of important leadership positions, beginning with a seven-year term as Executive Vice-President of SIL International.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> This role necessitated a move to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], making the 1983 SIL course the last one he directed.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> The position involved him speaking frequently at conferences, as well as visiting various SIL branches worldwide.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> Notably, he was invited to speak at the [[Second International Congress on World Evangelization]] in Manila in 1989.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>\n\nIn 1990 he was a co-founder of the Forum of Bible Agencies, which he established with Fergus MacDonald from the [[United Bible Societies]] in an attempt to promote greater cooperation among agencies working in Bible translation and distribution.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>\n\nIn 1992, he was elected Director of Wycliffe Bible Translators in the UK, but continued to be involved in the running of the Forum of Bible Agencies, as well as participating in several international conferences.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> During his term as Director, Bendor-Samuel introduced a number of initiatives, including a model for institutional funding for literacy and language development work; although this project did not have much of an impact in the UK, it was adopted successfully in other European countries.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> He also introduced a scheme called 'Vision 20', which connected churches in Britain with specific Bible translation projects that they could support. Later operating under the name 'In Focus', this programme continues to be an important part of Wycliffe UK's work.<ref name=WycliffeBio/> Later, Bendor-Samuel simultaneously served as the president of [[Wycliffe Global Alliance | Wycliffe International]]. His terms in both of these roles concluded in 1999.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>\n\nIn 2000, he was appointed to the role of Wycliffe Africa Area director, to encourage African churches and organisations to support Bible translation in their countries and beyond.<ref name=WycliffeBio/>\n\nFor the final few years of his life, Bendor-Samuel was working in SIL\u2019s Africa archives, conducting research into the development of the organisation in that continent.<ref name=WycliffeBio/><ref name=BFP12>{{cite news|title=Tributes paid to 81-year-old who died in Studley Green collision|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/8786183.Tributes_paid_to_81_year_old_who_died_in_Studley_Green_collision/|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=[[Bucks Free Press]]|date=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nBendor-Samuel died in hospital following a car accident near his home in [[Studley Green]] on the evening of 6 January 2011.<ref name=BFP12/><ref name=WycliffeBio2>{{cite web|title=A Short Biography of Dr John Bendor-Samuel 1929-2011|url=http://wycliffe.org.uk/wycliffe/about/history-bendor-samuel.html|publisher=[[Wycliffe UK]]|accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> His wife Pamela Bendor-Samuel survived him by eight years (1930-2019).

At -60  \u030aC the reaction of 1 and 2 afforded evenly to the lactone (3), the carbonyl addition product which underwent conversion on treatment with acid. The free acid (4) was obtained when the latter was cleaved reductively with zinc and alkali. Cyclization of the product occurred when treated with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> in acetic acid anhydride and gave the compound 6-acetoxy-3-MC (5).

A single ip injection (in inducible fetal lung supernatants) of 100&nbsp;mg/kg of 3-MC to the mothers resulted in a maximal 50-fold induction of AHH activity by 8 hr, which persisted for 48 hr. The same injections to adult F1 mice revealed only a 4- to 7\u2014fold increase in lung AHH activity, compared to the large fetal induction ratio.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=M.
