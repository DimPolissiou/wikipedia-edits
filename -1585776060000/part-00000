The racial makeup of the city was 90.9.% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 5.6% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.9% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], and 0.9% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 18.2% of the population.\n\nThe percentage of population under the age of 19 was 35.8%, 13.7% from 20 to 29, 27.9% from 30 to 44, 16.6% from 45 to 65, and 5.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years.\n\nThe male population accounts for 49.4% and the female 50.6%.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $84,223. About 7.29% of the population were below the [[poverty line]].<ref>https://datausa.io/profile/geo/anna-tx/</ref>\n\n==History==\nFollowing the [[American Civil War]], the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]] resumed laying track north from Corsicana and passed through the area in 1872. By the time Anna was platted in 1883, it had a population of 20, two stores, a steam gristmill, and a Baptist church. A post office also opened in that year. In 1885, the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway|railroad]] built a depot.\n\nBy 1890 the town had a population of nearly 200. Anna was incorporated in 1913, with John L. Greer as first mayor.\n\nLocal historian Chester A. Howell compiled a brief history of Anna for inclusion in a book, ''A Town Named Anna'',<ref>[http://www.annatexas.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=95 ''A Town Named Anna'']</ref> that was given to those who attended the Anna school homecoming on October 19, 1985. A one-page list of [[errata]] to correct some minor errors was added in 1989. In 2019, the Anna Area Historical Preservation Society published, ''The Spark That Ignited The Town Of Anna'' ({{ISBN|9781799137610}}), a collection of stories and pictures of early Anna, Texas.\n\n===First Christian Church of Anna===\n[[File:First Christian Church of Anna.png|thumb|First Christian Church of Anna (n\u00e9e, Liberty Christian Church), one of the earliest Christian Churches in Texas, was founded by pioneer settlers Collin McKinney and J.B. Wilmeth in 1846.]]\n\nLiberty Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), one of the earliest Christian Churches in Texas, was founded in northern Collin County by pioneer settlers Collin McKinney and J. B. Wilmeth in 1846. In 1854 a Christian seminary was established by members of the Liberty congregation about two miles northwest of Anna in the (then) newly established community of Mantua.\n\nThe [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]] extended its track in a north\u2013south route several miles east of Mantua in 1872. Mantua soon declined in favor of the new railroad towns of [[Van Alstyne, Texas|Van Alstyne]] ([[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson County]]) and Anna which developed here in early 1880s.\n\nAccording to local tradition Mantua's Christian congregation split between the two new communities. Former Mantua church members and early Anna resident Rebecca Sherley helped organize the First Christian Church of Anna in 1882. The Rev. Alf Douglas served as first Pastor. Services were held in the Sherley home until it burned in 1886. About 1890 the sanctuary was built here at the site of the former Sherley home. Major additions to the rear of the sanctuary were completed in 1949.\n\n===A. Sherley and Brothers Hardware Store===\n[[File:A. Sherley and Brothers Hardware Store.png|thumb|left|A. Sherley and Brothers Hardware Store]]\n\nLewis and Pauline Sherley moved to north Texas from Kentucky about 1853. When the town of Anna was established in 1872, their grandsons, brothers Andrew and Fred Sherley, opened a hardware store. In 1894 they built this structure to house the business. It remained in the family after the store closed in 1979. Over time they were undertakers as well as purveyors of furniture, farming implements and machinery, wagons, cotton, grain and groceries. Wagon-weighing scales in front of the building were removed when the road was widened. The structure is a fine example of an early Texas commercial building, retaining the original canopy and painted signs. Minimal Victorian-era detailing includes corbelled brickwork in the parapet and paneled kickplates on storefront display windows.\n\n===Tornado===\nOn May 9, 2006, a storm producing two tornadoes swept across Anna, with the first tornado (F0) passing {{convert|2.5|mi}} east of the high school, barely missing the incorporated city limits. The second tornado (F3) touched down in neighboring [[Westminster, Texas|Westminster]] and [[Whitewright, Texas|Whitewright]], destroying many homes and killing three. During the disaster, several volunteers from Collin County Amateur Radio Services worked with the National Weather Service in a [[Skywarn]] net. The Anna police and fire departments along with the American Red Cross opened Anna High School up as a shelter to the \"walking wounded\" and anyone who needed a place to stay due to the road blockages and damage in that area. The tornadoes could be seen from Anna, [[Van Alstyne, Texas|Van Alstyne]], and [[Melissa, Texas|Melissa]], and power was knocked out to several homes in the area.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.  The [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system describes the weather as [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]],  ''Cfa''.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=262014&cityname=Anna%2C+Texas%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Anna, Texas]</ref>\n\n<div

The racial makeup of the city was 90.9.% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 5.6% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.9% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], and 0.9% from two or more races.

The median age was 30 years.\n\nThe male population accounts for 49.4% and the female 50.6%.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $84,223. About 7.29% of the population were below the [[poverty line]].<ref>https://datausa.io/profile/geo/anna-tx/</ref>\n\n==History==\nFollowing the [[American Civil War]], the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]] resumed laying track north from Corsicana and passed through the area in 1872. By the time Anna was platted in 1883, it had a population of 20, two stores, a steam gristmill, and a Baptist church. A post office also opened in that year. In 1885, the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway|railroad]] built a depot.\n\nBy 1890 the town had a population of nearly 200. Anna was incorporated in 1913, with John L. Greer as first mayor.\n\nLocal historian Chester A. Howell compiled a brief history of Anna for inclusion in a book, ''A Town Named Anna'',<ref>[http://www.annatexas.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=95 ''A Town Named Anna'']</ref> that was given to those who attended the Anna school homecoming on October 19, 1985. A one-page list of [[errata]] to correct some minor errors was added in 1989. In 2019, the Anna Area Historical Preservation Society published, ''The Spark That Ignited The Town Of Anna'' ({{ISBN|9781799137610}}), a collection of stories and pictures of early Anna, Texas.\n\n===First Christian Church of Anna===\n[[File:First Christian Church of Anna.png|thumb|First Christian Church of Anna (nee, Liberty Christian Church), one of the earliest Christian Churches in Texas, was founded by pioneer settlers Collin McKinney and J.B. Wilmeth in 1846.]]\n\nLiberty Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), one of the earliest Christian Churches in Texas, was founded in northern Collin County by pioneer settlers Collin McKinney and J. B. Wilmeth in 1846. In 1854 a Christian seminary was established by members of the Liberty congregation about two miles northwest of Anna in the (then) newly established community of Mantua.\n\nThe [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]] extended its track in a north\u2013south route several miles east of Mantua in 1872. Mantua soon declined in favor of the new railroad towns of [[Van Alstyne, Texas|Van Alstyne]] ([[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson County]]) and Anna which developed here in early 1880s.\n\nAccording to local tradition Mantua's Christian congregation split between the two new communities. Former Mantua church members and early Anna resident Rebecca Sherley helped organize the First Christian Church of Anna in 1882. The Rev. Alf Douglas served as first Pastor. Services were held in the Sherley home until it burned in 1886. About 1890 the sanctuary was built here at the site of the former Sherley home. Major additions to the rear of the sanctuary were completed in 1949.\n\n===A. Sherley and Brothers Hardware Store===\n[[File:A. Sherley and Brothers Hardware Store.png|thumb|left|A. Sherley and Brothers Hardware Store]]\n\nLewis and Pauline Sherley moved to north Texas from Kentucky about 1853. When the town of Anna was established in 1872, their grandsons, brothers Andrew and Fred Sherley, opened a hardware store. In 1894 they built this structure to house the business. It remained in the family after the store closed in 1979. Over time they were undertakers as well as purveyors of furniture, farming implements and machinery, wagons, cotton, grain and groceries. Wagon-weighing scales in front of the building were removed when the road was widened. The structure is a fine example of an early Texas commercial building, retaining the original canopy and painted signs. Minimal Victorian-era detailing includes corbelled brickwork in the parapet and paneled kickplates on storefront display windows.\n\n===Tornado===\nOn May 9, 2006, a storm producing two tornadoes swept across Anna, with the first tornado (F0) passing {{convert|2.5|mi}} east of the high school, barely missing the incorporated city limits. The second tornado (F3) touched down in neighboring [[Westminster, Texas|Westminster]] and [[Whitewright, Texas|Whitewright]], destroying many homes and killing three. During the disaster, several volunteers from Collin County Amateur Radio Services worked with the National Weather Service in a [[Skywarn]] net. The Anna police and fire departments along with the American Red Cross opened Anna High School up as a shelter to the \"walking wounded\" and anyone who needed a place to stay due to the road blockages and damage in that area. The tornadoes could be seen from Anna, [[Van Alstyne, Texas|Van Alstyne]], and [[Melissa, Texas|Melissa]], and power was knocked out to several homes in the area.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.  The [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system describes the weather as [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]],  ''Cfa''.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=262014&cityname=Anna%2C+Texas%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Anna, Texas]</ref>\n\n<div style=\"width:85%;\">\n{{Weather box\n|location = Anna, Texas\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan high F = 55\n|Feb high F = 58\n|Mar high F = 68\n|Apr high F = 78\n|May high F = 84\n|Jun high F = 96\n|Jul high F = 96\n|Aug high F = 96\n|Sep high F = 88\n|Oct high F = 79\n|Nov high F = 66\n|Dec high F = 53\n|year high F = 76\n|Jan low F = 32\n|Feb low F = 33\n|Mar low F = 43\n|Apr low F = 50\n|May low F = 60\n|Jun low F = 68\n|Jul low F = 69\n|Aug low F = 69\n|Sep low F = 64\n|Oct low F = 52\n|Nov low F = 42\n|Dec low F = 31\n|year low F = 51\n|Jan precipitation inch = 2.2\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.8\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.3\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.2\n|May precipitation inch = 5.7\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.6\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.5\n|Aug precipitation inch = 2\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.9\n|Oct precipitation inch = 4.7\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.4\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3\n|year precipitation inch = 41.2\n|source 1 = Weatherbase <ref name=Weatherbase>\n{{cite web\n|url =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=262014&cityname=Anna-Texas\n|publisher=Weatherbase\n|title=Weatherbase.com\n|year=2013\n}}\nRetrieved on September 6, 2013.\n</ref>\n|date=September  2013\n}}\n</div>\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Ralph Fults]] (1911\u201393), outlaw and associate of the Barrow gang\n* [[Curley Johnson]] (b. 1935), American football player\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.annatexas.gov City of Anna official website]\n* {{Handbook of Texas|id=hla18|name=Anna, TX}}\n\n{{Collin County, Texas}}\n{{Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Collin County, Texas]]\n[[Category:Cities in Texas]]\n[[Category:Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1867]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFirst Christian Church of Anna:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: (nee \u2192 (n\u00e9e", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna,_Texas"}

In addition, the school boasts the highest senior satisfaction survey results of the district.{{fact|date=October 2015}} OVHS is also a two-time California Distinguished School.\n\n==International Baccalaureate magnet school==\nOVHS is in the [[International Baccalaureate]] or IB program. An IB program consists of three main programs: the IB Primary Years Program (PYP), which is for students ages 3 to 12, the IB Middle Years Program (MYP), ages 11 to 16, and the IB Diploma Program (DP), ages 16 to 19.\n\n== Advanced Placement ==\nOcean View offers many AP classes in addition to its IB classes.

The sports offered at OVHS are baseball, cross-country, track & field, golf, swimming, basketball, wrestling, volleyball, football, soccer, tennis, water polo, and softball. \n\nThe 1976 Football team had an inaugural season of 8\u20131, losing to Bolsa Grande 13\u20137 to miss out on the League Title. In 1977 they beat Bolsa Grande in a rematch 14\u20137, capturing the league title and to this day, boasts the only perfect season in Seahawks history. The Seahawks did capture a Sunset League Football Title in 1989, but the joy was short-lived. OV from Sept 1991 until Nov 1994 lost 26 consecutive Football games, an Orange County record. OV has qualified for CIF in 2001 and 2008.\n\nOVHS's first Boys' CIF Title came in 1992 in soccer, finishing with a record of 24\u20134\u20133.  The head coach was Paul Kollar, or better known as Senor Kollar, teaching Spanish Levels 1\u20134 at the time.  Kollar coached at OV for 15 years, winning 204 games, helping lead to 13 CIF playoff berths; semi-final apps in 1984, 1993, and the Div IV-A Championship in 1992.\n\nOcean View's varsity baseball team has been crowned the CIF Champions three times: 1998, 2005 and the 2010 season. \nAaron Kavanagh (c/o 98) was a starting pitcher on the 1998 championship Team (vs. La Quinta at Dodger Stadium), and after graduating college, returned (teaching history at OV) and led the 2005 team as head coach to their 2nd CIF Crown (at Angels Stadium).  He currently coaches at the baseball powerhouse Quartz Hill High School, where he also coached them to the 2006 CIF Championship (Angels Stadium).  Not confirmed how many other coaches have led two different schools to CIF Titles in back-to-back seasons.\n2005 championship game pitcher Alex Burnett currently pitches for the Chicago Cubs.\n\n\nIn 1992, the girls' cross country team, led by Coach Beth Chilcott, won the Division II CIF State Title.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cifstate.org/sports/cross_country/past_results_records/XC_records_through_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201160634/http://www.cifstate.org/sports/cross_country/past_results_records/XC_records_through_2014.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-01 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the girls' volleyball team won California Div III State Championship; def.

The 1985 girls went an amazing 32\u20130 to capture the school's first CIF title. In 2008, the girls defeated Bishop Amat in the Div IV CIF Title game, finishing that season at 29\u20132, the only HBUHSD to win any CIF title in the 2007\u20132008 academic year.\n\n'''Basketball'''\n\nJim Harris was the boys' basketball coach from the school's founding until his death in 2011.

Preseason Ranking #1 coming off a 1997 22\u20137 season, the 1998 team held the #1 pre-season county ranking all season and finished Div III-AA Champions (defeating Barstow at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim) with a 26\u20135 record.

Hanson has also been an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs. Notable league victories were defeating Tustin 54\u201319 and Santa Ana 68\u201323, both the lowest point totals in those respective schools' history. OV lost in the regional semi-finals of the state tourney to Washington Union and their superstar Chris Jefferies (1st Round; 27th Pick by LA Lakers in 2002). <ref>http://www.socalhoops.tierranet.com/archive/prepnotes/1098/ov1016.htm</ref>\n\nThe 2008\u20132009 boys' basketball team were regional CIF Champions for Division IV, and advanced to the state finals, where they lost to Sacred Heart Cathedral 62\u201355.

The Seahawks did capture a Sunset League Football Title in 1989, but the joy was short-lived. OV from Sept 1991 until Nov 1994 lost 26 consecutive Football games, an Orange County record. OV has qualified for CIF in 2001 and 2008.\n\nOVHS's first Boys' CIF Title came in 1992 in soccer, finishing with a record of 24\u20134\u20133.  The head coach was Paul Kollar, or better known as Senor Kollar, teaching Spanish Levels 1\u20134 at the time.  Kollar coached at OV for 15 years, winning 204 games, helping lead to 13 CIF playoff berths; semi-final apps in 1984, 1993, and the Div IV-A Championship in 1992.\n\nOcean View's varsity baseball team has been crowned the CIF Champions three times: 1998, 2005 and the 2010 season. \nAaron Kavanagh (c/o 98) was a starting pitcher on the 1998 championship Team (vs. La Quinta at Dodger Stadium), and after graduating college, returned (teaching history at OV) and led the 2005 team as head coach to their 2nd CIF Crown (at Angels Stadium).  He currently coaches at the baseball powerhouse Quartz Hill High School, where he also coached them to the 2006 CIF Championship (Angels Stadium).  Not confirmed how many other coaches have led two different schools to CIF Titles in back-to-back seasons.\n2005 championship game pitcher Alex Burnett currently pitches for the Chicago Cubs.\n\n\nIn 1992, the girls' cross country team, led by Coach Beth Chilcott, won the Division II CIF State Title.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cifstate.org/sports/cross_country/past_results_records/XC_records_through_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201160634/http://www.cifstate.org/sports/cross_country/past_results_records/XC_records_through_2014.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-01 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the girls' volleyball team won California Div III State Championship; def.

The 1985 girls went an amazing 32\u20130 to capture the school's first CIF title. In 2008, the girls defeated Bishop Amat in the Div IV CIF Title game, finishing that season at 29\u20132, the only HBUHSD to win any CIF title in the 2007\u20132008 academic year.\n\n'''Basketball'''\n\nJim Harris was the boys' basketball coach from the school's founding until his death in 2011. During the 33-year time span under Harris, his teams won 19 league championships and three CIF Southern Section titles, and a 665\u2013265 record.<ref name=harris>{{cite news|last=Sciacca|first=Mike|title=Players, colleagues remember Coach Harris|url=http://www.hbindependent.com/sports/tn-hbi-1027-jimharris-20111024,0,6583493.story|accessdate=October 31, 2011|newspaper=Huntington Beach Independent|date=October 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 1998 team is considered one of the best teams in OC High School history.  Preseason Ranking #1 coming off a 1997 22\u20137 season, the 1998 team held the #1 pre-season county ranking all season and finished Div III-AA Champions (defeating Barstow at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim) with a 26\u20135 record. Led by Tony Dow, CIF III-AA Player of the Year, and their center Kevin Hanson, who is the current player development coach for the NBA's New Orleans Pelicans.  Hanson has also been an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs. Notable league victories were defeating Tustin 54\u201319 and Santa Ana 68\u201323, both the lowest point totals in those respective schools' history. OV lost in the regional semi-finals of the state tourney to Washington Union and their superstar Chris Jefferies (1st Round; 27th Pick by LA Lakers in 2002). <ref>http://www.socalhoops.tierranet.com/archive/prepnotes/1098/ov1016.htm</ref>\n\nThe 2008\u20132009 boys' basketball team were regional CIF Champions for Division IV, and advanced to the state finals, where they lost to Sacred Heart Cathedral 62\u201355.

Beyond the Azores, the Cult of the Holy Spirit is alive in parts of [[Brazil]] (where it was established three centuries ago) and pockets of Portuguese settlers in North America. The cult of the Holy Spirit involves traditional rituals and religious celebrations of these faith communities.\n\nIn its original sense, \"[[Cult (religious practice)|cult]]\" referred to an accepted religious practice, in sharp contrast to the term's modern, negative connotation. [[Catholic devotions|Devotion]] to the Holy Spirit is part of classical [[Catholic dogma]] and is the inspiration of several Catholic [[religious institute]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07416a.htm|title=John I. Murphy, \"Religious Congregations of the Holy Ghost\", in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1910)|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref> including the [[Spiritans]], but what is considered here has peculiar characteristics of its own.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Holy Spirit as Dove (detail).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The dove: iconographic symbol of the Holy Spirit]]\n\n===Joachimites===\nWorship of the [[Holy Spirit]] was promoted by [[Joachim of Fiore]],<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 170</ref> a [[millenarian]] prophet who, on the basis on his interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], postulated that 1260 would see the beginning of [[Joachim of Fiore#Theory of the three ages| A Third Age]]. (He himself died in 1202.) The Third Age would be governed by the Holy Spirit and would represent a monastic governance, in which the hierarchy of the Church would be unnecessary and infidels would unite with Christians. These theories became associated with the [[Fraticelli]] strand of the [[Franciscan|Franciscan Order]] and were condemned by [[Pope Alexander IV]] in 1256.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), pp.169\u2013170</ref>\n\n===Cult===\nTwo hundred years later, there was a rebirth of the popularity of the doctrines in the [[Azores]]; their religious manifestations, rituals and symbols began to permeate the islands and, consequently, persist until today. These acts of faith were heavily influenced by Franciscan spiritualists, who were members of the first religious order that colonized the Azores, and brought with them traditions that were being extinguished on the mainland by Catholic Church orthodoxy. Here, in isolated communities under environmental pressures and the uncertainties of life, the millenarian rites of the Holy Spirit were accepted and fostered. The Azores, and those communities that had their origins in the archipelago, became the last outposts of [[Joachimites|Joachimite]] doctrines.\n\nThe origins of the modern ''cult'' and its rituals are not definitively understood. The dominant theory postulates that the celebrations were introduced into Portugal by Queen [[Elizabeth of Portugal]].<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 169</ref> The cult's principal centre of devotion was in [[Tomar]], which was also the location of the priory of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], charged with the spirituality of newly discovered lands (including the Azores).  Another centre was [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]], where, in the first years of the 14th century, Queen Elizabeth introduced the first celebration of the ''Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo'' ({{lang-en|Empire of the Divine Holy Spirit}}), probably influenced by [[Franciscan]] spiritualists, who there founded the first Franciscan Convent in Portugal. From there the cult first spread in Portugal (Aldeia Galega, [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]], [[Sintra]], [[Tomar]], [[Lisbon]]), and later accompanied the Portuguese during their Atlantic discoveries.\n\nThe new colonies were, in the beginning, subordinate to the priory in Tomar, later the [[archbishop]] of [[Funchal]], and finally, the new [[Episcopal see|bishopric]] of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]], which were overseen by the Order of Christ, who nominated new clerics, oriented the faithful and supervised the religious development. In this context, references to the proliferation of the cult of the Holy Spirit appeared early, and in a general way, throughout the archipelago. [[Gaspar Frutuoso]], writing 150 years after the beginning of the island's settlement, indicated that this devotion existed in all the islands; its expansion was tolerated, if not promoted, by the Order of Christ. References in the ''Constitui\u00e7\u00f5es Sinodais da Diocese de Angra'' (approved in 1559) by the [[Bishop of Angra]], [[Friar]] Jorge de Santiago show that some attention was given to the cults by the episcopal authorities.\n\nThe existence of the '''''Irmandades do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo''''' ({{lang-en|Brotherhoods of the Divine Holy Spirit}}) were first noted in the 16th century. The first hospital constructed in the Azores (1498), under the Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia of Angra, received its current name, the Hospital do Santo Esp\u00edrito. The distribution of food (meats, bread, milk) was already an important part of the charity common in the middle of the 16th century.\n\nFrom then on, and in particular after the beginning of the 18th century, the cult of the Holy Spirit assumed a position of importance in Azorean culture, becoming a unifier of the population in the various islands. With Azorean emigration, the cult was transplanted to Brazil, where by the end of the 18th century there existed feast days in [[Rio de Janeiro]], in [[Bahia]], and other zones where Azorean immigrants settled, such as [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Pernambuco]]. In the 19th century, the traditions spread to [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Hawaii]], Connecticut and [[California]] in the United States, as well as to [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], and [[British Columbia]] in Canada.\n\nThe Feast of the Empire of the Divine Holy Spirit was also celebrated on board of the ''naus'' on their way to Brazil and to [[Portuguese India Armadas|India]], during the 16th century. In a letter sent to Italy from Goa (India), the Jesuit missionary Fulvio Gregori reports: \"The Portuguese used to elect an Emperor by the Feast of Pentecost and it was so also in this ship St. Francisco. Indeed, they chose a boy as Emperor on the eve of Pentecost, in the midst of great pomp. They dressed him very richly and then put on his head the imperial crown. They also chose for him lords and officers at orders, so that the captain was appointed overseer over his house, another gentleman was appointed cupbearer, each with his office at the disposal of the Emperor. Even the officers of the ship joined in, the master, the pilot, etc. Then, on the day of Pentecost (Easter or Holy Spirit), all dressed to perfection, at an altar on the bow of the ship, where there was more space, with beautiful cloths and silverware, they led the Emperor to Mass, with music, drums and courtiers. There he was seated on a chair with velvet cushions, with a crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand, surrounded by his court, to the accompaniment of artillery salvos. The courtiers of the Emperor feasted and then, finally, served everyone here on board, around three hundred people.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portaldodivino.com/India/india.htm|title=O culto do Esp\u00edrito Santo nas naus da \u00cdndia.|publisher=Portaldodivino.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Spiritual tenets===\nGenerally, there are several prescribed tenets that organize this religious movement, that were derived from Joachimite dogma:\n* '''Hope''' (''{{lang-pt|esperan\u00e7a}}'') &mdash; the faithful seek the fulfillment of religious dogma that assumes a period of human spiritual development and brotherhood, and in which the Holy Spirit is the fountain of knowledge and order;\n*'''Faith in the Divine''' (''{{lang-pt|F\u00e9 no Divino}}'') &mdash; that the Holy Spirit is present in all places, it knows all and sees all, and the faithful recognize that there are no secrets from the Holy Spirit. Offenses are severely punitive; ''O Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo \u00e9 vingativo'' (''{{lang-en|The Holy Spirit is vengeful}}''), and holy vows/promises to God should be kept. [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit|Seven spiritual virtues]] guide the brotherhood of the faithful: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord.\n*'''Egalitarianism''' &mdash; all brothers are equal, and all can be ''mordomos'' (''{{lang-en|leader of the brotherhood}}''), and all may be crowned in their ritualized functions as the ''emperor'', receiving equal respect and obedience when invested with this authority: it is the practical application of the Joachimite principles.\n*'''Solidarity and Charity''' &mdash; in the distribution of alms (meat, soup and milk traditionally), the poor are privileged recipients who equally take part in the celebrations, while all offenses are pardoned in order to receive the Holy Spirit.\n*'''Autonomy from the Church'''; the cult of the Holy Spirit is not dependent on the formal organization of the Church, nor are the clergy needed to participate in the practices; there are no intermediaries between the devotees and the Divine. Over time, in practice, this tenet of Joachimite spirituality has become more obscure, as the Church plays a role in blessing the events (through processions to the local church and masses held auspiciously for the feast)\n\n==Imp\u00e9rios==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Imperio esp santo inocentes guarita (cropped).jpg \n| image2 = Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo da Serreta - Ilha Terceira - Portugal (16509600071).jpg  \n| image3 = Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo - Porto Martins.jpg \n| image4 = Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo - Quatro Ribeiras.jpg \n| footer = ''[[Cult_of_the_Holy_Spirit#Imp\u00e9rios|Imp\u00e9rios]]'' of the Cult of the Holy Spirit, found throughout the Azores.\n}}\nThe organization of the cult, with some variation between the islands, and between the Azorean diaspora includes the following structures:\n\n===Irmandade===\nThe '''Irmandade''' (''{{lang-en|Brotherhood}}'') is the organizational nucleus of the cult, comprising the ''brothers'', voluntarily registered (and accepted) and who are all equal in rights and responsibilities. Although they have historically been exclusively masculine, both women and men are accepted, as are members of different origins or titles. This rule was rarely violated, although on some islands there did exist ''Imp\u00e9rios dos nobres'', which only accepted ''brothers'' from the local aristocracy.<ref>The most recognized exception was the ''Imp\u00e9rio dos Nobres'' in [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]], on the island of [[Faial Island|Faial]], whose membership was composed of local nobility. Today, the responsibility of the Imp\u00e9rio is conferred in the local C\u00e2mara Municipal of Horta.</ref> Each ''irmandade'' is a territorial unit, constituted as local associations of neighbours, grouping families and residents from within a particular parish or locality. These groups have defined compromises, based on consensual rules that are not written, but recognized by the members. In cases where the diocese or authorities have attempted to impose or intervene in the businesses of these groups, there has generally been passive resistance and indignation from its members.\n\n===Imp\u00e9rio===\nEach ''irmandade'' is organized around the '''Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo''', normally a small structure, with a distinct architectural style where the faithful conduct their rituals. The architecture of the  '''Imp\u00e9rios''' varies from island to island; from simple tile-roofed buildings (such as in Santa Maria) to grande chapels with ornate facades and crowned with an imperial crown (in Terceira). It is used as a place to store the reliquaries, penants, symbols; to cook and/or distribute the offerings; and to perform some of the religious services associated with the event. The appearance of permanent ''imp\u00e9rios'' began in the last half of the 19th century, probably resulting from money remitted from emigrants in the Brazilian and/or Californian diaspora. Until this point, the cult would realize their services in ''treatros'', structures constructed principally for the events, that were later torn down. The Azorean diaspora, particularly those from New England and Canada, in addition to small structures, would construct larger enclosed salons owing to the conditions in these environments.\n\n===Mordomo===\nDuring each celebration, one member of the irmandade would receive the designation of ''mordomo'', which was normally made by drawing straws or name selection from a hat, usually by a young child.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p.170</ref> Many irmandades admit that voluntarism is common, when one of the brothers will make an offering or ''promessa'' (''{{lang-en|promise}}'') to the Holy Spirit, necessitating an act of benevolence and charity. The mordomo is responsible for coordinating the collection of funds for the feast, the organization of the event, the peoples invited, the purchase of meat, bread, wine, etc. and generally seen as the supreme authority of the brothers during the event.\n\n==Symbols==\n[[Image:Altar em honra do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo com Coroa, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|175px|right|An altar in honor of the Holy Spirit with Crown, an example from the island of S\u00e3o Jorge]]\n[[Image:Festas tradicionais que ocorrem em todas as 9 ilhas dos A\u00e7ores.

Coroa da Freguesia da Vila Nova, ilha Terceira, A\u00e7ores.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Crown, scepter and orb of the Holy Spirit]]\n{{See also|Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit}}\nThe rituals of the cult include various symbolic objects that are typically incorporated during the ceremonies; they include:\n* '''[[Crown (headgear)|Crown]], [[scepter]] and [[Sovereign's Orb|orb]]''' &mdash; these are most important symbols of the ''Imp\u00e9rio'', and assumes a central place during the celebrations. The crown is an imperial design, in silver, normally with four arms that meet at a golden orb (also in silver) surmounted by the dove of the Holy Spirit. Each crown comes with a silver scepter, again, surmounted with the dove of the Holy Spirit. In addition, the crown and scepters are decorated with ribbons of white, and mounted on a silver plate with a tall rest. The size of the crown varies, and in general, each ''irmandade'' may have one large and two smaller crowns, used to represent the Imp\u00e9rio of the Holy Spirit. In addition to being used in crowning ceremonies, it is considered an honor to transport the crown or let it remain in your home, which occurs with the brotherhood routinely. Throughout the years, the crown will circulate, remaining in a place of honor in the household, where nightly prayers would occur. Although, traditionally, the process of moving the crowns from household to household involved a cortege, escorted by the brotherhood, in modern times, the movement is not as ornamented.\n* '''Flag''' &mdash; the pennant, of brilliant red color, is a double-side quadrangular dimension (five palms on the side), knitted with a relief of the white dove of the Holy Spirit and rays of gold and white irradiating from its center. The flagstaff, made of wood, is two meters in height (although some are smaller or taller) surmounted with the dove of the Holy Spirit in tin or silver. The flag will accompany the crown and is always present in the liturgical ceremonies and crowning; it is an honor to be selected to carry the flag during the ceremonial cortege. A smaller flag is usually raised near the location of the crown, wherever it stays, and it is common to see white flags line the squares during the ceremonies.\n* '''Hymn''' &mdash; the ''Hino do Esp\u00edrito Santo'' (''{{lang-en|Hymn of the Holy Spirit}}''), composed at the end of the 19th century, is used by the bands and sung during the crowning ceremonies. Although primiarly used in these ceremonies, some of its chords have been inserted into the [[Hino dos A\u00e7ores|Hymn of the Azores]] (the regional national anthem).\n* '''Mace and ribbon''' &mdash; inspired by the [[ceremonial mace]]s carried traditionally by municipal judges or officials, the ceremony and cort\u00e8ge is accompanied by a variable number of [[mace-bearer]]s (but usually 12). The wooded maces, usually 1.5 meters in length, sometimes include a base for a candle, or surmounted with a tin or silver dove. During the cort\u00e8ge the mace-bearers surround the crown-bearer, in some cases the maces are joined together to form a rectangle, and the crown-bearer walks within the space. In some ''irmandades'' an extra mace  (sometimes painted in white) will be provided to an individual who will be responsible for maintaining the procession in good order. It is occasionally, referred colloquially as the ''\"enxota porcos\"'' ({{lang-en|pig incentive}}), likely a reference to a time when animals roamed the streets, and had to be forced to the side of the road.  The organization would normally select people who needed a position of honor: mostly young people.\n* '''Foli\u00f5es do Divino''' &mdash; a small group of about five musicians that sing hymns, accompanied by drum, cymbal, and tambourine, who visit the homes of the brotherhood.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 172</ref> They are also included in the transference of the crown, at the collection of donations, during the procession, the rituals and the distribution of offerings. On the island of [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]] as well as the area of Beira on [[S\u00e3o Jorge Island|S\u00e3o Jorge]], the ''foli\u00f5es'' are part of more complex rituals that have disappeared from other islands, involving the [[liturgy]] of the Holy Spirit.\n\n==Rituals==\n[[Image:Coroa\u00e7\u00e3o na Quinta de S\u00e3o Diogo, 1.\u00aa metade do S\u00e9culo XX.jpg|thumb|235px|left|A coronation ceremony in the first half of the 20th century]]\n\n===Procession===\nAlso, referred to as the '''cort\u00e8ge''', '''imp\u00e9rio''' or '''mudan\u00e7a''' ({{lang-en|the move}}); on Easter day, the crowns are transported to the church, where they are placed on the altar, until the end, when they ceremonially crown the recipient ('''coronation'''). The ''emperor'' will then depart for his home, accompanied by his cort\u00e8ge and the brotherhood, and led by the Holy Spirit's standard, the ''foli\u00f5es'', the crowns surrounded by the poles (in a rectangular form) and trailed by the faithful. Normally, a band will follow the cort\u00e8ge with cheerful processional music, although they may be accompanied alone by the ''Foli\u00f5es of the Divino''. Upon arriving at the emperor's home, the crowns are placed on an altar of honour of wood and adorned with white paper and flowers, to remain throughout the week. Every evening the neighbours and faith community gather at the home where traditionally some food and dancing may have occurred, but usually ends with the recitation of the rosary and benedictions to the Holy Spirit. On the following Sunday, the crowns depart once again with the cort\u00e8ge for the church, where they are received by the local parish priest, who recites the ''Magnificat'' (a traditional pastoral benediction). The process, traditionally, repeats itself until the seventh Sunday following Easter (referred to as the ''Domingo do Bodo''), and in some cases until the eighth Sunday following Easter (traditionally referred to as the ''Segundo Bodo'' or ''Domingo da Trindade'').<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 174</ref> The modern tradition, influenced by religious immigrants, is shortened to include a brief cort\u00e8ge procession (usually on the same day of the coronation), and ceremonial transfers of the crown to the home of the emperor, all performed throughout the summer.<ref>The shortened timeline was likely influenced by many immigrants who were limited to shorter vacations, most likely in the summer, but whom wished to follow the spirit of their traditions.</ref>\n\n===Coronation===\nThe '''[[coronation]]''' ({{lang-pt|coroa\u00e7\u00e3o}}) concludes the principal religious ceremonies and involves the placement of the silver crown on the head of the ''emperor'', or persons destined to hold it in the ceremony, by the parish priest.  Similarly, after ritually kissing the dove on the silver sceptre, the faithful are empowered to rise with the crowns while benedictions are made in the name of the Holy Spirit, while the hymn is played. Immediately following this ceremony, the cortege is reformed and proceeds to exit the church, with the priest singing the ''Magnificat'' once again.\n\n===Bodo===\nTraditionally, on the seventh Sunday following Easter ([[Pentecost]] Sunday) the faithful realize the '''bodo'''. On this day, the cort\u00e8ge, after leaving the church travel to the ''imp\u00e9rio'', where the Holy Spirit's standard and the crowns are placed in exhibition. In front of the imp\u00e9rio, on long bunks, are placed offerings or ''esmolas'' that, after being blessed, are distributed to the gathered. The brotherhood receive the people and invite them to freely partake of bread and wine, while meat, sugar pastries and ''massa sovada'' (traditional Portuguese sweet bread) are offered to the participants, organized by the mordomo. At the end of the Bodo, the crowns are collected and the cortege ferries them to the home of the mordomo. The Monday following this seventh Sunday of Easter, is Azores Day, or as it is traditionally known, the ''Dia da Pombinha'' ({{lang-en|Day of the Dove}}).\n\n====Esmola====\nThe ''esmola'' or ''pens\u00e3o'' ({{lang-en|charitable offering}}) is constituted by a portion of beef cattle (specifically killed for the event),  bread and ''vinho de cheiro'' (a high alcohol content wine derived from the Isabel caste grapes). It is distributed to the brotherhood, as well as the families in most need.\n\n===Fun\u00e7\u00e3o===\nThe ''function'', is the gathering of neighbors, family and friends for a ritualized meal that includes invited guests of the principal who took on a promise to the Holy Spirit.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 175</ref> The meal consists of the ''Holy Spirit Soup'', a meat broth that is applied to buttered bread and tempered with mint leaves, either accompanied with the cooked meat used in its preparation, Portuguese sweet bread and sweet rice puree sprinkled with cinnamon. There are many variations on the meat broth recipe that includes the methods of preparing the soup, the availability of side dishes or the consistency of the soup. On the island of Terceira, for example, the Holy Spirit Soup is accompanied by an ''alcatra'', a plate of meat cooked in red wine in an earthen pot. The ''function'' symbolizes community sharing, and occurs in the presence of the crowns and flag, accompanied by hymns to the Holy Spirit, normally led by the ''Foli\u00f5es''.\n\nToday, these functions are also held outside the normal religious context, on the Day of the Azores, during protocol receptions or more recently as tourist inspired events to promote the culture of the Azores (and uncommonly open to the public). The largest function recorded, occurred on 10 June 2000, when 8000 participants gathered on the Rua de S\u00e3o Pedro, in [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]], in the presence of the President of the Portuguese Republic, the Prime Minister and President of the Regional Government, as well as the accredited members of the Portuguese diplomatic corp and other invited dignitaries.\n\n====Brian\u00e7a====\nAs part of the rituals leading-up to the function, a cortege will also proceed through the community with a cow (which will later be slaughtered for the feast), decorated with colourful paper flowers and accompanied by the ''foli\u00f5es''.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), pp. 169, 174</ref> This secondary cortege, proceeding the events of the coronation and bodo, stops at the door of each family who contributes money, while hymns and chants are made, and the traditional ''brian\u00e7a'' music played.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 174</ref>\n\n====Ceia====\nThe '''ceia dos criadores''' is a dinner organized in honor of the farmers who have contributed [[Meat|animals for the meal]], or who have contributed gifts to the brotherhood.

Beyond the Azores, the Cult of the Holy Spirit is alive in parts of [[Brazil]] (where it was established three centuries ago) and pockets of Portuguese settlers in North America. The cult of the Holy Spirit involves traditional rituals and religious celebrations of these faith communities.\n\nIn its original sense, \"[[Cult (religious practice)|cult]]\" referred to an accepted religious practice, in sharp contrast to the term's modern, negative connotation. [[Catholic devotions|Devotion]] to the Holy Spirit is part of classical [[Catholic dogma]] and is the inspiration of several Catholic [[religious institute]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07416a.htm|title=John I. Murphy, \"Religious Congregations of the Holy Ghost\", in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1910)|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref> including the [[Spiritans]], but what is considered here has peculiar characteristics of its own.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Holy Spirit as Dove (detail).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The dove: iconographic symbol of the Holy Spirit]]\n\n===Joachimites===\nWorship of the [[Holy Spirit]] was promoted by [[Joachim of Fiore]],<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 170</ref> a [[millenarian]] prophet who, on the basis on his interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], postulated that 1260 would see the beginning of [[Joachim of Fiore#Theory of the three ages| A Third Age]]. (He himself died in 1202.) The Third Age would be governed by the Holy Spirit and would represent a monastic governance, in which the hierarchy of the Church would be unnecessary and infidels would unite with Christians. These theories became associated with the [[Fraticelli]] strand of the [[Franciscan|Franciscan Order]] and were condemned by [[Pope Alexander IV]] in 1256.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), pp.169\u2013170</ref>\n\n===Cult===\nTwo hundred years later, there was a rebirth of the popularity of the doctrines in the [[Azores]]; their religious manifestations, rituals and symbols began to permeate the islands and, consequently, persist until today. These acts of faith were heavily influenced by Franciscan spiritualists, who were members of the first religious order that colonized the Azores, and brought with them traditions that were being extinguished on the mainland by Catholic Church orthodoxy. Here, in isolated communities under environmental pressures and the uncertainties of life, the millenarian rites of the Holy Spirit were accepted and fostered. The Azores, and those communities that had their origins in the archipelago, became the last outposts of [[Joachimites|Joachimite]] doctrines.\n\nThe origins of the modern ''cult'' and its rituals are not definitively understood. The dominant theory postulates that the celebrations were introduced into Portugal by Queen [[Elizabeth of Portugal]].<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 169</ref> The cult's principal centre of devotion was in [[Tomar]], which was also the location of the priory of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], charged with the spirituality of newly discovered lands (including the Azores).  Another centre was [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]], where, in the first years of the 14th century, Queen Elizabeth introduced the first celebration of the ''Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo'' ({{lang-en|Empire of the Divine Holy Spirit}}), probably influenced by [[Franciscan]] spiritualists, who there founded the first Franciscan Convent in Portugal. From there the cult first spread in Portugal (Aldeia Galega, [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]], [[Sintra]], [[Tomar]], [[Lisbon]]), and later accompanied the Portuguese during their Atlantic discoveries.\n\nThe new colonies were, in the beginning, subordinate to the priory in Tomar, later the [[archbishop]] of [[Funchal]], and finally, the new [[Episcopal see|bishopric]] of [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]], which were overseen by the Order of Christ, who nominated new clerics, oriented the faithful and supervised the religious development. In this context, references to the proliferation of the cult of the Holy Spirit appeared early, and in a general way, throughout the archipelago. [[Gaspar Frutuoso]], writing 150 years after the beginning of the island's settlement, indicated that this devotion existed in all the islands; its expansion was tolerated, if not promoted, by the Order of Christ. References in the ''Constitui\u00e7\u00f5es Sinodais da Diocese de Angra'' (approved in 1559) by the [[Bishop of Angra]], [[Friar]] Jorge de Santiago show that some attention was given to the cults by the episcopal authorities.\n\nThe existence of the '''''Irmandades do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo''''' ({{lang-en|Brotherhoods of the Divine Holy Spirit}}) were first noted in the 16th century. The first hospital constructed in the Azores (1498), under the Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia of Angra, received its current name, the Hospital do Santo Esp\u00edrito. The distribution of food (meats, bread, milk) was already an important part of the charity common in the middle of the 16th century.\n\nFrom then on, and in particular after the beginning of the 18th century, the cult of the Holy Spirit assumed a position of importance in Azorean culture, becoming a unifier of the population in the various islands. With Azorean emigration, the cult was transplanted to Brazil, where by the end of the 18th century there existed feast days in [[Rio de Janeiro]], in [[Bahia]], and other zones where Azorean immigrants settled, such as [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Pernambuco]]. In the 19th century, the traditions spread to [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Hawaii]], Connecticut and [[California]] in the United States, as well as to [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], and [[British Columbia]] in Canada.\n\nThe Feast of the Empire of the Divine Holy Spirit was also celebrated on board of the ''naus'' on their way to Brazil and to [[Portuguese India Armadas|India]], during the 16th century. In a letter sent to Italy from Goa (India), the Jesuit missionary Fulvio Gregori reports: \"The Portuguese used to elect an Emperor by the Feast of Pentecost and it was so also in this ship St. Francisco. Indeed, they chose a boy as Emperor on the eve of Pentecost, in the midst of great pomp. They dressed him very richly and then put on his head the imperial crown. They also chose for him lords and officers at orders, so that the captain was appointed overseer over his house, another gentleman was appointed cupbearer, each with his office at the disposal of the Emperor. Even the officers of the ship joined in, the master, the pilot, etc. Then, on the day of Pentecost (Easter or Holy Spirit), all dressed to perfection, at an altar on the bow of the ship, where there was more space, with beautiful cloths and silverware, they led the Emperor to Mass, with music, drums and courtiers. There he was seated on a chair with velvet cushions, with a crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand, surrounded by his court, to the accompaniment of artillery salvos. The courtiers of the Emperor feasted and then, finally, served everyone here on board, around three hundred people.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portaldodivino.com/India/india.htm|title=O culto do Esp\u00edrito Santo nas naus da \u00cdndia.|publisher=Portaldodivino.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Spiritual tenets===\nGenerally, there are several prescribed tenets that organize this religious movement, that were derived from Joachimite dogma:\n* '''Hope''' (''{{lang-pt|esperan\u00e7a}}'') &mdash; the faithful seek the fulfillment of religious dogma that assumes a period of human spiritual development and brotherhood, and in which the Holy Spirit is the fountain of knowledge and order;\n*'''Faith in the Divine''' (''{{lang-pt|F\u00e9 no Divino}}'') &mdash; that the Holy Spirit is present in all places, it knows all and sees all, and the faithful recognize that there are no secrets from the Holy Spirit. Offenses are severely punitive; ''O Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo \u00e9 vingativo'' (''{{lang-en|The Holy Spirit is vengeful}}''), and holy vows/promises to God should be kept. [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit|Seven spiritual virtues]] guide the brotherhood of the faithful: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord.\n*'''Egalitarianism''' &mdash; all brothers are equal, and all can be ''mordomos'' (''{{lang-en|leader of the brotherhood}}''), and all may be crowned in their ritualized functions as the ''emperor'', receiving equal respect and obedience when invested with this authority: it is the practical application of the Joachimite principles.\n*'''Solidarity and Charity''' &mdash; in the distribution of alms (meat, soup and milk traditionally), the poor are privileged recipients who equally take part in the celebrations, while all offenses are pardoned in order to receive the Holy Spirit.\n*'''Autonomy from the Church'''; the cult of the Holy Spirit is not dependent on the formal organization of the Church, nor are the clergy needed to participate in the practices; there are no intermediaries between the devotees and the Divine. Over time, in practice, this tenet of Joachmite spirituality has become more obscure, as the Church plays a role in blessing the events (through processions to the local church and masses held auspiciously for the feast)\n\n==Imp\u00e9rios==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Imperio esp santo inocentes guarita (cropped).jpg \n| image2 = Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo da Serreta - Ilha Terceira - Portugal (16509600071).jpg  \n| image3 = Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo - Porto Martins.jpg \n| image4 = Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo - Quatro Ribeiras.jpg \n| footer = ''[[Cult_of_the_Holy_Spirit#Imp\u00e9rios|Imp\u00e9rios]]'' of the Cult of the Holy Spirit, found throughout the Azores.\n}}\nThe organization of the cult, with some variation between the islands, and between the Azorean diaspora includes the following structures:\n\n===Irmandade===\nThe '''Irmandade''' (''{{lang-en|Brotherhood}}'') is the organizational nucleus of the cult, comprising the ''brothers'', voluntarily registered (and accepted) and who are all equal in rights and responsibilities. Although they have historically been exclusively masculine, both women and men are accepted, as are members of different origins or titles. This rule was rarely violated, although on some islands there did exist ''Imp\u00e9rios dos nobres'', which only accepted ''brothers'' from the local aristocracy.<ref>The most recognized exception was the ''Imp\u00e9rio dos Nobres'' in [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]], on the island of [[Faial Island|Faial]], whose membership was composed of local nobility. Today, the responsibility of the Imp\u00e9rio is conferred in the local C\u00e2mara Municipal of Horta.</ref> Each ''irmandade'' is a territorial unit, constituted as local associations of neighbours, grouping families and residents from within a particular parish or locality. These groups have defined compromises, based on consensual rules that are not written, but recognized by the members. In cases where the diocese or authorities have attempted to impose or intervene in the businesses of these groups, there has generally been passive resistance and indignation from its members.\n\n===Imp\u00e9rio===\nEach ''irmandade'' is organized around the '''Imp\u00e9rio do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo''', normally a small structure, with a distinct architectural style where the faithful conduct their rituals. The architecture of the  '''Imp\u00e9rios''' varies from island to island; from simple tile-roofed buildings (such as in Santa Maria) to grande chapels with ornate facades and crowned with an imperial crown (in Terceira). It is used as a place to store the reliquaries, penants, symbols; to cook and/or distribute the offerings; and to perform some of the religious services associated with the event. The appearance of permanent ''imp\u00e9rios'' began in the last half of the 19th century, probably resulting from money remitted from emigrants in the Brazilian and/or Californian diaspora. Until this point, the cult would realize their services in ''treatros'', structures constructed principally for the events, that were later torn down. The Azorean diaspora, particularly those from New England and Canada, in addition to small structures, would construct larger enclosed salons owing to the conditions in these environments.\n\n===Mordomo===\nDuring each celebration, one member of the irmandade would receive the designation of ''mordomo'', which was normally made by drawing straws or name selection from a hat, usually by a young child.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p.170</ref> Many irmandades admit that voluntarism is common, when one of the brothers will make an offering or ''promessa'' (''{{lang-en|promise}}'') to the Holy Spirit, necessitating an act of benevolence and charity. The mordomo is responsible for coordinating the collection of funds for the feast, the organization of the event, the peoples invited, the purchase of meat, bread, wine, etc. and generally seen as the supreme authority of the brothers during the event.\n\n==Symbols==\n[[Image:Altar em honra do Divino Esp\u00edrito Santo com Coroa, ilha de S\u00e3o Jorge, A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|175px|right|An altar in honor of the Holy Spirit with Crown, an example from the island of S\u00e3o Jorge]]\n[[Image:Festas tradicionais que ocorrem em todas as 9 ilhas dos A\u00e7ores. Festa do Esp\u00edrito Santo. Coroa da Freguesia da Vila Nova, ilha Terceira, A\u00e7ores.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Crown, scepter and orb of the Holy Spirit]]\n{{See also|Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit}}\nThe rituals of the cult include various symbolic objects that are typically incorporated during the ceremonies; they include:\n* '''[[Crown (headgear)|Crown]], [[scepter]] and [[Sovereign's Orb|orb]]''' &mdash; these are most important symbols of the ''Imp\u00e9rio'', and assumes a central place during the celebrations. The crown is an imperial design, in silver, normally with four arms that meet at a golden orb (also in silver) surmounted by the dove of the Holy Spirit. Each crown comes with a silver scepter, again, surmounted with the dove of the Holy Spirit. In addition, the crown and scepters are decorated with ribbons of white, and mounted on a silver plate with a tall rest. The size of the crown varies, and in general, each ''irmandade'' may have one large and two smaller crowns, used to represent the Imp\u00e9rio of the Holy Spirit. In addition to being used in crowning ceremonies, it is considered an honor to transport the crown or let it remain in your home, which occurs with the brotherhood routinely. Throughout the years, the crown will circulate, remaining in a place of honor in the household, where nightly prayers would occur. Although, traditionally, the process of moving the crowns from household to household involved a cortege, escorted by the brotherhood, in modern times, the movement is not as ornamented.\n* '''Flag''' &mdash; the pennant, of brilliant red color, is a double-side quadrangular dimension (five palms on the side), knitted with a relief of the white dove of the Holy Spirit and rays of gold and white irradiating from its center. The flagstaff, made of wood, is two meters in height (although some are smaller or taller) surmounted with the dove of the Holy Spirit in tin or silver. The flag will accompany the crown and is always present in the liturgical ceremonies and crowning; it is an honor to be selected to carry the flag during the ceremonial cortege. A smaller flag is usually raised near the location of the crown, wherever it stays, and it is common to see white flags line the squares during the ceremonies.\n* '''Hymn''' &mdash; the ''Hino do Esp\u00edrito Santo'' (''{{lang-en|Hymn of the Holy Spirit}}''), composed at the end of the 19th century, is used by the bands and sung during the crowning ceremonies. Although primiarly used in these ceremonies, some of its chords have been inserted into the [[Hino dos A\u00e7ores|Hymn of the Azores]] (the regional national anthem).\n* '''Mace and ribbon''' &mdash; inspired by the [[ceremonial mace]]s carried traditionally by municipal judges or officials, the ceremony and cort\u00e8ge is accompanied by a variable number of [[mace-bearer]]s (but usually 12). The wooded maces, usually 1.5 meters in length, sometimes include a base for a candle, or surmounted with a tin or silver dove. During the cort\u00e8ge the mace-bearers surround the crown-bearer, in some cases the maces are joined together to form a rectangle, and the crown-bearer walks within the space. In some ''irmandades'' an extra mace  (sometimes painted in white) will be provided to an individual who will be responsible for maintaining the procession in good order. It is occasionally, referred colloquially as the ''\"enxota porcos\"'' ({{lang-en|pig incentive}}), likely a reference to a time when animals roamed the streets, and had to be forced to the side of the road.  The organization would normally select people who needed a position of honor: mostly young people.\n* '''Foli\u00f5es do Divino''' &mdash; a small group of about five musicians that sing hymns, accompanied by drum, cymbal, and tambourine, who visit the homes of the brotherhood.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 172</ref> They are also included in the transference of the crown, at the collection of donations, during the procession, the rituals and the distribution of offerings. On the island of [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]] as well as the area of Beira on [[S\u00e3o Jorge Island|S\u00e3o Jorge]], the ''foli\u00f5es'' are part of more complex rituals that have disappeared from other islands, involving the [[liturgy]] of the Holy Spirit.\n\n==Rituals==\n[[Image:Coroa\u00e7\u00e3o na Quinta de S\u00e3o Diogo, 1.\u00aa metade do S\u00e9culo XX.jpg|thumb|235px|left|A coronation ceremony in the first half of the 20th century]]\n\n===Procession===\nAlso, referred to as the '''cort\u00e8ge''', '''imp\u00e9rio''' or '''mudan\u00e7a''' ({{lang-en|the move}}); on Easter day, the crowns are transported to the church, where they are placed on the altar, until the end, when they ceremonially crown the recipient ('''coronation'''). The ''emperor'' will then depart for his home, accompanied by his cort\u00e8ge and the brotherhood, and led by the Holy Spirit's standard, the ''foli\u00f5es'', the crowns surrounded by the poles (in a rectangular form) and trailed by the faithful. Normally, a band will follow the cort\u00e8ge with cheerful processional music, although they may be accompanied alone by the ''Foli\u00f5es of the Divino''. Upon arriving at the emperor's home, the crowns are placed on an altar of honour of wood and adorned with white paper and flowers, to remain throughout the week. Every evening the neighbours and faith community gather at the home where traditionally some food and dancing may have occurred, but usually ends with the recitation of the rosary and benedictions to the Holy Spirit. On the following Sunday, the crowns depart once again with the cort\u00e8ge for the church, where they are received by the local parish priest, who recites the ''Magnificat'' (a traditional pastoral benediction). The process, traditionally, repeats itself until the seventh Sunday following Easter (referred to as the ''Domingo do Bodo''), and in some cases until the eighth Sunday following Easter (traditionally referred to as the ''Segundo Bodo'' or ''Domingo da Trindade'').<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 174</ref> The modern tradition, influenced by religious immigrants, is shortened to include a brief cort\u00e8ge procession (usually on the same day of the coronation), and ceremonial transfers of the crown to the home of the emperor, all performed throughout the summer.<ref>The shortened timeline was likely influenced by many immigrants who were limited to shorter vacations, most likely in the summer, but whom wished to follow the spirit of their traditions.</ref>\n\n===Coronation===\nThe '''[[coronation]]''' ({{lang-pt|coroa\u00e7\u00e3o}}) concludes the principal religious ceremonies and involves the placement of the silver crown on the head of the ''emperor'', or persons destined to hold it in the ceremony, by the parish priest.  Similarly, after ritually kissing the dove on the silver sceptre, the faithful are empowered to rise with the crowns while benedictions are made in the name of the Holy Spirit, while the hymn is played. Immediately following this ceremony, the cortege is reformed and proceeds to exit the church, with the priest singing the ''Magnificat'' once again.\n\n===Bodo===\nTraditionally, on the seventh Sunday following Easter ([[Pentecost]] Sunday) the faithful realize the '''bodo'''. On this day, the cort\u00e8ge, after leaving the church travel to the ''imp\u00e9rio'', where the Holy Spirit's standard and the crowns are placed in exhibition. In front of the imp\u00e9rio, on long bunks, are placed offerings or ''esmolas'' that, after being blessed, are distributed to the gathered. The brotherhood receive the people and invite them to freely partake of bread and wine, while meat, sugar pastries and ''massa sovada'' (traditional Portuguese sweet bread) are offered to the participants, organized by the mordomo. At the end of the Bodo, the crowns are collected and the cortege ferries them to the home of the mordomo. The Monday following this seventh Sunday of Easter, is Azores Day, or as it is traditionally known, the ''Dia da Pombinha'' ({{lang-en|Day of the Dove}}).\n\n====Esmola====\nThe ''esmola'' or ''pens\u00e3o'' ({{lang-en|charitable offering}}) is constituted by a portion of beef cattle (specifically killed for the event),  bread and ''vinho de cheiro'' (a high alcohol content wine derived from the Isabel caste grapes). It is distributed to the brotherhood, as well as the families in most need.\n\n===Fun\u00e7\u00e3o===\nThe ''function'', is the gathering of neighbors, family and friends for a ritualized meal that includes invited guests of the principal who took on a promise to the Holy Spirit.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 175</ref> The meal consists of the ''Holy Spirit Soup'', a meat broth that is applied to buttered bread and tempered with mint leaves, either accompanied with the cooked meat used in its preparation, Portuguese sweet bread and sweet rice puree sprinkled with cinnamon. There are many variations on the meat broth recipe that includes the methods of preparing the soup, the availability of side dishes or the consistency of the soup. On the island of Terceira, for example, the Holy Spirit Soup is accompanied by an ''alcatra'', a plate of meat cooked in red wine in an earthen pot. The ''function'' symbolizes community sharing, and occurs in the presence of the crowns and flag, accompanied by hymns to the Holy Spirit, normally led by the ''Foli\u00f5es''.\n\nToday, these functions are also held outside the normal religious context, on the Day of the Azores, during protocol receptions or more recently as tourist inspired events to promote the culture of the Azores (and uncommonly open to the public). The largest function recorded, occurred on 10 June 2000, when 8000 participants gathered on the Rua de S\u00e3o Pedro, in [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]], in the presence of the President of the Portuguese Republic, the Prime Minister and President of the Regional Government, as well as the accredited members of the Portuguese diplomatic corp and other invited dignitaries.\n\n====Brian\u00e7a====\nAs part of the rituals leading-up to the function, a cortege will also proceed through the community with a cow (which will later be slaughtered for the feast), decorated with colourful paper flowers and accompanied by the ''foli\u00f5es''.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), pp. 169, 174</ref> This secondary cortege, proceeding the events of the coronation and bodo, stops at the door of each family who contributes money, while hymns and chants are made, and the traditional ''brian\u00e7a'' music played.<ref>Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 174</ref>\n\n====Ceia====\nThe '''ceia dos criadores''' is a dinner organized in honor of the farmers who have contributed [[Meat|animals for the meal]], or who have contributed gifts to the brotherhood.

The Carlist Wars had a strong regional component ([[Southern Basque Country|Basque region]], [[Catalonia]], etc.), given that the new order called into question region\u2013specific law arrangements and customs kept for centuries.\n\nWhen [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] died in 1833, his fourth wife [[Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Maria Cristina]] became Queen Regent on behalf of their  infant daughter [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]].
