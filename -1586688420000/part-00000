A contemporary version of the argument originally given by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] in ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' (i.e., that he could not trust his perceptions on the grounds that an [[evil demon]] might, conceivably, be controlling his every experience), the ''brain in a vat'' is the idea that a brain can be fooled into anything when fed appropriate stimuli.\n\nThe inherently philosophical idea has also become a staple of many [[science fiction]] stories, with many such stories involving a [[mad scientist]] who might remove a person's [[brain]] from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and connect its [[neurons]] by wires to a supercomputer which would provide it with electrical impulses identical to those the brain normally receives. According to such science fiction stories, the computer would then be simulating a [[virtual reality]] (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the person with the \"disembodied\" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences without these being related to objects or events in the real world.\n\nNo such procedure in humans has ever been reported by a research paper in a scholarly journal, or other reliable source. Also, the ability to send external electric signals to the brain of a sort that the brain can interpret, and the ability to communicate thoughts or perceptions to any external entity by wire, is, except for very basic commands, well beyond current (2017) technology.\n\n== Grown ==\nIn 2004 Thomas DeMarse and Karl Dockendorf made an \"adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf |title=Thomas DeMarse, Karl Dockendorf, ''Adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays'' |access-date=2009-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042943/http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041022104658.htm Brain in a dish acts as autopilot, living computer], Science Daily. 22 October 2004.</ref>\n\nTeams at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Reading have created neurological entities integrated with a robot body.

After his death Dowell himself becomes a subject of such an experiment.\n*The [[Mi-go]] aliens in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], first appearing in the story \"[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]\" (1931), can transport humans from Earth to [[Pluto]] (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's brain and placing it into a \"brain cylinder\", which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak.\n*In [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s ''[[Captain Future]]'' novels series (1940), the character Prof. Simon Wright is a human brain living in a transparent case.\n*In ''[[Donovan's Brain]]'' (see term), the 1942 science fiction novel by [[Curt Siodmak]] (filmed three times in different versions: 1944, 1953 and 1962), the brain of a ruthless millionaire is kept alive in a tank where it grows to monstrous proportions and powers.\n*The final novel in [[C.S. Lewis]]'s \"[[Space Trilogy]]\", ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' (1945), uses the isolated brain of Francois Alcasan, an Algerian radiologist guillotined for murder, as a plot device. At some point in the novel, it is revealed that Alcasan's artificially-perfused head is used to allow evil intelligence to communicate with humans directly.\n*In [[Roald Dahl]]'s short story \"[[William and Mary (short story)|William and Mary]]\" (1960), after William's death his brain is kept alive on an artificial heart.<ref name=vice1/>\n*In [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'' (1963), the character [[A Wrinkle in Time#IT|IT]] is a disembodied telepathic brain that dominates the planet of Camazotz.\n*The [[Humans as Gods#Ruinators|Ruinators]], later known as the Demiurges, are the immensely cyborgized alien society in ''[[Humans as Gods]]'', the 1966\u20131977 sci-fi trilogy by [[Sergey Snegov]]. They use the isolated brains of the highly intelligent species [[Humans as Gods#Galaxians|Galaxians]] as the organic supercomputers in charge of the [[Humans as Gods#Metrics Stations|Metrics Stations]], the primary and most secret military defense structure of the Ruinators' Empire. The brains are being extracted from the prisoners' babies and grown artificially in the spheres filled with the nutrient liquid. Among the most important characters of the second and third novels comes the [[Humans as Gods#Vagrant|Brain of the Third Planet]], later known as [[Vagrant]] or Voice, who has somehow developed self-consciousness and later rebelled against the Ruinators. Due to the Vagrant's fervent desire for a life of those embodied, the Brain has been surgically put into a dragon's body, whose inherent brain was destroyed in a recent battle. Vagrant enjoyed a sentient dragon's life for a few decades after that, until the body grew too senile, and on the threshold of the dragon's death the brain was removed again to assume control over a starship.<ref name=vice1/>\n*In the 1971 novel ''[[Gray Matters (novel)|Gray Matters]]'' by [[William Hjortsberg]], the protagonist and his acquaintances are all disembodied brains, preserved underground after a nuclear war.\n*In the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' prequel trilogy to the novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', [[cymek]]s are disembodied brains that wear robotic bodies.\n*In [[P.

In the episode \"[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]\", the Providers are disembodied brains that kidnap individuals in order to force them to fight against each other.  Later, in the episode \"[[Spock's Brain]]\", [[Spock|Mr. Spock's]] brain is removed by a native of the Sigma Draconis system in order to serve as the Eymorg Controller. Due to Vulcan physiology, Spock's body remains alive. The crew of the ''Enterprise'' follow an ion trail to Sigma Draconis VI where, using the knowledge of the Eymorg, Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]] is able to restore Spock's brain to his body.\n*Isolated brains also appear in ''[[The Wild Wild West]]''.  In the episode \"[[The Night of the Druid's Blood]]\", one of [[James West's]] old tutors is killed and West discovers that it is Dr Tristam who has removed the brains from the bodies and is forcing them to work for him.  Finally West manages to communicate to the isolated brains that if they all work together they can destroy Dr Tristam and have peace.\n*In the 1970s ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'', Solon, an authority on micro-surgical techniques, transplants Morbius's brain into an artificial translucent brain cylinder casing.  Additionally, in the modern ''Doctor Who'' series (2005\u2013present), the recurring antagonists known as the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] are presented as human brains (in [[The Pandorica Opens|one instance]], an entire human head) encased in mechanical exoskeletons, connected by an artificial nervous system; this is ostensibly done as an \"upgrade\" from the comparatively fragile human body to a far more durable and longer-lasting shell. Another group of modern ''Doctor Who'' foes, the [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Toclafane|Toclafane]], were revealed to be human heads encased in flying, weaponized spheres, the final forms of humans from the far future who turned to desperate measures in order to survive the conditions of the impending [[heat death of the universe]].\n*In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\" and \"[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]\", [[Cassandra (Doctor Who)|Lady Cassandra]] is an isolated brain attached to a canvas of skin with a face.\n*The mad scientist in the French film ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' has a \"brain in a vat\" for a companion.\n*In ''[[RoboCop 2]]'', the brain, eyes, and much of the nervous system of the Detroit drug lord Cain is harvested by OCP officials to use in their plans for an upgraded \"RoboCop 2\" [[cyborg]]. These systems are stored in a vat shortly after the surgery, where the disembodied Cain can still see the remains of his former body being discarded before being placed into the fitted robotic skeleton.\n*[[Observer (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Observer]] from ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' carries his brain in a [[Petri dish]].\n*In the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', numerous technological advances have been made by the 31st century. The ability to keep heads alive in jars was invented by [[Ron Popeil]] (who has a guest cameo in \"[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]\") and also apparently [[Dick Clark]] of [[Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve]] fame still doing the countdown in the year 2999, has resulted in many political figures and celebrities being active; this became the writers' excuse to feature and poke fun at celebrities in the show. In \"[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]\" the Big Brain, an isolated brain and leader of the Brainspawn, is outwitted by Fry. The brain's disciples have been attempting to dumb down every lifeform they meet to enable them to steal all the universe's data and hoard it in the infosphere.<ref name=vice1/>\n* In the animated series ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'', the main character Hector Con Carne was reduced to a brain and a stomach in two jars. Both of them are able to move and talk, even without jars. Hector's brain sometimes controls the bear Boskov while Hector's stomach digests parts of Boskov's food.\n*The [[science fantasy]] [[television series]] ''[[LEXX]]'' includes a robot head containing human brain tissue. Also whenever the current Divine Shadow body dies his brain is removed and placed in a device that allows him to speak and kept with rest of the Divine Predecessors.\n*In the movie ''[[Blood Diner]]'', two cannibal brothers bring their uncle's (isolated) brain back to life to help them in their quest to restore life to the five-million-year-old goddess Shitaar. Their uncle's brain instructs them to collect the required parts to resurrecting Shitaar \u2013 virgins, assorted body parts, and the ingredients for a \"blood buffet\".\n*In the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[comedy film]] ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'', the [[protagonist]], a pioneering [[neurosurgeon]], falls in love with a disembodied brain that was able to communicate with him [[Telepathy|telepathically]].\n*''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' episode \"[[The Brain of Colonel Barham]]\" details the story of a dying [[astronaut]], Colonel Barham. It is decided to separate his brain from his body and keep it alive, with neural implants connecting it to visual and audio input/output for the mission.

A brainship is made by inserting the disembodied brain and nervous system or malformed body of a human being into a life-support system, and connecting it surgically to a series of computers via delicate synaptic connections (a [[brain\u2013computer interface]]). The brain \"feels\" the ship (or any other connected peripherals) as part of its own body. An example, ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' (1969) short story collection by science fiction author [[Anne McCaffrey]] is about the brainship ''Helva''. \"[[Mr. Spaceship]]\" (1959)  is an earlier story by Phillip K.

A contemporary version of the argument originally given by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] in ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' (i.e., that he could not trust his perceptions on the grounds that an [[evil demon]] might, conceivably, be controlling his every experience), the ''brain in a vat'' is the idea that a brain can be fooled into anything when fed appropriate stimuli.\n\nThe inherently philosophical idea has also become a staple of many [[science fiction]] stories, with many such stories involving a [[mad scientist]] who might remove a person's [[brain]] from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and connect its [[neurons]] by wires to a supercomputer which would provide it with electrical impulses identical to those the brain normally receives. According to such science fiction stories, the computer would then be simulating a [[virtual reality]] (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the person with the \"disembodied\" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences without these being related to objects or events in the real world.\n\nNo such procedure in humans has ever been reported by a research paper in a scholarly journal, or other reliable source. Also, the ability to send external electric signals to the brain of a sort that the brain can interpret, and the ability to communicate thoughts or perceptions to any external entity by wire, is, except for very basic commands, well beyond current (2017) technology.\n\n== Grown ==\nIn 2004 Thomas DeMarse and Karl Dockendorf made an \"adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf |title=Thomas DeMarse, Karl Dockendorf, ''Adaptive flight control with living neuronal networks on microelectrode arrays'' |access-date=2009-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042943/http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041022104658.htm Brain in a dish acts as autopilot, living computer], Science Daily. 22 October 2004.</ref>\n\nTeams at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Reading have created neurological entities integrated with a robot body.

Additionally, in the modern ''Doctor Who'' series (2005\u2013present), the recurring antagonists known as the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] are presented as human brains (in [[The Pandorica Opens|one instance]], an entire human head) encased in mechanical exoskeletons, connected by an artificial nervous system; this is ostensibly done as an \"upgrade\" from the comparatively fragile human body to a far more durable and longer-lasting shell. Another group of modern ''Doctor Who'' foes, the [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Toclafane|Toclafane]], were revealed to be human heads encased in flying, weaponized spheres, the final forms of humans from the far future who turned to desperate measures in order to survive the conditions of the impending [[heat death of the universe]].\n*In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\" and \"[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]\", [[Cassandra (Doctor Who)|Lady Cassandra]] is an isolated brain attached to a canvas of skin with a face.\n*The mad scientist in the French film ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' has a \"brain in a vat\" for a companion.\n*In ''[[RoboCop 2]]'', the brain, eyes, and much of the nervous system of the Detroit drug lord Cain is harvested by OCP officials to use in their plans for an upgraded \"RoboCop 2\" [[cyborg]]. These systems are stored in a vat shortly after the surgery, where the disembodied Cain can still see the remains of his former body being discarded before being placed into the fitted robotic skeleton.\n*[[Observer (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Observer]] from ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' carries his brain in a [[Petri dish]].\n*In the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', numerous technological advances have been made by the 31st century. The ability to keep heads alive in jars was invented by [[Ron Popeil]] (who has a guest cameo in \"[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]\") and also apparently [[Dick Clark]] of [[Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve]] fame still doing the countdown in the year 2999, has resulted in many political figures and celebrities being active; this became the writers' excuse to feature and poke fun at celebrities in the show. In \"[[The Day the Earth Stood Stupid]]\" the Big Brain, an isolated brain and leader of the Brainspawn, is outwitted by Fry. The brain's disciples have been attempting to dumb down every lifeform they meet to enable them to steal all the universe's data and hoard it in the infosphere.<ref name=vice1/>\n* In the animated series ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'', the main character Hector Con Carne was reduced to a brain and a stomach in two jars. Both of them are able to move and talk, even without jars. Hector's brain sometimes controls the bear Boskov while Hector's stomach digests parts of Boskov's food.\n*The [[science fantasy]] [[television series]] ''[[LEXX]]'' includes a robot head containing human brain tissue. Also whenever the current Divine Shadow body dies his brain is removed and placed in a device that allows him to speak and kept with rest of the Divine Predecessors.\n*In the movie ''[[Blood Diner]]'', two cannibal brothers bring their uncle's (isolated) brain back to life to help them in their quest to restore life to the five-million-year-old goddess Shitaar. Their uncle's brain instructs them to collect the required parts to resurrecting Shitaar \u2013 virgins, assorted body parts, and the ingredients for a \"blood buffet\".\n*In the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[comedy film]] ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'', the [[protagonist]], a pioneering [[neurosurgeon]], falls in love with a disembodied brain that was able to communicate with him [[Telepathy|telepathically]].\n*''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' episode \"[[The Brain of Colonel Barham]]\" details the story of a dying [[astronaut]], Colonel Barham. It is decided to separate his brain from his body and keep it alive, with neural implants connecting it to visual and audio input/output for the mission. But without a body, the brain becomes extremely powerful and megalomaniacal.\n* The 2011 web series ''[[The Mercury Men]]'' features a brain in a jar<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weprin|first1=Alex|title=Syfy Picks Up Original Web Series 'The Mercury Men'|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/syfy-picks-up-original-web-series-the-mercury-men/12549|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=21 January 2011}}</ref> (\"The Battery\") that can communicate telepathically and over a walkie-talkie-like devices and is revealed to control the \"mercury men\" for a catastrophic plan to destroy Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mercury Men Are Here|url=http://www.needcoffee.com/2011/09/12/mercury-men/|website=needcoffee.com|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=2011-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Randy|title=The Mercury Men|url=http://www.fanfilmfollies.com/featured/the-mercury-men|website=fanfilmfollies.com|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=2012-02-03}}</ref>\n*The [[List of Wonder Woman episodes#Season 3 (1978\u201379)|Wonder Woman]] episode \"Gault's Brain\" features the classic \"brain in a vat\".\n\n=== Comics ===\n* ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #62 (Dec. 1940) had the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] battle a human brain in a vat that had developed enormous powers and become mobile and sprouted an arm.\n* [[The Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]] Annual #1 (1987) had the inhabitants of Trudeau, [[South Dakota]], reduced to disembodied brains by the [[Word-Bringer]].\n\n===Anime and manga===\n* Many people in the ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' manga and anime franchise possess [[cyberbrain]]s, which can sustain a modified human brain within a cybernetic body indefinitely.\n\n===Video games===\n* In the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'']] series of games, isolated brains are used to control robots called \"Robobrains\".<ref name=vice1>{{cite web|title=The Top 5 Fictional Characters That Are Literally Just Brains|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-top-5-fictional-characters-that-are-literally-just-brains|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=2015-06-12}}</ref> In the ''Old World Blues'' downloadable content for the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' a group of scientists, dubbed the \"Think Tank\", have a more advanced version of the technology.\n* The video game ''[[Cortex Command]]'' revolves around the idea of brains being separated from physical bodies, and used to control units on a battlefield.\n* The Mother Brain from the game ''[[Metroid]]''.<ref name=vice1/>\n\n===Other===\n*A [[brainship]] is a fictional concept of an interstellar starship. A brainship is made by inserting the disembodied brain and nervous system or malformed body of a human being into a life-support system, and connecting it surgically to a series of computers via delicate synaptic connections (a [[brain\u2013computer interface]]). The brain \"feels\" the ship (or any other connected peripherals) as part of its own body. An example, ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' (1969) short story collection by science fiction author [[Anne McCaffrey]] is about the brainship ''Helva''. \"[[Mr. Spaceship]]\" (1959)  is an earlier story by Phillip K. Dick about a brainship. \n*The B'omarr Monks, of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' Universe, would surgically remove their brains from their bodies and continue their existence as a brain in a jar. They believe that cutting themselves off from civilization and all corporeal distractions leads to enlightenment. These monks are easily identified in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' as the spider-like creature that walks past [[C-3PO]] as he enters [[Jabba\u2019s Palace]].<ref>{{cite web|title=THE 7 CREEPIEST, FREAKIEST DENIZENS OF JABBA'S PALACE|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-7-creepiest-freakiest-denizens-of-jabbas-palace|accessdate=26 July 2016|date=2015-07-23}}</ref>\n* [[Krang]] from ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.<ref name=vice1/>\n*The [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'']] game supplement ''Monstrous Compendium'' MC15: ''[[Ravenloft]] Appendix II: Children of the Night'' (1993) features Rudolph Von Aubrecker, a living brain and villain character.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Locked-in syndrome]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*{{cite book\n| last =Fleming\n| first =Chet\n|date=February 1988\n| title = If We Can Keep a Severed Head Alive...Discorporation and U.S. Patent 4,666,425\n| publisher = [[Polinym Press]]\n| isbn = 978-0-942287-02-8\n| title-link =Head transplant\n}}\n* Librizzi L, Janigro D, De Biasi S, de Curtis M.
