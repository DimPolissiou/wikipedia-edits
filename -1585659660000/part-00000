Disney wanted to produce a television program to finance the development of the Disneyland amusement park. After being turned down by both [[CBS]] and [[NBC]], Disney eventually signed a deal with ABC (which had merged with [[United Paramount Theaters]] in 1953) on March 29, 1954. The show contained teasers for Walt's park, as well as episodes representing life in one of the park's main sections: [[Adventureland (Disney)|Adventureland]], [[Tomorrowland]], [[Fantasyland]], and [[Frontierland]], with the opening titles used from its inception until the show's move to NBC in 1961, showing the entrance to Disneyland itself, as well as the four aforementioned lands, one of which was then identified as the main feature of that evening's program.\n\nConsequently, \"Davy Crockett\" and other pioneers of the Old West, and American history in general, appeared in \"Frontier Land\". Similarly, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' might be the focus of an evening spent in \"Adventure Land\", although a documentary on the film could also be possibly presented as a topic for such episodes, including clips from the actual film. Topics for \"Fantasy Land\" would include either actual cartoons, and animated films, or documentaries on \"The Making of ...\" (such as behind-the-scenes presentation of [[Peggy Lee]] singing the duet of the wicked Siamese cats in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', or the barbershop quartet of lost dogs in the municipal Dog Pound); excerpts from a ''[[True-Life Adventures|True-Life Adventure]]'' documentary may also be included (for example, one on the life and works of [[beaver]]s and their dam-building) or those using [[Stroboscopic effect|stroboscopic]] stop-action photography (such as investigating what really happened when a rain-drop fell in a puddle, as part of a \"Fantasy Land\" episode), explaining the techniques of cartoon animation. The multiplane camera used to create the three-dimensional effects of ''[[Bambi]]'' was also as a topic for a \"Fantasy Land\"-set telecast. In one episode, four different artists were given the task of drawing the same tree, with each artist using his own preferred ways of drawing and imagining a tree;{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} this led to cartoon examples of differently animated trees, as in some of the early ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' shorts, and later full-length animated films. \"Tomorrow Land\" was an opportunity for the Disney studio staff to present cutting-edge science and technology, and to predict possible futures, such as futuristic automobiles and highways. This format remained basically unchanged through the 1980s, though new material was scarce in later years. Other episodes were segments from Disney films such as ''[[Seal Island (film)|Seal Island]]'' and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', or cartoons of [[Donald Duck]] and other Disney standbys.\n\nThe program spawned the [[Davy Crockett]] craze of 1955 with the airing of a three-episode series (not shown over the course of consecutive weeks) about the historical American frontiersman, starring [[Fess Parker]] in the title role. Millions of dollars of merchandise relating to the title character were sold, and the theme song, \"[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]\", became a hit record that year. Three historically based hour-long programs aired during late 1954/early 1955, and were followed up by two dramatized installments the following year. The TV episodes were later edited into two theatrical films.\n\nOn July 17, 1955, the opening of Disneyland was covered on a live television special, ''Dateline: Disneyland'',<ref name=\"epguides.com\"/> which is not technically considered to be part of the series. It was hosted by [[Art Linkletter]], with whom Walt Disney had worked out a deal prior to the opening to allow Linkletter to lease a shop on Main Street in return for the broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiecEZdR0aI|title=Extinct Attractions: Disney Legend Art Linkletter with David Oneal part 1|first=|last=David Oneal|date=February 11, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Art Linkletter was assisted by [[Bob Cummings]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and the program featured various other guests, including various appearances of Walt himself as he dedicated the various lands of Disneyland.<ref name=\"Cotter\">{{cite book|title=The Wonderful World of Disney Television|author=Bill Cotter|publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]|year=1997|location=New York|page = 17|isbn=0-7868-6359-5}}</ref>\n\n===''Walt Disney Presents'' (1958\u20131961)===\nIn 1958, the series was retitled ''Walt Disney Presents''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Tim |last2=Marsh |first2=Earle |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |date=2007 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York|isbn=9780345497734|page=1482 |edition=9th |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&pg=PA1482&dq=%22walt+disney+presents%22+brooks+marsh#v=onepage&q=%22walt%20disney%20presents%22%20brooks%20marsh&f=false |accessdate=2017-11-12}}</ref> and moved to a Friday-night timeslot; by 1960, ABC had switched it to Sunday nights, where it remained for 21 years. During this iteration, ''The Peter Tchaikovsky Story,'' an episode made to promote Walt's latest animated feature, ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', was one of the first stereo [[simulcast]]s on TV; in this case it was 3 channel stereo. FM radio stations across the country carried the left channel at the same time as ABC broadcast the TV show in mono, which served as a center channel, and AM radio stations broadcast the right channel. In the second half of the show, a lengthy clip of ''Sleeping Beauty'' was shown, with its 6 channels (70mm version) mixed down into 3 for the broadcast. Walt apparently wanted people to see ''Sleeping Beauty'' in 70&nbsp;mm, so, in the introduction, he explained the difference between 35&nbsp;mm and 70&nbsp;mm and held up a card with both sizes on it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Peter Tchaikovsky Story (Television)|url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/peter-tchaikovsky-story-the-television/|website=[[D23 (Disney)|D23]]|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=December 22, 2016}}</ref> In addition to episodes devoted to the latest additions at Disneyland, many episodes during this period were Westerns such as \"[[Texas John Slaughter (TV series)|Texas John Slaughter]]\" and \"[[Elfego Baca#Walt Disney television series|Elfego Baca]]\", while others talked about the [[NASA|United States' burgeoning efforts to explore outer space]] and others, such as \"[[Moochie of the Little League]]\", were set in the then-present day. Some episodes even mixed live-action and animation, showing Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket talking with Walt himself, while one 1959 episode turned the spotlight on Chip 'n' Dale, combining their theatrical cartoons with mixed media wrap-around footage.\n\n===''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' (1961\u20131969)===\nAlthough the basic format remained the same, the series moved to [[NBC]] on September 24, 1961, to take advantage of that network's ability to broadcast programming in [[color television|color]].<ref name=\"epguides.com\"/> In addition, Walt Disney's relationship with ABC had soured as the network resisted selling its stake in the theme park before doing so in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronology of Disneyland Theme Park (1960\u20131965)|url=http://kpolsson.com/disland/dl1960.htm|website=Kpolsson.com|date=February 1, 1956|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> In a display of foresight, Disney had filmed many of the earlier shows in color, allowing them to easily be repeated on NBC; since all but three of Disney's feature-length films were also made in color (the three [[black-and-white]] exceptions were ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'', and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'', all family comedies starring [[Fred MacMurray]]), they could now also be telecast in that format.\n\nTo emphasize the new feature, the series was retitled ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' when NBC began airing it,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of Color Television|url=http://161.58.97.168/200111/11114c01.html|website=161.58.9.168|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> retaining that moniker until 1969, by which time the [[Big Three television networks|big three networks]] were all broadcasting in color. The first NBC episode even dealt with the principles of color, as explained by a new character named [[Ludwig Von Drake]] (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]), a bumbling professor with a thick German accent, who was the uncle of [[Donald Duck]]. Von Drake was the first Disney character created specifically for television.\n\n[[Image:Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' title sequence]]\nWalt Disney died on December 15, 1966, 12 years after the anthology series premiered. While the broadcast that aired three days after his death featured a memorial tribute from ''[[The Huntley-Brinkley Report|Huntley-Brinkley Report]]'' anchor [[Chet Huntley]] with film and television star [[Dick Van Dyke]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013present|author=Tim Brooks|author2=Earle Marsh|publisher=[[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]]|location=New York|edition=3rd|page=[https://archive.org/details/completedirector00timb/page/1092 1092]|year=1985|isbn=0-345-31864-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/completedirector00timb/page/1092}}</ref> the introductions that Walt already filmed prior to his death continued to air for the remainder of the season. After that, the studio decided that Walt's persona as host was such a key part of the show's appeal to viewers that the host segment was dropped.\n\n===''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1969\u20131979)===\nThe series was retitled ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' in September 1969, as the previous title was no longer needed due to the aforementioned developments in color broadcasting. It continued to gain solid ratings, often ranking in the top 20, until the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 1976, Disney showed its hit 1961 film ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' on television for the first time, as a 2\u00bd-hour special. This marked a major step in broadcasting for the studio, which had never shown one of its more popular films on television in a time slot longer than an hour (although it had shown ''[[Now You See Him, Now You Don't]]'' and ''[[Napoleon and Samantha]]'' in a two-hour format in 1975).<ref name=\"billcotter.com\">{{cite web|title=Appendix B \u2013 The Anthology Series|url=http://www.billcotter.com/tvbook/appendix-b.htm|website=BillCotter.com|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> Walt Disney Productions also began running some of its multiepisode television programs, such as 1962's ''Sammy The Way-Out Seal'', as televised feature films on the anthology series. A slightly edited version of the 1954 Disney film ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' made its television debut as a two-hour special on NBC in October 1976.<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/> Several other Disney films, some of them not especially successful (such as ''[[Superdad]]'', which was an outright flop in its initial theatrical release) were also aired on the program in the form of two-hour broadcasts that year. However, the multiepisode format for feature films had not been discontinued; as late as 1981, films such as ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' were still being shown on the Disney program in several installments running a week apart.<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the show began to increasingly concentrate less on animated cartoons and dramatic or comedy films, and began to place an emphasis on nature-oriented programs (such as the ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'').<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/>\n\nThe show's continued ratings success in the post-Walt era came to an end during the 1975\u201376 season. At this time, Walt Disney Productions was facing a decline in fortunes due to falling box-office revenues, while NBC as a whole was also slipping in the ratings. The anthology series became even more dependent on airings of live-action theatrical features, its ''True-Life Adventures'', reruns of older episodes, and cartoon compilations. Nothing from the [[Disney animated features canon]] aired, with the exceptions of ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''[[Dumbo]]'', as part of a long-standing policy placed on the program by Disney. Additionally, in 1975, when CBS regained the broadcast rights to the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', it was scheduled opposite ''Disney'', as it had been between 1960 and 1968. At that time, telecasts of that film were highly rated annual events, which largely attracted the same family audience as the Disney series. From 1968 to 1975, when NBC held the television rights to ''Oz'' (which it had acquired from CBS in 1967), it usually pre-empted ''Disney'' to show it. However, the show's stiffest weekly competition came from CBS's newsmagazine ''[[60 Minutes (American television series)|60 Minutes]]''.\n\nIn 1975, an amendment to the [[Prime Time Access Rule]] gave the Sunday 7:00&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] slot back to the networks, allowing NBC to move ''Disney'' back by a half-hour. It also allowed CBS to schedule ''60 Minutes'' at 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time starting on December 7; prior to this, ''60 Minutes'' had aired at 6:00&nbsp;pm Eastern and did not begin its seasons until after the [[National Football League]] season ended. ''Disney'' fell out of the top 30, while ''60 Minutes'' had its ratings rise significantly.\n\n===''Disney's Wonderful World'' (1979\u20131981)===\nIn September 1979, the studio agreed to then-NBC president [[Fred Silverman]]'s request for changes to the program. The show shortened its title to ''Disney's Wonderful World'', and updated the opening sequence with a computer-generated logo and [[disco]]-styled theme song, but largely kept the same format. The problems for the show continued. As a result of the ratings strength of ''60 Minutes'', compounded by low ratings, increasingly less original material, and frequent pre-emptions (primarily due to sporting events such as [[NFL on NBC|NFL game telecasts]]),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cotter|first1=Bill|title=Appendix B: The Anthology Series Schedules|url=http://www.billcotter.com/tvbook/appendix-b.pdf|website=billcotter.com|accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref> NBC cancelled ''Disney'' in 1981.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Vernon|title=Scott's World: Networks Load Guns|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/05/08/Scotts-World-Networks-Load-Guns/3235358142400/|newspaper=[[United Press International]]|publisher=[[News World Communications]]|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=8 May 1981}}</ref> One factor that was beyond the control of either Disney or NBC was a 94-day strike by the [[Screen Actors' Guild]] that cut the number of shows for the 1980\u20131981 season,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Ed|title=Actors strike could delay fall TV season|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0724/072454.html|website=csmonitor.com|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=24 July 1980}}</ref> but the damage was done nonetheless.\n\n===''Walt Disney'' (1981\u20131983)===\nFollowing NBC's announcement that it would drop the anthology series, CBS picked up the program and began airing it on Saturdays at 8:00 pm Eastern Time, in September 1981. Despite a more elaborate credit sequence and another title change, to simply ''Walt Disney'', the series' format remained unchanged. During the 1981\u20131982 season, the series had a full season's worth of material again, but little of it was new. Among the little that actually was new were a handful of pilots based on ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'', ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain]]'', and ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'', but only the last of the three pilots was sold and became the half-hour sitcom ''[[Gun Shy (TV series)|Gun Shy]]'' the following season, one of the studio's first entries in that genre.\n\nThe 1982\u20131983 season had enough material to fill the time slot, but almost all of it was pre-existing material, the lone exception being the celebrity-laden opening ceremony of [[Epcot]] on October 23. It also did not help matters that NBC slotted the family-friendly sitcoms ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' and ''[[Silver Spoons]]'' at 8:00 pm and 8:30 pm up against it to draw children away from CBS. After moving to Tuesday at the beginning of 1983, it went on hiatus on February 15 while the aforementioned ''Gun Shy'' took up the second half of its time slot. When it came back for summer reruns on May 3, it was still on Tuesday at 8:00 pm; its final network broadcast was on September 24, bringing an uninterrupted 29-year run on all three networks to a close.\n\nThe end of the show coincided with the launch of the studio's [[cable television]] network, the [[Disney Channel]]. While ratings were a factor, the final decision to end the show came from Walt Disney Productions' then-CEO [[Card Walker]], who felt that having both the show and the new channel active would result in cannibalization of viewership.<ref name=\"DisneyWar\">{{cite book|title=Disneywar|author=[[James B.

Although he was not a performer, after filming a test video with his wife Jane and a member of his executive team (which required multiple takes), studio management believed he could do the hosting job. Eisner hired Michael Kay, a director of political commercials for then-[[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Bill Bradley]], to help him improve his on-camera performance.<ref name=\"The Keys to the Kingdom\"/>\n\n''The Disney Sunday Movie'' initially aired as ABC's lead-off program on Sundays, running from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time.<ref name=lat/> By this point, the format was similar to a movie-of-the-week. Gary Barton, a Disney senior vice president, was in charge of the program. ''Help Wanted: Kids'' was the first episode's film. Other first revival year films were, ''Young Again'', ''The Richest Cat in the World'', ''I-Man'' (starring Scott Bakula),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Best TV Shows That Never Were|last=Goldberg|first=Lee|year=2015}}</ref> and ''My Town''. Sometimes the slot would feature special instead of dramatic material like \"Disney Goes to the Oscars\" featuring the studio's Academy Award winners, and \"The Greatest Moments in Disney Animation\".<ref name=lat/> A handful of [[List of Disney Channel original films|Disney Channel original films]] made their network television debuts during these iteration as well,<ref name=bcm>{{cite journal|title=Stoddard  charts  ABC's long  road  ahead|journal=Broadcasting Magazine|date=June 30, 1986|pages=38\u201339|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-06-30.pdf}}</ref> but the program did not present any film made by Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone subsidiary]] as such films were not considered appropriate for children. However, ''[[Splash, Too]]'', a sequel to [[Splash (film)|the 1984 film]], aired on the series over two weeks in May 1988. The series had increased Disney park attendance and ABC's Sunday night ratings for the evening by an average 27% for the rest of the season. Disney, wanting to make it a regular viewing habit, gave ABC additional films from its library, including  ''[[Old Yeller]]'', ''The Apple Dumpling Gang'', and ''[[Candleshoe]]'' for the normal rerun mid-year period. ''The Last Electric Knight'' series movie produced a spin-off, originally to be called ''[[Sidekicks (TV series)|Karate Kid]]'' for ABC's 1987 season.<ref name=bcm/>\n\nDespite improving ABC's numbers, the program's ratings were never strong as the established ''60 Minutes'' and scripted mystery series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' on [[CBS]], both of which Disney was competing with for viewers, remained the leading primetime programs on Sunday nights. In 1987, ABC reduced ''The Disney Sunday Movie'' from two hours to one. The move did not help drive ratings, and the network decided not to renew its contract with Disney or pick up a fourth season of the second iteration of the anthology series.\n\n''The Disney Sunday Movie'' was also being run on the [[Disney Channel]], also hosted by Eisner.<ref name=\"drn\" />\n\n===''The Magical World of Disney'' (1988\u20131990)===\nIn the spring of 1988, NBC decided to renew its association with the company after it cut ties to the anthology series seven years earlier; the network brought the series, now named ''The Magical World of Disney'', to serve as the lead-in of its Sunday lineup in September 1988. As the program had done during its last season as ''The Disney Sunday Movie'', ''The Magical World of Disney'' ran for one hour, airing at 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time; Michael Eisner also returned as its presenter. \nDuring this period, the show attempted to reintroduce the rotating format the show started out with in 1954.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Ron|title=Nbc Moves Ahead With `Back To Basics` Lineup|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-03-22/features/8803020752_1_disney-hour-nbc-entertainment-brandon-tartikoff|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=22 March 1988}}</ref> It also introduced new versions of Walt-era movies and TV shows such as ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor#Remakes|The Absent-Minded Professor]]'', a reboot of ''[[Davy Crockett (miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'', and the musical ''[[Polly (1989 film)|Polly]]'', which was based on the book ''[[Pollyanna]]'' by [[Eleanor H. Porter]] and the [[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Walt Disney's 1960 film adaptation of it]]. \nIn the 1989\u20131990 season, during which the company was negotiating with [[Jim Henson]] to buy [[The Muppets]], they aired two Muppet specials; one of them was ''[[The Muppets at Walt Disney World]]'', which turned out to be Henson's last Muppet special. He died May 16, 1990, 10 days after the special aired, and the company only acquired The Muppets more than a decade later.\n\nAfter two seasons experiencing the same lackluster ratings as it had accrued during the end of its initial NBC run and its subsequent runs on CBS and ABC, Disney elected to end the broadcast television run of ''The Magical World of Disney'' and began airing the anthology on the Disney Channel \u2013 in the same time slot it had been airing for the past decade \u2013 starting in September 1990, expanding back to a two-hour format. Since the Disney Channel operated as a [[pay television|premium channel]] at the time, films presented on the series were presented without commercial interruption. ''The Magical World of Disney'' originally aired on the cable channel as a weekly Sunday-only program for its first 5\u00bd years; but in September 1996, as part of the first phase of a programming revamp that culminated in its formal conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel in April 1997, the Disney Channel expanded the ''Magical World'' brand to encompass its Monday through Saturday primetime film block, maintaining its 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern time slot.\n\n===''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1991\u2013present)===\n''The Wonderful World of Disney'' returned in 1991 as an umbrella title for Disney specials airing on major networks (CBS airings used the historical title ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' for the first few years, while other networks broadcast the show with another title, ''A Disney Special'').\n \t\nIn 1997, with Disney acquiring ABC the previous year, ABC gave the series a regular slot in the schedule.<ref name=\"drn\" /> Disney CEO Eisner formed [[Disney Telefilms]] by 1995 to supply original films to the series<ref name=bc>{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Allison|title=Game Boy |url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/game-boy/102439 |accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Broadcasting & Cable |publisher= NewBay Media, LLC |date=March 14, 2004}}</ref><ref name=vty>{{cite news|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Disney Telefilms ups exex|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/disney-telefilms-ups-exex-1117468572/|accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Variety|date=March 9, 1998}}</ref> and program together with ABC.<ref name=\"drn\" /> It led the network's Sunday night lineup at the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time slot,<ref name=vty0>{{cite news|title=Disney Sets ABC Pix|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/disney-sets-abc-pix-1117342089/|accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 1, 1997}}</ref> resulting in the displacement of Sunday mainstay ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', which had occupied the slot since 1992.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} On September 28, 1997, the all-new ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' premiered with the network television premiere of ''[[Toy Story]]''. On October 5, 1997, Disney Telefilms' first production, ''[[Toothless (film)|Toothless]]'', debuted on the series. In addition to the planned 16 original Disney telemovies, ABC and Disney added a few direct-to-video movies and films from other sources.<ref name=\"drn\" />\n\nIn 2001, a Spanish-language version of the program premiered on [[Telemundo]] (which, incidentally, was acquired by the English version's former home, [[NBC]], that same year 2001-2010) as ''El Maravilloso Mundo de Disney'', with more of a focus on Disney theatrical films than the English broadcasts at the time for Spanish version's former [[Disney Channel (Latin America)]].\n\nIn September 2003, ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' moved to Saturdays at 8:00 pm Eastern, with the previous Sunday time slot being ceded to ''AFV'' (which moved back to Sundays that season) and drama series in the 8:00&nbsp;pm hour. Rare exceptions to the program's format occurred during this time; for example, a ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV miniseries)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' miniseries ran for several weeks in 2004 under the ''Wonderful World of Disney'' banner. For most of its second run on ABC, the program aired throughout the television season, with the exception of the 2005\u201306 season (when it aired during the midseason only), and in 2007 and 2008 (when it was relegated to the summer months), with a broader array of films occupying the network's Saturday primetime slot at other times, when [[ESPN on ABC|sports programming]] did not air. The series ended as a regular program in 2008.\n\nAt this point, the series began to shift focus toward Disney theatrical films, relying less on original television films; however, the series aired two Disney Channel Original Movies (2002's ''[[Cadet Kelly]]'' and 2008's ''[[Camp Rock]]'', currently the only Disney Channel television films to have aired on non-Disney Channel-branded network domestically) during its ABC run. The second ABC revival also included some family-oriented films produced by studios other than Disney under the ''Wonderful World'' banner, such as ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' from [[20th Century Fox]] ([[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|which is presently owned by Disney]]) and the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' film series and ''[[Space Jam]]'' from [[Warner Bros.]], as well as television films such as ''[[Princess of Thieves]]'' from [[Granada Productions]] and the 2001 remake of ''[[Brian's Song (2001)|Brian's Song]]'' from [[Columbia TriStar Television]] (now known as [[Sony Pictures Television]]).\n\nIn December 2015, ABC's ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' officially returned to its anthology format with a showing of ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' for the first time on ABC since 2002, hosted by Dick Van Dyke. Van Dyke took viewers on a tour through the Disney Archives, as they explored props and costumes from the production of ''Mary Poppins'' and discussed the film\u2019s history and context within the Disney legacy.<ref>[http://www.insidethemagic.net/2015/12/dick-van-dyke-to-host-mary-poppins-on-the-wonderful-world-of-disney/ Dick Van Dyke to host \u201cMary Poppins\u201d on \u201cThe Wonderful World of Disney\u201d] Inside the Magic, Retrieved December 12, 2015</ref> It was then shown on February 21, 2016, with the special ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney: Disneyland 60|Disneyland 60]]'', which honored Disneyland's 60th anniversary;<ref>[http://wbay.com/2016/01/07/abc-special-celebrates-disneyland-turning-60/ ABC special celebrates Disneyland turning 60] [[WBAY]], Retrieved January 28, 2016</ref> on November 24, 2016, for their Magical Holiday Celebration, filmed at Walt Disney World;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.disneyabcpress.com/abc/shows/the-wonderful-world-of-disney-magical-holiday-celebration/|title=The Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration {{!}} ABC Press|website=www.disneyabcpress.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref> and on December 11, 2016, for the network television premiere of ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/disneys-frozen-film-makes-network-premiere-december-11|title=Disney\u2019s Frozen Film Makes Network Premiere December 11 {{!}} Playbill|newspaper=[[Playbill]]|publisher=TotalTheater|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref> On August 5, 2019, it was announced that ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' would present ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'' on November 5 of that year with [[Auli'i Cravalho]], [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] starring as Ariel, Ursula and Sebastian, respectively.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bentley|first=Jean|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/little-mermaid-live-starring-aulii-cravalho-set-at-abc-1229130|title=Little Mermaid' Live Starring Auli'i Cravalho Set at ABC|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 5, 2019|access-date=August 6, 2019}}</ref> The cast also included [[John Stamos]] as Chef Louis and [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]] as Prince Eric.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title=John Stamos & Graham Phillips Join \u2018The Little Mermaid Live!\u2019 On ABC |url=https://deadline.com/2019/09/john-stamos-reprise-chef-louis-role-the-little-mermaid-live-abc-graham-phillips-cast-1202744462/ |accessdate=September 26, 2019 |work=Deadline Hollywood |date=September 25, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> The special featured music from both the film and the Tony Award-nominated Broadway stage version and was performed in front of a live audience with giant projection surface.<ref>{{cite news |last1=White |first1=Peter |title=\u2018Little Mermaid\u2019 Live Musical: Auli\u2019i Cravalho, Shaggy & Hamish Hamilton Go Under The Sea To Describe ABC\u2019s \"Interesting Hybrid\" \u2013 TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/little-mermaid-interesting-hybrid-abc-1202662158/ |accessdate=August 6, 2019 |work=Deadline Hollywood |date=August 5, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> The title was used again on November 28, 2019, for a two hour music special, ''The Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration'', hosted by [[Emma Bunton]] and [[Matthew Morrison]].<ref>[https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2019/11/the-wonderful-world-of-disney-magical-holiday-celebration-airs-thanksgiving-night-on-abc/ \u201c \u2018The Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration\u2019 Airs Thanksgiving Night on ABC\u201d] from Disney Parks (November 11, 2019)</ref>\n\n==''Magical World of Toons''==\n\"''The Magical World of Toons''\" was the daily prime time programming block featuring character's key series episodes coinciding with the launch of its channel, [[Toon Disney]], on April 18, 1998.<ref name=awm>{{cite news|title=Toon Disney Launch.|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.2/3.2pages/3.2television.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=May 1998}}</ref> \"Magical World\" continued at least until 2003.<ref name=tfl>{{cite news|title=Disney's Pepper Ann Takes Her Quest for Coolness to Toon Disney Beginning September 2001;

The original opening titles were restored to the episodes in 1997.

For many years, the show also featured edited one-hour versions of such then-recent Disney films as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', and in other cases, telecasts of complete Disney films that were split into two or more one-hour episodes.<ref name=\"epguides.com\">{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Presents (a Titles & Air Dates Guide)|url=http://epguides.com/WaltDisneyPresents/|website=[[Epguides]]|date=August 5, 2012|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> Later original programs consisted of dramatizations of other historical figures and legends along the lines of the [[Davy Crockett]] mini-series. These included [[Daniel Boone (1960 TV series)|a miniseries based on Daniel Boone]] (not the Fess Parker characterization), [[Texas John Slaughter (TV series)|Texas John Slaughter]], [[Elfego Baca]], [[Francis Marion]] (the \"[[The Swamp Fox (TV series)|Swamp Fox]]\") and 1977's ''Kit Carson and the Mountain Man'' (with [[Christopher Connelly (actor)|Christopher Connelly]] as [[Kit Carson]], [[Robert Reed]] as [[John C. Fremont]], and [[Gregg Palmer]] as mountain man [[Jim Bridger]]).\n\nOccasionally, a more educational segment would be featured (such as ''[[The Story of the Animated Drawing]]''), including nature and animal programs similar to the ''True-Life Adventures'' that were released in theaters, as well as various dramatic installments which were either structured as single-part, two-part, and sometimes, multipart editions. Much of the original informational excerpts were to create awareness of Disneyland. In spite of essentially serving as advertisements for the park, entertainment value was emphasized, as well to make the shows palatable. Some of the program's informational content was formatted to promote upcoming feature film releases by the studio (such as ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' and ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]''), with some programs focusing on the art and technology of animation itself.\n\n==Theme music==\n* From 1954 to 1961, the series used the song \"[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]\" as its theme. The recording was taken directly from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.\n* From 1961 to 1969, an original song was used, \"The Wonderful World of Color\", written by [[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]]. This song helped to emphasize the use of color with its lyrics.\n* From 1969 to 1979 (''The Wonderful World of Disney''), orchestral medleys of various Disney songs from movies and theme parks as theme songs.\n* From 1979 to 1980 (''Disney's Wonderful World''), a [[disco]]-styled theme was written to emphasize the new visual changes, even though the format remained the same. [[John Debney]] composed the melody and [[John Klawitter]] wrote the lyrics.\n** From 1980 to 1981, the series discarded the Debney/Klawitter theme and went back to an earlier orchestral medley theme, while keeping the 1979 credits motif and title.\n* From 1981 to 1983 (''Walt Disney''), a short disco arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", arranged by [[Frank Gari]], served as theme against some elaborate, then-state-of-the-art computer graphics. [[CBC Television]] in Canada also used this title sequence and theme music for their own versions of the show. The sequence was also used as the opening sequence on international [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Video]] releases until 1987.\n* From 1986 to 1988, a synthesized, [[pop-rock]] arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" with some clapping was the theme. This was used again for the 1989\u201390 season of ''The Magical World of Disney'' and the 1991\u201396 run on The [[Disney Channel]].\n* In 1988, an orchestral medley of \"[[A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\" and \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" was used. This was switched back to the 1987 theme in 1989.\n* From 1991 to 1997, an orchestral medley of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"[[Part of Your World]]\" (the latter from Disney's then recent hit ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') was used for network airings of the show (known as ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' on CBS and ''A Disney Special'' on other networks) as well as ''[[The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage]]'', a collaboration with [[Stephen J. Cannell Productions]]. This theme was also used internationally.\n* From 1997 to 2002, an orchestral medley of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"A Whole New World\" (the latter used in the movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'') were used; also used occasionally was the Louis Armstrong hit \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\". This theme is still used today internationally.\n* From 2002 to 2007, a newer orchestral arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" with a wordless choir was used for ABC airings in the United States.\n* From 2007 to 2008, another orchestral arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" (in actuality, the theme from the current [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo, composed by [[Mark Mancina]]) and a brand-new opening title sequence (depicting a montage of the company's work) are used for ABC airings in the United States.\n* From 2012 on, \"Heaven\u2019s Triumph\", composed by Robert Etoll via Q-Factory, is used along with a brand-new opening title sequence (updated to include ''[[Star Wars]]'' and [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] properties).\n\n==International broadcasts==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\n==== The Telefe era ====\n''El mundo de Disney'' (The World of Disney) aired for the first time on the [[Over the air television|OTA]] network [[Telefe]] in 1990, hosted by Leonardo Greco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1771672-leonardo-greco-amo-este-pais-aunque-hay-que-arreglarle-algunas-cosas|title=Leonardo Greco: \"Amo este pa\u00eds, aunque hay que arreglarle algunas cosas\"|publisher=}}</ref> He remained as the sole presenter of the show, lasting until 1995, when the series concluded. The programme started airing at 8:00pm nightly from the second half of 1990 until December 1992. By 1993, it was moved to weekday afternoons at 5:00pm. When it was coming to an end, around 1994, shifted to Sunday afternoons, and aired a long marathon of movies and cartoons. According to Greco, this programme was possible because of a distributor who acquired the material, and was allowed to be shown without following a strict format, because the company wanted to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delosnoventas.blogspot.com.ar/2009/10/entrevista-con-leonardo-greco-la-cara.html|title=Entrevista con Leonardo Greco, la cara de Disney en la Argentina de los 90|first=|last=Noventosos|date=October 9, 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\nTelefe wanted a comeback, and appointed chef and host Maru Botana (then network talent) to present ''Planeta Disney'' (Disney Planet) on Sunday evenings, at 8:00pm, beginning November 21, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/654303-planeta-disney-en-la-orbita-de-telefe|title=\"Planeta Disney\" en la \u00f3rbita de Telef\u00e9|publisher=}}</ref> Starting on July 9, 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/09/espectaculos/c-00203.htm|title=Vuelven Pluto y compa\u00f1\u00eda|publisher=}}</ref> Botana was replaced with two personalities employed by Disney, Carolina Ibarra and Dani Martins.

The only clear difference was that only movies starring human actors, like ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' or ''[[The Island at the Top of the World]]'', could be broadcast, and not the cartoons. This experiment lasted until early 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://logos.foroslatinos.tv/t1350-programacion-de-tv-domingo-3-de-diciembre-de-1995?highlight=1995|title=1995 \u2013 Programaci\u00f3n de TV \u2013 domingo 3 de diciembre de 1995|publisher=}}</ref>\nBy 2007, the network took off from Telefe the exclusive rights to show all the Disney franchise movies and programs, and began to air its movies on Sunday evenings at 7:00pm, without a host. This also allowed Canal 13 to detain rights for other shows not related with Disney, but with the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network, like ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' or ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and to produce a localised version of the high-grossing film ''[[High School Musical: El Desaf\u00edo|High School Musical]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/8-6093-2007-04-20.html|title=P\u00e1gina/12 :: espectaculos|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Australia ===\nAfter more than 30 years of the Seven Network, in 2019, it now broadcast on the [[Nine Network]] and on [[9Go!]].\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe ABC run of the program under ''The Magical World of Disney'' title originally aired in that country under the title ''Cine Disney'' on the Brazilian-portuguese version of [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o]] (SBT) in partnership with [[The Walt Disney Company]].

The show was broadcast weekly on one of the [[Big Three television networks]] until 1990, a 36-year span with only a two-year hiatus in 1984-85. The series was broadcast on Sunday for 25 of those years. From 1991 until 1997, the series aired infrequently.\n\nThe program resumed a regular schedule in 1997 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] fall schedule, coinciding with Disney's recent purchase of the network. From 1997 until 2008, the program aired regularly on ABC. Since then, ABC has continued the series as an occasional special presentation from 2008 onward, the most recent being a holiday music special in November 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rotoscopers.com/2015/12/02/dick-van-dyke-hosts-wonderful-world-of-disney-return-to-abc/|title=Wonderful World of Disney Returns to ABC - Rotoscopers|website=www.rotoscopers.com}}</ref>\n \nThe show has had only two hosts, [[Walt Disney]] and former Disney Chairman [[Michael Eisner]].<ref name=\"drn\">{{cite news |last=Pierce |first=Scott |date=September 28, 1997 |title=ABC revives weekly Disney series |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/585719/ABC-revives-weekly-Disney-series.html | work=Deseret News |location= |access-date=March 14, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe show is the [[List of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|second-longest-running primetime program]] on American television, behind its rival film anthology series, the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'', which is still on the air as of 2019.\n\n==Titles==\n\n*''Walt Disney's Disneyland'' (1954\u20131958; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]<ref name=\"eotv\">{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Sean|title=Walt Disney Programs|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/waltdisneyp.htm|website=Encyclopedia of Television|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref>)\n*''Walt Disney Presents'' (1958\u20131961; ABC<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' (1961\u20131969; [[NBC]]<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (first era; 1969\u20131979; NBC<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''Disney's Wonderful World'' (1979\u20131981; NBC<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''[[#Walt Disney (1981\u20131983)|Walt Disney]]'' (1981\u20131983; [[CBS]]<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''[[#The Disney Sunday Movie (1986\u20131988)|The Disney Sunday Movie]]'' (1986\u20131988; ABC;<ref name=\"drn\"/><ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''[[#The Magical World of Disney (1988-1990)|The Magical World of Disney]]'' (1988\u20131990; NBC<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''[[#The Wonderful World of Disney|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' (1991-1997; [[CBS]]) (third era; 1997\u20132008, 2014\u2013present; ABC<ref name=\"drn\"/>)\n\n==History==\nThe anthology series was an outgrowth of Walt Disney looking for funding for [[Disneyland]] with his brother [[Roy O.

Disney wanted to produce a television program to finance the development of the Disneyland amusement park. After being turned down by both [[CBS]] and [[NBC]], Disney eventually signed a deal with ABC (which had merged with [[United Paramount Theaters]] in 1953) on March 29, 1954. The show contained teasers for Walt's park, as well as episodes representing life in one of the park's main sections: [[Adventureland (Disney)|Adventureland]], [[Tomorrowland]], [[Fantasyland]], and [[Frontierland]], with the opening titles used from its inception until the show's move to NBC in 1961, showing the entrance to Disneyland itself, as well as the four aforementioned lands, one of which was then identified as the main feature of that evening's program.\n\nConsequently, \"Davy Crockett\" and other pioneers of the Old West, and American history in general, appeared in \"Frontier Land\". Similarly, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' might be the focus of an evening spent in \"Adventure Land\", although a documentary on the film could also be possibly presented as a topic for such episodes, including clips from the actual film. Topics for \"Fantasy Land\" would include either actual cartoons, and animated films, or documentaries on \"The Making of ...\" (such as behind-the-scenes presentation of [[Peggy Lee]] singing the duet of the wicked Siamese cats in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', or the barbershop quartet of lost dogs in the municipal Dog Pound); excerpts from a ''[[True-Life Adventures|True-Life Adventure]]'' documentary may also be included (for example, one on the life and works of [[beaver]]s and their dam-building) or those using [[Stroboscopic effect|stroboscopic]] stop-action photography (such as investigating what really happened when a rain-drop fell in a puddle, as part of a \"Fantasy Land\" episode), explaining the techniques of cartoon animation. The multiplane camera used to create the three-dimensional effects of ''[[Bambi]]'' was also as a topic for a \"Fantasy Land\"-set telecast. In one episode, four different artists were given the task of drawing the same tree, with each artist using his own preferred ways of drawing and imagining a tree;{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} this led to cartoon examples of differently animated trees, as in some of the early ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' shorts, and later full-length animated films. \"Tomorrow Land\" was an opportunity for the Disney studio staff to present cutting-edge science and technology, and to predict possible futures, such as futuristic automobiles and highways. This format remained basically unchanged through the 1980s, though new material was scarce in later years. Other episodes were segments from Disney films such as ''[[Seal Island (film)|Seal Island]]'' and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', or cartoons of [[Donald Duck]] and other Disney standbys.\n\nThe program spawned the [[Davy Crockett]] craze of 1955 with the airing of a three-episode series (not shown over the course of consecutive weeks) about the historical American frontiersman, starring [[Fess Parker]] in the title role. Millions of dollars of merchandise relating to the title character were sold, and the theme song, \"[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]\", became a hit record that year. Three historically based hour-long programs aired during late 1954/early 1955, and were followed up by two dramatized installments the following year. The TV episodes were later edited into two theatrical films.\n\nOn July 17, 1955, the opening of Disneyland was covered on a live television special, ''Dateline: Disneyland'',<ref name=\"epguides.com\"/> which is not technically considered to be part of the series. It was hosted by [[Art Linkletter]], with whom Walt Disney had worked out a deal prior to the opening to allow Linkletter to lease a shop on Main Street in return for the broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiecEZdR0aI|title=Extinct Attractions: Disney Legend Art Linkletter with David Oneal part 1|first=|last=David Oneal|date=February 11, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Art Linkletter was assisted by [[Bob Cummings]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and the program featured various other guests, including various appearances of Walt himself as he dedicated the various lands of Disneyland.<ref name=\"Cotter\">{{cite book|title=The Wonderful World of Disney Television|author=Bill Cotter|publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]|year=1997|location=New York|page = 17|isbn=0-7868-6359-5}}</ref>\n\n===''Walt Disney Presents'' (1958\u20131961)===\nIn 1958, the series was retitled ''Walt Disney Presents''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Tim |last2=Marsh |first2=Earle |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |date=2007 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York|isbn=9780345497734|page=1482 |edition=9th |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&pg=PA1482&dq=%22walt+disney+presents%22+brooks+marsh#v=onepage&q=%22walt%20disney%20presents%22%20brooks%20marsh&f=false |accessdate=2017-11-12}}</ref> and moved to a Friday-night timeslot; by 1960, ABC had switched it to Sunday nights, where it remained for 21 years. During this iteration, ''The Peter Tchaikovsky Story,'' an episode made to promote Walt's latest animated feature, ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', was one of the first stereo [[simulcast]]s on TV; in this case it was 3 channel stereo. FM radio stations across the country carried the left channel at the same time as ABC broadcast the TV show in mono, which served as a center channel, and AM radio stations broadcast the right channel. In the second half of the show, a lengthy clip of Sleeping Beauty was shown, with its 6 channels (70mm version) mixed down into 3 for the broadcast. Walt apparently wanted people to see Sleeping Beauty in 70&nbsp;mm, so, in the introduction, he explained the difference between 35&nbsp;mm and 70&nbsp;mm and held up a card with both sizes on it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Peter Tchaikovsky Story (Television)|url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/peter-tchaikovsky-story-the-television/|website=[[D23 (Disney)|D23]]|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=December 22, 2016}}</ref> In addition to episodes devoted to the latest additions at Disneyland, many episodes during this period were Westerns such as \"[[Texas John Slaughter (TV series)|Texas John Slaughter]]\" and \"[[Elfego Baca#Walt Disney television series|Elfego Baca]]\", while others talked about the [[NASA|United States' burgeoning efforts to explore outer space]] and others, such as \"[[Moochie of the Little League]]\", were set in the then-present day. Some episodes even mixed live-action and animation, showing Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket talking with Walt himself, while one 1959 episode turned the spotlight on Chip 'n' Dale, combining their theatrical cartoons with mixed media wrap-around footage.\n\n===''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' (1961\u20131969)===\nAlthough the basic format remained the same, the series moved to [[NBC]] on September 24, 1961, to take advantage of that network's ability to broadcast programming in [[color television|color]].<ref name=\"epguides.com\"/> In addition, Walt Disney's relationship with ABC had soured as the network resisted selling its stake in the theme park before doing so in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronology of Disneyland Theme Park (1960\u20131965)|url=http://kpolsson.com/disland/dl1960.htm|website=Kpolsson.com|date=February 1, 1956|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> In a display of foresight, Disney had filmed many of the earlier shows in color, allowing them to easily be repeated on NBC; since all but three of Disney's feature-length films were also made in color (the three [[black-and-white]] exceptions were ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'', and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'', all family comedies starring [[Fred MacMurray]]), they could now also be telecast in that format.\n\nTo emphasize the new feature, the series was retitled ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' when NBC began airing it,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of Color Television|url=http://161.58.97.168/200111/11114c01.html|website=161.58.9.168|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> retaining that moniker until 1969, by which time the [[Big Three television networks|big three networks]] were all broadcasting in color. The first NBC episode even dealt with the principles of color, as explained by a new character named [[Ludwig Von Drake]] (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]), a bumbling professor with a thick German accent, who was the uncle of [[Donald Duck]]. Von Drake was the first Disney character created specifically for television.\n\n[[Image:Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' title sequence]]\nWalt Disney died on December 15, 1966, 12 years after the anthology series premiered. While the broadcast that aired three days after his death featured a memorial tribute from ''[[The Huntley-Brinkley Report|Huntley-Brinkley Report]]'' anchor [[Chet Huntley]] with film and television star [[Dick Van Dyke]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013present|author=Tim Brooks|author2=Earle Marsh|publisher=[[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]]|location=New York|edition=3rd|page=[https://archive.org/details/completedirector00timb/page/1092 1092]|year=1985|isbn=0-345-31864-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/completedirector00timb/page/1092}}</ref> the introductions that Walt already filmed prior to his death continued to air for the remainder of the season. After that, the studio decided that Walt's persona as host was such a key part of the show's appeal to viewers that the host segment was dropped.\n\n===''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1969\u20131979)===\nThe series was retitled ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' in September 1969, as the previous title was no longer needed due to the aforementioned developments in color broadcasting. It continued to gain solid ratings, often ranking in the top 20, until the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 1976, Disney showed its hit 1961 film ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' on television for the first time, as a 2\u00bd-hour special. This marked a major step in broadcasting for the studio, which had never shown one of its more popular films on television in a time slot longer than an hour (although it had shown ''[[Now You See Him, Now You Don't]]'' and ''[[Napoleon and Samantha]]'' in a two-hour format in 1975).<ref name=\"billcotter.com\">{{cite web|title=Appendix B \u2013 The Anthology Series|url=http://www.billcotter.com/tvbook/appendix-b.htm|website=BillCotter.com|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> Walt Disney Productions also began running some of its multiepisode television programs, such as 1962's ''Sammy The Way-Out Seal'', as televised feature films on the anthology series. A slightly edited version of the 1954 Disney film ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' made its television debut as a two-hour special on NBC in October 1976.<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/> Several other Disney films, some of them not especially successful (such as ''[[Superdad]]'', which was an outright flop in its initial theatrical release) were also aired on the program in the form of two-hour broadcasts that year. However, the multiepisode format for feature films had not been discontinued; as late as 1981, films such as ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' were still being shown on the Disney program in several installments running a week apart.<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the show began to increasingly concentrate less on animated cartoons and dramatic or comedy films, and began to place an emphasis on nature-oriented programs (such as the ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'').<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/>\n\nThe show's continued ratings success in the post-Walt era came to an end during the 1975\u201376 season. At this time, Walt Disney Productions was facing a decline in fortunes due to falling box-office revenues, while NBC as a whole was also slipping in the ratings. The anthology series became even more dependent on airings of live-action theatrical features, its ''True-Life Adventures'', reruns of older episodes, and cartoon compilations. Nothing from the [[Disney animated features canon]] aired, with the exceptions of ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''[[Dumbo]]'', as part of a long-standing policy placed on the program by Disney. Additionally, in 1975, when CBS regained the broadcast rights to the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', it was scheduled opposite ''Disney'', as it had been between 1960 and 1968. At that time, telecasts of that film were highly rated annual events, which largely attracted the same family audience as the Disney series. From 1968 to 1975, when NBC held the television rights to ''Oz'' (which it had acquired from CBS in 1967), it usually pre-empted ''Disney'' to show it. However, the show's stiffest weekly competition came from CBS's newsmagazine ''[[60 Minutes (American television series)|60 Minutes]]''.\n\nIn 1975, an amendment to the [[Prime Time Access Rule]] gave the Sunday 7:00&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] slot back to the networks, allowing NBC to move ''Disney'' back by a half-hour. It also allowed CBS to schedule ''60 Minutes'' at 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time starting on December 7; prior to this, ''60 Minutes'' had aired at 6:00&nbsp;pm Eastern and did not begin its seasons until after the [[National Football League]] season ended. ''Disney'' fell out of the top 30, while ''60 Minutes'' had its ratings rise significantly.\n\n===''Disney's Wonderful World'' (1979\u20131981)===\nIn September 1979, the studio agreed to then-NBC president [[Fred Silverman]]'s request for changes to the program. The show shortened its title to ''Disney's Wonderful World'', and updated the opening sequence with a computer-generated logo and [[disco]]-styled theme song, but largely kept the same format. The problems for the show continued. As a result of the ratings strength of ''60 Minutes'', compounded by low ratings, increasingly less original material, and frequent pre-emptions (primarily due to sporting events such as [[NFL on NBC|NFL game telecasts]]),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cotter|first1=Bill|title=Appendix B: The Anthology Series Schedules|url=http://www.billcotter.com/tvbook/appendix-b.pdf|website=billcotter.com|accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref> NBC cancelled ''Disney'' in 1981.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Vernon|title=Scott's World: Networks Load Guns|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/05/08/Scotts-World-Networks-Load-Guns/3235358142400/|newspaper=[[United Press International]]|publisher=[[News World Communications]]|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=8 May 1981}}</ref> One factor that was beyond the control of either Disney or NBC was a 94-day strike by the [[Screen Actors' Guild]] that cut the number of shows for the 1980\u20131981 season,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Ed|title=Actors strike could delay fall TV season|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0724/072454.html|website=csmonitor.com|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=24 July 1980}}</ref> but the damage was done nonetheless.\n\n===''Walt Disney'' (1981\u20131983)===\nFollowing NBC's announcement that it would drop the anthology series, CBS picked up the program and began airing it on Saturdays at 8:00 pm Eastern Time, in September 1981. Despite a more elaborate credit sequence and another title change, to simply ''Walt Disney'', the series' format remained unchanged. During the 1981\u20131982 season, the series had a full season's worth of material again, but little of it was new. Among the little that actually was new were a handful of pilots based on ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'', ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain]]'', and ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'', but only the last of the three pilots was sold and became the half-hour sitcom ''[[Gun Shy (TV series)|Gun Shy]]'' the following season, one of the studio's first entries in that genre.\n\nThe 1982\u20131983 season had enough material to fill the time slot, but almost all of it was pre-existing material, the lone exception being the celebrity-laden opening ceremony of [[Epcot]] on October 23. It also did not help matters that NBC slotted the family-friendly sitcoms ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' and ''[[Silver Spoons]]'' at 8:00 pm and 8:30 pm up against it to draw children away from CBS. After moving to Tuesday at the beginning of 1983, it went on hiatus on February 15 while the aforementioned ''Gun Shy'' took up the second half of its time slot. When it came back for summer reruns on May 3, it was still on Tuesday at 8:00 pm; its final network broadcast was on September 24, bringing an uninterrupted 29-year run on all three networks to a close.\n\nThe end of the show coincided with the launch of the studio's [[cable television]] network, the [[Disney Channel]]. While ratings were a factor, the final decision to end the show came from Walt Disney Productions' then-CEO [[Card Walker]], who felt that having both the show and the new channel active would result in cannibalization of viewership.<ref name=\"DisneyWar\">{{cite book|title=Disneywar|author=[[James B.

Although he was not a performer, after filming a test video with his wife Jane and a member of his executive team (which required multiple takes), studio management believed he could do the hosting job. Eisner hired Michael Kay, a director of political commercials for then-[[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Bill Bradley]], to help him improve his on-camera performance.<ref name=\"The Keys to the Kingdom\"/>\n\n''The Disney Sunday Movie'' initially aired as ABC's lead-off program on Sundays, running from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time.<ref name=lat/> By this point, the format was similar to a movie-of-the-week. Gary Barton, a Disney senior vice president, was in charge of the program. ''Help Wanted: Kids'' was the first episode's film. Other first revival year films were, ''Young Again'', ''The Richest Cat in the World'', ''I-Man'' (starring Scott Bakula),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Best TV Shows That Never Were|last=Goldberg|first=Lee|year=2015}}</ref> and ''My Town''. Sometimes the slot would feature special instead of dramatic material like \"Disney Goes to the Oscars\" featuring the studio's Academy Award winners, and \"The Greatest Moments in Disney Animation\".<ref name=lat/> A handful of [[List of Disney Channel original films|Disney Channel original films]] made their network television debuts during these iteration as well,<ref name=bcm>{{cite journal|title=Stoddard  charts  ABC's long  road  ahead|journal=Broadcasting Magazine|date=June 30, 1986|pages=38\u201339|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-06-30.pdf}}</ref> but the program did not present any film made by Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone subsidiary]] as such films were not considered appropriate for children. However, ''[[Splash, Too]]'', a sequel to [[Splash (film)|the 1984 film]], aired on the series over two weeks in May 1988. The series had increased Disney park attendance and ABC's Sunday night ratings for the evening by an average 27% for the rest of the season. Disney, wanting to make it a regular viewing habit, gave ABC additional films from its library, including  ''[[Old Yeller]]'', ''The Apple Dumpling Gang'', and ''[[Candleshoe]]'' for the normal rerun mid-year period. ''The Last Electric Knight'' series movie produced a spin-off, originally to be called ''[[Sidekicks (TV series)|Karate Kid]]'' for ABC's 1987 season.<ref name=bcm/>\n\nDespite improving ABC's numbers, the program's ratings were never strong as the established ''60 Minutes'' and scripted mystery series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' on [[CBS]], both of which Disney was competing with for viewers, remained the leading primetime programs on Sunday nights. In 1987, ABC reduced ''The Disney Sunday Movie'' from two hours to one. The move did not help drive ratings, and the network decided not to renew its contract with Disney or pick up a fourth season of the second iteration of the anthology series.\n\n''The Disney Sunday Movie'' was also being run on the [[Disney Channel]], also hosted by Eisner.<ref name=\"drn\" />\n\n===''The Magical World of Disney'' (1988\u20131990)===\nIn the spring of 1988, NBC decided to renew its association with the company after it cut ties to the anthology series seven years earlier; the network brought the series, now named ''The Magical World of Disney'', to serve as the lead-in of its Sunday lineup in September 1988. As the program had done during its last season as ''The Disney Sunday Movie'', ''The Magical World of Disney'' ran for one hour, airing at 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time; Michael Eisner also returned as its presenter. \nDuring this period, the show attempted to reintroduce the rotating format the show started out with in 1954.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Ron|title=Nbc Moves Ahead With `Back To Basics` Lineup|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-03-22/features/8803020752_1_disney-hour-nbc-entertainment-brandon-tartikoff|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=22 March 1988}}</ref> It also introduced new versions of Walt-era movies and TV shows such as ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor#Remakes|The Absent-Minded Professor]]'', a reboot of ''[[Davy Crockett (miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'', and the musical ''[[Polly (1989 film)|Polly]]'', which was based on the book ''[[Pollyanna]]'' by [[Eleanor H. Porter]] and the [[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Walt Disney's 1960 film adaptation of it]]. \nIn the 1989\u20131990 season, during which the company was negotiating with [[Jim Henson]] to buy [[The Muppets]], they aired two Muppet specials; one of them was ''[[The Muppets at Walt Disney World]]'', which turned out to be Henson's last Muppet special. He died May 16, 1990, 10 days after the special aired, and the company only acquired The Muppets more than a decade later.\n\nAfter two seasons experiencing the same lackluster ratings as it had accrued during the end of its initial NBC run and its subsequent runs on CBS and ABC, Disney elected to end the broadcast television run of ''The Magical World of Disney'' and began airing the anthology on the Disney Channel \u2013 in the same time slot it had been airing for the past decade \u2013 starting in September 1990, expanding back to a two-hour format. Since the Disney Channel operated as a [[pay television|premium channel]] at the time, films presented on the series were presented without commercial interruption. ''The Magical World of Disney'' originally aired on the cable channel as a weekly Sunday-only program for its first 5\u00bd years; but in September 1996, as part of the first phase of a programming revamp that culminated in its formal conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel in April 1997, the Disney Channel expanded the ''Magical World'' brand to encompass its Monday through Saturday primetime film block, maintaining its 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern time slot.\n\n===''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1991\u2013present)===\n''The Wonderful World of Disney'' returned in 1991 as an umbrella title for Disney specials airing on major networks (CBS airings used the historical title ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' for the first few years, while other networks broadcast the show with another title, ''A Disney Special'').\n \t\nIn 1997, with Disney acquiring ABC the previous year, ABC gave the series a regular slot in the schedule.<ref name=\"drn\" /> Disney CEO Eisner formed [[Disney Telefilms]] by 1995 to supply original films to the series<ref name=bc>{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Allison|title=Game Boy |url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/game-boy/102439 |accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Broadcasting & Cable |publisher= NewBay Media, LLC |date=March 14, 2004}}</ref><ref name=vty>{{cite news|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Disney Telefilms ups exex|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/disney-telefilms-ups-exex-1117468572/|accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Variety|date=March 9, 1998}}</ref> and program together with ABC.<ref name=\"drn\" /> It led the network's Sunday night lineup at the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time slot,<ref name=vty0>{{cite news|title=Disney Sets ABC Pix|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/disney-sets-abc-pix-1117342089/|accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 1, 1997}}</ref> resulting in the displacement of Sunday mainstay ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', which had occupied the slot since 1992.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} On September 28, 1997, the all-new ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' premiered with the network television premiere of ''[[Toy Story]]''. On October 5, 1997, Disney Telefilms' first production, ''[[Toothless (film)|Toothless]]'', debuted on the series. In addition to the planned 16 original Disney telemovies, ABC and Disney added a few direct-to-video movies and films from other sources.<ref name=\"drn\" />\n\nIn 2001, a Spanish-language version of the program premiered on [[Telemundo]] (which, incidentally, was acquired by the English version's former home, [[NBC]], that same year 2001-2010) as ''El Maravilloso Mundo de Disney'', with more of a focus on Disney theatrical films than the English broadcasts at the time for Spanish version's former [[Disney Channel (Latin America)]].\n\nIn September 2003, ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' moved to Saturdays at 8:00 pm Eastern, with the previous Sunday time slot being ceded to ''AFV'' (which moved back to Sundays that season) and drama series in the 8:00&nbsp;pm hour. Rare exceptions to the program's format occurred during this time; for example, a ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV miniseries)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' miniseries ran for several weeks in 2004 under the ''Wonderful World of Disney'' banner. For most of its second run on ABC, the program aired throughout the television season, with the exception of the 2005\u201306 season (when it aired during the midseason only), and in 2007 and 2008 (when it was relegated to the summer months), with a broader array of films occupying the network's Saturday primetime slot at other times, when [[ESPN on ABC|sports programming]] did not air. The series ended as a regular program in 2008.\n\nAt this point, the series began to shift focus toward Disney theatrical films, relying less on original television films; however, the series aired two Disney Channel Original Movies (2002's ''[[Cadet Kelly]]'' and 2008's ''[[Camp Rock]]'', currently the only Disney Channel television films to have aired on non-Disney Channel-branded network domestically) during its ABC run. The second ABC revival also included some family-oriented films produced by studios other than Disney under the ''Wonderful World'' banner, such as ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' from [[20th Century Fox]] ([[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|which is presently owned by Disney]]) and the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' film series and ''[[Space Jam]]'' from [[Warner Bros.]], as well as television films such as ''[[Princess of Thieves]]'' from [[Granada Productions]] and the 2001 remake of ''[[Brian's Song (2001)|Brian's Song]]'' from [[Columbia TriStar Television]] (now known as [[Sony Pictures Television]]).\n\nIn December 2015, ABC's ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' officially returned to its anthology format with a showing of ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' for the first time on ABC since 2002, hosted by Dick Van Dyke.

In Australia, the program aired on [[Seven Network|Network Seven]] on Saturdays at 6:30 pm, before it was dropped in 1994 due to [[Optus Vision]] (later [[Foxtel]])'s launch of a domestic version of the [[Disney Channel (Australia and New Zealand)|Disney Channel]], with ''[[List of Disney TV programming blocks#Saturday Disney|Saturday Disney]]'' replacing it as the channel's main block of Disney films.\n\nReruns of the shows were a staple of the Disney Channel for several years under the title ''Walt Disney Presents'' (which used the same title sequence as the 1980s CBS incarnation), when it was an outlet for vintage Disney cartoons, television series, and films, basically serving the same function that the anthology series served in the days before cable. The original opening titles were restored to the episodes in 1997. Reruns of the anthology series were discontinued when the channel purged all vintage material with the removal of its Vault Disney late-night block on September 8, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vhat Vood Vault Do?|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2002/09/06/261.aspx|author=Jim Hill|website=Jim Hill Media|date=September 6, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> However, a few select episodes are available on VHS or DVD (some of which are exclusive to the [[Disney Movie Club]]), with the possibility of additional future releases.\n\nRecently, live-action Disney films from the 1950s to the 1980s have aired on [[Turner Classic Movies]], without commercial interruption, and presented uncut and with [[letterbox]]ing on the network's [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]] feed.\n\nAll of the episodes and existing material used on the series up to 1996 are listed in the Bill Cotter book ''The Wonderful World of Disney Television'', which was released in 1997 by [[Hyperion Books]] (which was owned by the Walt Disney Company at the book's publication).<ref name=\"Cotter\"/>\n\n==Programming==\nOriginally hosted by Walt Disney himself, the original format of the Disney anthology series consisted of a balance of theatrical [[animated cartoon]]s, live-action features, and other informational material (some original, some pre-existing) from the studio's library. For many years, the show also featured edited one-hour versions of such then-recent Disney films as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', and in other cases, telecasts of complete Disney films that were split into two or more one-hour episodes.<ref name=\"epguides.com\">{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Presents (a Titles & Air Dates Guide)|url=http://epguides.com/WaltDisneyPresents/|website=[[Epguides]]|date=August 5, 2012|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> Later original programs consisted of dramatizations of other historical figures and legends along the lines of the [[Davy Crockett]] mini-series. These included [[Daniel Boone (1960 TV series)|a miniseries based on Daniel Boone]] (not the Fess Parker characterization), [[Texas John Slaughter (TV series)|Texas John Slaughter]], [[Elfego Baca]], [[Francis Marion]] (the \"[[The Swamp Fox (TV series)|Swamp Fox]]\") and 1977's ''Kit Carson and the Mountain Man'' (with [[Christopher Connelly (actor)|Christopher Connelly]] as [[Kit Carson]], [[Robert Reed]] as [[John C. Fremont]], and [[Gregg Palmer]] as mountain man [[Jim Bridger]]).\n\nOccasionally, a more educational segment would be featured (such as ''[[The Story of the Animated Drawing]]''), including nature and animal programs similar to the ''True-Life Adventures'' that were released in theaters, as well as various dramatic installments which were either structured as single-part, two-part, and sometimes, multipart editions. Much of the original informational excerpts were to create awareness of Disneyland. In spite of essentially serving as advertisements for the park, entertainment value was emphasized, as well to make the shows palatable. Some of the program's informational content was formatted to promote upcoming feature film releases by the studio (such as ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' and ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]''), with some programs focusing on the art and technology of animation itself.\n\n==Theme music==\n* From 1954 to 1961, the series used the song \"[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]\" as its theme. The recording was taken directly from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.\n* From 1961 to 1969, an original song was used, \"The Wonderful World of Color\", written by [[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]]. This song helped to emphasize the use of color with its lyrics.\n* From 1969 to 1979 (''The Wonderful World of Disney''), orchestral medleys of various Disney songs from movies and theme parks as theme songs.\n* From 1979 to 1980 (''Disney's Wonderful World''), a [[disco]]-styled theme was written to emphasize the new visual changes, even though the format remained the same. [[John Debney]] composed the melody and [[John Klawitter]] wrote the lyrics.\n** From 1980 to 1981, the series discarded the Debney/Klawitter theme and went back to an earlier orchestral medley theme, while keeping the 1979 credits motif and title.\n* From 1981 to 1983 (''Walt Disney''), a short disco arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", arranged by [[Frank Gari]], served as theme against some elaborate, then-state-of-the-art computer graphics. [[CBC Television]] in Canada also used this title sequence and theme music for their own versions of the show. The sequence was also used as the opening sequence on international [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Video]] releases until 1987.\n* From 1986 to 1988, a synthesized, [[pop-rock]] arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" with some clapping was the theme. This was used again for the 1989\u201390 season of ''The Magical World of Disney'' and the 1991\u201396 run on The [[Disney Channel]].\n* In 1988, an orchestral medley of \"[[A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\" and \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" was used. This was switched back to the 1987 theme in 1989.\n* From 1991 to 1997, an orchestral medley of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"[[Part of Your World]]\" (the latter from Disney's then recent hit ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') was used for network airings of the show (known as ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' on CBS and ''A Disney Special'' on other networks) as well as ''[[The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage]]'', a collaboration with [[Stephen J. Cannell Productions]]. This theme was also used internationally.\n* From 1997 to 2002, an orchestral medley of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"A Whole New World\" (the latter used in the movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'') were used; also used occasionally was the Louis Armstrong hit \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\". This theme is still used today internationally.\n* From 2002 to 2007, a newer orchestral arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" with a wordless choir was used for ABC airings in the United States.\n* From 2007 to 2008, another orchestral arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" (in actuality, the theme from the current [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo, composed by [[Mark Mancina]]) and a brand-new opening title sequence (depicting a montage of the company's work) are used for ABC airings in the United States.\n* From 2012 on, \"Heaven\u2019s Triumph\", composed by Robert Etoll via Q-Factory, is used along with a brand-new opening title sequence (updated to include ''[[Star Wars]]'' and [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] properties).\n\n==International broadcasts==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\n==== The Telefe era ====\n''El mundo de Disney'' (The World of Disney) aired for the first time on the [[Over the air television|OTA]] network [[Telefe]] in 1990, hosted by Leonardo Greco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1771672-leonardo-greco-amo-este-pais-aunque-hay-que-arreglarle-algunas-cosas|title=Leonardo Greco: \"Amo este pa\u00eds, aunque hay que arreglarle algunas cosas\"|publisher=}}</ref> He remained as the sole presenter of the show, lasting until 1995, when the series concluded. The programme started airing at 8:00pm nightly from the second half of 1990 until December 1992. By 1993, it was moved to weekday afternoons at 5:00pm. When it was coming to an end, around 1994, shifted to Sunday afternoons, and aired a long marathon of movies and cartoons. According to Greco, this programme was possible because of a distributor who acquired the material, and was allowed to be shown without following a strict format, because the company wanted to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delosnoventas.blogspot.com.ar/2009/10/entrevista-con-leonardo-greco-la-cara.html|title=Entrevista con Leonardo Greco, la cara de Disney en la Argentina de los 90|first=|last=Noventosos|date=October 9, 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\nTelefe wanted a comeback, and appointed chef and host Maru Botana (then network talent) to present ''Planeta Disney'' (Disney Planet) on Sunday evenings, at 8:00pm, beginning November 21, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/654303-planeta-disney-en-la-orbita-de-telefe|title=\"Planeta Disney\" en la \u00f3rbita de Telef\u00e9|publisher=}}</ref> Starting on July 9, 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/09/espectaculos/c-00203.htm|title=Vuelven Pluto y compa\u00f1\u00eda|publisher=}}</ref> Botana was replaced with two personalities employed by Disney, Carolina Ibarra and Dani Martins. They both shared the duties of hosting this show and the South American edition of Zapping Zone, on [[Disney Channel (Latin America)|Disney Channel]]. This lasted for a year and a half, with relative success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.com.ar/NotePrint.aspx?Note=301449|title=Una \u00f3rbita siempre ampliada \u2013 Espect\u00e1culos|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==== The Canal 13 era ====\nWhile Telefe had a major success carrying the animated movies and some TV series like ''[[Blossom (TV series)|Blossom]]'' or ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'' (distributed by [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]]), [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|Canal 13]] saw the possibility of buying material from the company and airing it (sometimes competing against the Telefe's programme) on Sunday afternoons, beginning in 1994, which at that time was filled with telecasts of ancient Argentinian films from the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s, and by reruns of ''[[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]]'' and ''[[The Three Stooges]]''. The only clear difference was that only movies starring human actors, like ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' or ''[[The Island at the Top of the World]]'', could be broadcast, and not the cartoons. This experiment lasted until early 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://logos.foroslatinos.tv/t1350-programacion-de-tv-domingo-3-de-diciembre-de-1995?highlight=1995|title=1995 \u2013 Programaci\u00f3n de TV \u2013 domingo 3 de diciembre de 1995|publisher=}}</ref>\nBy 2007, the network took off from Telefe the exclusive rights to show all the Disney franchise movies and programs, and began to air its movies on Sunday evenings at 7:00pm, without a host. This also allowed Canal 13 to detain rights for other shows not related with Disney, but with the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network, like ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' or ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and to produce a localised version of the high-grossing film ''[[High School Musical: El Desaf\u00edo|High School Musical]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/8-6093-2007-04-20.html|title=P\u00e1gina/12 :: espectaculos|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Australia ===\nAfter more than 30 years of the Seven Network, in 2019, it now broadcast on the [[Nine Network]] and on [[9Go!]].\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe ABC run of the program under ''The Magical World of Disney'' title originally aired in that country under the title ''Cine Disney'' on the Brazilian-portuguese version of [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o]] (SBT) in partnership with [[The Walt Disney Company]].

Based in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] and later in [[DeSoto, Texas]], the Sky Ryders was a member corps of [[Drum Corps International]] and a six time DCI World Championship Finalist.<ref name=\"sky\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Sky Ryders History]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe organization was first established as a junior corps in 1952 called the Lysle Rishel Post 68 Drum & Bugle Corps and led by director Ken Fairbrother, a former member of the Hawthorne Caballeros. In 1955, under the direction of H.D. \"Prof\" McCosh, the corps was reorganized and adopted the name Sky Ryders.  In 1957, they began winning competitions in Kansas, and in 1959 they started competing in American Legion national competitions. They won their first [[American Legion]] Kansas state Championship in 1959, repeated in 1960-62, and won another in 1964. In 1959, the corps also attended its first American Legion National championship, placing tenth of 24 junior corps. This was followed by American Legion Nationals finishes of 6th, 5th, and 4th the following three seasons and 3rd in 1964.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\">{{cite book | title=A History of Drum & Bugle Corps | volume=Vol. 2 | first=Steve | last=Vickers | publisher=Drum Corps World | date=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe corps experienced financial and membership issues in 1966, taking the season off after nearly disbanding. When it returned in 1967, it was largely with members of their feeder corps, the Jets, and with girls allowed into the brass and percussion sections rather than being restricted to the color guard.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1969, brass instructor John Simpson recruited Larry Kerchner to collaborate on the corps' music. The corps had a successful year, again winning the Kansas American Legion title and placing 7th at the American Legion Nationals in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1967 through 1971, the corps mostly confined its travel to Kansas and the surrounding states. At around that same time, the Sky Ryders were one of the first corps to make the switch from French horns to mellophones for mid-range voices.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1972, the Sky Ryders traveled to [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]] for the inaugural Drum Corps International World Championship, placing 20th of the 39 corps from across the USA and Canada. The corps would not return to the DCI Championships until competing as a Class A corps at [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Denver]] in 1977, where they finished in 3rd place. Up until that time, the Sky Ryders had always been a hometown corps, drawing its members exclusively from the Hutchinson area, but in 1977, the corps began to recruit from a wider area.  In 1978, the corps switched from Class A to Open Class and had increasing success, placing 31st in Denver that year and to 22nd  and 17th in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] the next two years. During that time, corps director George Tuthill and brass instructor John Simpson attracted many members from Oklahoma and Texas, and Kerchner's unique and melodic arrangements were popular with fans and judges.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Tuthill set out to get the Sky Ryders into DCI's elite Top 12. In 1981, they placed 14th in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] at the first DCI Championships held outside the United States. In 1982, Tuthill's goal was accomplished with a 10th-place finish in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The corps' huge rainbow flag, unfolded behind the corps during their show and displayed in the stands afterwards, and their closing number of \"Over the Rainbow\" quickly became Sky Ryders traditions.  In 1983, the Sky Ryders received particular attention performing Kerchner's Grammy-nominated jazz arrangement of \"Home on the Range,\" and for the second year in a row, the corps placed in DCI's Top 12 with a 12th-place finish in [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nThe corps dropped out of DCI Finals in 1984, placing 17th in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1985, the corps had a stronger year with a 15th-place finish at [[Camp Randall Stadium]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], performing the first of two successive productions of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Starting in 1986, under the direction of alumnus Dale Antoine and a design team led by Tommy Keenum, the Sky Ryders returned to DCI's Top 12. Over the next three years, they entertained audiences with dramatized productions of the popular musicals \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"West Side Story,\" and \"The Sound of Music\" and gained a reputation as \"The Great Story Tellers.\" Their \"Wizard of Oz\" show in 1986 included elements such as a Wicked Witch riding a bicycle, gold lam\u00e9 \"yellow brick road\" flags, and colorful guard costumes for the various characters in the film. They finished the year with the corps' highest placement of 9th in Madison.1987's \"West Side Story\" placed 12th as did 1988's \"The Sound of Music\", with both of those programs also containing costuming and actions that helped to tell the story.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nAfter achieving popularity, the corps suddenly switched directions in 1989 with cadet-style uniforms and a more darkly themed show, including \"March (from Symphonic Metamorphosis)\" and selections from \"Carmina Burana.\" The corps finished the season out of DCI Finals with a Semifinals tie for 14th place. The stylistic change and the fall from Finals were elements in the  financial difficulties the corps faced in 1990.

Based in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] and later in [[DeSoto, Texas]], the Sky Ryders was a member corps of [[Drum Corps International]] and a six time DCI World Championship Finalist.<ref name=\"sky\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Sky Ryders History]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe organization was first established as a junior corps in 1952 called the Lysle Rishel Post 68 Drum & Bugle Corps and led by director Ken Fairbrother, a former member of the Hawthorne Caballeros. In 1955, under the direction of H.D. \"Prof\" McCosh, the corps was reorganized and adopted the name Sky Ryders.  In 1957, they began winning competitions in Kansas, and in 1959 they started competing in American Legion national competitions. They won their first [[American Legion]] Kansas state Championship in 1959, repeated in 1960-62, and won another in 1964. In 1959, the corps also attended its first American Legion National championship, placing tenth of 24 junior corps. This was followed by American Legion Nationals finishes of 6th, 5th, and 4th the following three seasons and 3rd in 1964.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\">{{cite book | title=A History of Drum & Bugle Corps | volume=Vol. 2 | first=Steve | last=Vickers | publisher=Drum Corps World | date=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe corps experienced financial and membership issues in 1966, taking the season off after nearly disbanding. When it returned in 1967, it was largely with members of their feeder corps, the Jets, and with girls allowed into the brass and percussion sections rather than being restricted to the color guard.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1969, brass instructor John Simpson recruited Larry Kerchner to collaborate on the corps' music. The corps had a successful year, again winning the Kansas American Legion title and placing 7th at the American Legion Nationals in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1967 through 1971, the corps mostly confined its travel to Kansas and the surrounding states. At around that same time, the Sky Ryders were one of the first corps to make the switch from French horns to mellophones for mid-range voices.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1972, the Sky Ryders traveled to [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]] for the inaugural Drum Corps International World Championship, placing 20th of the 39 corps from across the USA and Canada. The corps would not return to the DCI Championships until competing as a Class A corps at [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Denver]] in 1977, where they finished in 3rd place. Up until that time, the Sky Ryders had always been a hometown corps, drawing its members exclusively from the Hutchinson area, but in 1977, the corps began to recruit from a wider area.  In 1978, the corps switched from Class A to Open Class and had increasing success, placing 31st in Denver that year and to 22nd  and 17th in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] the next two years. During that time, corps director George Tuthill and brass instructor John Simpson attracted many members from Oklahoma and Texas, and Kerchner's unique and melodic arrangements were popular with fans and judges.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Tuthill set out to get the Sky Ryders into DCI's elite Top 12. In 1981, they placed 14th in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] at the first DCI Championships held outside the United States. In 1982, Tuthill's goal was accomplished with a 10th-place finish in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The corps' huge rainbow flag, unfolded behind the corps during their show and displayed in the stands afterwards, and their closing number of \"Over the Rainbow\" quickly became Sky Ryders traditions.  In 1983, the Sky Ryders received particular attention performing Kerchner's Grammy-nominated jazz arrangement of \"Home on the Range,\" and for the second year in a row, the corps placed in DCI's Top 12 with a 12th-place finish in [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nThe corps dropped out of DCI Finals in 1984, placing 17th in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1985, the corps had a stronger year with a 15th-place finish at [[Camp Randall Stadium]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], performing the first of two successive productions of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Starting in 1986, under the direction of alumnus Dale Antoine and a design team led by Tommy Keenum, the Sky Ryders returned to DCI's Top 12. Over the next three years, they entertained audiences with dramatized productions of the popular musicals \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"West Side Story,\" and \"The Sound of Music\" and gained a reputation as \"The Great Story Tellers.\" Their \"Wizard of Oz\" show in 1986 included elements such as a Wicked Witch riding a bicycle, gold lam\u00e9 \"yellow brick road\" flags, and colorful guard costumes for the various characters in the film. They finished the year with the corps' highest placement of 9th in Madison.1987's \"West Side Story\" placed 12th as did 1988's \"The Sound of Music\", with both of those programs also containing costuming and actions that helped to tell the story.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nAfter achieving popularity, the corps suddenly switched directions in 1989 with cadet-style uniforms and a more darkly themed show, including \"March (from Symphonic Metamorphosis)\" and selections from \"Carmina Burana.\" The corps finished the season out of DCI Finals with a Semifinals tie for 14th place. The stylistic change and the fall from Finals were elements in the  financial difficulties the corps faced in 1990. From its roots as a hometown corps, the Sky Ryders had evolved into a corps with mostly out-of-state members, with the bulk of those members coming from Texas, so, in order to survive, the corps' leadership relocated the organization to [[De Soto, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas]].  After the challenges of the move to Texas, the corps finished the 1990 season in 19th place during DCI Semifinals in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1991, the Sky Ryders once again regained DCI Top 12 status with a return to the corps' tradition of popular musicals, this time with Lerner and Loewe's \"Camelot.\" The corps placed 12th in DCI Finals held in their new hometown of Dallas. The corps performed another popular Lerner and Loewe musical in 1992 with the Scottish-themed \"Brigadoon,\" but during DCI's 20th Anniversary Championships in Madison, the corps only placed 15th in Semifinals.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the Sky Ryders once more abandoned their successful formula for a \"more contemporary show\", including \"Connotations\" by Edward Gregson and \"Symphony No. 2\" by David Diamond, and the corps finished their last full season of competition with a placement of 20th in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. Despite plans for a 1994 season, the corps' continuing financial difficulties resulted in bankruptcy and the disbanding of the corps. Although the corps had departed the scene, the efforts of the unit's director during its Texas tenure, Paul Proctor, saw that all of the corps' substantial debt was eventually paid off.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\n== Show summary (1960\u20131993)==\nThe following is a list of Sky Ryders shows from 1960 to 1993.<ref name=\"songhistory\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpsdet&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Song History for Sky Ryders]</ref>\n\n''Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist.''\n\n{|border = \"1\" style = \"text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse; width:100%\"\n|-\n!

This process is called [[folksonomy]].\n\n== Origin and uses ==\nThe [[Number sign|number sign or hash symbol]] \"#\" is often used in [[information technology]] to highlight a special meaning. (The symbol is also called a \"pound sign\" in the US, and \"hash\" in the UK) In 1970, for example, the number sign was used to denote ''immediate'' [[address mode]] in the [[assembly language]] of the [[PDP-11]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://programmer209.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/the-pdp-11-assembly-language/ |title=PDP-11 assembly language |publisher=Programmer209.wordpress.com |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref> when placed next to a symbol or a number.

This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the pound sign: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North-American version with an 80-degree angle. The North-American version seems to have prevailed as most pound signs in [[Europe]] now follow the 80-degree inclination.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-E.161-198811-S!!PDF-E&type=items |title=Recommendation E.161 - Arrangement of figures, letters and symbols on telephones and other devices that can be used for gaining access to a telephone network  |publisher=ITU |date=November 25, 1988}}</ref>\n\nThe pound sign was adopted for use within IRC ([[Internet Relay Chat]]) networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics.<ref>\"Channel Scope\".

Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen [[digital on-screen graphic|bug]], encouraging viewers to participate in a [[backchannel]] of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. [[Television commercial]]s have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/New-TV-Screen-1032111.aspx|title = New to Your TV Screen: Twitter Hashtags|date = April 21, 2011<!-- 3:25 PM-->|author = Michael Schneider|magazine = TV Guide}}</ref> Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://mashable.com/2012/12/03/mcdonalds-tv-ad-twitter-hashtag/|title = McDonald's Releases First TV Ad With Twitter Hashtag|date = December 3, 2012|author = Todd Wasserman|publisher = Mashable}}</ref>\n\nWhile personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or \"branded\" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., [[The Ed Show|#edshow]] as well as @edshow) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to \"trend\" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for a live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags that identify a series being broadcast (e.g., [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia|#SunnyFX]]) and instantaneous, \"temporary\" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1747437/twitter-tv-hashtag-tips-twitters-own-expert|title = Twitter TV Hashtag Tips From Twitter's Own Expert|author = Gregory Ferenstein|date = April 15, 2011|magazine = Fast Company}}</ref> Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen television ratings system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/twitter-chatter-correlates-tv-ratings-good-or-bad-news-nielsen-1144311 |title=Twitter Chatter Correlates With TV Ratings, But Is That Good Or Bad News For Nielsen? |work=International Business Times |date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn example of trending \"temporary\" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]], a variety [[talk show]] on [[NBC]]. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called \"Tonight Show Hashtags,\" which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the \"Tonight Show Hashtags\" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded \"[[Index term|keywords]]\" by [[AOL]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/10/twitter-hashtag-pages-aol-keywords/|title = Twitter's Hashtag Pages Could Be The New AOL Keywords \u2014 But Better|author = Ryan Lawler|date = June 10, 2012|publisher = Techcrunch}}</ref>\n\nThe late-night television comedy [[game show]] [[@midnight]] with [[Chris Hardwick]] on [[Comedy Central]] features a daily game entitled \"Hashtag Wars,\" in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme.\n\nSome hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan \"''[[Je suis Charlie]],''\" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with ''Charlie Hebdo'' offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.\n\n==== Purchasing ====\n\nSince February 2013 Twitter and [[American Express]] have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag.<ref>{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = Heather | title = Twitter and Amex let you pay with a hashtag | date = February 12, 2013 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/11/tech/social-media/twitter-hashtag-purchases/| work = CNN | accessdate = November 25, 2013}}</ref> American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |title=Sync with Twitter |publisher=Amex Sync |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125121304/https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |archive-date=November 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Event promotion ====\n[[File:Occupy for Rights.JPG|thumb|[[Stencil graffiti]] promoting the hashtag #OccupyForRights]]\n\nOrganized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.\n\nCompanies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.\n\nPolitical protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as [[Occupy Wall Street|#OccupyWallStreet]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|#LibyaFeb17]], have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] officially titled the [[2018 Russia\u2013United States summit]] as the \"#HELSINKI2018 Meeting\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://um.fi/helsinki2018|title=#HELSINKI2018 - Ministry for Foreign Affairs|website=um.fi|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==== Consumer complaints ====\nHashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms  to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term \"bashtag\" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag  to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, [[McDonald's]] created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.<ref>{{cite news | first = Alexis | last = Akwagyiram | title = Are Twitter and Facebook changing the way we complain? | date = May 17, 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18081651 | work = BBC News | accessdate = June 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Sentiment analysis ====\nThe use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest [[Prediction|predictor]] of whether or not a statement is [[sarcasm|sarcastic]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|title=Who cares about sarcastic tweets?

The use of embedded capitals ([[CamelCase]]) increases legibility and avoids confusion.

In China, microblogs [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Tencent Weibo]] use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between [[Chinese characters]] necessitates a closing tag. [[Twitter]] uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and [[orthographies]] with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g., '\u6211 #\u7231 \u4f60' instead of '\u6211#\u7231\u4f60')<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rick|title=Twitter Rolls Out Hashtag Support for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian|url=https://www.techinasia.com/twitter-hashtag-languages/|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Tech in Asia|date=July 13, 2011}}</ref> or by  [[zero-width non-joiner]] characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '\u6211&#8204;#\u7231&#8204;\u4f60', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).<ref>{{cite news|last1=International services team|title=Right-to-left languages on Twitter|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Twitter|date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172013/https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation.

Twitter warns that adding hashtags to unrelated tweets, or repeated use of the same hashtag without adding to a conversation can filter an account from search results, or suspend the account.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Twitter Rules|url=https://support.twitter.com/groups/56-policies-violations/topics/236-twitter-rules-policies/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules|publisher=Twitter, Inc.|accessdate=September 22, 2017|quote=if you post multiple unrelated updates to a topic using # ...}}</ref>\n\n[[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] performed a sketch parodying the often incorrect and misunderstood use of hashtags on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' in September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA |title=\"#Hashtag\" with Jimmy Fallon & Justin Timberlake (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon) |publisher=YouTube |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Function ==\n[[File:Seguir hashtags.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Search bar in the header of a social networking site, searching for most recent posts containing the hashtag #science]]\n\nHashtags are mostly used in unmoderated, ad hoc discussion forums; any combination of characters led by a hash symbol is a hashtag, and any hashtag, if promoted by enough individuals, can \"trend\" and attract more individual users to discussion. On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it appears in the \"Trending Topics\" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be \"retired\" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them.\n\nHashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become \"trending topics\" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there must be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.\n\nHashtags also function as beacons that help users find and \"follow\" (subscribe) or \"list\" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.\n\nTelevision broadcasters such as [[Channel 4]] have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as [[First Dates]] and [[The Undateables]]. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme.\n\nHashtags can be used on the social network [[Instagram]], by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750 |title=Instagram banned hashtags | date = November 7, 2013|work=[[BBC.co.uk]] |accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular [[subaltern]] communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.<ref>Olszanowski, M. (2014). \"Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship{{sic|hide=y}}\". ''Visual Communication Quarterly,'' 21(1), 83\u201395. Retrieved February 8, 2015, from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15551393.2014.928154#.VNgGT7DF-7FF-7F</ref>\n\nFamous YouTube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic.\n\nHashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta-commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linguistics.fi/julkaisut/SKY2014/Wikstrom.pdf|title=#srynotfunny: Communicative Functions of Hashtags on Twitter|last=Wikstr\u00f6m|first=Peter|date=2014|work=SKY Journal of Linguistics|access-date=May 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. \"My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan\". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with \"It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm\" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, \"BREAKING NEWS: US GDP growth is back! #kidding\". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: \"Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility,\" where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite

This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the pound sign: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North-American version with an 80-degree angle. The North-American version seems to have prevailed as most pound signs in [[Europe]] now follow the 80-degree inclination.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-E.161-198811-S!!PDF-E&type=items |title=Recommendation E.161 - Arrangement of figures, letters and symbols on telephones and other devices that can be used for gaining access to a telephone network  |publisher=ITU |date=November 25, 1988}}</ref>\n\nThe pound sign was adopted for use within IRC ([[Internet Relay Chat]]) networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics.<ref>\"Channel Scope\".

Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen [[digital on-screen graphic|bug]], encouraging viewers to participate in a [[backchannel]] of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. [[Television commercial]]s have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/New-TV-Screen-1032111.aspx|title = New to Your TV Screen: Twitter Hashtags|date = April 21, 2011<!-- 3:25 PM-->|author = Michael Schneider|magazine = TV Guide}}</ref> Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://mashable.com/2012/12/03/mcdonalds-tv-ad-twitter-hashtag/|title = McDonald's Releases First TV Ad With Twitter Hashtag|date = December 3, 2012|author = Todd Wasserman|publisher = Mashable}}</ref>\n\nWhile personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or \"branded\" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., [[The Ed Show|#edshow]] as well as @edshow) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to \"trend\" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for a live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags that identify a series being broadcast (e.g., [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia|#SunnyFX]]) and instantaneous, \"temporary\" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1747437/twitter-tv-hashtag-tips-twitters-own-expert|title = Twitter TV Hashtag Tips From Twitter's Own Expert|author = Gregory Ferenstein|date = April 15, 2011|magazine = Fast Company}}</ref> Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen television ratings system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/twitter-chatter-correlates-tv-ratings-good-or-bad-news-nielsen-1144311 |title=Twitter Chatter Correlates With TV Ratings, But Is That Good Or Bad News For Nielsen? |work=International Business Times |date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn example of trending \"temporary\" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]], a variety [[talk show]] on [[NBC]]. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called \"Tonight Show Hashtags,\" which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the \"Tonight Show Hashtags\" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded \"[[Index term|keywords]]\" by [[AOL]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/10/twitter-hashtag-pages-aol-keywords/|title = Twitter's Hashtag Pages Could Be The New AOL Keywords \u2014 But Better|author = Ryan Lawler|date = June 10, 2012|publisher = Techcrunch}}</ref>\n\nThe late-night television comedy [[game show]] [[@midnight]] with [[Chris Hardwick]] on [[Comedy Central]] features a daily game entitled \"Hashtag Wars,\" in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme.\n\nSome hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan \"''[[Je suis Charlie]],''\" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with ''Charlie Hebdo'' offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.\n\n==== Purchasing ====\n\nSince February 2013 Twitter and [[American Express]] have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag.<ref>{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = Heather | title = Twitter and Amex let you pay with a hashtag | date = February 12, 2013 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/11/tech/social-media/twitter-hashtag-purchases/| work = CNN | accessdate = November 25, 2013}}</ref> American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |title=Sync with Twitter |publisher=Amex Sync |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125121304/https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |archive-date=November 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Event promotion ====\n[[File:Occupy for Rights.JPG|thumb|[[Stencil graffiti]] promoting the hashtag #OccupyForRights]]\n\nOrganized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.\n\nCompanies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.\n\nPolitical protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as [[Occupy Wall Street|#OccupyWallStreet]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|#LibyaFeb17]], have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] officially titled the [[2018 Russia\u2013United States summit]] as the \"#HELSINKI2018 Meeting\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://um.fi/helsinki2018|title=#HELSINKI2018 - Ministry for Foreign Affairs|website=um.fi|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==== Consumer complaints ====\nHashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms  to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term \"bashtag\" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag  to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, [[McDonald's]] created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.<ref>{{cite news | first = Alexis | last = Akwagyiram | title = Are Twitter and Facebook changing the way we complain? | date = May 17, 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18081651 | work = BBC News | accessdate = June 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Sentiment analysis ====\nThe use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest [[Prediction|predictor]] of whether or not a statement is [[sarcasm|sarcastic]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|title=Who cares about sarcastic tweets?

It is always safe to precede the \"#\" with a space, and to include letters without diacritics, digits, and underscores.{{r|charset}} In many cases, other characters are also allowed, in particular, accented characters used in many languages, but handling may vary from one client to another and from time to time as standards evolve. A discussion of hashtag standards suggests that if #Romeo&Juliet is used, different Twitter clients might link to #Romeo, #Romeo&, or #Romeo&Juliet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2010/02/hashtag-standards/ |title=Hashtag Standards|website=Terence Eden's Blog|date=25 February 2010|author=Terence Eden|accessdate= 21 September 2017}}</ref> Hashtags are not case sensitive: a search for \"#hashtag\" finds \"#HashTag\". The use of embedded capitals ([[CamelCase]]) increases legibility and avoids confusion. A (real) pen shop should use #PenIsland rather than all lower-case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.penisland.net/ |title=Pen Island Pens - Home |website=Penisland.net |date=  |author= |accessdate= 21 September 2017}}</ref> On microblogging and social networking sites hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a text, often at the beginning or the end, but also within the text, usually as a word (e.g., \"It is #sunny today\").\n\nLanguages that do not use letters handle hashtags differently. In China, microblogs [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Tencent Weibo]] use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between [[Chinese characters]] necessitates a closing tag. [[Twitter]] uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and [[orthographies]] with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g., '\u6211 #\u7231 \u4f60' instead of '\u6211#\u7231\u4f60')<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rick|title=Twitter Rolls Out Hashtag Support for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian|url=https://www.techinasia.com/twitter-hashtag-languages/|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Tech in Asia|date=July 13, 2011}}</ref> or by  [[zero-width non-joiner]] characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '\u6211&#8204;#\u7231&#8204;\u4f60', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).<ref>{{cite news|last1=International services team|title=Right-to-left languages on Twitter|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Twitter|date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172013/https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation.

On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it appears in the \"Trending Topics\" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be \"retired\" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them.\n\nHashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become \"trending topics\" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there must be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.\n\nHashtags also function as beacons that help users find and \"follow\" (subscribe) or \"list\" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.\n\nTelevision broadcasters such as [[Channel 4]] have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as [[First Dates]] and [[The Undateables]]. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme.\n\nHashtags can be used on the social network [[Instagram]], by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750 |title=Instagram banned hashtags | date = November 7, 2013|work=[[BBC.co.uk]] |accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular [[subaltern]] communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.<ref>Olszanowski, M. (2014). \"Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship{{sic|hide=y}}\". ''Visual Communication Quarterly,'' 21(1), 83\u201395. Retrieved February 8, 2015, from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15551393.2014.928154#.VNgGT7DF-7FF-7F</ref>\n\nFamous YouTube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic.\n\nHashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta-commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linguistics.fi/julkaisut/SKY2014/Wikstrom.pdf|title=#srynotfunny: Communicative Functions of Hashtags on Twitter|last=Wikstr\u00f6m|first=Peter|date=2014|work=SKY Journal of Linguistics|access-date=May 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. \"My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan\". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with \"It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm\" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, \"BREAKING NEWS: US GDP growth is back! #kidding\". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: \"Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility,\" where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite
