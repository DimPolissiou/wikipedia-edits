He had an older half-brother, [[Yakov Dzhugashvili]] (born 1907), from his father's first marriage to [[Kato Svanidze]], and a younger sister, [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]], was born in 1926.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|p=15}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kotkin|2014|p=466}}</ref> The family also took in [[Artyom Sergeyev]], the son of [[Fyodor Sergeyev]], a close friend of Joseph. Fyodor died four months after the birth of Artyom in an accident, so the boy was raised in the Stalin household.<ref>{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=351}}</ref>\n\nAs his mother was interested in pursuing a professional career, a [[nanny]], Alexandra Bychokova, was hired to look after Stalin and Svetlana.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1932 his mother shot herself.<ref>{{harvnb|Kotkin|2017|pp=110\u2013111}}</ref> To conceal the suicide, the children were told that Alliluyeva had died of [[peritonitis]], a complication from [[appendicitis]]. It would be 10 years before they learned the truth of their mother's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|p=53}}</ref> Svetlana would later write that the death of their mother had a profound impact on her brother. She noted that he started to [[alcoholism|drink alcohol]] at the age of 13, and in drunken episodes would curse and attack her.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|p=72}}</ref> \n\nStarting from the death of Alliluyeva, Joseph Stalin ceased to visit his children; only the nursemaid and head of Stalin's security guards looked after Vasily and his sister. One officer, Sergei Efimov, was charged with continuously looking after the two children.\n\n==Military service==\nVasily started his active military service in the 16th Fighter Aviation Regiment in Moscow.{{when|date=January 2019}} Here he met Galina Burdonskaia, his future wife. They married when Vasily was 19.\n\nHe was transferred to the front in August 1941, and given the surname Ivanov in an attempt to conceal his identity. As the son of Stalin he flew in combat rarely, and when he did he was accompanied by a [[Formation flying|formation]]. In total Stalin took part in 29 combat missions, and is said to have shot down two enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"Kun 360\">{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=360}}</ref> As the son of the Soviet leader, Stalin was hated by most of his colleagues, who felt he was an informant to his father.<ref>{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=357}}</ref> In the spring of 1942 he was sent back to Moscow, and given a role inspecting the conditions of the air force, and mainly stayed in Moscow for the rest of the war.<ref name=\"Kun 360\"/> Bored in this role, Stalin found himself in trouble after an 4 April 1943 incident where he had explosives dropped into the [[Moskva River]], injuring himself and killing the flight engineer.<ref>{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=361}}</ref> \n\nAs a result of the explosion, Stalin was demoted, though within a year and a half he was promoted to command an air division. He was further promoted to general, and at the age of 24 was made the youngest [[major-general]] in the [[Red Army]]. He was also awarded several decorations, including the [[Order of Red Banner]] (twice), the [[Order of Alexander Nevsky]], and the [[Order of Suvarov]]. After the war he was transferred to Germany as part of the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=362}}</ref>\n\nHe was promoted to major-general in 1946, to Lieutenant-General in 1947, and to Commander of the [[Air Forces of the Moscow Military District]] in 1948.\n\n==Arrest and imprisonment==\nJoseph Stalin died on 4 March 1953. Vasily arrived shortly after the death of his father, and in a drunken rage claimed his father had been poisoned.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|p=184}}</ref> After his father's death, a long period of troubles began for Stalin. The [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Defense Ministry]] offered him to take up command of any [[Military districts of the Soviet Union|military district]], but he would only accept Moscow. This was not possible so instead Stalin was forced to retire from the military.<ref>{{harvnb|Alliluyeva|1967|p=224}}</ref> Less than two months after his father's death Stalin was arrested on 28 April 1953, because he had visited a restaurant with foreign diplomats. He was charged with [[Wiktionary:denigration#Noun|denigration]] of the Soviet Union's leaders, [[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet propaganda]] and criminal negligence, and sentenced to eight years in prison.<ref>{{harvnb|Alliluyeva|1967|p=225}}</ref>\n\nStalin asked the new Soviet leaders, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]], for clemency but he was considered a dangerous person, and he was judged in a behind-closed-doors trial and was not allowed legal representation. He was imprisoned in the special penitentiary of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] under the name \"Vasily Pavlovich Vasilyev\". He was released from prison on 11 January 1960. The [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] issued him a pension of 300 rubles, an apartment in Moscow, and a three-month treatment vacation in [[Kislovodsk]]. He was also granted permission to wear his general's uniform and all of his military medals.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 (\u043a\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0444) \u0418.\u0412.\u0414\u0436\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0448\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438 (\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430) \u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438.JPG|right|thumb|Stalin's grave in [[Kazan]].]]\nVasily Stalin died on 19 March 1962, due to chronic alcoholism, two days before his 41st birthday.<ref>{{harvnb|Alliluyeva|1967|p=230}}</ref> \n\nVasily Stalin was partially [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabillitated]] in 1999, when the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court lifted charges of anti-Soviet propaganda that dated from 1953.

[[Nadezhda Alliluyeva]].\n\n==Early life==\nStalin was born on 21 March 1921, the son of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva]]. He had an older half-brother, [[Yakov Dzhugashvili]] (born 1907), from his father's first marriage to [[Kato Svanidze]], and a younger sister, [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]], was born in 1926.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|p=15}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kotkin|2014|p=466}}</ref> The family also took in [[Artyom Sergeyev]], the son of [[Fyodor Sergeyev]], a close friend of Joseph. Fyodor died four months after the birth of Artyom in an accident, so the boy was raised in the Stalin household.<ref>{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=351}}</ref>\n\nAs his mother was interested in pursuing a professional career, a [[nanny]], Alexandra Bychokova, was hired to look after Stalin and Svetlana.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1932 his mother shot herself.<ref>{{harvnb|Kotkin|2017|pp=110\u2013111}}</ref> To conceal the suicide, the children were told that Alliluyeva had died of [[peritonitis]], a complication from [[appendicitis]]. It would be 10 years before they learned the truth of their mother's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|p=53}}</ref> Svetlana would later write that the death of their mother had a profound impact on her brother. She noted that he started to [[alcoholism|drink alcohol]] at the age of 13, and in drunken episodes would curse and attack her.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|p=72}}</ref> \n\nStarting from the death of Alliluyeva, Joseph Stalin ceased to visit his children; only the nursemaid and head of Stalin's security guards looked after Vasily and his sister. One officer, Sergei Efimov, was charged with continuously looking after the two children.\n\n==Military service==\nVasily started his active military service in the 16th Fighter Aviation Regiment in Moscow.{{when|date=January 2019}} Here he met Galina Burdonskaia, his future wife. They married when Vasily was 19.\n\nHe was transferred to the front in August 1941, and given the surname Ivanov in an attempt to conceal his identity. As the son of Stalin he flew in combat rarely, and when he did he was accompanied by a [[Formation flying|formation]]. In total Stalin took part in 29 combat missions, and is said to have shot down two enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"Kun 360>{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=360}}</ref> As the son of the Soviet leader, Stalin was hated by most of his colleagues, who felt he was an informant to his father.<ref>{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=357}}</ref> In the spring of 1942 he was sent back to Moscow, and given a role inspecting the conditions of the air force, and mainly stayed in Moscow for the rest of the war.<ref name=\"Kun 360/> Bored in this role, Stalin found himself in trouble after an 4 April 1943 incident where he had explosives dropped into the [[Moskva River]], injuring himself and killing the flight engineer.<ref>{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=361}}</ref> \n\nAs a result of the explosion, Stalin was demoted, though within a year and a half he was promoted to command an air division. He was further promoted to general, and at the age of 24 was made the youngest [[major-general]] in the [[Red Army]]. He was also awarded several decorations, including the [[Order of Red Banner]] (twice), the [[Order of Alexander Nevsky]], and the [[Order of Suvarov]]. After the war he was transferred to Germany as part of the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kun|2003|p=362}}</ref>\n\nHe was promoted to major-general in 1946, to Lieutenant-General in 1947, and to Commander of the [[Air Forces of the Moscow Military District]] in 1948.\n\n==Arrest and imprisonment==\nJoseph Stalin died on 4 March 1953. Vasily arrived shortly after the death of his father, and in a drunken rage claimed his father had been poisoned.<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2015|p=184}}</ref> After his father's death, a long period of troubles began for Stalin. The [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Defense Ministry]] offered him to take up command of any [[Military districts of the Soviet Union|military district]], but he would only accept Moscow. This was not possible so instead Stalin was forced to retire from the military.<ref>{{harvnb|Alliluyeva|1967|p=224}}</ref> Less than two months after his father's death Stalin was arrested on 28 April 1953, because he had visited a restaurant with foreign diplomats. He was charged with [[Wiktionary:denigration#Noun|denigration]] of the Soviet Union's leaders, [[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet propaganda]] and criminal negligence, and sentenced to eight years in prison.<ref>{{harvnb|Alliluyeva|1967|p=225}}</ref>\n\nStalin asked the new Soviet leaders, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]], for clemency but he was considered a dangerous person, and he was judged in a behind-closed-doors trial and was not allowed legal representation. He was imprisoned in the special penitentiary of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] under the name \"Vasily Pavlovich Vasilyev\". He was released from prison on 11 January 1960. The [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] issued him a pension of 300 rubles, an apartment in Moscow, and a three-month treatment vacation in [[Kislovodsk]]. He was also granted permission to wear his general's uniform and all of his military medals.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 (\u043a\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0444) \u0418.\u0412.\u0414\u0436\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0448\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438 (\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430) \u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438.JPG|right|thumb|Stalin's grave in [[Kazan]].]]\nVasily Stalin died on 19 March 1962, due to chronic alcoholism, two days before his 41st birthday.<ref>{{harvnb|Alliluyeva|1967|p=230}}</ref> \n\nVasily Stalin was partially [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabillitated]] in 1999, when the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court lifted charges of anti-Soviet propaganda that dated from 1953.

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm.

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm.
