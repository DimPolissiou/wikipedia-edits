Despite the constant threat of discovery, as the  [[Falange|Falangists]] search for him, the couple's love helps them to remain resilient.<ref name=\"SSIFF2019\"/> Higonio becomes increasingly isolated in his hiding spot, where he stays until the 1969 amnesty. The story is told in chapter-like sections, each with titles alluding to the themes.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1933, at the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]], a newly-married man who has criticized Franco's army and government fears that he will be the victim of reprisal killings and goes into hiding. As Falangists search for him, he hides under the floor of his house with the help of his wife. The first section, titled \u201ccampeada\u201d (\"to run\u201d) depicts his first period where he is on the run from his pursuers.\n\nThe next section is titled \u201cesconder\u201d (\u201cto hide\u201d) shows his  betrayal by his neighbor, and then his move to a trench dug under the kitchen. The next section is titled \u201cdetenci\u00f2n\u201d (\u201ctemporary loss of freedom\u201d). During this section, the couple start to imagine that the Nationalists will win the civil war, but this is only a fantasy.\n\nThe next section is titled \u201cPeligro\u201d (\"danger\"). As the political situation worsens, Higinio's wife is arrested, but she does not betray her husband's hiding place. The next section is titled \u201cencerrar\u201d  (\u201cshut down\u201d).\nIt is about his isolation in his hiding spot. His wife gets pregnant with their child, and at times she is gone from the house for periods. When two gay men start staying in the house, Higinio befriends them.\n\nThe next section is called \u201cAprtado\u201d (\u201cremote\u201d). Higinio starts to feel very isolated and detached from outside world, which he can only see in glimpses through the curtains or from muffled spunds. He tries to follow the news on the radio and TV to learn more. In the \u201ccambiar\u201d (\u201cchange\u201d) and \u201cfranco\u201d (\u201cfrank\u201d) sections, Higino goes through a major change. With the birth of his son, Higinio starts to reconsider whether he should remain in hiding. His wife tells him the family has been needing his help.\n\nIn the next section, his wife and son start to question why he remains in hiding, arguing that no one is still looking for him. In the neighborhood, it is becoming well known that he is living under the house. However, he has become habituated to his isolation, and it is hard for him to leave his hole.\n\nThe next chapter is titled \u201cdesenterrar\u201d. Higinio realizes that it is probably safe to come out of hiding. When the Franco government announces an amnesty, and pardons him for his political offenses, he still cannot leave the trench. After 33 years, his isolation has become his normal life.\n\nThe final chapter, \u201cSalir\u201d (\u201cgo out\u201d), begins when his wife, Rosa, leaves him, realizing that Higinio is too trapped in fear. Finally, he manages to leave the hole in 1969, as many other \"topos\" (\"moles\") show themselves again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Antonio de la Torre (actor)|Antonio de la Torre]] as Higinio Blanco, a Republican\n* [[Bel\u00e9n Cuesta]] as Rosa, a seamstress, and Higinii's wife\n* Vicente Vergara as Gonzalo\n* Jos\u00e9 Manuel Poga as Rodrigo\n* Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda del Castillo\n* Carlos Bernardino as [[Falange|Falangista]]\n* Emilio Palacios as Jaime\n* Enrique Asenjo\n* Daniel Morilla\n* Antonio Romero as Fede\t\n* \u00d3scar Corrales as Dami\u00e1n\n* Manuel Dom\u00ednguez as Republicano 1\n* Esperanza Guardado\n* Javi Mena\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere on September 22, 2019 at the 2019 [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"SSIFF2019\"/> \n\nThe film was released in cinemas in Spain on October 31, 2019.<ref name=\"ElPa\u00eds\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|7937168}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|the_endless_trench}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Endless Trench, The}}\n[[Category:2019 films]]\n[[Category:Spanish drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish Civil War films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Andalusia]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Endless Trench\n| image          = The Endless Trench poster.jpg\n| caption        = \n| director       = {{plainlist|\n* [[Jon Gara\u00f1o]]\n* [[Aitor Arregi]]\n* [[Jose Mari Goenaga]]\n}}\n| writer         = {{plainlist|\n* Luiso Berdejo\n* Jose Mari Goenaga\n}}\n| producer       = {{plainlist|\n* Xabier Berzosa\n* I\u00f1aki Gomez\n* I\u00f1igo Obeso\n}}\n| starring       = {{plainlist|\n* [[Antonio de la Torre (actor)|Antonio de la Torre]]\n* [[Bel\u00e9n Cuesta]]\n}}\n| music          = Pascal Gaigne\n| cinematography = Javi Agirre Erauso\n| editing        = {{plainlist|\n* Laurent Dufreche\n* Ra\u00fal L\u00f3pez\n}}\n| studio         = Irusoin<br>Moriarti Produkzioak<br>La Claqueta PC<br>Manny Films\n| distributor    = \n| released       = {{Film date|2019|09|22|df=y|[[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]|2019|10|31|Spain}}<ref name=\"SSIFF2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sansebastianfestival.com/2019/sections_and_films/official_selection/7/670188/in|title=La trinchera infinita / The Endless Trench|work=San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|accessdate=September 24, 2019}}</ref>\n| country        = Spain<br>France\n| language       = Spanish\n| gross          = \n}}\n\n'''''The Endless Trench''''' ({{lang-es|'''La trinchera infinita'''}}) is a 2019 Spanish [[Historical period drama|historical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] film directed by [[Jon Gara\u00f1o]], [[Aitor Arregi]] and [[Jose Mari Goenaga]].<ref name=\"Cineuropa\">{{cite web |last=Rivera|first=Alfonso|url=https://cineuropa.org/en/newsdetail/378548 |title=Review: The Endless Trench |date=22 September 2019 |access-date=24 September 2019 |website=Cineuropa.org}}</ref><ref name=\"ElPa\u00eds\">{{cite news |last=Belinch\u00f3n|first=Gregorio|url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2019/09/22/actualidad/1569135715_040212.html |title=Viaje a unas tinieblas que duraron 30 a\u00f1os |date=23 September 2019 |access-date=24 September 2019 |language=es |newspaper=El Pa\u00eds}}</ref> It premiered at the 2019 [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]], where it won the [[Silver Shell for Best Director]] and the Jury Prize for Best Screenplay.<ref name=\"SSIFF2019\"/><ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite news |last=Hopewell|first=John|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/festivals/pacified-golden-shell-san-sebastian-1203352832/ |title=\u2018Pacified\u2019 Wins Golden Shell at San Sebastian |date=28 September 2019 |access-date=29 September 2019 |magazine=Variety}}</ref>\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1933, young newlyweds Higinio and Rosa are worried about the risk of reprisal killings, as Higinio is a Republican.

With the help of her friend, she rents a room. Initially, she hates her room which is a complete mess, but then she learns that the room was previously occupied by a carefree vagabond named Charlie ([[Dulquer Salmaan]]). When she starts cleaning up the place, she discovers a photo and a sketchbook of this man. The sketches depict the previous New Year's Eve when a small-time thief ([[Soubin Shahir]]) tries to rob the man's room. In a turn-of-events, the man joins him, and they both go on the rooftop of a home. There, they are shocked by what they see inside.  That was the last page of the sketch, and the story is left unfinished, which piques her curiosity about the rest of the story, as well as the previous occupant of the room.\n\nIntrigued, Tessa starts finding the people in the man's sketches. Backtracking his steps, she meets the man's \"father\" (who is more of a friend), a boat servant, and Mariya/Queen Mary ([[Kalpana (Malayalam actress)|Kalpana]]), a physically abused woman. Charlie takes Mariya out to sea for her birthday. Unfortunately, Mariya commits suicide and he becomes heartbroken. Following up on more clues, Tessa gets news that the man is staying in a hotel and rushes to meet him. However, she just misses him by a few seconds. Later a helper boy in the hotel explains to her that the little girl with Charlie was Mariya's daughter.\n\nOne day, she meets the thief depicted in that man's sketches and inquiries about the day's events. He informs her that his sir (Charlie) stopped a woman from hanging herself, and followed her when she escaped from the scene on the bike. They find the house and finally identify the girl as Doctor Kani ([[Aparna Gopinath]]). She then meets Kani and inquires about her story. Kani explains that she was depressed over her broken relationship when she did her first independent operation leading to the death of a 10-year-old girl. Further hooked by the media, she was desperate and about to commit suicide on new year eve and was distracted by that man. He takes her to a home maintained by Kunjappan ([[Nedumudi Venu]]) and she was living there than on. Kunjappan a hopeless romantic is waiting for his teenage love Theresia to show up.\n\nTessa's mother finds her and takes her home. While a depressed Tessa was on her way back home, the man then returns with Kunjappan's long lost love, who is a nun now. Kani informs him about Tessa, and he admits knowing about Tessa and her search for him. Charlie informs Kani that he will be attending the [[Thrissur Pooram]] function, and Tessa can find him there if she's looking for him. Finally, Tessa finds him performing in a magic show.  Afterward, he spots her, approaches, and asks her if she wants to have drinks. At first, she introduces herself as Shruti Raman and lets him think that he has met the wrong person. But as the festival starts, Charlie's antics make her confess that she is indeed Tessa and he too reveals his name to be 'Charlie'. As the credits roll, they are seen wandering together towards a new journey in life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Dulquer Salmaan]] as Charlie\n* [[Parvathy Thiruvothu|Parvathy]] as Tessa\n* [[Aparna Gopinath]] as Kani\n* [[Nedumudi Venu]] as Kunjappan\n* [[Chemban Vinod Jose]] as Mathai/Pathrose\n* [[Kalpana (Malayalam actress)|Kalpana]] as Queen Mary/ Mariya\n* [[Soubin Shahir]] as Sunikuttan/ Mr. D'souza\n* [[Neeraj Madhav]] as Ansari \n* [[P.

With the help of her friend, she rents a room. Initially, she hates her room which is a complete mess, but then she learns that the room was previously occupied by a carefree vagabond named Charlie ([[Dulquer Salmaan]]). When she starts cleaning up the place, she discovers a photo and a sketchbook of this man. The sketches depict the previous New Year's Eve when a small-time thief ([[Soubin Shahir]]) tries to rob the man's room. In a turn-of-events, the man joins him, and they both go on the rooftop of a home. There, they are shocked by what they see inside.  That was the last page of the sketch, and the story is left unfinished, which piques her curiosity about the rest of the story, as well as the previous occupant of the room.\n\nIntrigued, Tessa starts finding the people in the man's sketches. Backtracking his steps, she meets the man's \"father\" (who is more of a friend), a boat servant, and Mariya/Queen Mary ([[Kalpana (Malayalam actress)|Kalpana]]), a physically abused woman. Charlie takes Mariya out to sea for her birthday. Unfortunately, Mariya commits suicide and he becomes heartbroken. Following up on more clues, Tessa gets news that the man is staying in a hotel and rushes to meet him. However, she just misses him by a few seconds. Later a helper boy in the hotel explains to her that the little girl with Charlie was Mariya's daughter.\n\nOne day, she meets the thief depicted in that man's sketches and inquiries about the day's events. He informs her that his sir (Charlie) stopped a woman from hanging herself, and followed her when she escaped from the scene on the bike. They find the house and finally identify the girl as Doctor Kani ([[Aparna Gopinath]]). She then meets Kani and inquires about her story. Kani explains that she was depressed over her broken relationship when she did her first independent operation leading to the death of a 10-year-old girl. Further hooked by the media, she was desperate and about to commit suicide on new year eve and was distracted by that man. He takes her to a home maintained by Kunjappan ([[Nedumudi Venu]]) and she was living there than on. Kunjappan a hopeless romantic is waiting for his teenage love Theresia to show up.\n\nTessa's mother finds her and takes her home. While a depressed Tessa was on her way back home, the man then returns with Kunjappan's long lost love, who is a nun now. Kani informs him about Tessa, and he admits knowing about Tessa and her search for him. Charlie informs Kani that he will be attending the [[Thrissur Pooram]] function, and Tessa can find him there if she's looking for him. Finally, Tessa finds him performing in a magic show.  Afterward, he spots her, approaches, and asks her if she wants to have drinks. At first, she introduces herself as Shruti Raman and lets him think that he has met the wrong person. But as the festival starts, Charlie's antics make her confess that she is indeed Tessa and he too reveals his name to be 'Charlie'. As the credits roll, they are seen wandering together towards a new journey in life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Dulquer Salmaan]] as Charlie\n* [[Parvathy Thiruvothu|Parvathy]] as Tessa\n* [[Aparna Gopinath]] as Kani\n* [[Nedumudi Venu]] as Kunjappan\n* [[Chemban Vinod Jose]] as Mathai/Pathrose\n* [[Kalpana (Malayalam actress)|Kalpana]] as Queen Mary/ Mariya\n* [[Soubin Shahir]] as Sunikuttan/ Mr. D'souza\n* [[Neeraj Madhav]] as Ansari \n* [[P.

{"title_page": "Na Lani \u2018Eh\u0101", "text_new": "'''Na Lani \u02bbEh\u0101''', translated as '''The Royal Four''' or '''The Heavenly Four''', refers to the siblings King [[Kal\u0101kaua]], Queen [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]], Princess [[Likelike]] and Prince [[Leleiohoku II|William Pitt Leleiohoku II]]. All four were composers, known for their patronage and enrichment of Hawaii's musical culture and history. All four of them organized glee clubs. William Pitt Leleiohoku II, the youngest brother who died at age 22, was a guitar master, and leader of the Kawaihau Glee Club. He was believed to have been one of the most talented of the family. Youngest sister [[Likelike]] was a musician and a co-founder of the Kaohuokalani Singing Club. \n\nQueen Lili\u02bbuokalani and King Kal\u0101kaua were the eldest siblings and had the most profound impact on Hawaii's culture. Both mentored numerous individuals, some of whom went on to musical careers in their own rights. Kal\u0101kaua did the most to revive Hawaiian culture when as monarch he showcased native Hawaiian music and traditional hula at his coronation and birthday jubilee celebrations, kickstarting the first [[Hawaiian Renaissance]]. Prior to his actions, those two mainstays of Hawaiian culture had been pushed into the shadows for decades by religious conservatives. He was the founder of Kal\u0101kaua's Singing Boys glee club, as well as Hui Lei Mamo glee club which featured many hula dancers. After her ascension to the throne upon her brother's death, Lili\u02bbuokalani sent Hui Lei Mamo on a tour throughout the United States and Europe. She was the most prolific songwriter of the siblings, and both she and Kal\u0101kaua collaborated with Royal Hawaiian bandmaster [[Henri Berger]].  \n\nThe Royal Four's aggregate body of musical compositions in the [[Hawaiian language]] numbers in the hundreds.  The [[Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame]], formed in 1994, acknowledges the royal siblings as their patrons, recognizing their roles as the progenitors of Hawaii's music and arts culture that the world identifies with today.\n\n== Terminology ==\n''Na Lani \u02bbEh\u0101'', translates as ''The Royal Four'' or ''The Heavenly Four''.<ref name=\"AboutUs\" /> In the [[Hawaiian language]], ''na'' is a plural form of \"the\", ''lani'' means \"heaven\" or \"royal\", while ''\u02bbEh\u0101'' is \"four\".{{sfn|Pukui|Elbert|1986|pages=xiii, 38, 193, 544}} In [[Ancient Hawaii|traditional Hawaiian]] culture, the ''[[ali\u02bbi]]'' (chiefs or royals) class were poetically referred to as ''lani'' or \"Heavenly Ones\". Prior to the advent of [[Christianity]] in the kingdom, the highest-ranking ali\u02bbi were worshiped as ''akua'' or gods.{{sfn|Sahlins|1996|page=128}} They were considered sacred individuals, who governed with divine power ''[[mana]]'', which was derived from the spiritual energy of their ancestors.{{sfn|Koskinen|1960|pages=110\u2013111}}\n\nThe collective name predates the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame's acknowledgement in 1994.

The hula was viewed by them as evil and corrupt, and it was eventually banned from public performances by Queen consort [[Ka\u2018ahumanu]].{{sfn|Carr|2014|p=110}} Nevertheless, the hula continued to be practiced in private settings. The Royal Four siblings were raised in the Protestant Christian faith, but saw the hula as part of their cultural heritage. One of the leading critics of the Kal\u0101kaua era was Presbyterian minister [[Sereno E. Bishop]] who often incorporated his revulsion of the \"bestialities of the ''hula hula''\"<ref>{{cite news |title=The Rev. Sereno E.

During the king's 1883 coronation, local chanter and hula master [[\u02bbIoane \u02bb\u016ak\u0113k\u0113]], aka Dandy Ioane, danced with hula girls, before an estimated 5,000 luau guests.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=259, 264}}{{sfn|Allen|1995|page=150}} \"Dandy\" was an apt name for Ioane, who specially tailored his own clothing in a style that led one newspaper to call him, \"Honolulu's [[Beau Brummell]]\".<ref>{{cite news |title='Dandy' Ioane Was A Porter \u2013 He Made His Own Fine Raiment \u2013 Blossomed In Royalty Days |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/47938912/dandy-ioane-was-a-porter-he-made/ |accessdate=April 4, 2020 |work=The Honolulu Advertiser |date=January 20, 1927}}</ref> The hula that was  choreographed  for the coronation blended the traditional style with the more modern steps, with a printed program provided to the public. Legislator [[William Richards Castle]] filed a lawsuit against the printer on grounds of obscenity.{{sfn|Silva|2004|pp=108\u2013112}} \n\nAnother event where the king celebrated Hawaiian culture, was at his two-week 50th birthday Jubilee in 1886. The celebration  began with a parade featuring the hula, and floats representing stories from native Hawaiian culture.  Hula was once again performed at the evening luau gala celebration, continuing through the night until the dawn of the next day. Unlike the reactions to the hula performances at the coronation, very little was reported in the media about the Jubilee hulas.{{sfn|Silva|2004|pp=112\u2013120}} Kal\u0101kaua's reign is generally regarded as the first [[Hawaiian Renaissance#First Hawaiian Renaissance|Hawaiian Renaissance]], for both his influence on Hawaii's music, and for other contributions he made to reinvigorate Hawaiian culture.

All four were composers, known for their patronage and enrichment of Hawaii's musical culture and history. All four of them organized glee clubs. William Pitt Leleiohoku II, the youngest brother who died at age 22, was a guitar master, and leader of the Kawaihau Glee Club. He was believed to have been one of the most talented of the family. Youngest sister [[Likelike]] was a musician and and a co-founder of the Kaohuokalani Singing Club. \n\nQueen Lili\u02bbuokalani and King Kal\u0101kaua were the eldest siblings and had the most profound impact on Hawaii's culture. Both mentored numerous individuals, some of whom went on to musical careers in their own rights. Kal\u0101kaua did the most to revive Hawaiian culture when as monarch he showcased native Hawaiian music and traditional hula at his coronation and birthday jubilee celebrations, kickstarting the first [[Hawaiian Renaissance]]. Prior to his actions, those two mainstays of Hawaiian culture had been pushed into the shadows for decades by religious conservatives. He was the founder of Kal\u0101kaua's Singing Boys glee club, as well as Hui Lei Mamo glee club which featured many hula dancers.

The Royal Four siblings were raised in the Protestant Christian faith, but saw the hula as part of their cultural heritage.

The celebration  began with a parade featuring the hula, and floats representing stories from native Hawaiian culture.  Hula was once again performed at the evening luau gala celebration, continuing through the night until the dawn of the next day.
