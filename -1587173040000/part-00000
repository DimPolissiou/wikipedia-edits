Relocating again to [[San Francisco]] the next year, they released 1992's ''[[Bivouac (album)|Bivouac]]'' through the Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label.\n\nSchwarzenbach's charisma and personal, frustrated lyrics helped establish him as a [[cult following|cult idol]], even as he underwent surgery to remove painful, voice-threatening [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]]s from his throat. Jawbreaker toured with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] in 1993 and released ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]'' in 1994, attracting the attention of major labels. They signed a $1 million contract with [[DGC Records]] and released 1995's ''[[Dear You]]'', but its more polished production and smooth vocals caused significant backlash from the band's core audience.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> Internal tensions led to Jawbreaker's dissolution in 1996. On April 19, 2017, the band announced their reunion.<ref name=\"reunion\"/>\n\nFollowing the breakup, the members of Jawbreaker were active in other projects including [[Jets to Brazil]] and [[Whysall Lane]]. Pfahler continued to issue previously-recorded Jawbreaker material through his Blackball Records label, and public interest in the band continued due in part to nationally charting [[pop punk]] and emo acts openly indebted to Jawbreaker's sound. In 2004, Pfahler licensed the out-of-print ''Dear You'' from DGC's parent company [[Geffen Records]] and re-released it to a positive response. He has since issued a [[audio mastering|remastered]] version of ''Unfun'', and plans to remaster the rest of the band's catalog.\n\n== History ==\n=== 1986\u201390: Formation and ''Unfun'' ===\nPrior to forming Jawbreaker, [[Blake Schwarzenbach]] and Adam Pfahler were childhood friends in [[Santa Monica, California]] and classmates at [[Crossroads High School]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\">{{Cite journal |last=Kelley |first=Trevor |title=The Oral History of Jawbreaker |journal=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |page=79 |date=September 2010  |volume=25 |issue=266 |location=[[Cleveland]]}}</ref> In 1986 they moved to [[New York City]] to attend [[New York University]] and decided to start a band.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Seeking a [[bassist]], they responded to a [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] posted on campus by Chris Bauermeister.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> \"It wasn't just this Xeroxed thing\", Pfahler later recalled, \"It was something he had drawn, like a poster. It was all colored and it named all the right bands.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> The trio began practicing together at Giant Studios on [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], with Schwarzenbach on [[guitar]] and Pfahler on [[drum kit|drums]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> \"It was just us, trying to figure each other out in that hourly room for a while\", recalls Schwarzenbach, \"We went through ''a lot'' of incarnations before we sounded anything like the band we became. I am glad we didn't play live [very much then], because I had to go through my [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] phase.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> They practiced with several singers and went through several names during this time, eventually settling on the name Rise.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 1987 Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister took time off from college and moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue Rise, adding Bauermeister's childhood friend Jon Liu on lead vocals.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> This changed, however, when Schwarzenbach wrote and sang \"Shield Your Eyes\" for the band's [[demo (music)|demo]]. It was the first recording on which he sang, and he later noted that it \"kind of defined where we would go as a band\".<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> According to Liu, \"That was the song where everything worked. The vocal arrangements. The lyrics. It was a perfect piece. But to my detriment, I kind of bristled against it. I was like, 'This is amazing, and I don't think I can do ''anything'' like this.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> The band soon changed their name to Jawbreaker and Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister decided to continue as a trio with Schwarzenbach on vocals.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Bauermeister was given the task of informing Liu that he was no longer in the band, which proved awkward since the two were roommates.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> \"I am cool with it now,\" reflected Liu in 2010, \"It was to everybody's benefit.

Then there were maybe 25 utterly forgettable metal-club-in-Florida-type shows.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Bauermeister stopped speaking to Pfahler and Schwarzenbach when the tour reached Canada, with several weeks still to go. By the conclusion of the tour, tensions between the members had risen to the point where they announced the band's breakup.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Schwarzenbach and Bauermeister returned to New York University to finish their degrees, and rarely spoke to each other.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\">Kelley, p. 80.</ref>\n\n=== 1991\u201392: Relocation and ''Bivouac'' ===\nPfahler quickly regretted the breakup, while Schwarzenbach and Bauermeister eventually reconciled in New York.<ref>Kelley, pp. 79\u201380.</ref> The trio decided to continue with Jawbreaker and relocate to [[San Francisco]], where they had already earned the acceptance of local acts Econochrist and [[Samiam]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> In 1991 they moved into an apartment complex in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]]; Pfahler and Schwarzenbach shared an apartment across the hall from Bauermeister, [[J Church (band)|J Church]]'s Lance Hahn and roadie Raul Reyes.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> They recorded their second album, ''[[Bivouac (album)|Bivouac]]'', with [[recording engineer]] [[Billy Anderson (producer)|Billy Anderson]], and it was released in 1992 through the local labels Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Pfahler has described the album as \"varied and ambitious\", noting that it \"took ages to finish\" and \"I think we were trying to prove something with that record. We were definitely stretching out.\"<ref name=\"Etc.\"/><ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/>\n\nBy the time of ''Bivouac''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release Schwarzenbach had developed a [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]] on his throat, causing him to lose his voice onstage.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 23\"/> As the band drove across the United States to fly from New York City to begin a European tour, he began to suffer serious vocal problems.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Though the condition caused him great pain while singing, threatened his voice, and was potentially fatal should the polyp burst or lodge in his throat, the band decided to do the European tour anyway.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> \"That period seemed really arduous for me because I was so physically challenged by singing\", recalls Schwarzenbach, \"Every day was full of dread, having to stand up there and see what would happen. But it was too late. We had to play or else we would have bankrupted our friends.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> By the time the band reached [[Ireland]], Schwarzenbach's condition had worsened and the tour was put on hold while he had surgery to remove the polyp.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> The tour resumed a week later.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/>\n\n=== 1993\u201394: ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' and signing to DGC ===\nUpon returning to San Francisco, Pfahler and Schwarzenbach were homeless and slept in the band's touring van for a brief period.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> They soon found new residences, with Schwarzenbach moving to nearby [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] where he began writing lyrics for the band's third album, ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]''.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Jawbreaker travelled to [[Chicago]] in May 1993 and recorded the bulk of the album with engineer [[Steve Albini]],<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> though the album's production is officially credited on liner notes and packaging to Fluss, Albini's cat. They recorded three additional tracks with [[Billy Anderson (producer)|Billy Anderson]] in San Francisco that August, and the album was released in early 1994 through Tupelo/Communion.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Music journalist [[Andy Greenwald]] and ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Trevor Kelley both cite it as the album most beloved by the band's fans.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 24\">Greenwald, p. 24.</ref> \"''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' is arguably Jawbreaker's best album,\" writes Greenwald, \"but it is also far and away its most loved, the best example of Schwarzenbach's innate ability to marry the boozy, bluesy regretfulness of [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] with the loose, seat-of-the-pants attitude of [[924 Gilman Street|Gilman Street]] punk.\"<ref name=\"Greenwald, 24\"/> As [[dubbing (music)|dubbed]] copies of the album began to circulate in late summer 1993, the band began to earn a devoted fanbase.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/>\n\n[[File:Ben-weasel2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ben Weasel]] was among the figures in the punk rock community openly critical of Jawbreaker's signing to DGC.]]\nIn October 1993, prior to ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, Jawbreaker were asked to open for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] on six dates of their ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\">Kelley, p. 81.</ref> Fans bristled against this, wary that it would result in Jawbreaker\u2014a beloved independent band\u2014signing to major label [[DGC Records]], whom Nirvana were contracted to.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I think we were fortunate [with ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'']\", recalls Schwarzenbach, \"But we ''still'' got some flack. Even at that point, there were people who didn't think we were especially punk-rock, as some people practiced it. I don't think there was any major pushback, though, until we did the Nirvana tour. That's ''officially'' when it started.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> According to Pfahler: \"People really came down on us for going on tour with Nirvana. They really saw it as, 'Okay, here we go. This is the first step. The next thing that happens is that someone from the label sees them and they get snapped up.' Which is kind of what happened.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\nFollowing the release of ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' in February 1994, Jawbreaker received contract offers from major record labels.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Though they had already decided to break up following the album's supporting tours due to tiredness and frustration, the band decided to consider the offers, partly due to the major label successes of their peers [[Green Day]] and [[Jawbox]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\">Greenwald, p. 25.</ref> They met with a number of labels over the course of the year, narrowing their options to [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[Capitol Records]], and DGC.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> They signed to DGC in a one million-dollar deal, due in part to the relationship they had developed with [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative Mark Kates who they had met on the Nirvana tour.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Fans and key figures in the punk rock community were quick to denounce the band for the move.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> In an interview for [[Ben Weasel]]'s ''Panic Button'' zine following the Nirvana tour, Schwarzenbach had stated flatly that Jawbreaker was not interested in signing to a major record label. In response to the signing, Weasel took the band to task in a column for ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' accompanied by a photo depicting him eating his own hat, which he had promised to do if the band ever signed to a major.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u201396: ''Dear You'' and breakup ===\nJawbreaker began recording their major-label debut, ''[[Dear You]]'', in February 1995 at [[Fantasy Studios]] in [[Berkeley, California]] with [[Rob Cavallo]], who had [[record producer|produced]] Green Day's breakthrough album ''[[Dookie]]'' the previous year.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Recording sessions lasted two months and resulted in disenchantment and tension within the band, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> After a week of recording drums and bass guitar, Bauermeister and Pfahler were largely absent from the rest of the sessions while Schwarzenbach continued to work on the album with Cavallo.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I didn't even go\", recalled Bauermeister in 2010, \"I just hung out at home with my wife. I was already trying to separate myself from the band, while Blake became more of the major force.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> With a large recording budget at their disposal, Schwarzenbach and Cavallo spent much of their time polishing the record's production value, making the vocals and guitar clear and bringing them to the forefront of the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> According to Cavallo, \"Blake really wanted to be heard. I think he wanted his voice to be heard for the first time. He also decided to sing differently. Then, to me, I thought those songs could benefit from some precision.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n[[File:Rob Cavallo.jpg|thumb|upright|Producer [[Rob Cavallo]] gave ''Dear You'' very polished production value in comparison to Jawbreaker's previous albums.]] \nIn the months leading up to the album's release, a number of music publications positioned Jawbreaker as the next stars of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] punk scene, sometimes referring to them as \"the thinking man's Green Day\".<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> When ''Dear You'' was released in September 1995, however, its polished production and clear vocals strongly divided the band's fanbase.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> \"[''Dear You'']'s production glistened and gleamed,\" says Greenwald, \"Schwarzenbach's voice was sanded and smoothed, and the songs were mellow, introspective affairs. The reaction was harsh\u2014those who had entrusted their emotional lives to Schwarzenbach, had viewed him as a tattered, secular priest to lay their burdens on, felt betrayed.\"<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> Ben Weasel was so displeased with the album, particularly the sound of Schwarzenbach's singing, that he wrote Pfahler a letter detailing his complaints with it.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Despite a [[music video]] in rotation to support the [[single (music)|single]] \"Fireman,\" sales of ''Dear You'' were poor.<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/>\n\nAs the band toured in support of the album, audience reaction toward the new material was either lukewarm or outright negative.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I have never seen anything like that\u2014before or since\", said Kates, \"There was a point where they were headlining the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] and there were kids sitting on the floor, with their backs to the stage, when they were playing songs from ''Dear You''. I'm not making that up. If you were to try to explain that to somebody now, it would make no sense.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Jawbreaker continued touring in 1996, opening for the [[Foo Fighters]] that spring, but audience reception did not improve.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Samiam's Sergie Loobkoff cites a show at [[The Warfield]] in San Francisco as a turning point: \"That is when I knew they were ''definitely'' going to break up. It was their hometown; they had put out the big major-label record. But then you're looking around and it was like no one cared.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\nAttitudes between the band members continued to sour, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach, who took to traveling in separate vans.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Tensions came to a head in [[Salem, Oregon]], culminating in a fistfight between the two which spilled out of the van and onto the sidewalk.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Baker\">{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Jordan |title=Jawbreaker / Timmy Hansell (In Honor.org) |date=2008-08-30 |website=Pastepunk.com |url=http://www.pastepunk.com/site/jawbreaker-timmy-hansell-in-honororg/ |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> \"I remember just calling Blake a 'fucking [[prima donna]]' and a 'stupid son of a bitch who thinks it's all about him.'

I was devastated.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 82\"/> He eventually returned to music, joining the [[Chicago]] [[pop punk]] band [[Horace Pinker]] from 1999 to 2001, performing on their 2000 EP ''Copper Regret'' before forming the shortlived [[Shorebirds]] and Mutoid Men with Mattie Jo Canino, formerly of [[Latterman]].

I am glad we didn't play live [very much then], because I had to go through my [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] phase.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> They practiced with several singers and went through several names during this time, eventually settling on the name Rise.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 1987 Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister took time off from college and moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue Rise, adding Bauermeister's childhood friend Jon Liu on lead vocals.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> This changed, however, when Schwarzenbach wrote and sang \"Shield Your Eyes\" for the band's [[demo (music)|demo]]. It was the first recording on which he sang, and he later noted that it \"kind of defined where we would go as a band\".<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> According to Liu, \"That was the song where everything worked. The vocal arrangements. The lyrics. It was a perfect piece. But to my detriment, I kind of bristled against it. I was like, 'This is amazing, and I don't think I can do ''anything'' like this.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> The band soon changed their name to Jawbreaker and Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister decided to continue as a trio with Schwarzenbach on vocals.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> Bauermeister was given the task of informing Liu that he was no longer in the band, which proved awkward since the two were roommates.<ref name=\"Kelley, 79\"/> \"I am cool with it now,\" reflected Liu in 2010, \"It was to everybody's benefit.

But it was too late. We had to play or else we would have bankrupted our friends.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> By the time the band reached [[Ireland]], Schwarzenbach's condition had worsened and the tour was put on hold while he had surgery to remove the polyp.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> The tour resumed a week later.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/>\n\n=== 1993\u201394: ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' and signing to DGC ===\nUpon returning to San Francisco, Pfahler and Schwarzenbach were homeless and slept in the band's touring van for a brief period.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> They soon found new residences, with Schwarzenbach moving to nearby [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] where he began writing lyrics for the band's third album, ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]''.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Jawbreaker travelled to [[Chicago]] in May 1993 and recorded the bulk of the album with engineer [[Steve Albini]],<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> though the album's production is officially credited on liner notes and packaging to Fluss, Albini's cat. They recorded three additional tracks with [[Billy Anderson (producer)|Billy Anderson]] in San Francisco that August, and the album was released in early 1994 through Tupelo/Communion.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/> Music journalist [[Andy Greenwald]] and ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Trevor Kelley both cite it as the album most beloved by the band's fans.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 24\">Greenwald, p. 24.</ref> \"''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' is arguably Jawbreaker's best album,\" writes Greenwald, \"but it is also far and away its most loved, the best example of Schwarzenbach's innate ability to marry the boozy, bluesy regretfulness of [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] with the loose, seat-of-the-pants attitude of [[924 Gilman Street|Gilman Street]] punk.\"<ref name=\"Greenwald, 24\"/> As [[dubbing (music)|dubbed]] copies of the album began to circulate in late summer 1993, the band began to earn a devoted fanbase.<ref name=\"Kelley, 80\"/>\n\n[[File:Ben-weasel2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ben Weasel]] was among the figures in the punk rock community openly critical of Jawbreaker's signing to DGC.]]\nIn October 1993, prior to ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, Jawbreaker were asked to open for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] on six dates of their ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\">Kelley, p. 81.</ref> Fans bristled against this, wary that it would result in Jawbreaker\u2014a beloved independent band\u2014signing to major label [[DGC Records]], whom Nirvana were contracted to.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I think we were fortunate [with ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'']\", recalls Schwarzenbach, \"But we ''still'' got some flack. Even at that point, there were people who didn't think we were especially punk-rock, as some people practiced it. I don't think there was any major pushback, though, until we did the Nirvana tour. That's ''officially'' when it started.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> According to Pfahler: \"People really came down on us for going on tour with Nirvana. They really saw it as, 'Okay, here we go. This is the first step. The next thing that happens is that someone from the label sees them and they get snapped up.' Which is kind of what happened.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\nFollowing the release of ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' in February 1994, Jawbreaker received contract offers from major record labels.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Though they had already decided to break up following the album's supporting tours due to tiredness and frustration, the band decided to consider the offers, partly due to the major label successes of their peers [[Green Day]] and [[Jawbox]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\">Greenwald, p. 25.</ref> They met with a number of labels over the course of the year, narrowing their options to [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[Capitol Records]], and DGC.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> They signed to DGC in a one million-dollar deal, due in part to the relationship they had developed with [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative Mark Kates who they had met on the Nirvana tour.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Fans and key figures in the punk rock community were quick to denounce the band for the move.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> In an interview for [[Ben Weasel]]'s ''Panic Button'' zine following the Nirvana tour, Schwarzenbach had stated flatly that Jawbreaker was not interested in signing to a major record label. In response to the signing, Weasel took the band to task in a column for ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' accompanied by a photo depicting him eating his own hat, which he had promised to do if the band ever signed to a major.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u201396: ''Dear You'' and breakup ===\nJawbreaker began recording their major-label debut, ''[[Dear You]]'', in February 1995 at [[Fantasy Studios]] in [[Berkeley, California]] with [[Rob Cavallo]], who had [[record producer|produced]] Green Day's breakthrough album ''[[Dookie]]'' the previous year.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Recording sessions lasted two months and resulted in disenchantment and tension within the band, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> After a week of recording drums and bass guitar, Bauermeister and Pfahler were largely absent from the rest of the sessions while Schwarzenbach continued to work on the album with Cavallo.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I didn't even go\", recalled Bauermeister in 2010, \"I just hung out at home with my wife. I was already trying to separate myself from the band, while Blake became more of the major force.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> With a large recording budget at their disposal, Schwarzenbach and Cavallo spent much of their time polishing the record's production value, making the vocals and guitar clear and bringing them to the forefront of the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]].<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> According to Cavallo, \"Blake really wanted to be heard. I think he wanted his voice to be heard for the first time. He also decided to sing differently. Then, to me, I thought those songs could benefit from some precision.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\n[[File:Rob Cavallo.jpg|thumb|upright|Producer [[Rob Cavallo]] gave ''Dear You'' very polished production value in comparison to Jawbreaker's previous albums.]] \nIn the months leading up to the album's release, a number of music publications positioned Jawbreaker as the next stars of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] punk scene, sometimes referring to them as \"the thinking man's Green Day\".<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> When ''Dear You'' was released in September 1995, however, its polished production and clear vocals strongly divided the band's fanbase.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> \"[''Dear You'']'s production glistened and gleamed,\" says Greenwald, \"Schwarzenbach's voice was sanded and smoothed, and the songs were mellow, introspective affairs. The reaction was harsh\u2014those who had entrusted their emotional lives to Schwarzenbach, had viewed him as a tattered, secular priest to lay their burdens on, felt betrayed.\"<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/> Ben Weasel was so displeased with the album, particularly the sound of Schwarzenbach's singing, that he wrote Pfahler a letter detailing his complaints with it.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Despite a [[music video]] in rotation to support the [[single (music)|single]] \"Fireman,\" sales of ''Dear You'' were poor.<ref name=\"Greenwald, 25\"/>\n\nAs the band toured in support of the album, audience reaction toward the new material was either lukewarm or outright negative.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> \"I have never seen anything like that\u2014before or since\", said Kates, \"There was a point where they were headlining the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] and there were kids sitting on the floor, with their backs to the stage, when they were playing songs from ''Dear You''. I'm not making that up. If you were to try to explain that to somebody now, it would make no sense.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Jawbreaker continued touring in 1996, opening for the [[Foo Fighters]] that spring, but audience reception did not improve.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Samiam's Sergie Loobkoff cites a show at [[The Warfield]] in San Francisco as a turning point: \"That is when I knew they were ''definitely'' going to break up. It was their hometown; they had put out the big major-label record. But then you're looking around and it was like no one cared.\"<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/>\n\nAttitudes between the band members continued to sour, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach, who took to traveling in separate vans.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/> Tensions came to a head in [[Salem, Oregon]], culminating in a fistfight between the two which spilled out of the van and onto the sidewalk.<ref name=\"Kelley, 81\"/><ref name=\"Baker\">{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Jordan |title=Jawbreaker / Timmy Hansell (In Honor.org) |date=2008-08-30 |website=Pastepunk.com |url=http://www.pastepunk.com/site/jawbreaker-timmy-hansell-in-honororg/ |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> \"I remember just calling Blake a 'fucking [[prima donna]]' and a 'stupid son of a bitch who thinks it's all about him.'

It was responded by the [[Communist]]s'  '''second counter-encirclement campaign at Honghu Soviet''' ({{zh|c=\u6d2a\u6e56\u82cf\u533a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u53cd\u56f4\u527f}}), also called by the communists as the '''second counter-encirclement campaign at Honghu Revolutionary Base''' ({{zh|links=no|c=\u6d2a\u6e56\u9769\u547d\u6839\u636e\u5730\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u53cd\u56f4\u527f}}), in which the local [[Chinese Red Army]] successfully defended their soviet republic in the Honghu region against the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] attacks from 1 March 1931, to early June, 1931.\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter their defeat in the [[first encirclement campaign against the Honghu Soviet]] in early February 1931 and the subsequent forced withdraw to regroup, [[Kuomintang|nationalist]] forces launched the second [[encirclement campaigns|encirclement campaign]] against the communist base in Honghu on 1 March 1931.  The nationalists believed that their poorly supplied communist enemy would not have sufficient time to recover from previous battles in the last encirclement campaign, and they must not wait too long to provide more times for their communist enemy.  The nationalist commander-in-chief was the same one in the [[first encirclement campaign against the Honghu Soviet]], the 10th Army commander Xu Yuanquan (\u5f90\u6e90\u6cc9), whose 10th Army was not deployed directly in the campaign, but instead, deployed some distance away from the battlefield as strategic reserve.  The brunt of the fighting was to be carried out mostly by troops of regional [[warlord era|warlords]] who were nominally under the command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]].\n\nThe communists were not jubilant after their victory achieved in [[first encirclement campaign against the Honghu Soviet]], because they were fully aware the nationalist withdraw was only temporary and it was only matter of time before the nationalists resume their assault on Honghu Soviet.  To better prepare the defense of their homebase against the new wave of the imminent nationalist attacks which had already begun, communists restructured their organization in Honghu Soviet.  In the early March 1931, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] (CCoCPC) sent Xi\u00e0 X\u012b (\u590f\u66e6) to Honghu Soviet for restructuring.  To better coordinate administrative activities, CPC Hunan\u2013Western Hubei Bureau was formed, and to better coordinate political activities, CPC provisional Hunan\u2013Western Hubei provincial committee was formed.  To better coordinate military affairs, Revolutionary military committee was formed, and Xi\u00e0 X\u012b was named as the CPC party secretary of the Hunan\u2013Western Hubei Bureau, and the chairman of the revolutionary military committee.  Cui Mei (\u5d14\u73ab) was named as the party secretary of the CPC provisional Hunan\u2013Western Hubei provincial committee, and he was later succeed by Yang Guanghua (\u6768\u5149\u534e).  This restructure of communist party apparatus was proven to be catastrophic later on, when Xi\u00e0 X\u012b  carried out huge purges on local communist ranks, resulting in causing more damage than the military actions taken by their nationalist enemy.\n\n==Order of battle==\nNationalists:\n*Newly Organized 11th Division\n*19th Division\n*44th Brigade of the 15th Division\n*2 Brigades (including the 142nd Brigade) of the 48th Division\n*Newly Organized 2nd Brigade\n*Newly Organized 3rd Brigade\n\nCommunists:\n*9th Division (Brigade-sized)\n**Independent Regiment\n**26th Regiment\n*Hunan\u2013Western Hubei Garrison Regiment\n*Mianyang Independent Regiment\n*Training Regiment\n*Independent battalions of guerrillas\n\n==First stage==\nOn 1 March 1931, the nationalist Newly Organized 11th Division and a brigade of the nationalist 48th Division crossed the [[Yangtze River]] and attacked the communist base on the southern bank of the Yangtze River. The local communist force was unable to repel the numerically and technically superior nationalist force, and was forced to fall back, and nationalists took Lotus Pond (Ouchi, \u85d5\u6c60), Stone Head (Shishou, \u77f3\u9996) as a result.\n\nCommunists were fully aware that they were no match for the enemy and reasoned that if they were to concentrate their forces and face off the enemy, they would be annihilated. Instead, the communists decided to split their forces into two, operating on both banks of the Yangtze River, and once the nationalists were stretched out too thin, the communists would counterattack.  The primary objectives of communists were to defend their base on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, and to reestablish their base in the northern bank of the Yangtze River when possible, and if the enemy was overstretched and provided the needed opportunity, the communist would establish new bases if possible. Under the command of Duan Dechang (\u6bb5\u5fb7\u660c), the communist Independent Regiment and CPC party apparatus crossed the Yangtze River, and began guerrilla warfare in the regions of Qianjiang (\u6f5c\u6c5f), Mianyang (\u6c94\u9633) and Jiangli (\u76d1\u5229), deep behind the nationalist line in the heart of the nationalist-controlled area.  Under the command Zhou Yiqun (\u5468\u9038\u7fa4), the communist force on the southern bank of the Yangtze River also began guerrilla warfare, and at the same time, a portion of the force penetrated deep into the regions around the [[Dongting Lake]], while another portion of the force escorted the local populace to the Eastern Mountain (Dongshan, \u4e1c\u5c71) region.\n\n==Second stage==\nIn early April, 1931, nationalist 142nd Brigade of the 48th Division, 44th Brigade of the 15th Division, Newly Organized 11th Division, and the 19th Division attacked toward Eastern Mountain region from Tiaoxuankou (\u8c03\u5f26\u53e3), Wanyu (\u4e07\u5ebe), [[Huarong County]], and [[Yueyang]] respectively.  After two major clashes at regions of Rape-Turnip Temple (Sanweisi, \u4e09\u8451\u5bfa) and Pine Wood Bridge (Songbanqiao \u677e\u677f\u6865), the communist attempt to check the nationalist advance was crashed.  Local communist regular army and the communist Huarong Guerrillas were forced to withdrew to the north of the Yangtze River by mid-April, and the nationalist force succeeded in taking the Eastern Mountain region.  However, by this time, the nationalist force was overstretched, and was unable to eradicate the remaining communist guerrillas in the newly conquered region, and moreover, their rear was constantly harassed by the communists forces that had crossed the Yangtze River, and with the bulk of the force deployed away during the campaign, there was simply not enough troops to stay behind to guard the vast areas in the rear.  Realizing the nationalists had overstretched themselves way beyond the threshold, the communists jumped on the opportunity to counterattack.\n\nWhile the crack troops of the nationalist force was penetrating deep into the enemy territory and taking more lands, their rear was guarded by the second rate troops most consisted of poorly trained conscripts who were drafted just shortly prior to the [[first encirclement campaign against the Honghu Soviet]].  Seizing the opportunity, communist force on the northern bank of the Yangtze River including the Independent Regiment attacked and took the town of Red River (Zhuhe \u6731\u6cb3) for four time, annihilated the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Newly Organized 2nd Brigade in the process, forcing the nationalist brigade to be out of the action for the rest of the campaign.  The communist force operated on the northern bank of the Yangtze River also attacked the town of Fengkou (\u5cf0\u53e3) twice, completely annihilated two battalions of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade in the process.  A regiment of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade consisted of newly drafted conscripts could not handle the pressure and after suffering a defeat that did not produce too much casualties, the surviving conscripts in the regiment deserted ''en masse''.  The destruction of the two nationalist newly organized brigades caused the total collapse in the new nationalist positions on the north bank of the Yangtze river, losing nearly all of the territories newly taken from the communists during their earlier success, and the communists thus successfully reestablished their original base on the northern bank of the river.\n\n==Third stage==\nThe complete recovery of the communists on the northern bank of the Yangtze River marked the beginning of the communist counteroffensive. In April 1931, the communist Independent Regiment was expanded to have a second regiment, the 26th Regiment, and the new formation was renamed as the 9th Division of the 3rd Army, even though the new unit is only a brigade-sized formation at the best, since it only had two regiments. Additional communist military units were also formed, including Hunan\u2013Western Hubei Garrison Regiment, Mianyang Independent Regiment, Training Regiment and the Independent battalions of guerrillas of several counties in the communist base.  After the reorganization, communists took the initiative by attacking the nationalists, and in the battle fought in the region of Laoxinkou (\u8001\u65b0\u53e3) in mid April, the previously badly mauled nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade was struck again with disastrous result: after each of the two surviving regiments of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade lost a battalion completely in the battle, the four surviving battalions of the two regiments of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade disintegrated when the conscripts in the surviving units deserted en masse.  The nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade ceased to function and only existed in names on papers, and after the devastating defeat, regions including Dragon Gulf (Longhaiwan, \u9f99\u6d77\u6e7e), Bear's Mouth (Xiongkou, \u718a\u53e3), Han River Mouth (Hanhekou, \u6c49\u6cb3\u53e3), and Dafengkou (\u5927\u4e30\u53e3)  fell back into the communist hand by late April in a domino effect.\n\nAs warlords' armies begun to crumble, the strategic reserve, [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s own troop, the 10th Army could not offer any help because of the heightened tension between Chiang and warlords in [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]], so the 10th Army was redeployed to [[Changsha]] for the preparation to face off the warlords from the two provinces in case war broke out. Taking advantage of the infighting among the nationalists themselves, the communist force on the northern bank of the Yangtze River attacked toward [[Jiangling County]], and by early June 1931, in a series of battles fought in the regions of Three Official's Palace (Sanguandian, \u4e09\u5b98\u6bbf),  Sand Hill (Shagang, \u6c99\u5c97), Puji Temple (Pujiguan, \u666e\u6d4e\u89c2), Haoxue (\u90dd\u7a74), and Wang Family's Bridge (Wanjiaqiao, \u6c6a\u5bb6\u6865), communist force on the northern bank of the Yangtze River succeed in killing over two thousand nationalist troops, capturing more than a thousand guns from the defeated nationalists.  The communist force on the southern bank of the Yangtze River also made impressive gains in that it retook the Eastern Mountain region, but during the process, their commander-in-chief Zhou Yiqun was killed in action in a battle near Yueyang.  However, this nationalist achievement was not enough to avert the strategic failure of the encirclement campaign and the nationalists were forced to withdraw and call off the campaign.  The communists not only successfully defended their base, but also further strengthened it by expanding into the regions around Tongting Lake, and the communist force on the southern bank of the Yangtze River crossed the Yangtze River after the campaign, and reorganized into the 26th Regiment of the 9th Division of the 3rd Army of the Chinese Red Army.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chinese battles#Modern China|List of battles of the Chinese Civil War]]\n*[[National Revolutionary Army]]\n*[[History of the People's Liberation Army]]\n*[[Chinese Civil War]]\n{{Chinese Civil War}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.unitedcn.com]\n*[http://cn.netor.com/]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Encirclement campaign, Honghu, 2nd}}\n[[Category:Campaigns of the Chinese Civil War]]\n[[Category:History of the Republic of China]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=September 2014}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Second encirclement campaign against the [[Honghu Soviet]]\n|partof=[[Chinese Civil War]]\n|place=[[Honghu]], [[China]]\n|date=March 1, 1931 \u2013 early June, 1931\n|result=[[Communist Party of China|communist]] victory\n|combatant1=<center>[[Image:Flag of the Republic of China Army.svg|60px|Flag of the National Revolutionary Army]] <br>[[National Revolutionary Army]]</center>\n|combatant2=<center>[[Image:Chinese Red Army Flag.jpg|60px]] <br>[[Chinese Red Army]]</center>\n|commander1=[[Image:Flag of the Republic of China Army.svg|22px|Flag of the National Revolutionary Army]] Xu Yuanquan (\u5f90\u6e90\u6cc9) \n|commander2=[[Image:Chinese Red Army Flag.jpg|22px]] Zhou Yiqun (\u5468\u9038\u7fa4), <br>[[Image:Chinese Red Army Flag.jpg|22px]]Duan Dechang (\u6bb5\u5fb7\u660c)\n|strength1= >22,000\n|strength2= 5,000\n|casualties1= > 4,000\n|casualties2= Light\n|}}\n{{Campaignbox Chinese Civil War}}\n\nThe '''second encirclement campaign against the [[Honghu Soviet]]''' was a series of battles launched by the Chinese [[Nationalist Government]] that was intended to destroy [[Communist Party of China|communist]] [[Honghu]] [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] and its [[Chinese Red Army]] in the local region.

Cui Mei (\u5d14\u73ab) was named as the party secretary of the CPC provisional Hunan\u2013Western Hubei provincial committee, and he was later succeed by Yang Guanghua (\u6768\u5149\u534e).  This restructure of communist party apparatus was proven to be catastrophic later on, when Xi\u00e0 X\u012b  carried out huge purges on local communist ranks, resulting in causing more damage than the military actions taken by their nationalist enemy.\n\n==Order of battle==\nNationalists:\n*Newly Organized 11th Division\n*19th Division\n*44th Brigade of the 15th Division\n*2 Brigades (including the 142nd Brigade) of the 48th Division\n*Newly Organized 2nd Brigade\n*Newly Organized 3rd Brigade\n\nCommunists:\n*9th Division (Brigade-sized)\n**Independent Regiment\n**26th Regiment\n*Hunan\u2013Western Hubei Garrison Regiment\n*Mianyang Independent Regiment\n*Training Regiment\n*Independent battalions of guerrillas\n\n==First stage==\nOn 1 March 1931, the nationalist Newly Organized 11th Division and a brigade of the nationalist 48th Division crossed the [[Yangtze River]] and attacked the communist base on the southern bank of the Yangtze River. The local communist force was unable to repel the numerically and technically superior nationalist force, and was forced to fall back, and nationalists took Lotus Pond (Ouchi, \u85d5\u6c60), Stone Head (Shishou, \u77f3\u9996) as a result.\n\nCommunists were fully aware that they were no match for the enemy and reasoned that if they were to concentrate their forces and face off the enemy, they would be annihilated. Instead, the communists decided to split their forces into two, operating on both banks of the Yangtze River, and once the nationalists were stretched out too thin, the communists would counterattack.  The primary objectives of communists were to defend their base on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, and to reestablish their base in the northern bank of the Yangtze River when possible, and if the enemy was overstretched and provided the needed opportunity, the communist would establish new bases if possible. Under the command of Duan Dechang (\u6bb5\u5fb7\u660c), the communist Independent Regiment and CPC party apparatus crossed the Yangtze River, and began guerrilla warfare in the regions of Qianjiang (\u6f5c\u6c5f), Mianyang (\u6c94\u9633) and Jiangli (\u76d1\u5229), deep behind the nationalist line in the heart of the nationalist-controlled area.  Under the command Zhou Yiqun (\u5468\u9038\u7fa4), the communist force on the southern bank of the Yangtze River also began guerrilla warfare, and at the same time, a portion of the force penetrated deep into the regions around the [[Dongting Lake]], while another portion of the force escorted the local populace to the Eastern Mountain (Dongshan, \u4e1c\u5c71) region.\n\n==Second stage==\nIn early April, 1931, nationalist 142nd Brigade of the 48th Division, 44th Brigade of the 15th Division, Newly Organized 11th Division, and the 19th Division attacked toward Eastern Mountain region from Tiaoxuankou (\u8c03\u5f26\u53e3), Wanyu (\u4e07\u5ebe), [[Huarong County]], and [[Yueyang]] respectively.  After two major clashes at regions of Rape-Turnip Temple (Sanweisi, \u4e09\u8451\u5bfa) and Pine Wood Bridge (Songbanqiao \u677e\u677f\u6865), the communist attempt to check the nationalist advance was crashed.  Local communist regular army and the communist Huarong Guerrillas were forced to withdrew to the north of the Yangtze River by mid-April, and the nationalist force succeeded in taking the Eastern Mountain region.  However, by this time, the nationalist force was overstretched, and was unable to eradicate the remaining communist guerrillas in the newly conquered region, and moreover, their rear was constantly harassed by the communists forces that had crossed the Yangtze River, and with the bulk of the force deployed away during the campaign, there was simply not enough troops to stay behind to guard the vast areas in the rear.  Realizing the nationalists had overstretched themselves way beyond the threshold, the communists jumped on the opportunity to counterattack.\n\nWhile the crack troops of the nationalist force was penetrating deep into the enemy territory and taking more lands, their rear was guarded by the second rate troops most consisted of poorly trained conscripts who were drafted just shortly prior to the [[first encirclement campaign against the Honghu Soviet]].  Seizing the opportunity, communist force on the northern bank of the Yangtze River including the Independent Regiment attacked and took the town of Red River (Zhuhe \u6731\u6cb3) for four time, annihilated the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Newly Organized 2nd Brigade in the process, forcing the nationalist brigade to be out of the action for the rest of the campaign.  The communist force operated on the northern bank of the Yangtze River also attacked the town of Fengkou (\u5cf0\u53e3) twice, completely annihilated two battalions of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade in the process.  A regiment of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade consisted of newly drafted conscripts could not handle the pressure and after suffering a defeat that did not produce too much casualties, the surviving conscripts in the regiment deserted ''en masse''.  The destruction of the two nationalist newly organized brigades caused the total collapse in the new nationalist positions on the north bank of the Yangtze river, losing nearly all of the territories newly taken from the communists during their earlier success, and the communists thus successfully reestablished their original base on the northern bank of the river.\n\n==Third stage==\nThe complete recovery of the communists on the northern bank of the Yangtze River marked the beginning of the communist counteroffensive. In April 1931, the communist Independent Regiment was expanded to have a second regiment, the 26th Regiment, and the new formation was renamed as the 9th Division of the 3rd Army, even though the new unit is only a brigade-sized formation at the best, since it only had two regiments. Additional communist military units were also formed, including Hunan\u2013Western Hubei Garrison Regiment, Mianyang Independent Regiment, Training Regiment and the Independent battalions of guerrillas of several counties in the communist base.  After the reorganization, communists took the initiative by attacking the nationalists, and in the battle fought in the region of Laoxinkou (\u8001\u65b0\u53e3) in mid April, the previously badly mauled nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade was struck again with disastrous result: after each of the two surviving regiments of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade lost a battalion completely in the battle, the four surviving battalions of the two regiments of the nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade disintegrated when the conscripts in the surviving units deserted en masse.  The nationalist Newly Organized 3rd Brigade ceased to function and only existed in names on papers, and after the devastating defeat, regions including Dragon Gulf (Longhaiwan, \u9f99\u6d77\u6e7e), Bear's Mouth (Xiongkou, \u718a\u53e3), Han River Mouth (Hanhekou, \u6c49\u6cb3\u53e3), and Dafengkou (\u5927\u4e30\u53e3)  fell back into the communist hand by late April in a domino effect.\n\nAs warlords' armies begun to crumble, the strategic reserve, [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s own troop, the 10th Army could not offer any help because of the heightened tension between Chiang and warlords in [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]], so the 10th Army was redeployed to [[Changsha]] for the preparation to face off the warlords from the two provinces in case war broke out. Taking advantage of the infighting among the nationalists themselves, the communist force on the northern bank of the Yangtze River attacked toward [[Jiangling County]], and by early June 1931, in a series of battles fought in the regions of Three Official's Palace (Sanguandian, \u4e09\u5b98\u6bbf),  Sand Hill (Shagang, \u6c99\u5c97), Puji Temple (Pujiguan, \u666e\u6d4e\u89c2),Haoxue (\u90dd\u7a74), and Wang Family's Bridge (Wanjiaqiao, \u6c6a\u5bb6\u6865), communist force on the northern bank of the Yangtze River succeed in killing over two thousand nationalist troops, capturing more than a thousand guns from the defeated nationalists.  The communist force on the southern bank of the Yangtze River also made impressive gains in that it retook the Eastern Mountain region, but during the process, their commander-in-chief Zhou Yiqun was killed in action in a battle near Yueyang.  However, this nationalist achievement was not enough to avert the strategic failure of the encirclement campaign and the nationalists were forced to withdraw and call off the campaign.  The communists not only successfully defended their base, but also further strengthened it by expanding into the regions around Tongting Lake, and the communist force on the southern bank of the Yangtze River crossed the Yangtze River after the campaign, and reorganized into the 26th Regiment of the 9th Division of the 3rd Army of the Chinese Red Army.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Chinese battles#Modern China|List of battles of the Chinese Civil War]]\n*[[National Revolutionary Army]]\n*[[History of the People's Liberation Army]]\n*[[Chinese Civil War]]\n{{Chinese Civil War}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.unitedcn.com]\n*[http://cn.netor.com/]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Encirclement campaign, Honghu, 2nd}}\n[[Category:Campaigns of the Chinese Civil War]]\n[[Category:History of the Republic of China]]\n", "name_user": "Danielt998", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThird stage:clean up, replaced: ,H \u2192 , H", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_encirclement_campaign_against_the_Honghu_Soviet"}

In the United Kingdom, it is produced by the [[BBC]]. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9 to 12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format and style of the show has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants, and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===Grossman's departure and 2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although they do not address the viewer's directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final. Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available.

competitive cooking show produced by [[Endemol Shine Group]] and is broadcasted in 60 countries around the world. In the UK, it is produced by the BBC. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9- to12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===Grossman's departure and 2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although they do not address the viewer's directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final. Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available. Many commentators (who did not realise what the competition was about), particularly from Malaysia and Indonesia, pointed out that rendang is usually cooked as a stew and is not crispy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title='I would rendang his head': UK MasterChef judges stir up a storm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/i-would-rendang-his-head-uk-masterchef-judges-stir-up-a-storm|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The judges failed to differentiate between \"crispy\" and \"undercooked\".
