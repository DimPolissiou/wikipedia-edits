The current system sorts the previously known kingdoms into these three domains: [[Archaea]], [[Bacteria]], and [[Eukarya]].\n\n===Domain Archaea===\nThe [[Archaea]] are [[prokaryotic]], with no nuclear membrane, distinct biochemistry, and RNA markers from bacteria. The [[Archaea]]ns possess unique, ancient evolutionary history for which they are considered some of the oldest species of organisms on Earth, most notably their diverse, exotic metabolisms, which allow them to feed on inorganic matter.

Traditionally classified as bacteria, many thrive in the same environments favored by humans, and were the first [[prokaryote]]s discovered; they were briefly called the '''Eubacteria''' or \"true\" bacteria when the Archaea were first recognized as a distinct [[clade]].\n\nMost known pathogenic prokaryotic organisms belong to bacteria (see <ref name=\"Eckburg\">{{cite journal |last1=Eckburg |first1=Paul B. |last2=Lepp |first2=Paul W. |last3=Relman |first3=David A. |year=2003 |title=Archaea and their potential role in human disease |journal=Infection and Immunity |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=591\u2013596 |doi=10.1128/IAI.71.2.591-596.2003 |pmid=12540534 |pmc=145348}}</ref> for exceptions). For that reason, and because the Archaea are typically difficult to grow in laboratories, Bacteria are currently studied more extensively than Archaea.\n\nSome examples of bacteria include:\n* [[Cyanobacteria]] \u2013 photosynthesizing bacteria that are related to the chloroplasts of eukaryotic plants and algae\n* [[Spirochaete]]s \u2013 [[Gram-negative]] bacteria that include those causing syphilis and Lyme disease\n* [[Actinobacteria]] \u2013 [[Gram-positive]] bacteria including ''[[Bifidobacterium animalis]]'' which is present in the human large intestine\n\n===Domain Eukarya===\n[[Eukarya]] are uniquely organisms whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus ([[eukaryotes]], [[eukaryotic]]). They include many large single-celled organisms and all known non-[[microscopic organism]]s. A partial list of eukaryotic organisms includes:\n\n;[[Fungi|Kingdom Fungi]] or fungi:\n* [[Saccharomycotina]] \u2013 includes true yeasts\n* [[Basidiomycota]] \u2013 includes mushrooms\n;[[Plant|Kingdom Plantae]] or plants:\n* [[Bryophyte|Bryophyta]] \u2013 mosses\n* [[Magnoliophyta]] \u2013 flowering plants\n;[[Animal|Kingdom Animalia]] or animals:\n* [[Chordata]] \u2013 includes [[vertebrate]]s as a subphylum\n\n==Niches==\nEach of the three cell types tends to fit into recurring specialities or roles. Bacteria tend to be the most prolific reproducers, at least in moderate environments. Archaeans tend to adapt quickly to extreme environments, such as high temperatures, high acids, high sulfur, etc. This includes adapting to use a wide variety of food sources. Eukaryotes are the most flexible with regard to forming cooperative colonies, such as in multi-cellular organisms, including humans.

A more comprehensive genealogy of the product is described in [[Sun Grid Engine]]. Grid Engine was first distributed by Genias Software and from 1999, after a company merger, by Gridware, Inc.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nAnalyses of additional [[STIS]] data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation of Fomalhaut b as a collision between two asteroid-sized objects <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

However, longer-term monitoring of Fomalhaut b may show evidence that the object is fading with time.<ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.  A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/> However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths and in the most recently-analyzed HST data, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/><ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.

Fomalhaut b appears to be moving at about 4 kilometers per second.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> While it is unclear whether Fomalhaut b's orbit will make it cross the debris disk or cross the debris disk only in projection (i.e. it is not orbiting in the same plane as the disk), its orbit is not completely nested within the debris disk<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.\n\nAt the optical wavelengths at which Fomalhaut b is detected, it is only about 2.7\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup> times as bright as the star and is the faintest (intrinsically) extrasolar object yet imaged.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> The shape of its spectrum, as determined from measurements obtained at 0.4&nbsp;to&nbsp;0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm, appears similar to that of its host star, suggesting that the emission identifying Fomalhaut b is completely due to scattered starlight<ref name=\"Currie\"/>.  Although the initial discovery paper for Fomalhaut b suggested that its optical brightness may be variable due to [[planetary accretion]], later reanalyses of these data fail to find convincing evidence that Fomalhaut b is indeed variable,<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Galicher\"/><ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/> thus eliminating evidence for planetary accretion. However, longer-term monitoring of Fomalhaut b may show evidence that the object is fading with time <ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>.\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.  A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/> However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths and in the most recently-analyzed HST data, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/><ref name=\"PNAS-20200420\"/>\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain. Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]]<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Janson2012\"/> but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planetary-mass bodies in the system.  Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter. Models for Fomalhaut b assuming it is surrounded by a swarm of planetesimals imply that it could be much lower mass (10\u2013100 times the [[Earth mass|mass of Earth]]).<ref name=\"Kennedy2011\"/> If Fomalhaut b is instead one of two shepherding planets that together confine the debris disk into a narrow ring,<ref name=\"Boley2012\"/> it could be anywhere between several times the mass of [[Mars]] to slightly more massive than Earth.\n\nIf Fomalhaut b is a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn, it probably formed several million years after the host star itself was formed, making it roughly 450 million years old.<ref name=\"Mamajek2012\">{{Cite journal |title=On the Age and Binarity of Fomalhaut |first=Eric |last=Mamajek |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2012 |arxiv = 1206.6353|bibcode = 2012ApJ...754L..20M |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/754/2/L20 |volume=754 |pages=L20}}</ref> Alternatively, if it is a transient dust cloud it must be extremely young,<ref name=\"Currie\"/> perhaps having formed within the last few centuries.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\n== Other planets orbiting Fomalhaut ==\n\nFomalhaut b is orbiting its host star at a wide separation, where forming massive planets is difficult.

Operations started on 1 October 1995 with the arrival of the first Air Baltic aircraft, a [[Saab 340]], at Riga, and that afternoon, the plane made the first passenger flight for Air Baltic.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.airbaltic.com/public/company_history.html |title=Company history |publisher=Airbaltic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the airline's first [[BAe 146|Avro RJ70]] was delivered; and Air Baltic joined the SAS frequent flier club as a partner. 1997 saw the opening of a cargo department and, in 1998, the airline's first [[Fokker 50]] plane was delivered. The adopted [[livery]] was mainly white, with the name of the airline written in blue on the forward [[fuselage]], the 'B' logo being heavily stylized in blue checks. The checker blue pattern was repeated on the aircraft [[Vertical stabilizer|tailfin]].\n\nIn 1999, airBaltic became a [[joint stock company]]; it was previously a [[limited liability company]].<ref name=\"Hist\">\"[http://www.airbaltic.com/public/company_history.html Company history].\" AirBaltic. Retrieved on 22 November 2011.</ref> All of their Saab 340s were replaced by Fokker 50s. By September, the airline had begun operating under the European Aviation Operating Standards, or JAR ops. Air Baltic welcomed the new millennium by introducing new uniforms and opening a cargo centre at Riga's airport.\n\nThe first [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-500]] joined the fleet in 2003, and on 1 June 2004, Air Baltic launched services from the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], initially to five destinations. In October 2004, Air Baltic was rebranded as '''AirBaltic'''. Their present livery consists of an all-white fuselage and [[lime (color)|lime]] tailfin. AirBaltic.com is displayed on the forward upper fuselage, and the word \"Baltic\" is repeated in blue on the lower part of the tailfin. In December 2006, the first Boeing 737-300 joined the fleet and was configured with [[winglet]]s. In July 2007, AirBaltic introduced an online check-in system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airbaltic.com/public/31274.html |title=airBaltic introduces Internet check-in for flights |publisher=Airbaltic.com |date=2007-07-31 |accessdate=2013-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703064929/http://www.airbaltic.com/public/31274.html |archivedate=2012-07-03 }}</ref> It was the first online check-in system in the Baltic states. In the spring of 2008, two long-haul [[Boeing 757]]s joined the existing AirBaltic fleet. On 10 March 2008, it was announced that in the next three years the airline would acquire new aircraft, experiencing the largest fleet expansion in the company's history.

The adopted [[livery]] was mainly white, with the name of the airline written in blue on the forward [[fuselage]], the 'B' logo being heavily stylized in blue checks. The checker blue pattern was repeated on the aircraft [[Vertical stabilizer|tailfin]].\n\nIn 1999, airBaltic became a [[joint stock company]]; it was previously a [[limited liability company]].<ref name=\"Hist\">\"[http://www.airbaltic.com/public/company_history.html Company history].\" AirBaltic. Retrieved on 22 November 2011.</ref> All of their Saab 340s were replaced by Fokker 50s. By September, the airline had begun operating under the European Aviation Operating Standards, or JAR ops. Air Baltic welcomed the new millennium by introducing new uniforms and opening a cargo centre at Riga's airport.\n\nThe first [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-500]] joined the fleet in 2003, and on 1 June 2004, Air Baltic launched services from the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], initially to five destinations. In October 2004, Air Baltic was rebranded as '''AirBaltic'''. Their present livery consists of an all-white fuselage and [[lime (color)|lime]] tailfin. AirBaltic.com is displayed on the forward upper fuselage, and the word \"Baltic\" is repeated in blue on the lower part of the tailfin. In December 2006, the first Boeing 737-300 joined the fleet and was configured with [[winglet]]s. In July 2007, AirBaltic introduced an online check-in system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airbaltic.com/public/31274.html |title=airBaltic introduces Internet check-in for flights |publisher=Airbaltic.com |date=2007-07-31 |accessdate=2013-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703064929/http://www.airbaltic.com/public/31274.html |archivedate=2012-07-03 }}</ref> It was the first online check-in system in the Baltic states.

The new additions will be next generation [[De Havilland Canada Dash 8|De Havilland Dash 8-400]] aircraft.\n\nAirBaltic had strong links with SAS, which owned 47.2% of the airline, and operated frequent flights to SAS hubs in [[Copenhagen]], [[Oslo]] and [[Stockholm]].

It was the capital from 542 to 725 AD of the ancient [[Visigothic kingdom]], which followed the fall of the Roman Empire, and the location of historic events such as the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Councils of Toledo]].

Alfonso captured the fortress town of Coria, which controlled a pass from Castilian lands into the lands of the taifa of Badajoz.

After the fall of the caliphate, Toledo was the capital city of one of the richest [[Taifa]]s of [[Al-Andalus]]. Its population was overwhelmingly [[Muladi]], and, because of its central location in the Iberian Peninsula, Toledo took a central position in the struggles between the Muslim and Christian rulers of northern Spain. The conquest of Toledo by [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI of Castile]] in 1085 marked the first time a major city in Al-Andalus was captured by Christian forces; it served to sharpen the religious aspect of the Christian reconquest.\n\n===Medieval Toledo after the Reconquista===\n[[File:Braun Toledo UBHD.jpg|thumb|230px|Toledo in the 16th century]]\n[[File:El Greco - View and Plan of Toledo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''[[View of Toledo]]'' by city resident [[El Greco]] c. 1608.]]\nOn May 25, 1085, Alfonso VI of Castile took Toledo and established direct personal control over the Moorish city from which he had been exacting tribute, ending the medieval [[Taifa]]'s [[Kingdom of Toledo]]. This was the first concrete step taken by the combined kingdom of Leon-Castile in the [[Reconquista]] by Christian forces. After Castilian conquest, Toledo continued to be a major cultural centre; its Arab libraries were not pillaged, and a tag-team [[Toledo School of Translators|translation centre]] was established in which books in Arabic or Hebrew would be translated into Castilian by Muslim and Jewish scholars, and from Castilian into Latin by Castilian scholars, thus letting long-lost knowledge spread through Christian Europe again. Toledo served as the capital city of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] intermittently (Castile did not have a permanent capital) from 1085, and the city flourished. Under the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo]] multiple persecutions (633, 653, 693) and stake burnings of Jews (638 CE) occurred; the [[Kingdom of Toledo]] followed up on this tradition (1368, 1391, 1449, 1486\u20131490 CE) including forced conversions and mass murder and the rioting and blood bath against the Jews of Toledo (1212 CE).<ref name=STR-JewishPersecution>{{cite web|last1=Grosser|first1=P.E. and E.G.

It was at this time that Don [[Isaac Abrabanel]], a prominent Jewish figure in Spain in the 15th century and one of the king's trusted courtiers who witnessed the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, wrote that Toledo was named ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' by its first Jewish inhabitants who, he stated, settled there in the 5th century BCE, and which name \u2013 by way of conjecture \u2013 may have been related to its Hebrew cognate \u05d8\u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05dc (= wandering), on account of their wandering from Jerusalem.

However, in 1561, in the first years of his son [[Philip II of Spain]]'s reign, the Spanish court was moved to [[Valladolid]], thus letting the city's importance dwindle until the late 20th century, when it became the capital of the autonomous community of [[Castile\u2013La Mancha]].

Between the 15th and 17th centuries the Toledo sword-making industry enjoyed a great boom, to the point where its [[Toledo steel|products]] came to be regarded as the best in Europe. Swords and daggers were made by individual craftsmen, although the sword-makers guild oversaw their quality. In the late 17th and early 18th century production began to decline, prompting the creation of the Royal Arms Factory in 1761 by order of [[King Carlos III]]. The Royal Factory brought together all the sword-makers guilds of the city and it was located in the former mint. In 1777, recognizing the need to expand the space, Carlos III commissioned the architect [[Francesco Sabatini|Sabatini]] to construct a new building on the outskirts of the city. This was the beginning of several phases of expansion. Its importance was such that it eventually developed into a city within the city of Toledo.\n\nIn the 20th century, the production of knives and swords for the army was reduced to cavalry weapons only, and after the [[Spanish Civil War]], to the supply of swords to the officers and NCOs of the various military units. Following the closure of the factory in the 1980s, the building was renovated to house the campus of the Technological University of Castilla-La Mancha in Toledo.<ref name=ref_duplicada_1>{{cite web | title = lacerca.com \u2013 Las espadas forjadas en Toledo se remontan a la \u00e9poca romana | url = http://www.lacerca.com/noticias/las_espadas_forjadas_toledo_se_remontan_epoca_romana-21888-1.html | accessdate = 15 July 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080802121638/http://www.lacerca.com/noticias/las_espadas_forjadas_toledo_se_remontan_epoca_romana-21888-1.html | archivedate = 2 August 2008 }}</ref> According to the Statistical Institute of Castilla-La Mancha, in 2007 the recent distribution of employment by sectors of occupation was as follows: 86.5% of the population engaged in the services, 6.6% in construction, 5.4% in industry and 1.5% in agriculture and livestock.<ref name=\"estadistica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.jccm.es/Fichas_municipales/Fichas/45168.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213143119/http://www.ies.jccm.es/Fichas_municipales/Fichas/45168.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 December 2009|title=Instituto de Estad\u00edstica de Castilla-La Mancha \u2013 Ficha municipal|accessdate=21 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Unemployment===\nIn the decade to 2008, unemployment in absolute terms remained fairly stable in the city of Toledo, but in 2009 this figure increased significantly: nearly 62% compared to 2008, with the number of unemployed rising from 2,515 to 4,074 (figures at 31 March each year), according to the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla La Mancha.<ref name=\"paro\">{{cite web | title = Instituto de Estad\u00edstica de la Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha \u2013 Datos estad\u00edsticos de Toledo (Todos los Informes > Informes por Temas > Estad\u00edsticas Municipales > Mercado de Trabajo) | url = http://difusion.ies.jccm.es/wds/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx | accessdate=5 April 2009 }}</ref> Of this 62%, one third of the increase took place in the first quarter.\n\nAccording to other statistics from the same source, almost half the unemployed in the city of Toledo (1,970 persons) are among those whose education does not go beyond the compulsory secondary level.

The synod of 1565\u20131566 concerned itself with the execution of the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]; and the last council held at Toledo, 1582\u20131583, was guided in detail by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].\n\nToledo had large communities of Muslims and Jews until they were [[Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain in 1492]] (Jews) and 1502 ([[Mud\u00e9jar]]s). Today's city contains the religious monuments the [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca|Synagogue of Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca]], the [[Synagogue of El Transito]], [[Mosque of Cristo de la Luz]] and the [[Church of San Sebasti\u00e1n, Toledo|church of San Sebasti\u00e1n]] dating from before the expulsion, still maintained in good condition. Among [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking [[Sephardi Jews]], in their various diasporas, the [[family name]] [[Toledano]] is still prevalent \u2013 indicating an ancestry traced back to this city (the name is also attested among non-Jews in various [[Spanish language|Spanish-speaking countries]]).\n\nIn the 13th century, Toledo was a major cultural centre under the guidance of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], called \"El Sabio\" (\"the Wise\") for his love of learning. The [[Toledo School of Translators]], that had commenced under Archbishop [[Raymond de Sauvet\u00e2t|Raymond of Toledo]], continued to bring vast stores of knowledge to Europe by rendering great academic and philosophical works in Arabic into Latin. The [[Palacio de Galiana]], built in the [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style, is one of the monuments that remain from that period.\n\nThe [[Cathedral of Toledo]] (''Catedral de Toledo'') was built between 1226 and 1493 and modeled after the [[Bourges Cathedral]], though it also combines some characteristics of the [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style. It is remarkable for its incorporation of light and features the [[Baroque]] altar called ''[[El Transparente]]'', several stories high, with fantastic figures of stucco, paintings, bronze castings, and multiple colors of marble, a masterpiece of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[mixed media]] by [[Narciso Tom\u00e9]] topped by the daily effect for just a few minutes of a shaft of light from which this feature of the cathedral derives its name. Two notable bridges secured access to Toledo across the Tajo, the [[Puente de Alc\u00e1ntara, Toledo|Alc\u00e1ntara bridge]] and the later built [[Puente de San Mart\u00edn (Toledo)|San Mart\u00edn bridge]].\n\nThe [[Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes, Toledo|Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes]] is a [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]], built 1477\u20131504, in a remarkable combination of Gothic-Spanish-Flemish style with [[Mud\u00e9jar]] ornamentation.\n\nToledo was home to [[El Greco]] for the latter part of his life, and is the subject of some of his most famous paintings, including ''[[The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]]'', exhibited in the Church of Santo Tom\u00e9.\n\nWhen Philip II moved the [[royal court]] from Toledo to [[Madrid]] in 1561, the old city went into a slow decline from which it never recovered.\n\n===Toledo steel===\n{{Main|Toledo steel}}\nToledo has been a traditional sword-making, steel-working centre since about 500 BC, and came to the attention of Rome when used by [[Hannibal]] in the [[Punic Wars]].

Known as the Route of Don Quixote, two of the pathways designated, sections 1 and 8, are based in Toledo; those linking the city with La Mancha Castile and Montes de Toledo exploit the natural route which passes through the Cigarrales and heads to Cobisa, Nambroca Burguillos of Toledo, where it takes the Camino Real from Sevilla to suddenly turn towards Mascaraque Almonacid de Toledo, deep into their surroundings, near Mora, in La Mancha.\n\nThis stretch, Mascaraque-Toledo, of the Route of Don Quixote has recently been included in an official way on the Camino de Santiago in Levantine branch with origins in Cartagena, Alicante and Valencia, as both routes are declared a European Cultural Route on this stretch.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Puerta del Cambron, Toledo - view 3.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Puerta del Cambr\u00f3n]], completed in 1576.]]\nToledo has long been an obligatory stop in the centre of the peninsula.

At this point, the A-42 connects with the Highway of the Vineyard that reaches Tomelloso. It is planned to extend the A-42, by a toll road, to Ciudad Real and Ja\u00e9n.\n\nIn the early twenty-first century was built, in order to decongest the traffic between Toledo and Madrid, the toll motorway AP-41.\n\nAnother way of State Highway Network that Toledo is part of the N-403, Toledo-Maqueda \u2013 \u00c1vila \u2013 Adanero.

The current station, [[Toledo Railway Station]] (built in [[Neo-Mud\u00e9jar]] style), was opened on April 24 of 1919.\n\nThe line suffered some technical issues and service disruptions, but continued to serve as the main intercity route until the early twenty-first century. On 2 July, 2003 the last conventional train service between the two capitals ended and work began on a high-speed link to Madrid, which entered service on November 16 of 2005. The new line reduced the travel time to Madrid to just under 30 minutes.\n\n==Health==\nIn the early 1960s began the construction of the Residence Health Social Security \"Virgen de la Salud\". The original building still remains in use, although successive extensions were added (maternity, outpatient clinics, operating rooms, etc.) into the existing complex.

Toledo was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1986 for its extensive monumental and cultural heritage.\n\nToledo is known as the \"Imperial City\" because it was the main venue of the court of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] in Spain, and as the \"City of the Three Cultures\" for the cultural influences of Christians, Muslims, and Jews reflected in its history. It was the capital from 542 to 725 AD of the ancient [[Visigothic kingdom]], which followed the fall of the Roman Empire, and the location of historic events such as the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Councils of Toledo]].

The decision also took king-making power away from the bishops, who would be in their own sees and would not have time to come together to attend the royal election. The decision did allow the bishop of Toledo, alone among bishops, to be involved in decisions concerning the royal Visigothic succession.

Wamba weakened the power of the bishop of Toledo by creating a new bishopric outside Toledo at the church of Saints Peter and Paul. This was one of the main churches of Toledo and was the church where Wamba was anointed king, and the church from which Visigothic kings departed for war after special ceremonies in which they were presented with a relic of the [[True Cross]]. By creating a new bishopric there, Wamba removed power over royal succession from the bishop of Toledo and granted it to the new bishop.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=100}}</ref> The [[Twelfth Council of Toledo]] was held in 681 after Wamba's removal from office. Convinced that he was dying, Wamba had accepted a state of [[penitence]] that according to the decision of a previous church council, made him ineligible to remain king. The Twelfth Council, led by newly installed bishop [[Julian of Toledo|Julian]] confirmed the validity of Wamba's removal from office and his succession by [[Erwig|Ervig]]. The Twelfth Council eliminated the new bishopric that Wamba had created and returned the powers over succession to the bishop of Toledo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Roger|title=Visigothic Spain, 409\u2013711|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell|page=101}}</ref>\n\nThe Twelfth Council of Toledo approved 28 laws against the Jews.

After the fall of the caliphate, Toledo was the capital city of one of the richest [[Taifa]]s of [[Al-Andalus]]. Its population was overwhelmingly [[Muladi]], and, because of its central location in the Iberian Peninsula, Toledo took a central position in the struggles between the Muslim and Christian rulers of northern Spain. The conquest of Toledo by [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI of Castile]] in 1085 marked the first time a major city in Al-Andalus was captured by Christian forces; it served to sharpen the religious aspect of the Christian reconquest.\n\n===Medieval Toledo after the Reconquista===\n[[File:Braun Toledo UBHD.jpg|thumb|230px|Toledo in the 16th century]]\n[[File:El Greco - View and Plan of Toledo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''[[View of Toledo]]'' by city resident [[El Greco]] c. 1608.]]\nOn May 25, 1085, Alfonso VI of Castile took Toledo and established direct personal control over the Moorish city from which he had been exacting tribute, ending the medieval [[Taifa]]'s [[Kingdom of Toledo]]. This was the first concrete step taken by the combined kingdom of Leon-Castile in the [[Reconquista]] by Christian forces. After Castilian conquest, Toledo continued to be a major cultural centre; its Arab libraries were not pillaged, and a tag-team [[Toledo School of Translators|translation centre]] was established in which books in Arabic or Hebrew would be translated into Castilian by Muslim and Jewish scholars, and from Castilian into Latin by Castilian scholars, thus letting long-lost knowledge spread through Christian Europe again. Toledo served as the capital city of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] intermittently (Castile did not have a permanent capital) from 1085, and the city flourished. Under the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo]] multiple persecutions (633, 653, 693) and stake burnings of Jews (638 CE) occurred; the [[Kingdom of Toledo]] followed up on this tradition (1368, 1391, 1449, 1486\u20131490 CE) including forced conversions and mass murder and the rioting and blood bath against the Jews of Toledo (1212 CE).<ref name=STR-JewishPersecution>{{cite web|last1=Grosser|first1=P.E. and E.G.

Between the 15th and 17th centuries the Toledo sword-making industry enjoyed a great boom, to the point where its [[Toledo steel|products]] came to be regarded as the best in Europe. Swords and daggers were made by individual craftsmen, although the sword-makers guild oversaw their quality. In the late 17th and early 18th century production began to decline, prompting the creation of the Royal Arms Factory in 1761 by order of [[King Carlos III]]. The Royal Factory brought together all the sword-makers guilds of the city and it was located in the former mint. In 1777, recognizing the need to expand the space, Carlos III commissioned the architect [[Francesco Sabatini|Sabatini]] to construct a new building on the outskirts of the city. This was the beginning of several phases of expansion. Its importance was such that it eventually developed into a city within the city of Toledo.\n\nIn the 20th century, the production of knives and swords for the army was reduced to cavalry weapons only, and after the [[Spanish Civil War]], to the supply of swords to the officers and NCOs of the various military units.

The earliest, directed against [[Priscillian]], assembled in 400. At the synod of 589 the Visigothic King [[Reccared I|Reccared]] declared his conversion from [[Arianism]] to [[Catholicism]]; the synod of 633 decreed uniformity of catholic liturgy throughout the Visigothic kingdom and took stringent measures against baptized Jews who had relapsed into their former faith. Other councils forbade circumcision, Jewish rites and observance of the Sabbath and festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font.<ref>S. Katz, ''The Jews in the Visigothic Kingdoms of Spain and Gaul'', (Cambridge 1937). Cited in [[Paul Johnson (writer)]], ''A History of the Jews'', p. 177</ref> The council of 681 assured to the [[Archdiocese of Toledo|archbishop of Toledo]] the [[primate (bishop)|primacy]] of Spain. At [[Guadamur]], very close to Toledo, was dug in 1858 the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]], the best example of [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]] in Spain.\n\nAs nearly one hundred early canons of Toledo found a place in the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', they exerted an important influence on the development of [[Canon law|ecclesiastical law]]. The synod of 1565\u20131566 concerned itself with the execution of the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]; and the last council held at Toledo, 1582\u20131583, was guided in detail by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].\n\nToledo had large communities of Muslims and Jews until they were [[Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain in 1492]] (Jews) and 1502 ([[Mud\u00e9jar]]s). Today's city contains the religious monuments the [[Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca|Synagogue of Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca]], the [[Synagogue of El Transito]], [[Mosque of Cristo de la Luz]] and the [[Church of San Sebasti\u00e1n, Toledo|church of San Sebasti\u00e1n]] dating from before the expulsion, still maintained in good condition. Among [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]-speaking [[Sephardi Jews]], in their various diasporas, the [[family name]] [[Toledano]] is still prevalent \u2013 indicating an ancestry traced back to this city (the name is also attested among non-Jews in various [[Spanish language|Spanish-speaking countries]]).\n\nIn the 13th century, Toledo was a major cultural centre under the guidance of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], called \"El Sabio\" (\"the Wise\") for his love of learning. The [[Toledo School of Translators]], that had commenced under Archbishop [[Raymond de Sauvet\u00e2t|Raymond of Toledo]], continued to bring vast stores of knowledge to Europe by rendering great academic and philosophical works in Arabic into Latin. The [[Palacio de Galiana]], built in the [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style, is one of the monuments that remain from that period.\n\nThe [[Cathedral of Toledo]] (''Catedral de Toledo'') was built between 1226 and 1493 and modeled after the [[Bourges Cathedral]], though it also combines some characteristics of the [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style. It is remarkable for its incorporation of light and features the [[Baroque]] altar called ''[[El Transparente]]'', several stories high, with fantastic figures of stucco, paintings, bronze castings, and multiple colors of marble, a masterpiece of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[mixed media]] by [[Narciso Tom\u00e9]] topped by the daily effect for just a few minutes of a shaft of light from which this feature of the cathedral derives its name. Two notable bridges secured access to Toledo across the Tajo, the [[Puente de Alc\u00e1ntara, Toledo|Alc\u00e1ntara bridge]] and the later built [[Puente de San Mart\u00edn (Toledo)|San Mart\u00edn bridge]].\n\nThe [[Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes, Toledo|Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes]] is a [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]], built 1477\u20131504, in a remarkable combination of Gothic-Spanish-Flemish style with [[Mud\u00e9jar]] ornamentation.\n\nToledo was home to [[El Greco]] for the latter part of his life, and is the subject of some of his most famous paintings, including ''[[The Burial of the Count of Orgaz]]'', exhibited in the Church of Santo Tom\u00e9.\n\nWhen Philip II moved the [[royal court]] from Toledo to [[Madrid]] in 1561, the old city went into a slow decline from which it never recovered.\n\n===Toledo steel===\n{{Main|Toledo steel}}\nToledo has been a traditional sword-making, steel-working centre since about 500 BC, and came to the attention of Rome when used by [[Hannibal]] in the [[Punic Wars]].

Collingwood]]\n'''Alv\u00edssm\u00e1l''' (\"Talk of Alv\u00edss\") is a poem collected in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', probably dating to the 12th century, that describes how the god [[Thor]] outwits a [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarf]] called [[Alv\u00edss]] (\"All-Wise\") who seeks to marry his daughter.\n\n==Plot==\nAlv\u00edss comes to Thor to claim Thor's daughter as his bride, saying that she had been promised to him earlier. Thor refuses as he had not been at home at the time, then tells Alv\u00edss that he may take the young woman if he can correctly answer all of Thor's questions.  The dwarf's replies act as an exhaustive list of the sentient mythological entities among men, [[\u00c6sir]], [[Vanir]], [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], dwarfs, and [[\u00c1lf|elves]].

He spent his early years in the middle-income [[Stuyvesant Town]] housing development in [[Lower Manhattan]].

When he was 12, his family moved to the [[Philadelphia Main Line]], the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from [[Radnor High School]] in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the [[University of Chicago]] with a degree in history.<ref name=\"pbsbio\"/> His senior thesis was on popular science writer [[Robert Ardrey]].<ref name=\"Beam 2010\" />\n\nAs an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], who was scheduled to speak at the university: \"In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping.\"<ref>University of Chicago ''Maroon'', April 5, 1983.</ref> To his piece, Brooks appended the note: \"Some would say I'm envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?\" When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.<ref>[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0402/features/index-brooks.shtml \"Everybody's a Critic\", Mary Ruth Yoe, ''University of Chicago Magazine''(February, 2004).]</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nUpon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the [[City News Bureau of Chicago]], a wire service owned jointly by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]''.<ref name=\"pbsbio\" /> He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him.<ref name=\"Beam 2010\" /> In 1984, mindful of the offer he had received from Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern at Buckley's ''[[National Review]]''. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent lifestyle that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions, Bach concerts, dinners at Buckley's [[Park Avenue]] apartment and villa in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.\n\n<blockquote>Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. ''National Review'' was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. [[Sam Tanenhaus]] later reported in ''The New Republic'' that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn't been for his being Jewish. \"If true, it would be upsetting,\" Brooks says.<ref name=\"Beam 2010\" /></blockquote>\n\nAfter his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]] and wrote movie reviews for ''[[The Washington Times]]''.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:PBS-Rehearsal-David Brooks.jpg|thumb|Brooks and PBS staff at rehearsal for ''[[PBS Newshour]]'' in 2012.]]\nIn 1986, Brooks was hired by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', where he worked first as an editor of the book review section. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990\u201394, ''The Wall Street Journal'' posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to [[Brussels]], where he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' when it was launched in 1994. In 1996, he edited an anthology, ''Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.''<ref name=\"pbsbio\" /><ref name=\"nytbio\" />\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = left | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?157392-1/bobos-paradise ''Booknotes'' interview with Brooks on ''Bobos'', July 30, 2000], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nIn 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled ''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There]]'' to considerable acclaim. The book, a [[paean]] to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or \"new upper class\" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.\n\nAccording to a 2010 article in ''New York Magazine'' written by Christopher Beam, ''New York Times'' editorial-page editor [[Gail Collins]] called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.\n\n<blockquote>Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist [[William Safire]], but one who understood how liberals think. \"I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn't make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,\" says Collins. \"He was perfect.\" Brooks started writing in September 2003. \"The first six months were miserable,\" Brooks says. \"I'd never been hated on a mass scale before.\"<ref name=\"Beam 2010\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 2004, Brooks' book ''[[On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense]]'' was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, ''Bobos in Paradise'', but it was not as well received as its predecessor.

When he was 12, his family moved to the [[Philadelphia Main Line]], the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from [[Radnor High School]] in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the [[University of Chicago]] with a degree in history.<ref name=\"pbsbio\"/> His senior thesis was on popular science writer [[Robert Ardrey]].<ref name=\"Beam 2010\" />\n\nAs an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], who was scheduled to speak at the university: \"In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping.\"<ref>University of Chicago ''Maroon'', April 5, 1983.</ref> To his piece, Brooks appended the note: \"Some would say I'm envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?\" When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.<ref>[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0402/features/index-brooks.shtml \"Everybody's a Critic\", Mary Ruth Yoe, ''University of Chicago Magazine''(February, 2004).]</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nUpon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the [[City News Bureau of Chicago]], a wire service owned jointly by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]''.<ref name=\"pbsbio\" /> He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him.<ref name=\"Beam 2010\" /> In 1984, mindful of the offer he had received from Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern at Buckley's ''[[National Review]]''. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent lifestyle that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions, Bach concerts, dinners at Buckley's [[Park Avenue]] apartment and villa in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.\n\n<blockquote>Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. ''National Review'' was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. [[Sam Tanenhaus]] later reported in ''The New Republic'' that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn't been for his being Jewish. \"If true, it would be upsetting,\" Brooks says.<ref name=\"Beam 2010\" /></blockquote>\n\nAfter his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]] and wrote movie reviews for ''[[The Washington Times]]''.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:PBS-Rehearsal-David Brooks.jpg|thumb|Brooks and PBS staff at rehearsal for ''[[PBS Newshour]]'' in 2012.]]\nIn 1986, Brooks was hired by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', where he worked first as an editor of the book review section. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990\u201394, ''The Wall Street Journal'' posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to [[Brussels]], where he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' when it was launched in 1994. In 1996, he edited an anthology, ''Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.''<ref name=\"pbsbio\" /><ref name=\"nytbio\" />\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = left | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?157392-1/bobos-paradise ''Booknotes'' interview with Brooks on ''Bobos'', July 30, 2000], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nIn 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled ''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There]]'' to considerable acclaim. The book, a [[paean]] to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or \"new upper class\" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.\n\nAccording to a 2010 article in ''New York Magazine'' written by Christopher Beam, ''New York Times'' editorial-page editor [[Gail Collins]] called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.\n\n<blockquote>Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist [[William Safire]], but one who understood how liberals think. \"I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn't make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,\" says Collins. \"He was perfect.\" Brooks started writing in September 2003. \"The first six months were miserable,\" Brooks says. \"I'd never been hated on a mass scale before.\"<ref name=\"Beam 2010\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 2004, Brooks' book ''[[On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense]]'' was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, ''Bobos in Paradise'', but it was not as well received as its predecessor.
