Subsequently, on September 12, the network removed the animated series from its Saturday morning schedule in favor of a new three-hour block of [[live action]] \u2013 mostly scripted \u2013 series aimed at teenagers, with ''Saved by the Bell'' (which entered its fourth and final season at that time) as its centerpiece, making NBC the first network to drop conventional children's programming (animated or otherwise) entirely. The following year in September 1993, this block officially adopted the \"TNBC\" brand. As a result of the retooling of the network's Saturday morning lineup, ''[[California Dreams]]'', a sitcom originally centered on a family was retooled around a group of teenage friends (though retaining its focus around the show's titular [[Musical ensemble#Rock and pop bands|band]]), from season 2 onward, setting the template for future TNBC shows to follow very similar formats.\n\nMost of the scripted programs featured that aired as part of the TNBC lineup were sitcoms [[executive producer|executive produced]] by ''Saved by the Bell'' [[showrunner]] [[Peter Engel (TV producer)|Peter Engel]] such as ''California Dreams'', ''[[City Guys]]'', ''[[Hang Time (TV series)|Hang Time]]'', ''[[One World (TV series)|One World]]'' and the ''Saved by the Bell'' spinoff, ''[[Saved by the Bell: The New Class]]'', the latter of which took over the timeslot previously held until its conclusion by its parent series. From its start, the lineup was designed to meet the earliest form of the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s [[E/I|educational programming]] guidelines defined under the [[Children's Television Act]], with many of these shows incorporating [[very special episode]]s dealing with relevant teenage social issues such as [[underage drinking]], [[Substance abuse|drug use]] and [[sexual harassment]].\n\n[[File:TNBC (1993-2000) logo.png|thumb|right|TNBC logo used from 1993 to 2000]]\nThough Engel contributed heavily to the block, three comedy series he produced during its existence would not air on the TNBC block. ''[[Saved by the Bell: The College Years]]'' debuted on NBC in September 1993 (the same month that the longer-running ''Saved by the Bell: The New Class'' premiered), but aired instead as part of the network's primetime schedule; ''[[USA High]]'', a comedy centering on a group of American students participating in an international school program, aired instead on [[USA Network]] (which coincidentally later became a sister network to NBC in 2004, through then-parent [[General Electric]]'s majority purchase of USA corporate parent [[Vivendi Universal]]) from 1997 to 2000, and ''[[Malibu, CA (TV series)|Malibu, CA]]'', centering on a group of teenagers living in the [[Malibu, California|titular]] [[Southern California]] community, aired in [[broadcast syndication|first-run syndication]] from 1998 to 2000 under a distribution agreement with [[Tribune Entertainment]].\n\nIn addition to the scripted series, two reality-based series aired during the lineup's history: the [[game show]]s ''[[Brains & Brawn]]'' and ''[[Name Your Adventure]]''. Another non-scripted NBC show, ''[[NBA Inside Stuff]]'' (a supplementary program created through the network's [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[NBA on NBC|television package]]), aired directly after the programming block but was never an official part of the TNBC lineup.\n\nIn 2000, ''[[Just Deal]]'' became the first TNBC scripted series not to be produced by Peter Engel since the short-lived 1993 series ''[[Running the Halls]]'', and the first series to be shot in a [[single-camera setup|single-camera]] format. The following year, ''[[Sk8 (TV series)|Sk8]]'' premiered on the block, lasting for one season before being canceled. Both ''Just Deal'' and ''Sk8'' were productions of [[Thomas W.

By 2001, the block was suffering from declining viewership, particularly among its intended audience of teens; much of its audience by this point was from older viewers who had left their TV on after ''Today'' ended, and by its last season, the average age of a TNBC viewer was 41 years old.<ref name=variety-adultsdiscover>{{cite web|title=Adults 'Discover' kiddie programs|url=https://variety.com/2003/tv/news/adults-discover-kiddie-programs-1117880923/|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=2003|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref>  On January 6, 2002, [[Discovery Communications]] entered into a time-lease agreement with NBC to produce a new Saturday morning block featuring original programs from the [[Discovery Kids]] cable channel.

Lots of efforts go into the preparations, most of the culinary order. The house is cleaned, washed and turned inside out, and the boy, Andrey, and his tutor Pobedimsky receive new costumes, made by the local tailor.\n\nUpon his uncle's arrival the boy is disappointed. The general does not look at all like a fierce war hero with a sabre as he'd imagined him to be. He is a shifty, youngish middle-aged man who is extraordinary absent-minded and totally delighted with the way how everything around him here is \"so very real.\" He is infatuated with Tatyana Ivanovna, the wife of the estate's manager Fyodor. \n\nSo as to accommodate the guest and his lackey properly, the boy and his teacher are moved to the couple's lodge.

The idyll goes all pear-shaped one evening when the latter, having forgotten that she has a husband, asks Tatyana (whom he insists on calling Pelageya Ivanovna) to go with himself to Saint Petersburg. The outraged Fyodor Petrovich, who is present, first throws the general out of the outbuilding, then Pobedimsky, who rather stupidly betrays his own feelings towards Tatyana Ivanovna.

Chekhov included it into the Volume 4 of his Collected Works, published by [[Adolf Marks]] in 1899\u20131901.\n\nDuring the author's lifetime \"The Privy Councillor\" was translated into [[German language|German]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language]]s. Published in [[Prague]] in 1892, it proved to be Chekhov's first story to come out there as a separate edition. It was translated into German by Elsa Goeller.

The original version of this engine was used in the 1969 and 1970 [[Boss 302 Mustang]]s and Cougar Eliminators and was constructed by attaching heads designed for the planned [[Ford 335 engine|351 Cleveland]] (which debuted the following year) to a Ford small block.<ref name=\"build\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mustangandfords.com/how-to/engine/mdmp-1011-ford-boss-302-engine-build/ |title=Ford Boss 302 Engine Build - Build A Better Boss |last=Holdener |first=Richard |date=2010-10-10 |accessdate=2015-08-10}}</ref> The construction was aided by the two engines sharing a [[cylinder head]] bolt pattern, though the Boss heads had to have their coolant passages slightly modified.<ref name=\"build\" />\n\nAn entirely new [[Ford Modular engine#Boss 302 .28Road Runner.29 Variant|Boss 302 engine]] was introduced for the 2012 Ford Mustang using a variant of the [[Ford Modular engine]].\n\n==Design==\nThe 1969-70  302 H.O. engine was created in 1968 for the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]]'s 1969 [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am]] road racing series.  Fitted to the factory-made [[Boss 302 Mustang]]s of 1969-70, it is a unique Ford small-block featuring a thin-wall high nickel content casting. It differed substantially from regular 302s, featuring 4-bolt mains, screw-in freeze plugs, higher nickel content, and cylinder heads using a canted valve design developed for the 351C, which made its debut in late 1969 Mustangs.\n\nThe high nickel content block had a thicker deck, and a taller intake manifold due to the heads. It also had a distinct harmonic balancer, crankcase windage tray, bigger diameter alternator pulley (from the 289 HIPO), and bigger diameter power steering pulley all to accommodate the higher RPM capabilities of the engine vs a standard 302. The Boss 302 has eight valve cover bolts; in 1969 they were chrome and in 1970 they were cast aluminum, while the standard 302 has six valve cover bolts. The [[connecting rod]]s are the same as used in the 289 HIPO, and have an engineering number of C3AE-D on them. They are capable of higher RPMs than standard 302 rods (up to ~8k RPM), aided by a spot face for {{convert|3/8|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} bolts with a unique football-shaped head (vs 5/16 for standard small blocks), and beefier cap. The [[crankshaft]] is cross drilled (this was changed in 1970 for better reliability) high strength steel forging. The cam and lifters are high lift, solid mechanical units. The cam featured 290 degrees duration and {{convert|.477|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} of lift.\n\nThe wide and large port heads with staggered valve placement give the 302 H.O. high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof design of the heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake {{convert|2.23|in|mm|1}} and exhaust {{convert|1.7|in|mm|1}} valves sitting in a small quench style [[combustion chamber]]. [[Exhaust valve]]s were sodium-filled to aid cooling. Valve springs were dual units with an inner and outer spring to minimize harmonic resonance at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod guide plates to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable [[rocker arm]]s.

The original version of this engine was used in the 1969 and 1970 [[Boss 302 Mustang]]s and Cougar Eliminators and was constructed by attaching heads designed for the planned [[Ford 335 engine|351 Cleveland]] (which debuted the following year) to a Ford small block.<ref name=\"build\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mustangandfords.com/how-to/engine/mdmp-1011-ford-boss-302-engine-build/ |title=Ford Boss 302 Engine Build - Build A Better Boss |last=Holdener |first=Richard |date=2010-10-10 |accessdate=2015-08-10}}</ref> The construction was aided by the two engines sharing a [[cylinder head]] bolt pattern, though the Boss heads had to have their coolant passages slightly modified.<ref name=\"build\" />\n\nAn entirely new [[Ford Modular engine#Boss 302 .28Road Runner.29 Variant|Boss 302 engine]] was introduced for the 2012 Ford Mustang using a variant of the [[Ford Modular engine]].\n\n==Design==\nThe 1969-70  302 H.O. engine was created in 1968 for the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]]'s 1969 [[Trans-Am Series|Trans-Am]] road racing series.  Fitted to the factory-made [[Boss 302 Mustang]]s of 1969-70, it is a unique Ford small-block featuring a thin-wall high nickel content casting. It differed substantially from regular 302s, featuring 4-bolt mains, screw-in freeze plugs, higher nickel content, and cylinder heads using a canted valve design developed for the 351C, which made its debut in late 1969 Mustangs.\n\nThe high nickel content block had a thicker deck, and a taller intake manifold due to the heads. It also had a distinct harmonic balancer, crankcase windage tray, bigger diameter alternator pulley (from the 289 HIPO), and bigger diameter power steering pulley all to accommodate the higher RPM capabilities of the engine vs a standard 302. The Boss 302 has eight valve cover bolts; in 1969 they were chrome and in 1970 they were cast aluminum, while the standard 302 has six valve cover bolts. The [[connecting rod]]s are the same as used in the 289 HIPO, and have an engineering number of C3AE-D on them. They are capable of higher RPMs than standard 302 rods (up to ~8k RPM), aided by a spot face for {{convert|3/8|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} bolts with a unique football-shaped head (vs 5/16 for standard small blocks), and beefier cap. The [[crankshaft]] is cross drilled (this was changed in 1970 for better reliability) high strength steel forging. The cam and lifters are high lift, solid mechanical units. The cam featured 290 degrees duration and {{convert|.477|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} of lift.\n\nThe wide and large port heads with staggered valve placement give the 302 H.O. high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof design of the heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake {{convert|2.23|in|mm|1}} and exhaust {{convert|1.7|in|mm|1}} valves sitting in a small quench style [[combustion chamber]]. [[Exhaust valve]]s were sodium-filled to aid cooling. Valve springs were dual units with an inner and outer spring to minimize harmonic resonance at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod guide plates to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable [[rocker arm]]s. Fuel was provided by a [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] {{convert|780|cuft/min|1|abbr=on}} manual [[Choke valve|choke]] carburetor. The taller intake required a thinner spacer. Ford used a phenolic spacer that incorporated an aluminum tube for the PCV hose, and also helped isolate the carburetor from the heat of the intake.

For most of the series, Peter is shown as an obese, unintelligent, lazy, outspoken, childish, and eccentric alcoholic. He has several jobs, which have included working at the Happy Go Lucky Toy Factory, a fisherman, and currently as a shipping clerk at the Pawtucket Brewery. It is discovered that his legal first name is Justin, in the season 13 episode \"[[Quagmire's Mom]]\".\n\n===Lois Griffin===\n{{main|Lois Griffin}}\n\n'''Lois Patrice Griffin''' (n\u00e9e '''Pewterschmidt''') (voiced by [[Alex Borstein]]) is the matriarch of the Griffin household, Peter's wife, and the mother of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. She is a 43-year-old German-American housewife who cares deeply for her kids and her husband, while also working as a [[piano instructor]]. Lois is also very flirtatious and has slept with numerous people on the show.\n\n===Meg Griffin===\n{{main|Meg Griffin}}\n\n'''Margaret Winnifred \"Meg\" Griffin''' (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in season 1, [[Mila Kunis]] since season 2) is the Griffins' 18-year-old daughter and oldest child. She is a self-conscious, insecure, and sensitive teenager who is more often than not ridiculed and ignored by the people around her. Meg just wants to be another face in the crowd by fitting in with her peers and being accepted, but she often finds herself to be a victim of circumstance. She has had several love interests over the course of the series, including Brian Griffin, Mayor Adam West, Tom Tucker, Glenn Quagmire, and Joe Swanson.\n\n===Chris Griffin===\n{{main|Chris Griffin}}\n\n'''Christopher Cross \"Chris\" Griffin''' (voiced by [[Seth Green]]) is the Griffins' 14-year-old son and middle child. He is a friendly, laid-back, and funny teenager who is a younger version of Peter physically, but intellectually, he often shows more potential, as demonstrated from moments of coherence and articulation within his speech. Chris, can however, be scatterbrained and is easily confused, something Peter frequently takes for granted.\n\n===Stewie Griffin===\n{{main|Stewie Griffin}}\n\n'''Stewart Gilligan \"Stewie\" Griffin''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the Griffin's 1-year-old child, but often behaves in adult ways such as speaking in an upper-class British dialect. He is a [[Child prodigy|child genius]] who frequently aspired to murder his mother Lois and take over the world but has since mellowed out considerably. He turned 1 year old in \"[[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]],\" and has not aged past one year since.\n\n===Brian Griffin===\n{{main|Brian Griffin}}\n\n'''Brian H. Griffin''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the family's 8-year-old [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] talking white [[Labrador Retriever]] and the best friend of both Stewie and Peter. He and Stewie are often at the center of the show's most critically acclaimed episodes, most notably the \"''[[Road to... (Family Guy)|Road to...]]''\" episodes, where he and Stewie go on road-trips together. Brian is portrayed as an intellectual\u2014a [[Brown University]] attendee\u2014who often serves as the family's voice of reason, pointing out how ridiculous Peter's ideas are. He is not-so-secretly in love with Lois and is an unsuccessful, unemployed writer.\n\nBrian was not revealed to be an [[atheist]] until [[Family Guy (season 7)|season 7]]. In earlier seasons, he was shown to be very much a believer of [[God]] especially in \"[[If I'm Dyin', I'm Lyin']]\" in [[Family Guy (season 2)|season 2]]. How this change occurred in Brian is unknown.\n\nIn \"[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]\", Brian is hit by a car and dies from his injuries, with the family by his side. The family then decides to adopt a new streetwise dog with a [[New Jersey]]/[[Italian American]] way of speaking named Vinny. However, in \"[[Christmas Guy]]\" (two episodes later), Stewie still misses Brian, but finds a way to go back in time and successfully saves him, also meaning that the family never adopted Vinny. Though Stewie and Vinny did say their goodbyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/hes-back-brian-griffin-returns-to-family-guy|title=WATCH: Brian Griffin Returns to Family Guy|publisher=Mediaite|date=2013-12-15|accessdate=2014-07-21}}</ref>\n\n===Extended family===\n* '''Francis Griffin''' (voiced by [[Charles Durning]]) \u2013 Peter's grumpy and stubborn adoptive father, Lois's adoptive father-in-law, and the adoptive paternal grandfather of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. He was once married to Peter's biological mother Thelma Griffin. An obsessively devout 80-year-old Roman Catholic, he hates Lois because she is not a Catholic, and often calls her a \"Protestant whore\", disapproves of his son's family's lifestyle, and frequently attempts to force his religious views on them. To a lesser extent he disapproves of Lois due to her heritage, and is angry with Peter for not marrying an \"Irish rose\". When Peter and Lois got married, Francis taped the sign \"To a Protestant Whore\" underneath the \"Just Married\" sign on the limousine. Despite all of this, he truly did love and care for Peter, and showed on multiple occasions to care for his grandchildren. Francis used to have a job at a metal fabrication plant; after his short retirement, he became a bodyguard for the Pope. In the episode \"[[Peter's Two Dads]]\", Francis dies on Meg's 17th birthday when Peter gets drunk and tries to ride a [[unicycle]] down the stairs, but ends up falling off the stairs and landing on top of Francis.  \n* '''Mickey McFinnigan''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Peter's biological father, and the biological paternal grandfather of Meg, Chris, and Stewie, and father-in-law of Lois. He is an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[alcoholism|drunk]]. He reprises a major role in \"Peter's Two Dads\", when Peter visits him in [[Ireland]]. Mickey mocks Peter at first and bullies him, but Peter challenges him to a drinking contest and wins. Finally, Mickey accepts Peter into his family and spoils him ever after by buying Guinness and more.\n* '''Thelma Griffin''' (voiced by [[Florence Stanley]] in the first appearance, [[Phyllis Diller]] in later appearances, [[Alex Borstein]] as a young woman in \"Don't Be a Dickens at Christmas\") \u2013 Ex-wife to Francis, mother of Peter, and paternal grandmother of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. She is the mother-in-law of Lois. She first appears in \"[[Holy Crap]]\".

In the episode \"[[Grumpy Old Man]]\", it is revealed that Thelma was sent to a retirement home. In the Season 12 episode \"[[Mom's the Word]]\", it is revealed that Thelma died from a stroke.

It is noted on a few occasions Barbara only married Carter for his wealth and family heritage. She is demeaning but more polite to Peter than her husband is. In appearance, she is basically an older version of Lois. In the episode \"[[The Fat Guy Strangler]]\", it is revealed that she had an affair with [[Jackie Gleason]] which traumatized Patrick. In \"[[Family Goy]]\", it is revealed she is [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]], and a survivor of the [[Holocaust]]. She only changed her religion so she and Carter could gain access to country clubs.

She then broke into her parents' house and found out where he lived. Then she and the family drove to the address which was found to be a mental institution. When there seemed to be nothing wrong with him they decided to check him out and take him in. Later it is discovered that he has an imaginary wife named Marian and, more importantly, that he had a hatred of overweight people due to a bad experience from his childhood (witnessing comedian [[Jackie Gleason]] having a sexual encounter with his mother).

Also, in \"[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]\", Stewie refers to a \"pedophile who lives down the street\" about which nobody is taking any action \"because he's so funny\", clearly talking about Herbert.

She arrives at his trial where a lot of the generic men attending the trial recognize her as noted by Mayor Adam West. Crystal admits her faults, but claims to have found religion and asks that he be released to her custody. The judge presiding over the trial rejects her request and sentences Quagmire to twenty years in prison. She tries to get him to find solace in God as well, but he rejects her words. Stewie even asked Crystal if she is aware of what Dan has been through. Just before he enters the prison, the judge arrives and announces that he has commuted Quagmire's sentence, thanks to his mother's \"talents\" and that new DNA evidence has turned up.

In the episode \"[[Love, Blactually]]\", it is revealed that Loretta has regretted her actions and wants Cleveland back, but he refuses her advances. Cleveland informs her he needs to move on, and advises her to do the same. She takes Cleveland's house in the divorce and puts it up for sale, yet is still apparently living there some months later. In ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' episode \"Gone with the Wind\", Loretta dies at the age of 44 in an accident when Peter drops a [[Brontosaurus]] skeleton (which Brian had dug up from the Griffin family's yard) on her house and she goes through the same bathtub gag that Cleveland went through which she does not survive.

Also, it is revealed that he has lost his faith in God because of the affair his mother had with Quagmire that led to his parents' divorce. When Cleveland became engaged to Donna, Cleveland Brown Jr. became the stepbrother of Roberta and Rallo.

In \"[[A Hero Sits Next Door]]\", Joe mentioned that he was crippled stopping [[Grinch|the Grinch]] from stealing Christmas from an orphanage.

He also has crush on Meg, but she, too, finds him annoying. At one point in the series, however, Neil and Meg become interns at the local news station, Channel 5, and they share a kiss. Neil speaks with a [[lateral lisp]], but in \"[[The Story on Page One]]\", when he removes his [[Retainer (orthodontics)|retainer]] he speaks with a deep, smooth bass voice (provided by Seth MacFarlane). \n* {{anchor|Muriel Goldman}}'''Muriel Goldman''' (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]) \u2013 Mort's wife and Neil's mother, whose physical appearance is very similar to her husband's. She met Mort via a video dating service, and they had their first kiss at age of fourteen while both of them were suffering from a cold. Later in her life, one of recreations of herself and Mort was watching old films along with the album ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' to find if any of them synchronized. She was murdered in the Season 9 premiere \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\" where she was stabbed in the back by Diane Simmons. It is also revealed in that episode that she provided James Woods with multiple prescriptions for [[Oxycontin]].

He disliked her and frequently traded insults with her on-air. His family includes his first wife, Stacy; his second wife, Sarah; and a son from his first marriage named Jake, whose face is upside down. He is shown to be protective of his son and dislikes people's use of the term \"freak\". MacFarlane stated that Tucker's voice is the easiest to do for him, and he was \"sort of modeled after the cigarette spokesmen from the 1940s commercials\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/429/429628p10.html|title=Interview with Seth MacFarlane|work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref> Tom hardly speaks in completely normal sentences, instead using his news anchor voice in regular conversation (e.g. \"Back to you, [character]\"). In \"The Kiss Seen Around the World\", Meg Griffin developed a crush on him until he showed his true colors by saying he does not care if Neil Goldman died, then yelled at Tom by saying he only cared about his ratings. In the episode \"Mother Tucker\", Tom has a brief relationship with Peter Griffin's mother, Thelma Griffin, where he became a father figure to a childish Peter. In the episode \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", Simmons killed Muriel Goldman and Derek Wilcox, James Woods, as well as Woods' then girlfriend leaving evidence to frame Tucker. In \"[[Excellence in Broadcasting]]\", Tucker was released from prison and mentions on the news that Diane was the killer and is now dead. He introduces Joyce Kinney as Diane's successor. In \"[[Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]\", Peter learns about Tucker's life as George P. Wilbur and had done minor TV appearances after that. Peter plans to get Tom back on the track in Hollywood.

In \"[[The King Is Dead (Family Guy)|The King Is Dead]]\", it was revealed that her birth name was Diane Seidelman. She and fellow anchor Tom Tucker often traded insults on the air. Her largest role on the show was when Peter hired her to play Anna in his version of ''[[The King and I]]''; she quit after he kept changing everything. In \"[[Patriot Games (Family Guy)|Patriot Games]]\", it was revealed that she was the widow of an unnamed man who committed suicide after Tom Tucker asked, \"Diane, didn't your first husband blow his brains out?\" In the season 9 premiere \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", it was mentioned that she used to date James Woods until he broke up with her around the same time when Tom Tucker tried to replace her. Diane reveals that she worked with Tom for 15 years. This caused her to plan revenge on both men with James Woods ending up murdered and leaving evidence that Tom Tucker murdered Muriel Goldman, Derek Wilcox, James Woods' girlfriend Priscilla and Quagmire's then-girlfriend Stephanie. Lois put the pieces together, only to come face to face with Diane, who took Lois to the edge of a cliff, where she intended to kill her. However, Diane is shot and killed with a sniper rifle fired by Stewie. After saving Lois' life he then states that \"If anyone's gonna take that bitch down, it's gonna be me.\" In \"Excellence in Broadcasting\", her murderous actions and demise were mentioned by Tom; Diane was replaced by Joyce Kinney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SethMacFarlane/statuses/25669684152|title=Twitter/SethMacFarlane: Yes, tonight's episode is|publisher=Twitter.com|accessdate=2013-12-10}}</ref> Lori Alan has appeared in Seth MacFarlane's animated short ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|Larry & Steve]]'', a precursor to ''Family Guy''.

When Lois confides in her over drinks that she was in a porn film, Joyce announces it on the news the next day causing most of Quahog to loathe Lois. Also, it is revealed that in order to have a name that would work on television she changed her last name from Chevapravatdumrong (the last name of the [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong|series' co-producer]]) to Kinney.

He speaks with a strong Spanish accent and is described as an \"effeminate weirdo\" by his employees. He disapproves of nearly all of Peter's actions, mainly because most of them are detrimental to the company, and fires or comes close to firing Peter on multiple occasions. In \"[[Mr. Saturday Knight]]\", he is invited to the Griffins' house for dinner. He promotes Peter to head of toy development and minutes later chokes to death on a dinner roll after it was Heimlich maneuvered out of Brian's throat and into Mr. Weed's mouth. His video [[Will (law)|will]] describes how the factory will be replaced by a children's hospital starting \"now\" as the machinery promptly endangers everyone at the factory. His great-grandfather's surname was [[cynodon dactylon|\"Bermudagrass\"]] but was changed to Weed at [[Ellis Island]]. In the episode \"[[Lois Kills Stewie]]\", Stewie tells Lois, before attempting to shoot her, \"Say hello to Cleveland for me, Oh, and Mr. Weed\".<ref name=\"Knight\">{{cite episode|title=[[Mr. Saturday Knight]]|series=Family Guy|credits=Steve Callaghan (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]]|airdate=September 5, 2001|season=3|number=9}}</ref>\n* {{anchor|Santos and Pasqual}}'''Santos and Pasqual''' \u2013 A pair of Portuguese immigrants who do not speak English.

In return, they urinate in his refreshments when the opportunity arises as seen in \"[[The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire]]\". In this episode, Pasqual saves Joe's life after he nearly drowns by using CPR. This prompts Lois to demand that Peter take CPR classes in order to learn what to do should the situation happen again.\n* {{anchor|Angela}}'''Angela''' (voiced by [[Carrie Fisher]]) \u2013 Peter and Opie's supervisor who is in charge of the Shipping Department at the Pawtucket Brewery.

However, Angela fires Opie in \"[[The Blind Side (Family Guy)|The Blind Side]]\". Peter tried to befriend her based on her love of animals, but ended up horrifying her by staging a bloody cockfight in her house. In \"[[Peter-assment]]\", Angela targets Peter with sexual lust after Peter comes to work without wearing his glasses (which were broken at the time). After Peter refused to have sex with her and cheat on Lois, she tried to gas herself in her car. After Peter rescued her, it was revealed that she has not dated anyone in ten years. Feeling sorry for her, Peter disguised himself as a stereotypical 1920s New York billionaire and had sex with her. Angela knew it was really Peter, but what she did not know was that Peter, as a means of remaining faithful to Lois, hid Mort Goldman (who did it for $2) in his pants so it was Mort who actually had sex with her, not Peter. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Angela attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale. Following Carrie Fisher's unexpected death on December 27, 2016, Seth MacFarlane revealed that Angela would appear on at least two more episodes that Fisher had already done voiceover work on in Season 15, but would not comment on the character's future except by saying that \"Family Guy will miss [Fisher] immensely.\"<ref>http://ew.com/tv/2016/12/28/carrie-fisher-family-guy/</ref> Her final appearance was during the sixteenth-season episode \"Don't Be A Dickens At Christmas\" aired on December 10, 2017.

He sometimes tells Peter to stick his finger in his mouth, only to bite it. He wears two different shoes on each foot. He once went for a haircut that went horribly awry. No-one other than Angela seems to understand what he is saying. However, Peter has been shown to understand him in some instances such as when he gets fired. In \"[[Whistle While Your Wife Works]]\", Opie was forced to watch Peter and Lois have sex in his office at the brewery. In \"[[Blue Harvest]]\", he played a Tusken Raider. In \"[[New Kidney in Town]]\", Peter sends him a shoutout on The Price is Right. In \"[[It's A Trap!]]\", he plays a small amphibious alien that swallows the door droid, voiced by Consuela, from Jabba the Hutt, played by Joe Swanson's, palace. In \"The Blind Side\", Opie is fired from his position for doing something unnecessary that only Peter understood and is replaced by a deaf woman named Stella.

He is a recent immigrant to the United States, apparently of [[Arab]] ethnicity. In all his appearances, he has demonstrated that he is extremely earnest in his attempts to learn a Western sense of humor and understand its subtleties, such as the nature of a sarcastic or ironic comment. He laughs in a loud manner at sarcastic or ironic statements before explaining why the joke was funny (for example, \"Ahh! Is funny because...\"). Peter does not seem to have a strong relationship with Fouad, likely due to his comparatively short time employed at the Pawtucket Brewery, however Peter gets along much better with Fouad than he does with Opie or Angela. Fouad first appears in \"[[Chick Cancer]]\", being introduced by Peter as that foreign guy at work who helped him understand sarcasm. In \"[[Blue Harvest]]\", Fouad plays Lieutenant Shann Childsen on the [[Death Star]] prison deck, who laughs when [[Chewbacca]] (played by Brian) asks for a cell by the pool, stating that it is funny because prisons do not have luxury areas such as swimming pools. In \"[[Padre de Familia]]\", Peter suspects that Fouad may be an illegal immigrant and is angered because of it. Fouad's voice is also heard off-camera in a DVD exclusive scene in \"Three Kings\". In \"[[The Shawshank Redemption]]\" segment, Captain Byron Hadley (played by Seamus) yells for lights out calling the inmates \"ladies\" and Fouad replies that it is funny because they are men.\n* {{anchor|Stella}}'''Stella''' (voiced by [[Marlee Matlin]]) \u2013 A deaf worker at the Pawtucket Brewery.

In \"[[The Peter Principal]]\", Principal Shepherd had a bitter divorce and suffers a breakdown causing the board of education to put him on an indefinite paid leave. As Vice-Principal Brenda McGuire was found dead in her car, the board of education asks for someone to come forward to be the interim principal until a permanent replacement for Principal Shepherd can be found. When Lois anonymously tipped off the board of education about how Peter was helping Meg and her friends on their revenge on the mean students, the board of education intervenes causing them to fire him and reinstate Principal Shepherd after he recovered from his divorce following his sex trip to Thailand. In \"[[Crimes and Meg's Demeanor]]\", Principal Shepherd is revealed to have the first name with John and lives in an apartment building across from the building that is managed by Lou Spinazola. After a confrontation with Stewie and Brian over what appeared to have been him killing his ex-wife Fiona which ended with Brian falling out of the window, Principal Shepherd admitted to the police and the medic about him living off food taken from the school to make ends meet when the police find the bag that supposedly leaked blood.\n* '''Mr. Berler''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Mr. Berler is one of Meg's teachers at James Woods Regional High School.

Connie is a beautiful yet narcissistic and mean-spirited girl who tends to look down on those who are either socially inept or unpopular and encourages the other popular students who she is friends with to bully them, with Meg being an object of favoritism to this abuse. She is most often seen with her closest friends: Gina, Scott, and Doug. While a [[bully]] to most students lacking popularity and confidence, Connie does have a softer side; in \"[[Stew-Roids]]\" &ndash; Connie begs Meg for help after she realizes what it is like to be shunned and ridiculed by her classmates. In the same episode, she fell in love with (and dated) Chris when she realized how nice and kind he can be. In \"[[Let's Go to the Hop]]\", she dances with Peter when he went undercover as \"[[Lando Calrissian|Lando Griffin]]\" at the [[Winter Formal|Winter Snowball dance]]. \n* '''Gina''' (voiced by [[Alex Borstein]] in earlier appearances, [[Camille Guaty]] in later appearances, [[Nina Dobrev]] in \"[[Trading Places (Family Guy)|Trading Places]]\") \u2013 A popular student and cheerleader at James Woods Regional High School who is Connie D'Amico's best friend.\n* '''Esther''' (voiced by [[Tamera Mowry]] in \"[[Barely Legal (Family Guy)|Barely Legal]]\" and \"[[Peter's Daughter]]\", [[Christina Milian]] in later episodes) \u2013 An African-American girl who is one of Meg's friends.\n* '''Patty''' (voiced by [[Alexandra Breckenridge]] in \"[[Barely Legal (Family Guy)|Barely Legal]]\", Barclay DeVeau in \"[[Halloween on Spooner Street]]\", [[Martha MacIsaac]] in later episodes) \u2013 A redheaded girl who is one of Meg's friends.

He even comments on it the first time his name is spoken in the series. He has several catchphrases, the most notable being \"Oh, no!\". He first appeared as the clerk of an \"exotic entertainment\" shop in the Season 1 episode \"[[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]]\", and was then seen sitting astride an obese donkey at the [[Renaissance fair]] when Peter fought the [[Black Knight (Arthurian legend)|Black Knight]]. He has since been seen with a variety of jobs including a deacon, a therapist, a medium, a lawyer, a masseur and a barman. More recently, he was seen working at the bowling alley selling rental shoes as seen in \"The Splendid Source\", refereeing the boxing match where Lois fought Deirdre Jackson in \"Baby, You Knock Me Out\", and working at Quahog Laser Tag in \"Forget-Me-Not\". He has also been seen training to be a police officer, teaching a CPR course, chairing the Quahog [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings and entertaining children at the Quahog Library. He is a member of the school board committee of James Woods Regional High School.

He does not get along well with Meg, although he did once hire her to work in the store. In \"[[Friends of Peter G.]]\", it is revealed that the reason that he knows so much about movies is because he is an alcoholic and he spent so much time in his house and watched every film he could get his hands on.

Another of her nephews was molested by James Woods before he committed suicide, as revealed in \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\" when she was working as Woods' maid. In \"[[Stewie Goes for a Drive]]\", Stewie runs away from home and ends up in a bad neighborhood.

He is present in \"[[Mr. Saturday Knight]]\" when Mr. Weed dies after choking during dinner at the Griffins'. In \"[[I Take Thee Quagmire]]\", it is revealed that anyone who touches his bones dies instantly (though in \"[[Death Is a Bitch]]\" it seems that this is contradicted, but while Stewie rubs his ankle to heal it faster, Death being out of commission, no one at all is able to die). In \"[[Wasted Talent]]\", Death comes to a college campus where a party had taken place and everybody is dead with beer bottles around the room. After doing his deed, he drinks some beer bottles to try to find a silver scroll (for Pawtucket Pat's contest). He ends up getting drunk and crashes his car. In \"[[Friends of Peter G.]]\", Death shows Peter what his life would be like if he continues to drink as much as he does, and if he does not drink at all. Peter learns to control his drinking from this. Death later ends up in a car crash in \"[[Grumpy Old Man]]\", leading him to be taken away by \"Super Death\" (a larger version of himself) who tells him he was going to be reincarnated as a Chinese child.

Dr. Hartman is generally shown to be an unskilled doctor and his skills fluctuate from episode to episode. In one episode, he mentions his [[Yale School of Medicine|Yale Medical School]] degree, but then implies it is a product of his [[calligraphy]] skills. Occasionally, he seems to know exactly what he is doing and performs great medical feats, such as plastic surgery to restore Peter's face, to other episodes where he does not even understand common medical terminology, or needs a chart to find body parts and lets [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] take care of patients while he is gone, as in \"[[You Can't Do That on Television, Peter]]\". He temporarily loses his medical license in \"[[Stewie Loves Lois]]\" when Peter accuses him of rape (it turns out that Hartman had in fact merely performed a normal [[prostate]] exam, though Peter did not understand the procedure). He manages to regain his license after treating Peter's urination problem. In \"[[Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air]]\", Peter brought up the fact that Hartman sounds very similar to [[#Relatives of the Griffin family|Carter Pewterschmidt]] when he speaks. As a response, Hartman tells Peter that Carter is one of his patients and that there are only so many voices in the world; some are bound to be similar and that he never noticed because they do not talk all that much despite the fact that Carter is in fact a patient of his. This was brought up to turn the scenario that MacFarlane voices both Hartman and Carter into a comical situation. His name comes from MacFarlane's close friend and fellow animator [[Butch Hartman|Elmer \"Butch\" Hartman]]. In \"[[New Kidney in Town]]\", Hartman gives Peter one of his kidneys because the Griffin family are his last paying customers. Also in the episode, Hartman reveals that while attempting to clone a chicken, he inadvertently created [[#The Giant Chicken|the Giant Chicken]] where Peter says he is going to want to discuss with Dr. Hartman later. In \"[[Secondhand Spoke]]\", it is revealed that Hartman has a gay son. In \"[[Ratings Guy]]\", it is revealed that Hartman is the worst doctor at Quahog's hospital. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Dr. Hartman was among the Quahog citizens to attend the trial between Pawtucket Patriot Ale and Duff Beer in Springfield. He was shown to have been seated next to [[Dr. Nick|Dr. Nick Riviera]] (who was also an incompetent doctor). In \"Once Bitten\", Dr. Hartman enlisted his dad to get him and Seamus into a movie theater. In \"[[Papa Has a Rollin' Son]]\", it is revealed that Hartman has [[Dyslexia]].\n* '''[[Frank Sinatra Jr.]]''' (voiced by himself) \u2013 A singer, songwriter and conductor who meets Brian Griffin in \"Brian Sings and Swings\" following his near-death experience. Frank gives him some words of wisdom before taking the stage at the Quahog Cabana Club. Brian and Frank start to sing together, and eventually Stewie Griffin joins them, forming the \"New Rat Pack\". In \"Tales of a Third Grade Nothing,\" Frank and Brian purchase the Quahog Cabana Club. When business fails to improve, the two look to Stewie to bring in more customers. Stewie turns the club into a trendy Hollywood style night club called pLace that ultimately fails when [[Andy Dick]] shows up to party. The episode \"[[Bookie of the Year]]\" was Frank Sinatra Jr.'s final role before he died where he was shown helping Brian and Stewie with a restaurant plan.\n* {{anchor|God}}'''[[God]]''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 The father of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and the creator of life. He is a central part of the basic tenets in the religion of [[Christianity]]. Although the basic concept of God exists in other monotheistic and polytheistic religions, it is the Christian God that serves as the basis for the character in ''Family Guy''. His appearance in the show is the stereotypical appearance of an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] god in the Western world; a bald-headed Caucasian man with long white hair, a huge white beard and a white robe. Contrary to the widespread belief of a benevolent and pure God, the \"God\" character in ''Family Guy'' has often been shown to have several human flaws, especially being shown as being socially irresponsible and [[Sexual perversion|sexually perverted]]. In the episode \"[[Fifteen Minutes of Shame]]\", he aims a [[sniper rifle]] with [[red dot sight]] at Meg from the clouds after she says, \"Oh God, kill me now\", but is interrupted by a phone call before he can complete the task. In the episode \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\", God flirts with a woman at the Drunken Clam, and lights her a cigarette with lightning before accidentally vaporizing her and setting the bar on fire, to which he exclaims, \"Jesus Christ!\" Jesus then arrives, and hastily leaves the area with God in a [[Cadillac Escalade]] before they can be caught up in the blaze. In \"[[Untitled Griffin Family History]]\", God asks his roommate Chuggs for a lighter, using it to [[Fart lighting|light a fart]]. On his second attempt, the lit fart sets in motion the [[Big Bang]] that creates the universe. In \"[[The Courtship of Stewie's Father]]\", [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] quarrels with a teenage Jesus, before Jesus storms out of the room shouting, \"You're not my real father!\". He then goes on to give God a phone call asking if he can go back to live with him in [[Heaven]], but is rejected. God then turns to a young woman named Janet lying in his bed, hoping to have sex with her. Janet hands him a condom to his disappointment, and asks her to reconsider, saying it is his birthday, but Janet refuses. In \"[[Partial Terms of Endearment]]\", Peter thanks God thinking he is set to participate in a threesome with Lois and her friend Naomi, to which God replies \"Don't mention it, Peter\". A jingle is then heard singing, \"God! He knows what turns you on!\" after which God says, \"Have fun!\" In \"[[Into Fat Air]]\", God and Jesus discuss on how to name a country in the Himalayas. God says that the mountains look like nipples, to which Jesus replies by saying that he cannot just call a country \"Nipples\". In response, God suggests the name \"[[Nepal]]\" to Jesus' approval. In other episodes, God's serious side has also been shown on occasion such as in \"[[If I'm Dyin', I'm Lyin']]\" where he curses Peter with six of the [[10 plagues]] after he lied to the people of Quahog about being a healer and is then worshipped as a god.\n* {{anchor|Horace}}'''Horace''' (voiced by John G. Brennan) \u2013 The proprietor and [[bartender]] of The Drunken Clam for 30 years. Has been shown to have been working there for at least as long as Peter and his friends have been regulars. Horace has also been shot a handful of times, but has recovered from each incident. In \"[[One If by Clam, Two If by Sea]]\", Horace sold The Drunken Clam following a storm and moved to Florida. He later repurchased it after moving back to Quahog. In \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\", Horace's life is saved by Peter (who was blind at the time) when The Drunken Clam was on fire. In \"[[Save the Clam]]\", Horace is accidentally killed when a baseball hit by Jerome hits him during a baseball game between The Drunken Clam and Mort's Pharmacy. His death causes the bank to close The Drunken Clam which was enough for Peter, Joe and Quagmire to protest this until Jerome buys The Drunken Clam to keep Horace's legacy alive.\n* {{anchor|Jake Tucker}}'''Jake Tucker''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Tom Tucker's deformed son and Chris' former classmate. Jake's many appearances show him with an \"upside-down face\"; a mouth near the top of his head and eyes near the bottom. In \"[[It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One]]\", he gets a normal face, via toxic waste. Although typically depicted as a demanding and obnoxious brat, Jake craves his father's attention, which he rarely gets. It is also revealed in \"[[Peter Griffin: Husband, Father...Brother?]]\" that he \"doesn't have a bottom\". Though Tom often neglects him, he often shows that he cares when Brian accused Jake of giving Chris alcohol. However, when Chris gets his own back on Jake by planting drugs in his locker an enraged Tom declares him a \"bad boy\" and loses faith in him. In \"[[Mother Tucker]]\", Jake is noticeably neglected by Tom when Tom pays more attention to Peter. But Peter then realizes that Tom should pay more attention to Jake.\n* '''[[James Woods]]''' (voiced by himself) \u2013 An actor whose fictional persona becomes a criminal sociopath. In \"[[Peter's Got Woods]]\", he is invited by Peter to help deal with the local high school being named for Woods, i.e. James Woods Regional High School. While Brian's attentions are turned to his girlfriend, Peter becomes friends with Woods. This friendship ends when Woods becomes jealous of Brian. Peter and Brian lure Woods into a crate, forgetting to make holes for air, and ship him off to be studied by \"[[Raiders of the Lost Ark|top men]]\". Woods returns in \"[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]\", stealing Peter's wallet and assuming his identity. Peter retaliates by assuming Woods' identity and ruining his credibility on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. When Woods shows up to fight Peter, he is again lured into a crate to be studied by \"top men\". In \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\", Woods makes an appearance as General [[Maximilian Veers]]. In \"[[Brian Griffin's House of Payne]]\", the CBS producers hire Woods to star in Brian Griffin's television show, Woods making multiple changes to Brian's original script that prompt Brian to back out of the project. James Woods reappears in \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\" in which he becomes a [[born-again Christian]] due to his new relationship with young news intern Priscilla. Woods turns his life over to Jesus wishing to make amends for his sins. Woods is later killed as part of an elaborate murder plot orchestrated by Diane Simmons. In \"[[Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]\", it is revealed that the paramedics who loaded Woods' body into the ambulance recognized him and had his body rushed to a special Hollywood hospital where a teenage girl's life force was drained into Woods which successfully resurrected him. He is still a born-again Christian when he encounters Peter Griffin and Tom Tucker in Hollywood. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", James Woods was present in Springfield at the trial between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale. During this time, he interacted with his Simpsons counterpart from \"[[Homer and Apu]]\". The episode \"Inside Family Guy\" had James Woods hosting the behind the scenes-theme of the episode.\n* '''Jeffrey''' (voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]]) - Jeffrey is Bruce's boyfriend.\n* {{anchor|Jerome}}'''Jerome''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) \u2013 An African-American man who first appeared in \"[[Jerome is the New Black]]\" where he won the audition as a temporary replacement for Cleveland. It is revealed he was involved with Lois Griffin in their younger days before she met Peter, which made Peter jealous enough to burn down Jerome's house. So Lois invited him to come live with them. Peter believed that Jerome was trying to steal Lois from him and became jealous. He kicked Jerome out of his house, but later apologized to him and they remained friends. Jerome also tells Peter that he had some nasty ass sex with Meg when he was staying with the Griffins although Peter told him that he does not care about that. He returns in \"[[Save the Clam]]\" playing for Mort Goldman's softball team against Peter and his team from The Drunken Clam. He accidentally kills Horace by swinging the ball towards his face. Jerome appears at the funeral where he apologizes for accidentally killing Horace. When it came to the demolition of The Drunken Clam which Peter, Quagmire, and Joe were protesting, Jerome appears and uses his sports earnings from lacrosse (which also happens to be his brother's name) to buy The Drunken Clam in order to keep Horace's legacy alive. In \"[[Baby Got Black]]\", it is revealed that Jerome has a daughter named Pam and at first disapproved of her relationship with Chris. In \"Follow the Money\", Jerome reveals that he lost both his childhood sweetheart and their daughter shortly after their wedding. In \"Pawtucket Pete,\" it is revealed that Jerome's voice is unaffected by helium as seen when Peter fired a harpoon gun at Brian Griffin's parade balloon.\n* {{anchor|Jesus}}'''[[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane in early episodes, [[David A. Goodman|David Goodman]] in \"[[Stu and Stewie's Excellent Adventure]]\", [[Seth Green]] in \"[[The Courtship of Stewie's Father]]\", [[Alec Sulkin]] in later episodes) \u2013 The central figure of [[Christianity]]. Throughout the duration of the series, there has been a running gag that Jesus drives a [[Cadillac Escalade]]. This is first seen in the episode \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\", in which he uses it to pick up God from the Drunken Clam after He accidentally set the bar on fire. In \"[[North by North Quahog]]\", he is seen in the car in a trailer for the action film ''[[The Passion of the Christ|The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This]]'' starring [[Jim Caviezel]] as Jesus and [[Chris Tucker]], and directed by [[Mel Gibson]]. Jesus Christ's most prominent appearance on the show came in the episode \"[[I Dream of Jesus]]\", where he worked in disguise at a vinyl record store called \"Dead Format Records\" before being recognized by Peter. After a public display of his powers, including [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]], he becomes a huge celebrity in Quahog. While having dinner with the Griffins, Jesus proves to Brian that he actually is Jesus Christ by turning their dinners into ice cream sundaes, before immensely enlarging Lois' breasts at Peter's request, to the absolute shock of Brian. As the episode progresses, Jesus lets fame get to his head more and more while becoming more distant from Peter and his family, and ultimately gets himself incarcerated for drug abuse. When Peter visits him in prison, Jesus apologizes for his actions and decides that he probably was not mature enough to return to the world. He then gives Peter another record of \"[[Surfin' Bird]]\" as a gift after the first one he had was destroyed by Brian and Stewie. In \"[[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]]\", he turned water into [[funk]]. In the episode \"[[Holy Crap]]\", Francis repeatedly gives Jesus the [[employee of the week]] award, and is himself later seen in a golf course going for a fourth [[Birdie (golf)|birdie]]. Upon missing his putt, he uses his power to move the ball into the hole. In the episode \"[[And the Wiener is...]]\", Jesus and [[Moses]] use guns to defeat the Romans in a film by the National Gun Association. In the episode \"[[Deep Throats]]\", Lois asks \"What if Jesus had given up?\", after which Jesus is seen in a shabby-looking house sitting lazily in a chair, with several children running around him, and calls out to their mother asking why their ironing board is still out. In \"[[Stu and Stewie's Excellent Adventure]]\", the adult Stewie tells his infant self of a time when he went back in time on vacation to see Jesus, saying that his abilities may have been exaggerated a bit. A cutaway shows adult Stewie and other members of the public watching Jesus perform [[Art Metrano]]'s \"tricks\" while humming the song \"[[Fine and Dandy (song)|Fine and Dandy]]\". In \"[[Boys Do Cry]]\", Stewie imagines what it would be like meeting Jesus, and in a cutaway is then seen entering a room in Jesus' house to find him naked washing himself in a tub. Despite noticing Stewie, he carries on. In \"[[Jerome is the New Black]]\", he has an African-American counterpart in \"Black Jesus\" who is portrayed as a cool laid back character and is seen wearing sunglasses. In \"[[Go, Stewie, Go]]\", he is seen in a dodgeball game on the side of the [[Jock (athlete)|jocks]] pelting numerous balls at the [[nerd]]s. In \"[[Life of Brian]]\", Stewie is seen at the [[last supper]] suggesting the idea of rebellion to [[Judas Iscariot]], pointing out that Jesus ordered five margaritas while all Judas had was the salad. In other episodes, Jesus has also been portrayed as a voice of reason, such as in \"[[Family Goy]]\", where he tells Peter about his Jewish identity after Peter and Lois quarreled over whether their family should be Christian or Jewish. However, in response to Peter's question asking which religion his family should follow, Jesus says \"6 of 1, they're all complete crap\". In \"[[3 Acts of God]]\", it is shown that Jesus is dating [[Carrie Underwood]]. In \"[[The 2000-Year-Old Virgin]],\" Jesus has broken up with Carrie Underwood.\n* {{anchor|Jillian Russell}}'''Jillian Russell-Wilcox''' (voiced by [[Drew Barrymore]]) \u2013 Brian's cute, [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimic]], and dimwitted ex-girlfriend who is portrayed as a [[Dumb blonde|stereotypical blonde]]. She is quite ignorant; for example, she does not understand that [[Adolf Hitler]] was defeated decades ago. She has a close friendship with Peter, who treats her more like a daughter than he does Meg, due to their similar levels of intelligence. The remainder of the Griffin family look on her as a figure of mockery and symbol of Brian's shallowness, although she has affection for them, involving them all in her wedding. She first appeared in \"[[Whistle While Your Wife Works]]\". She is the only girlfriend that Brian has dated for more than one episode, and was a recurring character in Season 5. He stays with her purely for sex, though after they split, he felt strong feelings of love for her. In \"[[Prick Up Your Ears (Family Guy)|Prick Up Your Ears]]\", when Brian talks about Jillian's bulimia, he goes on to compare her to [[Karen Carpenter|Karen]] from [[The Carpenters]], who succumbed to anorexia in 1983, claiming she \"overdid it\" but he thinks \"Jillian's found a good balance\". She breaks up with Brian in \"[[Movin' Out (Brian's Song)|Movin' Out]]\" when it is revealed that Brian did not want a committed relationship with her, and she briefly dated Mayor West. She got married in the episode \"[[We Love You, Conrad]]\". In \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", her husband Derek Wilcox was murdered by Diane Simmons, making Jillian a widow. She is shown dating again in \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\", where Quagmire attempts to date her to make Brian jealous, but she and [[Cheryl Tiegs]] leave together when they realize how immature both men are acting. In \"[[Valentine's Day in Quahog]]\", Jillian is among the ex-girlfriends of Brian that Stewie assembles.\n* {{anchor|Jim Kaplan}}'''Jim Kaplan''' (voiced by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]]) \u2013 A [[Confidence trick|con man]] who tricks Peter into spending money on various useless things on many occasions. He was first introduced as Doug but has been referred to as Jim in later episodes. First appearing in \"[[There's Something About Paulie]]\", he sells a car to Peter that does not have an engine under the hood but rather a picture of one by claiming that the car belonged to James Bond. He later sells Peter volcano insurance in \"[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]\" where Peter paid him with Lois' rainy day money (which she planned to use after Stewie broke Meg's glasses). With help from the accountant Max Weinstein, Peter reclaimed the money. Jim later sells Peter a TiVo in \"[[Bango Was His Name Oh!]]\". In \"[[A Fish out of Water (Family Guy)|A Fish out of Water]]\", he gives Peter a loan for Peter's new fishing boat and Peter offers up his house as collateral which later gets taken over by the bank and sold to a fashionable, artsy, neo-hippie-ish new couple named Jim and Abby. In \"[[Hell Comes to Quahog]]\", he sells Peter a tank for Meg at a car dealership for her first car and finally convinces him by saying \"Did I mention it's a tank?\"\n* '''Judge Dignified Q. Blackman''' (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) \u2013 The [[African-American]] judge who presides over trials involving any of this show's characters. His full name was revealed by the bailiff in \"Veteran Guy\" when Peter, Cleveland, and Joe were on trial for violating the [[Stolen Valor Act of 2013]].\n* '''Lou Spinazola''' - The manager of the seedy apartment building that Brian Griffin resides in from \"The D in Apartment 23\" to \"Crimes and Meg's Demeanor.\" Lou's one rule in his apartment building is to never kiss the mail carrier. In \"Married... with Cancer,\" Lou allows Brian and his terminal cancer-recovered wife Jess Schlotz to move in while having developed a sitcom catchphrase.\n* '''Paddy Tanniger''' \u2013 A short red-haired angry man who has been seen as a caddy manager and a Hummer salesman. He generally ends his statements with \"Big whoop, wanna fight about it?\" He was eventually killed when he was run over by a tank piloted by Brian and Stewie in \"[[Hell Comes to Quahog]]\". It is mentioned on the DVD commentary for \"The Perfect Castaway\" that the character was disliked by nearly all the writing staff, which led to his death.\n* '''Rupert''' (voiced by [[Dave Boat|David Boat]] in \"Road to the North Pole\") \u2013 A stuffed [[teddy bear]] that belongs to one-year-old [[Stewie Griffin]]. Though inanimate, Rupert has become his personal confidant and best friend. Stewie confides all his secrets and machinations in Rupert, and often gets upset when Rupert does not respond. Rupert has been known to double as a pistol when needed \"[[Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater]]\". Rupert has been damaged several times. The first time in a flashback in \"[[Stu & Stewie's Excellent Adventure]]\", Stewie argued with Brian about the economy and Brian decided to eat one of Rupert's legs. Stewie got the leg back after a while. The second time involved encountering an unfamiliar [[Rottweiler]] dog in \"[[Stewie Loves Lois]]\". Rupert was torn to shreds but was later sewn back together by Lois. In \"[[A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas]]\", Stewie tears Rupert in two, after waking up from a Santa Claus-themed nightmare. In \"[[Killer Queen (Family Guy)|Killer Queen]]\", Stewie shoots Rupert in the head with a gun rather than risk letting him die a worse death when he sees the cover of a Queen album. In \"[[The Man with Two Brians]]\", he is humped by New Brian for two hours. Stewie is then shown dragging a body into the garbage, later revealed to be New Brian. At the end of the episode Stewie is shown crying in the shower and washing Rupert in despair, constantly reassuring him that it was not his fault. In \"[[Chick Cancer]]\", when Stewie married [[Olivia Fuller]], he had Rupert officiate the ceremony. \"[[8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter]]\" had the creation of Stewpert, a being where Stewie and Rupert were fused together after Stewie activated his teleportation device before he realized Rupert was inside, in reference to Brundlefly of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''. Stewie had several times referred to him as gay. Stewie accused Rupert of choosing to watch the boys in \"[[Road to Rhode Island]]\" as opposed to watching their bags as Stewie has told him to, much to Stewie's chagrin. In the episode \"[[Road to Rupert]]\". Brian accidentally sells Rupert causing both Brian and Stewie (after Brian confesses to selling Rupert by accident) to head off to the Swiss Alps to retrieve him from the family that he was sold to, eventually challenging the father of the family to a ski race to either get him back or give the family Brian as the stakes, Stewie does not respect the rules and throws hot tea in the other young boy' eyes blinding him long enough to grab Rupert, but Stewie later says that he was through with Rupert and was too old for him, saying \"...after all, Brian, I'm nearly one.\"  Stewie has also imagined Rupert as a muscular, human male a few times, including in \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\", where he builds a buff Rupert snowman in the opening credit sequence. However, Rupert retains his Teddy Bear head. In a DVD exclusive scene in \"[[Excellence in Broadcasting]]\", Stewie explores the experience of masturbating and in his fantasy buff Rupert makes out with an equally buff Brian while Stewie is tied to the bed. In the episode \"Lois Comes Out of Her Shell\", Rupert's head is ripped off by Stewie's evil pet turtle Sheldon who Stewie enters a fight with in return. In \"Total Recall\", the factory that made Rupert demands all bears are sent back due to them becoming a choking hazard. Lois in shock sends him back and Brian and Stewie go on a life-threatening quest to get him back, only just saving Rupert (and Stewie) from instant death on a furnace. As they return home, Stewie celebrates with Rupert only for Rupert's eye to come off and Stewie to swallow it supposedly killing him with Chris who witnessed the scene casually shouting \"Mom, Stewie's dead\". In the episode \"[[Quagmire's Quagmire]]\", Stewie must decide whether to \"play\" with Rupert anymore after Lois finds his newborn plush toy, a blue, scruffy looking, bow-tied teddy bear named Oscar who was apparently given to him by Babs Pewterschmidt (his maternal grandmother) when Stewie was born. This fact is stated by Meg who is in the attic, organizing items from boxes along with Lois. Stewie treats Rupert like a nagging wife juxtaposed to Oscar's imaginary role as the still loved ex-girlfriend. In \"[[Stewie, Chris & Brian's Excellent Adventure]]\", Rupert tells the other stuffed animals that he is straight after Stewie and Brian leave with Chris in the time machine. In \"[[Dog Bites Bear]]\", Brian accidentally destroys Rupert while drunk but later replaces him with an identical looking bear that Stewie believes to be Rupert having returned from the dead.\n* {{anchor|Seamus Levine|Seamus}}'''Seamus Levine'''<ref>''Valentine's Day in Quahog''</ref> (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Seamus is a tough [[fisherman]] with two peg-legs as well as two peg arms. He wears a black eye-patch over his right eye. He makes his first appearance in the episode \"[[A Fish out of Water (Family Guy)|A Fish Out of Water]]\". While spending time with Peter and the gang in a steam room, it is revealed his whole body from the neck down is wood. He tends to warn Peter of danger. Seamus had his own talk show in \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\". In his premiere episode, he jokes that his [[Adendrophilia|father was a tree]], but in the episode \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\" he blames his condition on James Woods. Seamus initially claims that Woods carved him from wood and did not wish hard enough for him [[Pinocchio|to be a real boy]], but he later revealed that they both got high on acid one day and Woods ate off Seamus' arms and legs, thinking that he was a steak. In \"[[Ocean's Three and a Half]]\", when Seamus is seen naked, his body is entirely wooden while his head is human, bringing into question how he can sustain life. He played Byron Hadley in the series' portrayal of ''The Shawshank Redemption'' which was seen the second of the \"[[Three Kings (Family Guy)|Three kings]]\". In a DVD exclusive scene, Seamus tries out for Fox News Channel in \"[[FOX-y Lady]]\". He gets a ship in a bottle for Christmas in \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\". In \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\", he attends Quagmire's class on how to pick up women. In \"[[Cool Hand Peter]]\", Seamus attempts to join in Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire's road trip only to be rejected by Peter. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Seamus attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale where he was sitting next to Captain Horatio McCallister.

After [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] is killed in a tragic car accident, the Griffin family decides to find another dog at the pet store to ease their grief. They meet Vinny, a pussyhound (he is 1/16th cat) of [[Italian people|Italian]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latintimes.com/articles/10581/20131125/brian-griffin-dies-4-things-know-vinny.htm#.UpPg_eJx5id|title=Brian Griffin Dies: 4 Things To Know About 'Family Guy' Newcomer Vinny|work=Latin Times|first=William |last=Cannon|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> Each member of the family is taken by the dog, save for Stewie, and he is adopted into their family. Stewie, still mourning over the death of Brian, rebuffs the hound and makes several attempts to get him out of the family. However, once Stewie learns that Vinny had also undergone a period of mourning when his owner died in a freak yoga accident, he comes to accept Vinny as a part of the family. Like Brian, Vinny is an anthropomorphized dog where he is described as having a \"tough guy attitude\", and according to executive producer [[Steve Callaghan]], \"Vinny is just a lot more rough around the edges, and is a really good match for Stewie.\"<ref name=\"DailyMail\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2513065/Family-Guy-character-KILLED-OFF-hit-car-shock-new-episode.html#ixzz2lhrycb8D|website=DailyMail.co.uk|first=Mike|title=Vinny Arrives|last=Larkin|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> His personality is that of a streetwise, \"wise guy\" Italian American. In \"[[Christmas Guy]]\", Vinny found out that Carter Pewterschmidt canceled an event at Quahog Mall upon asking around and reported this to the Griffin family. Vinny helps Stewie distract his past self so he can steal the return pad from his backpack and travel back in time to save Brian. Before Stewie goes back in time, he says his goodbyes to Vinny. Just before Stewie travels back in time, Vinny walks off shouting \"Georgette, I'm coming home!\" to which Stewie questions himself on who \"Georgette\" is. At the end of \"The Boys in the Band,\" Vinny was seen performing with Olivia Fuller.\n\n==Gag characters==\n* '''Al Harrington''' (voiced by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]]) \u2013 The owner, president, and CEO of \"Al Harrington's [[Airdancer|Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tubeman]] Emporium and Warehouse\". In an advertisement, he speaks at an incredibly fast rate and could be described as \"in-your-face\", but just in that friendly-annoying way, as described by Peter. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Al Harrington made a cameo at the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale.\n* '''[[Barbershop quartet|Barbershop Quartet]]''' (voiced by Jon Joyce, Bob Joyce, Rick Logan, and Randy Crenshaw) \u2013 A group of four men that sing close harmony songs in specific episodes.\n* ''' [[Big Bird]]''' (voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]) - Parody of a fictional character from the children's television program ''[[Sesame Street]]'', Big Bird, or sometimes referred to as \"Bird\" appears in multiple episodes such as \"I Never Met The Dead Man\", \"A Picture's Worth a Thousand Bucks\", \"[[Model Misbehavior]]\", \"[[Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air]]\", \"[[The Peter Principal]]\", and also \"[[Brian's Play]]\" were he is portrayed as a meth addict working as the resources director of [[The Muppets]].\n* {{anchor|Buzz Killington}}'''Buzz Killington''' (voiced by Danny Smith) \u2013 A man who dresses and acts as if he is a 19th-century British man of means. His name is based on the term \"[[wikt:buzzkill|buzzkill]]\". He is a stereotype of a socially popular person in the late 19th century{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}, but by today's standard would be regarded as a \"buzzkill\". He is typically introduced into otherwise fun situations, such as a wild party, but his contributions (showing etchings, telling stories) bring the party (and fun) to a grinding halt.\n* '''[[Conway Twitty]]''' \u2013 Usually seen in archival footage of his performances, which are used when one of the characters needs a distraction. The first such appearance was in the episode \"[[Peter's Daughter]]\" where Meg's wedding had just been called off and Peter said that the guests were expecting a show\u2014cut to a clip of Twitty singing his best-known song, \"[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]\". Twitty has also been featured in \"[[Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey]]\" and \"[[The Juice is Loose]]\" (which featured a 3-minute clip of him singing \"[[I See the Want To in Your Eyes]]\"). In \"[[It's a Trap!]]\", he's referred to as Darth Twitty and a Darth Vader helmet is digitally placed over his hair. In \"[[Lois Comes Out of Her Shell]]\", Peter beats up [[Justin Bieber]] just before a concert, so the scene cuts to \"Conway Bieber\" digitally sporting the young singer's floppy hair. In \"[[3 Acts of God]]\", God tells Peter that Twitty wanted him to tell Peter to quit using him in cutaway gags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/family-guy-2014/episode-13-season-12/3-acts-of-god/100148 |title=Family Guy Episode Guide 2014 Season 12 \u2013 3 Acts of God, Episode 13 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n* '''[[Cookie Monster]]''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Cookie Monster is, like Big Bird, a fictional character from ''Sesame Street'' who has made various appearances on this show.\n\n[[File:Evil monkey.JPG|thumb|A [[stuffed animal|stuffed]] Evil Monkey hanging in a closet]]\n* {{anchor|Evil Monkey}}'''Evil Monkey''' (voiced by Danny Smith) \u2013 A monkey living in Chris's closet, who scares Chris whenever he jumps out of the closet by pointing at him with an evil grimace and a strange tremble (which the monkey claims is due to a [[copper deficiency]]). For much of the series, the family believes the Evil Monkey is a figment of Chris's imagination. In \"[[Hannah Banana]]\", Chris blames him for a bad test grade, saying that he scared him while he was trying to study. Peter and Lois are stunned when Chris catches him and shows him to them. The Evil Monkey explains that he moved into Chris's closet after his wife had an affair and divorced him, and pointing at Chris was his way of trying to make conversation. Chris is unconvinced, but when Monkey helps him write a book report, they become friends. Eventually, Monkey moves out of Chris's closet and, saying \"I'll go where I'm needed\", moves into Jake Tucker's closet. The monkey's trademark grimace and pointing was the idea of writer [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Seth MacFarlane Interview|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/articles/seth.cfm|work=TVShowsOnDVD.com|date=April 21, 2003|accessdate=December 17, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824231737/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/articles/seth.cfm|archivedate=August 24, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' episode \"[[The Cleveland Show (season 3)#Episodes|BFFs]]\", [[List of Family Guy characters#Peter Griffin|Peter Griffin]] brought the Evil Monkey with him to rescue [[List of Family Guy characters#Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] and his friends from hillbilly rapists.\n* {{anchor|The Giant Chicken|Ernie the Giant Chicken}}'''Ernie the Giant Chicken''' (voiced by Danny Smith) \u2013 An anthropomorphic, human-sized chicken that often fights violently and suddenly with Peter Griffin, usually interrupting some unrelated event. The fight scenes are often long and melodramatic, involving the destruction of large sections of Quahog and sometimes killing bystanders. Peter always wins, but it is then shown that the Giant Chicken is still alive. This rivalry begins in \"[[Da Boom]]\" when the Giant Chicken gives Peter an expired coupon, which angers Peter (however, in \"[[Meet the Quagmires]]\", Peter's meddling in his past allows him to accidentally punch the Giant Chicken while dancing at the Country Club, giving a new origin to the rivalry). In \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\", the Giant Chicken turns up while the Spooner Street residents are discussing Quagmire peeping in the ladies' room watching Lois, and Peter interrupts his defense of Quagmire to rejoin the fight. In \"[[No Chris Left Behind]]\", their fight comes to a halt when Peter and the Giant Chicken forget what they have been fighting about, and Peter is cordially invited to dinner with the Chicken and his wife Nicole. Although the character's official name in scripts and production documents is simply \"the Giant Chicken\", the Chicken is referred to as \"Ernie\" in this dinner scene. When the bill comes, both Peter and Ernie try to pay. This starts out politely but quickly escalates to a fight that resumes their feud. In \"[[Big Man on Hippocampus]]\", the Chicken ends up attacking an amnesiac Peter when he insults his lawn. The blow to the head causes Peter to remember who he is, and he states that he does not remember making peace with the Chicken, who resumes smashing various objects on his head. Ernie is shown as [[Boba Fett]] in the ''[[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy|Star Wars]]'' episodes \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\" and \"[[It's a Trap!]]\". In \"[[New Kidney in Town]]\", Dr. Hartman tells the Griffins about a failed cloning attempt that resulted in a violent man-sized chicken. Peter responds that they should talk. He also appears in \"[[Trading Places (Family Guy)|Trading Places]]\", when Chris makes a chicken noise and says it was fake. The Chicken's fight with Peter continues in \"[[Internal Affairs (Family Guy)|Internal Affairs]]\", where Peter accidentally backs into the front of the Chicken's car; during this brawl, the Chicken is close to killing Peter at an oil rig, but gets burned alive by the falling debris and plunges into the ocean, taking on the appearance of a roasted chicken\u2014but he reveals he is still alive by opening his eyes. In \"[[Yug Ylimaf]]\", Brian and Stewie witness a backwards fight between Peter and the Chicken that \"ends\" by Peter opening his car door in front of the Chicken's moving bicycle. He is the main antagonist in ''[[Family Guy Video Game!]]'' disguised as [[Mr. Belvedere]]. Ernie is not directly referenced in the episode \"[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]\", but in the veterinary surgery waiting room when Peter asks a decapitated chicken if he should be running around, the chicken says \"Don't talk to me. You have a bad reputation in the chicken community\". In the crossover episode with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', titled \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", [[Comic Book Guy]] references the aforementioned \"chicken fights\", by claiming the epic fight between Peter and [[Homer Simpson]] was the \"worst chicken fight ever\". In \"Follow the Money,\" Lois has become friends with Ernie much to the dismay of Peter and Nicole.\n* '''[[Fred Flintstone]]''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]) \u2013 Fred Flintstone is a [[caveman]] from ''[[The Flintstones]]'' who has made various appearances on the show. In \"Patriot Games\" where he warns viewers to 'vote no on Indian gaming laws'. He also bet with Stewie on the Mike Tyson vs. Carol Channing fight on ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]''. In \"Believe it or Not, Joe's Walking on Air\" when at Peter Griffin's men's club, he confesses to Barney that he was walking by his house when he saw Betty undressing. Fred says that Betty saw him, but kept undressing leading to an \"erocktion.\" Fred also appeared in \"Peter's Daughter\" as they see a marriage counselor/divorce lawyer named Mr. Stoneberg over the rough parts of their marriage. In \"Quagmire's Baby,\" Fred Flintstone was seen in ''Wildest Police Chases'' being pursued by police officers which ended at a movie theater where the police officers apprehend Fred Flintstone when he tried to climb the fence. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Fred Flintstone is the judge who presided over the trial involving Pawtucket Patriot Beer and Duff Beer in Springfield. While he finds in favor of Duff Beer, Fred Flintstone states that they pale in comparison to his favorite beer Bud Rock.\n* '''The Greased-up Deaf Guy''' (voiced by Mike Henry) \u2013 A naked man covered in grease who first appears in \"[[The Thin White Line]]\". His speech is indicative of someone with [[prelingual deafness]]. He is always shown running; even when stopped, he will continue to run in place, flailing his arms. In \"[[North by North Quahog]]\", he mentions that he used to be a lawyer. In \"[[Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High]]\", he is seen speaking in court during the show's ''Law and Order''-parody intro. He was named Jay after an audience member by the same name in ''Family Guy Live'' queried his name in a Q&A session. He appears in the direct-to-DVD movie ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]''. He also appears in ''[[Family Guy Online]]''. The reason for his condition was revealed in \"[[Yug Ylimaf]]\" where an accident with Stewie's time machine caused Brian and Stewie to witness him on his way to work hurrying past a grease truck that explodes, burning off his suit, and covering him in grease.\n* '''James William Bottomtooth III''' (voiced by [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]]) \u2013 A character who suffers from a severe underbite ([[Prognathism|Habsburg jaw]]), which has given him a comically oversized lower jaw and has made his speech impossible to understand due to his extreme [[Locust Valley lockjaw]] accent. He has a taste for brandy, which he pours into his lower jaw. He is part of the staff of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in \"[[Brian Goes Back to College]]\". In \"[[You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives]]\", he refuses to sign Brian's petition against Mayor Adam West's gay marriage ban because he is a devout Christian. He has a son named James William Bottomtooth IV who attends Morningwood Academy and bears a strong resemblance to his father (particularly the large lower jaw and speech). Like his classmates, he holds a strong antipathy for Chris, as seen in \"[[No Chris Left Behind]]\", until he finds out that Chris is the grandson of Carter Pewterschmidt, who also attended Morningwood. He is part of the mob that rushes the Griffin home in \"[[The Juice Is Loose]]\" to deal with [[O. J. Simpson|O.J. Simpson]]. In \"[[420 (Family Guy)|420]]\", he catches a bag of marijuana in his jaw. In \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\", he attends Quagmire's class on how to pick up women.\n* '''''[[Kool-Aid Man|Kool-Aid Guy]]''''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 The mascot for the popular drink ''[[Kool-Aid]]'', is parodied in several episodes. In \"[[Death Has a Shadow]]\" and \"[[Stewie Kills Lois]]\", when each family member exclaims \"Oh no!\" to the Judge's sentencing of Peter, the Kool-Aid Guy breaks through the courtroom wall yelling \"OH YEAH!\", then backs away awkwardly. In \"[[Peterotica]]\", he has an epiphany while sitting in his living room when a car crashes through his wall, which put him on the receiving end of the trademarked breaking wall for the first time. In \"[[Prick Up Your Ears (Family Guy)|Prick Up Your Ears]]\", after Stewie panics about the existence of the Tooth Fairy, Brian and Chris fail to calm Stewie, then Glenn Quagmire makes an attempt, then the Kool-Aid Guy is seen in a pair of boxing gloves at the back of a line of other characters. In \"[[The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair]]\", Evil Stewie lures him out by pretending to impersonate other people saying \"Oh no!\"; when he bursts through the wall, Evil Stewie shatters him with a baseball bat, and drinks up the spilled Kool-Aid. Thanks to Stewie's and Brian's interference, the Kool-Aid Guy misses his cue when they travel back to the events in \"Death Has a Shadow\" in \"[[Back to the Pilot]]\", when he shatters trying to back out of the courthouse. He is still able to yell at Stewie and Brian where he blamed them for messing things up. In \"[[Valentine's Day in Quahog]]\", the Kool-Aid Guy is with his parents when they meet his date in the form of an anthropomorphic [[Yoo-hoo]] bottle (much to his father's dismay). In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", the Kool-Aid Guy attempts to break through the wall during a trial between Peter and [[Homer Simpson]] in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. However, he calls Peter to apologize that he \"went to the wrong [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]]\" as he broke through the wall of the courthouse there. This references the fact that the state in which ''The Simpsons'' version of Springfield is located has never been revealed.\n* '''Phineas and Barnaby''' \u2013 Two [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]] that usually pursue two goals: working out at the Quahog Gym and riding high-wheel 'Penny Farthing' bicycles of the 1860s\u20131890s.\n* '''Tomik and Bellgarde''' (voiced by [[John Viener]] and Alec Sulkin) \u2013 Two foreign guys who have \"been living in the United States almost long enough to sound American\". They first appear in \"[[The Former Life of Brian]]\" sitting in a coffee shop discussing how much fun they had at a \"discotheque\" and reflecting that they had drunk \"so many liters of beer\". In \"[[Extra Large Medium]]\", they wonder how to celebrate Gerbitz Day, a holiday in their native country. In \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\", they participated in the musical number \"All I Really Want For Christmas\" where they revealed they do not know what Christmas is and that their home country has a similar holiday called \"Kishkev Fufleer\". They are alcoholics attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings Peter attends in \"[[Friends of Peter G.]]\" They do not share any stories, but participate in the performance of \"Mr. Booze\".\n* '''Vern and Johnny''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Two [[Vaudeville]] characters who appear in cutaways and are dressed in traditional turn-of-the-century outfits. Vern will often perform a line or two of a song and then, either because he is finished or because his act is not going well, he asks Johnny to \"play me off\", at which point Johnny enthusiastically plays \"[[Galloping Gertie]]\" on the piano. They debut in the episode \"[[Holy Crap]]\" and perform in the talent show in \"[[Deep Throats]]\". They appear in two small boats connected by a rope by Carter Pewterschmidt's racing yacht in \"[[Model Misbehavior]]\". In \"[[Saving Private Brian]]\", they are both shot to death by Stewie, who says \"They're dead, all right? We're not gonna be seeing them again\". This is later proven wrong in \"[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]\" when Vern is shown to be performing in the surface world as a ghost and Johnny is shown playing piano in Hell because he is later revealed to be a child molester.\n\n==Deaths==\nFive actors who voiced semi-regular ''Family Guy'' characters have died:\n\n* [[Phyllis Diller]] (d. 2012), who played Peter's mother, Thelma<ref>Diller's last episode was in season 6, episode 6, \"[[Padre de Familia]]\"</ref>\n* [[Charles Durning]] (d. 2012), who voiced his father, Francis, and who died after his character had already died in the series;<ref>Francis Griffin died in season 5, episode 10, \"[[Peter's Two Dads]]\", but then came back as a vision of Peter's in season 8, episode 2, \"[[Family Goy]]\"</ref>\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] (d. 2016), who played Angela, Peter's boss at the brewery;<ref>Fisher's last appearance was in season 15, episode 17, \"[[Peter's Lost Youth]]\"</ref>\n*[[Frank Sinatra Jr.]] (d. 2016), who appeared in three episodes as himself.<ref>Sinatra's last appearance was in season 15, episode 2, \"[[Bookie of the Year]]\"</ref>\n* [[Adam West]] (d. 2017), who voiced [[Mayor West|Mayor Adam West]].<ref>West's last appearance will be in the episode \"Peter Gets Fired\", scheduled to air in November 2017</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Family Guy}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Television|Animation|Comedy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Family Guy Charactes, List Of}}\n[[Category:Animated human characters]]\n[[Category:Family Guy characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television adult animation]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Family Guy'' characters}}\n[[File:Griffin family.png|thumb|267px|The [[Griffin family]].

For most of the series, Peter is shown as an obese, unintelligent, lazy, outspoken, childish, and eccentric alcoholic. He has several jobs, which have included working at the Happy Go Lucky Toy Factory, a fisherman, and currently as a shipping clerk at the Pawtucket Brewery. It is discovered that his legal first name is Justin, in the season 13 episode \"[[Quagmire's Mom]]\".\n\n===Lois Griffin===\n{{main|Lois Griffin}}\n\n'''Lois Patrice Griffin''' (n\u00e9e '''Pewterschmidt''') (voiced by [[Alex Borstein]]) is the matriarch of the Griffin household, Peter's wife, and the mother of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. She is a 43-year-old German-American housewife who cares deeply for her kids and her husband, while also working as a [[piano instructor]]. Lois is also very flirtatious and has slept with numerous people on the show.\n\n===Meg Griffin===\n{{main|Meg Griffin}}\n\n'''Margaret Winnifred \"Meg\" Griffin''' (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in season 1, [[Mila Kunis]] since season 2) is the Griffins' 18-year-old daughter and oldest child. She is a self-conscious, insecure, and sensitive teenager who is more often than not ridiculed and ignored by the people around her. Meg just wants to be another face in the crowd by fitting in with her peers and being accepted, but she often finds herself to be a victim of circumstance. She has had several love interests over the course of the series, including Brian Griffin, Mayor Adam West, Tom Tucker, Glenn Quagmire, and Joe Swanson.\n\n===Chris Griffin===\n{{main|Chris Griffin}}\n\n'''Christopher Cross \"Chris\" Griffin''' (voiced by [[Seth Green]]) is the Griffins' 14-year-old son and middle child. He is a friendly, laid-back, and funny teenager who is a younger version of Peter physically, but intellectually, he often shows more potential, as demonstrated from moments of coherence and articulation within his speech. Chris, can however, be scatterbrained and is easily confused, something Peter frequently takes for granted.\n\n===Stewie Griffin===\n{{main|Stewie Griffin}}\n\n'''Stewart Gilligan \"Stewie\" Griffin''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the Griffin's 1-year-old child, but often behaves in adult ways such as speaking in an upper-class British dialect. He is a [[Child prodigy|child genius]] who frequently aspired to murder his mother Lois and take over the world but has since mellowed out considerably. He turned 1 year old in \"[[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]],\" and has not aged past one year since.\n\n===Brian Griffin===\n{{main|Brian Griffin}}\n\n'''Brian H. Griffin''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the family's 8-year-old [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] talking white [[Labrador Retriever]] and the best friend of both Stewie and Peter. He and Stewie are often at the center of the show's most critically acclaimed episodes, most notably the \"''[[Road to... (Family Guy)|Road to...]]''\" episodes, where he and Stewie go on road-trips together. Brian is portrayed as an intellectual\u2014a [[Brown University]] attendee\u2014who often serves as the family's voice of reason, pointing out how ridiculous Peter's ideas are. He is not-so-secretly in love with Lois and is an unsuccessful, unemployed writer.\n\nBrian was not revealed to be an [[atheist]] until [[Family Guy (season 7)|season 7]]. In earlier seasons, he was shown to be very much a believer of [[God]] especially in \"[[If I'm Dyin', I'm Lyin']]\" in [[Family Guy (season 2)|season 2]]. How this change occurred in Brian is unknown.\n\nIn \"[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]\", Brian is hit by a car and dies from his injuries, with the family by his side. The family then decides to adopt a new streetwise dog with a [[New Jersey]]/[[Italian American]] way of speaking named Vinny. However, in \"[[Christmas Guy]]\" (two episodes later), Stewie still misses Brian, but finds a way to go back in time and successfully saves him, also meaning that the family never adopted Vinny. Though Stewie and Vinny did say their goodbyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/hes-back-brian-griffin-returns-to-family-guy|title=WATCH: Brian Griffin Returns to Family Guy|publisher=Mediaite|date=2013-12-15|accessdate=2014-07-21}}</ref>\n\n===Extended family===\n* '''Francis Griffin''' (voiced by [[Charles Durning]]) \u2013 Peter's grumpy and stubborn adoptive father, Lois's adoptive father-in-law, and the adoptive paternal grandfather of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. He was once married to Peter's biological mother Thelma Griffin. An obsessively devout 80-year-old Roman Catholic, he hates Lois because she is not a Catholic, and often calls her a \"Protestant whore\", disapproves of his son's family's lifestyle, and frequently attempts to force his religious views on them. To a lesser extent he disapproves of Lois due to her heritage, and is angry with Peter for not marrying an \"Irish rose\". When Peter and Lois got married, Francis taped the sign \"To a Protestant Whore\" underneath the \"Just Married\" sign on the limousine. Despite all of this, he truly did love and care for Peter, and showed on multiple occasions to care for his grandchildren. Francis used to have a job at a metal fabrication plant; after his short retirement, he became a bodyguard for the Pope. In the episode \"[[Peter's Two Dads]]\", Francis dies on Meg's 17th birthday when Peter gets drunk and tries to ride a [[unicycle]] down the stairs, but ends up falling off the stairs and landing on top of Francis.  \n* '''Mickey McFinnigan''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Peter's biological father, and the biological paternal grandfather of Meg, Chris, and Stewie, and father-in-law of Lois. He is an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[alcoholism|drunk]]. He reprises a major role in \"Peter's Two Dads\", when Peter visits him in [[Ireland]]. Mickey mocks Peter at first and bullies him, but Peter challenges him to a drinking contest and wins. Finally, Mickey accepts Peter into his family and spoils him ever after by buying Guinness and more.\n* '''Thelma Griffin''' (voiced by [[Florence Stanley]] in the first appearance, [[Phyllis Diller]] in later appearances, [[Alex Borstein]] as a young woman in \"Don't Be a Dickens at Christmas\") \u2013 Ex-wife to Francis, mother of Peter, and paternal grandmother of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. She is the mother-in-law of Lois. She first appears in \"[[Holy Crap]]\". She is 82 years old as stated in the episode \"[[Mother Tucker]]\", has gray hair and noticeable wrinkles below her eyes, and wears purple earrings and a purple bead necklace. She also wears glasses like her son and husband and is a heavy smoker. Unlike Francis, she is generally friendly and personable, and gets along well with Lois. Before Francis' death, she divorced him because she had \"needs he didn't fill\" and dated Tom Tucker for a while in \"[[Mother Tucker]]\". She often appears with news inconvenient or troubling to Peter and his family. Her brief partnership with Peter's biological father, Irishman Mickey McFinnegan, is only established in the episode \"[[Peter's Two Dads]]\". In the episode \"[[Grumpy Old Man]]\", it is revealed that Thelma was sent to a retirement home. In the Season 12 episode \"[[Mom's the Word]]\", it is revealed that Thelma died from a stroke. Thelma's death was written into the series because of Phyllis Diller's death in August 2012.\n* '''Karen \"Heavy Flo\" Griffin''' (voiced by [[Kate McKinnon]]) \u2013 Peter's older sister who first appears in \"[[Peter's Sister]].\" She is the paternal aunt of Meg, Chris and Stewie and sister-in-law of Lois. Karen is a professional wrestler and is shown as the reason Peter bullies Meg where he was picked on by Karen. During her fight with Peter in the ring, Karen was knocked out by Meg using a real folding chair instead of a fake folding chair which puts her in a coma. At the end of the episode, Peter gets a phone call from the doctor where he is told that Karen is not in fact fine and needs an immediate blood transfusion. Peter states to the doctor that he doesn't want to check to see if he is the same blood type as Karen and decides to leave Karen to her own devices leading the family members to look at him with concern, but not say or do anything as the episode ends. \n* {{anchor|Carter Pewterschmidt}}'''Carter Pewterschmidt''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Lois's father, Babs's husband, and the maternal grandfather of Meg, Chris, and Stewie, and father-in-law of Peter. He is a 70-year-old billionaire industrialist, shipping mogul, and owner of several major companies. He is based on [[Harve Presnell]] character Wade Gustafson in ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} His company in the episode \"[[Business Guy]]\" is named Pewterschmidt Industries, and he is also a member of a fancy yacht club, where he mingles with other superwealthy people. He is a hard worker, and has been shown to have become temporarily senile as a result of forced retirement in \"[[Grumpy Old Man]]\". Carter is a domineering, devious and manipulative individual who despises his son-in-law, Peter, whom he often insults, badmouths and seeks to humiliate. On rare occasions, he and Peter work together, normally with a common goal. He is married to Barbara, with whom he had three children \u2013 Lois, Carol, and Patrick. In \"[[No Chris Left Behind]]\" and \"[[Fresh Heir]]\", he is shown to have a strong relationship with Chris. It is revealed in \"[[Welcome Back, Carter]]\" that he was an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] officer. He is shown to be a womanizer with a fetish for Asian women, having had affairs in \"[[Welcome Back, Carter]]\" and \"[[Carter and Tricia]]\", and hiring an Asian prostitute in \"[[Stewie Kills Lois]]\". Babs left Carter once, but, with persuasion from Peter, he entered the dating scene, but he eventually convinced Babs to take him back. In \"[[Screwed the Pooch]]\", it is implied that Carter had an affair with an African-American woman, resulting in a [[biracial]] son as mentioned by Lois. In ''[[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy]]'', Carter plays both [[Owen Lars]] and [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]]. In the episode \"[[The Old Man and the Big C]]\", it is revealed that Carter's parents were not around much and he was primarily raised by a maid named Mamie. It is shown that Carter really cares about Mamie, as he worriedly defends her health when Lois asks what he would do if Mamie were to hypothetically get cancer, indicating Carter would be devastated if she were to fall ill.\n* {{anchor|Barbara Pewterschmidt}}'''Babs Pewterschmidt''' (voiced by [[Alex Borstein]]) \u2013 Carter's wife, the mother of Lois, Carol, and Patrick, and the maternal grandmother of Meg, Chris and Stewie, and mother-in-law to Peter. It is noted on a few occasions Barbara only married Carter for his wealth and family heritage. She is demeaning but more polite to Peter than her husband is. In appearance, she is basically an older version of Lois. In the episode \"[[The Fat Guy Strangler]]\", it is revealed that she had an affair with [[Jackie Gleason]] which traumatized Patrick. In \"[[Family Goy]]\", it is revealed she is [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]], and a survivor of the [[Holocaust]]. She only changed her religion so she and Carter could gain access to country clubs. It is also revealed in that episode that her maiden name was Hebrewbergmoneygrabber, which was changed to Hebrewberg to escape Nazi persecution. In the episode \"[[Running Mates (Family Guy)|Running Mates]]\", she is described as passive aggressive. Barbara Pewterschmidt is also the ex-wife of billionaire [[Ted Turner]]. She left Carter in \"[[Welcome Back Carter]]\" after learning he had an affair. However, she does eventually forgive him after deeming herself too old to remarry. In \"[[Family Guy (season 16)|Don't Be a Dickens at Christmas]]\", most of Pewterschimdt family are fluent in [[German language|German]], but Lois is not, and Stewie understands it, but cannot speak it.\n* {{anchor|Carol Pewterschmidt}}'''Carol Pewterschmidt-West''' (voiced by [[Carol Kane]] in the first appearance, [[Julie Hagerty]] in later appearances) \u2013 Lois' younger sister and the maternal aunt of Meg, Chris and Stewie, and sister-in-law of Peter. She has been married and divorced nine times where her previous last names have included Johnson, Carrington, Stone, O'Craggedy, Consago, Steinhols, Washington, Proudfoot and Thong. In \"[[Emission Impossible]]\", Peter and Lois had to stay with her when she ended up pregnant. The baby, a boy, is born in the episode yet never seen again. In \"[[Brothers & Sisters (Family Guy)|Brothers & Sisters]]\", Carol moved in with Peter and Lois after her latest divorce where she ended up meeting Mayor Adam West. Her previous husbands include Evan Johnson (who bonded with Peter over the [[Boston Red Sox]] baseball team), Randall Carrington (who is always bringing people very unusual and inconvenient gifts), and [[Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy|Doggie Daddy]] (it was mentioned that Augie caused a strain in their relationship). She gets married to Adam West since the \"[[Thanksgiving (Family Guy)|Thanksgiving]]\" episode until his death.\n* {{anchor|Patrick Pewterschmidt}}'''Patrick Pewterschmidt''' (voiced by [[Robert Downey Jr.]] in the first appearance, [[Oliver Vaquer]] in the second appearance) \u2013 The older brother of Lois and Carol and the maternal uncle of Meg, Chris, and Stewie, and Peter's brother-in-law. He has been kept hidden by her mother and father. He first appeared in the episode \"[[The Fat Guy Strangler]]\". When a picture of Lois's family was broken, she noticed a folded-in part of the picture included a brother she did not know she had. She then broke into her parents' house and found out where he lived. Then she and the family drove to the address which was found to be a mental institution. When there seemed to be nothing wrong with him they decided to check him out and take him in. Later it is discovered that he has an imaginary wife named Marian and, more importantly, that he had a hatred of overweight people due to a bad experience from his childhood (witnessing comedian [[Jackie Gleason]] having a sexual encounter with his mother). At the same time, there is a rash of killings in the neighborhood of fat men, and Patrick is strongly suggested to be this \"Fat Guy Strangler\". After denying it, Lois finally decides she must take him back, after he tries to strangle Peter to death. Patrick appeared in the [[Family Guy (season 10)|season 10]] episode \"[[Killer Queen (Family Guy)|Killer Queen]]\", in which he helped Peter and Joe after he is released from the mental institution by Charles Yamamoto as part of his revenge plot on Chris which involved framing Patrick. After Charles dies from having the cover of the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] album ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' shown to him by Stewie, Patrick identifies Charles as the one who let him out of the mental institution. Patrick manages to slip away after that with Peter having to injure Joe to make it look like a struggle.\n* {{anchor|Jasper}}'''Jasper''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Brian's stereotypical flamboyantly [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] cousin. Brian stays with him in Hollywood in \"[[Brian Does Hollywood]]\". Jasper marries a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] named Ricardo, in \"[[You May Now Kiss the... Uh... Guy Who Receives]]\". Jasper also makes a short appearance in \"[[E. Peterbus Unum]]\" during a flashback of Peter getting something the family does not need (in this case, a new dog\u2014one that looks like a flamboyantly gay version of Brian). He also appeared in \"[[Brian's Play]]\", when he was seen chatting to Brian through a webcam. His most recent appearance (along with Ricardo) was at Brian's funeral in \"[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]\".\n* {{anchor|Bertram}}'''Bertram''' (voiced by [[Wallace Shawn]]) \u2013 The son of a gym teacher and her partner through [[artificial insemination]]. Bertram's biological father is Peter Griffin. Bertram appears in \"[[Emission Impossible]]\", \"[[Sibling Rivalry (Family Guy)|Sibling Rivalry]]\" and \"[[The Big Bang Theory (Family Guy)|The Big Bang Theory]]\". In \"[[Emission Impossible]]\", Bertram is a sperm inside Peter's testicles. He enters combat with Stewie Griffin in order to prevent his destruction, as Stewie wishes to remain the baby of the family. The two became frenemies, and Stewie spares Bertram. In \"[[Sibling Rivalry (Family Guy)|Sibling Rivalry]]\", it is revealed that a mishap prior to Peter receiving a vasectomy caused Bertram to be part of a sperm donation used to impregnate a female gym teacher's partner. After he is born, he begins playing at the same park as Stewie, and the two fight over who will rule the playground. Stewie eventually disarms Bertram, who admits defeat and runs away. Bertram appears again in \"[[The Big Bang Theory (Family Guy)|The Big Bang Theory]]\", in which he tries to erase Stewie from existence by killing [[Leonardo da Vinci]], one of Stewie's ancestors. Although he kills da Vinci, he is killed in turn by Stewie who manages to maintain the timeline and save the universe. Bertram appears as the main antagonist in ''[[Family Guy Video Game!]]''. An alternate reality version of Bertram is the main antagonist in the video game ''[[Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse]]''.\n* '''Dylan Flannigan''' (voiced by Seth Green) \u2013 Brian's human son. He first appears in \"[[The Former Life of Brian]]\". His mother Tracy was devastated when Brian left her. After Brian apologizes to Dylan for not being there for him, Brian turns his son's life around, making him into a charming, polite young man. Dylan then decides to leave the Griffin house and change his mother like Brian changed him. In \"[[Brian's a Bad Father]]\", Dylan returns as the star of a [[Disney Channel]] show.\n* '''Biscuit''' \u2013 Brian's deceased mother who appears in a flashback of \"[[Road to Rhode Island]]\".

He has a particular interest in Chris; in the episode \"[[Play It Again, Brian]]\", Chris finally realizes this and asks Herbert, \"Are you a pedophile?\", to no onscreen answer. Also, in \"[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]\", Stewie refers to a \"pedophile who lives down the street\" about which nobody is taking any action \"because he's so funny\", clearly talking about Herbert. He has a dog named Jesse, who is also very old and is unable to use his hind legs. He has a high-pitched, very soft effeminate voice and pronounces [[sibilant consonant]]s with a high-pitched whistle. Herbert is often seen wearing a light blue robe and slippers, walks with a [[Walker (mobility)|walker]] and frequently makes inappropriate, sexually tinged comments to teenage boys (in \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\", Herbert wants a [[The Little Drummer Boy|little drummer boy]] for Christmas, while staring at a poster of [[Nick Jonas]]).

He is shown on a number of occasions to be unnecessarily competitive, most notably while playing friendly games of baseball, bowling, and golf. In \u201d[[FOX-y Lady]]\u201c, Quagmire reveals that he is 61, and he maintains his youthful look by consuming lots of carrots.\n* '''Crystal Quagmire''' (voiced by [[Alex Borstein]] in \"[[Fore, Father]]\", [[Allison Janney]] in \"[[Quagmire's Mom]]\") \u2013 The mother of Glenn and Brenda Quagmire and the ex-wife of Dan. Her first appearance was in \"Fore Father\" where she is seen in a flashback breastfeeding Glenn. When facing prison time for statutory rape in \"Quagmire's Mom\", Quagmire places the blame for his behavior on living with his sexually promiscuous mom during his trial where her actions are seen during a flashback sequence. She arrives at his trial where a lot of the generic men attending the trial recognize her as noted by Mayor Adam West. Crystal admits her faults, but claims to have found religion and asks that he be released to her custody. The judge presiding over the trial rejects her request and sentences Quagmire to twenty years in prison. She tries to get him to find solace in God as well, but he rejects her words. Stewie even asked Crystal if she is aware of what Dan has been through. Just before he enters the prison, the judge arrives and announces that he has commuted Quagmire's sentence, thanks to his mother's \"talents\" and that new DNA evidence has turned up. He is surprised that despite her new religious life, she would do such a thing, but she admits that she would do anything to help him.\n* '''Dan Quagmire'''/'''Ida Davis'''<ref name=\"S10E10\">Meg and Quagmire</ref> (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 The father of Glenn and Brenda Quagmire and the ex-husband of Crystal Quagmire. Dan was a war hero in the [[Vietnam War]]. He was thought to be a homosexual by Peter.

Following the operation, she takes the name Ida Davis.<ref name=\"S10E10\" /> In \"Quagmire's Mom\", Stewie asks Crystal if she knows what her ex-husband has gone through.\n* '''Brenda Quagmire''' (voiced by [[Alex Borstein]] in \"Jerome Is the New Black\", [[Kaitlin Olson]] in \"Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q\") \u2013 The sister of Glenn Quagmire and the daughter of Dan and Crystal, who used to be in an abusive relationship.\n* '''Courtney Quagmire'''<ref>No Giggity, No Doubt</ref> (voiced by [[Mandy Moore]]) \u2013 The biological daughter of Glenn Quagmire as revealed in the episode \"No Giggity, No Doubt.\"\n\n===Brown/Tubbs family===\n* '''[[Cleveland Brown]]''' (voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]]) \u2013 Peter's mild-mannered friend who formerly owned and ran a [[delicatessen|deli]]. He is a heavyset, mustached, 46-year-old African-American male who is very polite to everyone and has a unique laugh. He is the father of Cleveland Jr. A running gag in the series is the front of his house being damaged, usually as a result of one of Peter's shenanigans, while Cleveland is in the upstairs bathtub. The tub always falls into the front yard with Cleveland exclaiming, \"No, no, no, no, no, no!!!\" Following his departure from Quahog, the character became the star of his own [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off series]] ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' during which he lived in Stoolbend, Virginia. In \"[[He's Bla-ack!]]\", Cleveland brings his family along when he moves back to Quahog ever since ''The Cleveland Show'' had stopped production.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Jodi|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/10/24/family-guy-cleveland-returns|title='Family Guy': Details on Cleveland's return|publisher=Insidetv.ew.com|date=2013-10-24|accessdate=2014-07-21}}</ref> In \"[[Take a Letter (Family Guy)|Take a Letter]],\" Cleveland obtains a job as a [[postal worker]] at Quahog's branch of the [[United States Postal Service]].

Performing Loretta's gravely voice was very demanding on Alex Borstein, and early in the show, Loretta had very few lines, the bulk of which were \"Mm-hmm!\" She treats Cleveland harshly, and cheats on him with, among others, Glenn Quagmire, leading the Browns to divorce. In the episode \"[[Love, Blactually]]\", it is revealed that Loretta has regretted her actions and wants Cleveland back, but he refuses her advances. Cleveland informs her he needs to move on, and advises her to do the same. She takes Cleveland's house in the divorce and puts it up for sale, yet is still apparently living there some months later. In ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' episode \"Gone with the Wind\", Loretta dies at the age of 44 in an accident when Peter drops a [[Brontosaurus]] skeleton (which Brian had dug up from the Griffin family's yard) on her house and she goes through the same bathtub gag that Cleveland went through which she does not survive.

It is also revealed in this episode that, according to Peter Griffin, she had also cheated on Cleveland with Mayor Adam West, Ollie Williams, [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]], and the Greased-Up Deaf Guy. \n* '''[[Cleveland Brown Jr.]]''' (voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] in earlier appearances, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in \"The Cleveland Show\" and later appearances) \u2013 The 14-year-old son of [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] and [[#Loretta Brown|Loretta Brown]]. In his appearances on ''Family Guy'', he is slim, [[Hyperactivity|hyperactive]] and has an apparent knack for golf. However, starting with the first episode of ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', he is somewhat older and both obese and somewhat [[Lethargy|lethargic]]; the reason for this sudden weight gain is never explained until the episode Season 4 episode \"A Rodent Like This\" where Cleveland Jr. is really an agent that appears to have killed the slimmer Cleveland Jr. from ''Family Guy'' and took his place as Cleveland's son. Also, it is revealed that he has lost his faith in God because of the affair his mother had with Quagmire that led to his parents' divorce. When Cleveland became engaged to Donna, Cleveland Brown Jr. became the stepbrother of Roberta and Rallo. As of \"[[He's Bla-ack!]]\", Junior has moved back to Quahog along with Cleveland and the rest of the family and has become an infrequently-appearing member of the ''Family Guy'' cast, retaining his appearance from ''The Cleveland Show''.\n* '''Donna Tubbs-Brown''' (voiced by [[Sanaa Lathan]]) \u2013 Cleveland's second and current wife and one of the main characters of ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.

He is a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]] 42-year-old police officer who suffers from [[impotence]] and [[Fecal incontinence|incontinence]]. Joe still proves to be an extremely skilled police officer, as he is constantly seen pursuing criminals or rescuing victims with the aid of his wheelchair and even goes so far as to abandon his wheelchair to complete his work. In \"[[A Hero Sits Next Door]]\", Joe mentioned that he was crippled stopping [[Grinch|the Grinch]] from stealing Christmas from an orphanage. He is usually shown as being very tactful, but he also has severe anger issues (In \"[[Road to Rupert]]\", for example, he overreacts when Peter makes it difficult for him to revoke his driving license.) He is married to Bonnie Swanson, who was once pregnant for many years. They have a son named Kevin who staged his own death in Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2011/10/fox-november-sweeps-press-release.html |title=FOX November Sweeps \u2013 Press Release &#124; Spoilers |website=SpoilerTV.com |date=2011-10-17 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}</ref> He also has an infant daughter, Susie.

After missing several times, he shoots himself. In \"Ocean's Three and a Half\", she finally gives birth to a daughter named Susie at the age of 42. In \"[[The Hand That Rocks The Wheelchair]]\", Bonnie is arrested after Meg plants a gun in her purse due to Meg's infatuation with Joe, which she acquires when Bonnie asks her to look after Joe while she is out of town. She is later released from police custody. In \"[[Foreign Affairs (Family Guy)|Foreign Affairs]]\", Bonnie goes to Paris with Lois in the hopes of having an affair after feeling neglected by Joe. She nearly leaves Joe for a French man, also in a wheelchair, named Fran\u00e7ois. After intervention from Lois, Joe comes to Paris and apologizes for neglecting her before proving his love by walking (although it is actually Quagmire walking while tied to Joe's back). Bonnie reunites with Joe and they return to Quahog. In the [[Family Guy (season 10)|season ten]] episode \"[[Internal Affairs (Family Guy)|Internal Affairs]]\", it is shown that Bonnie was once a [[stripper]] at The Fuzzy Clam where she first met Joe.

In \"[[Thanksgiving (Family Guy)|Thanksgiving]]\", Kevin returns and tells them a story that he was in a coma following a bomb that had been placed inside a turkey during [[Thanksgiving]] years before and faked his own death in order to leave the war and return home. However even upon the episode of his return to the series, Kevin's appearances remain occasional and somewhat less frequent than his baby sister Susie, even though he continues to live under his parents' roof. In \"[[Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]\", it was mentioned that Bonnie stopped Kevin's suicide attempt. In \"[[Joe's Revenge]]\", it is revealed that Kevin shares a room with Susie as they get to know each other. In \"[[Turkey Guys]]\", it is revealed that Kevin is dating a [[Dwarfism|little person]].\n* {{anchor|Susan \"Susie\" Swanson}}'''Susie Swanson''' \u2013 Joe and Bonnie's infant daughter who was born in the episode \"[[Ocean's Three and a Half]]\". Upon first meeting her, Stewie develops a crush on the newborn Susie and is seen practicing guitar to write a song about her and later shows Brian a music video he made of the song \"[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]\" by [[Bryan Adams]]. In the episode \"[[Stew-Roids]]\", it is shown that Susie is strong enough to beat up Stewie. In \"Joe's Revenge\", it is revealed that Susie and Kevin share a room as they get to know each other. Although Susie has not yet spoken, the voice of her inner monologues are provided by [[Patrick Stewart]].\n* {{anchor|Bud Swanson}}'''Bud Swanson''' (voiced by [[Ed O'Neill]]) \u2013 Joe's father, and Kevin and Susie's grandfather, whose first and only appearance so far was in \"[[Papa Has a Rollin' Son]]\". Joe was initially estranged from Bud because of Bud's intolerance towards handicapped people and his fear that it would happen to him, Joe, or anyone else he loved (though he was unaware of Joe's paraplegic state when they reconnected). After putting up with Peter passing off as him, Joe tells his father to confront his fears and the two reconcile with Bud having accepted Joe's paraplegic state.\n\n===Goldman family===\n* {{anchor|Mort Goldman}}'''Mort Goldman''' (voiced by [[Johnny Brennan|John Brennan]]) \u2013 A Jewish [[pharmacist]] of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish descent]], and one of Peter's friends.

Mort frequently discusses his various maladies and childhood bullying in casual conversations. Although he first appeared one season after his son Neil, Mort became a major supporting character, especially during the period when Cleveland Brown was absent doing ''The Cleveland Show'' &ndash; when Cleveland returns to ''Family Guy'', he interrupts the opening title song sequence to take Mort's place in the line-up of male characters on the left side of the stairs. Mort bowled a [[Perfect game (bowling)|perfect game]] in the episode \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\". Mort plays a [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawa]] in the \"[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]\" episode, and [[Lando Calrissian]] in the \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\" and \"[[It's a Trap!]]\" episodes.

He is the editor of the school's newspaper, is a member of the A/V Club, and works at his father's pharmacy where he is employee of the month, according to ''[[Family Guy Online]]''. He is more confident than his father, so much so that he does not seem to realize that he is highly considered an annoyance amongst his peers. He also has crush on Meg, but she, too, finds him annoying. At one point in the series, however, Neil and Meg become interns at the local news station, Channel 5, and they share a kiss. Neil speaks with a [[lateral lisp]], but in \"[[The Story on Page One]]\", when he removes his [[Retainer (orthodontics)|retainer]] he speaks with a deep, smooth bass voice (provided by Seth MacFarlane). \n* {{anchor|Muriel Goldman}}'''Muriel Goldman''' (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]) \u2013 Mort's wife and Neil's mother, whose physical appearance is very similar to her husband's. She met Mort via a video dating service, and they had their first kiss at age of fourteen while both of them were suffering from a cold. Later in her life, one of recreations of herself and Mort was watching old films along with the album ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' to find if any of them synchronized. She was murdered in the Season 9 premiere \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\" where she was stabbed in the back by Diane Simmons. It is also revealed in that episode that she provided James Woods with multiple prescriptions for [[Oxycontin]].

He was also an actor before moving to Quahog; he was in ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]''. Tom tends to insult everybody around him, particularly former co-anchor Diane Simmons. He disliked her and frequently traded insults with her on-air. His family includes his first wife, Stacy; his second wife, Sarah; and a son from his first marriage named Jake, whose face is upside down. He is shown to be protective of his son and dislikes people's use of the term \"freak\". MacFarlane stated that Tucker's voice is the easiest to do for him, and he was \"sort of modeled after the cigarette spokesmen from the 1940s commercials\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/429/429628p10.html|title=Interview with Seth MacFarlane|work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref> Tom hardly speaks in completely normal sentences, instead using his news anchor voice in regular conversation (e.g. \"Back to you, [character]\"). In \"The Kiss Seen Around the World\", Meg Griffin developed a crush on him until he showed his true colors by saying he does not care if Neil Goldman died, then yelled at Tom by saying he only cared about his ratings. In the episode \"Mother Tucker\", Tom has a brief relationship with Peter Griffin's mother, Thelma Griffin, where he became a father figure to a childish Peter. In the episode \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", Simmons killed Muriel Goldman and Derek Wilcox, James Woods, as well as Woods' then girlfriend leaving evidence to frame Tucker.

In \"[[Patriot Games (Family Guy)|Patriot Games]]\", it was revealed that she was the widow of an unnamed man who committed suicide after Tom Tucker asked, \"Diane, didn't your first husband blow his brains out?\" In the season 9 premiere \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", it was mentioned that she used to date James Woods until he broke up with her around the same time when Tom Tucker tried to replace her. Diane reveals that she worked with Tom for 15 years. This caused her to plan revenge on both men with James Woods ending up murdered and leaving evidence that Tom Tucker murdered Muriel Goldman, Derek Wilcox, James Woods' girlfriend Priscilla and Quagmire's then-girlfriend Stephanie. Lois put the pieces together, only to come face to face with Diane, who took Lois to the edge of a cliff, where she intended to kill her. However, Diane is shot and killed with a sniper rifle fired by Stewie.

When Lois confides in her over drinks that she was in a porn film, Joyce announces it on the news the next day causing most of Quahog to loathe Lois. Also, it is revealed that in order to have a name that would work on television she changed her last name from Chevapravatdumrong (the last name of the [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong|series' co-producer]]) to Kinney.

He speaks with a strong Spanish accent and is described as an \"effeminate weirdo\" by his employees. He disapproves of nearly all of Peter's actions, mainly because most of them are detrimental to the company, and fires or comes close to firing Peter on multiple occasions. In \"[[Mr. Saturday Knight]]\", he is invited to the Griffins' house for dinner. He promotes Peter to head of toy development and minutes later chokes to death on a dinner roll after it was Heimlich maneuvered out of Brian's throat and into Mr. Weed's mouth. His video [[Will (law)|will]] describes how the factory will be replaced by a children's hospital starting \"now\" as the machinery promptly endangers everyone at the factory. His great-grandfather's surname was [[cynodon dactylon|\"Bermudagrass\"]] but was changed to Weed at [[Ellis Island]].

In \"[[Peter-assment]]\", Angela targets Peter with sexual lust after Peter comes to work without wearing his glasses (which were broken at the time). After Peter refused to have sex with her and cheat on Lois, she tried to gas herself in her car. After Peter rescued her, it was revealed that she has not dated anyone in ten years. Feeling sorry for her, Peter disguised himself as a stereotypical 1920s New York billionaire and had sex with her. Angela knew it was really Peter, but what she did not know was that Peter, as a means of remaining faithful to Lois, hid Mort Goldman (who did it for $2) in his pants so it was Mort who actually had sex with her, not Peter. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Angela attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale. Following Carrie Fisher's unexpected death on December 27, 2016, Seth MacFarlane revealed that Angela would appear on at least two more episodes that Fisher had already done voiceover work on in Season 15, but would not comment on the character's future except by saying that \"Family Guy will miss [Fisher] immensely.\"<ref>http://ew.com/tv/2016/12/28/carrie-fisher-family-guy/</ref> Her final appearance was during the sixteenth-season episode \"Don't Be A Dickens At Christmas\" aired on December 10, 2017.

He sometimes tells Peter to stick his finger in his mouth, only to bite it. He wears two different shoes on each foot. He once went for a haircut that went horribly awry. No-one other than Angela seems to understand what he is saying. However, Peter has been shown to understand him in some instances such as when he gets fired. In \"[[Whistle While Your Wife Works]]\", Opie was forced to watch Peter and Lois have sex in his office at the brewery. In \"[[Blue Harvest]]\", he played a Tusken Raider. In \"[[New Kidney in Town]]\", Peter sends him a shoutout on The Price is Right.

In \"Underage Peter,\" it is revealed that Opie is not disabled, but rather he spoke gibberish due to being constantly under the influence of alcohol.\n* {{anchor|Fouad}}'''Fouad''' (voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]]) \u2013 One of Peter Griffin's co-workers at the Pawtucket Brewery. He is a recent immigrant to the United States, apparently of [[Arab]] ethnicity. In all his appearances, he has demonstrated that he is extremely earnest in his attempts to learn a Western sense of humor and understand its subtleties, such as the nature of a sarcastic or ironic comment. He laughs in a loud manner at sarcastic or ironic statements before explaining why the joke was funny (for example, \"Ahh! Is funny because...\"). Peter does not seem to have a strong relationship with Fouad, likely due to his comparatively short time employed at the Pawtucket Brewery, however Peter gets along much better with Fouad than he does with Opie or Angela. Fouad first appears in \"[[Chick Cancer]]\", being introduced by Peter as that foreign guy at work who helped him understand sarcasm. In \"[[Blue Harvest]]\", Fouad plays Lieutenant Shann Childsen on the [[Death Star]] prison deck, who laughs when [[Chewbacca]] (played by Brian) asks for a cell by the pool, stating that it is funny because prisons do not have luxury areas such as swimming pools. In \"[[Padre de Familia]]\", Peter suspects that Fouad may be an illegal immigrant and is angered because of it. Fouad's voice is also heard off-camera in a DVD exclusive scene in \"Three Kings\". In \"[[The Shawshank Redemption]]\" segment, Captain Byron Hadley (played by Seamus) yells for lights out calling the inmates \"ladies\" and Fouad replies that it is funny because they are men.\n* {{anchor|Stella}}'''Stella''' (voiced by [[Marlee Matlin]]) \u2013 A deaf worker at the Pawtucket Brewery.

He was revealed to be Jewish in \"[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]\". In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Principal Shepherd attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale where he was placed next to [[Principal Skinner]]. In \"[[The Peter Principal]]\", Principal Shepherd had a bitter divorce and suffers a breakdown causing the board of education to put him on an indefinite paid leave. As Vice-Principal Brenda McGuire was found dead in her car, the board of education asks for someone to come forward to be the interim principal until a permanent replacement for Principal Shepherd can be found. When Lois anonymously tipped off the board of education about how Peter was helping Meg and her friends on their revenge on the mean students, the board of education intervenes causing them to fire him and reinstate Principal Shepherd after he recovered from his divorce following his sex trip to Thailand. In \"[[Crimes and Meg's Demeanor]]\", Principal Shepherd is revealed to have the first name with John and lives in an apartment building across from the building that is managed by Lou Spinazola. After a confrontation with Stewie and Brian over what appeared to have been him killing his ex-wife Fiona which ended with Brian falling out of the window, Principal Shepherd admitted to the police and the medic about him living off food taken from the school to make ends meet when the police find the bag that supposedly leaked blood.\n* '''Mr. Berler''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Mr. Berler is one of Meg's teachers at James Woods Regional High School.

Connie is a beautiful yet narcissistic and mean-spirited girl who tends to look down on those who are either socially inept or unpopular and encourages the other popular students who she is friends with to bully them, with Meg being an object of favoritism to this abuse. She is most often seen with her closest friends: Gina, Scott, and Doug. While a [[bully]] to most students lacking popularity and confidence, Connie does have a softer side; in \"[[Stew-Roids]]\" &ndash; Connie begs Meg for help after she realizes what it is like to be shunned and ridiculed by her classmates. In the same episode, she fell in love with (and dated) Chris when she realized how nice and kind he can be. In \"[[Let's Go to the Hop]]\", she dances with Peter when he went undercover as \"[[Lando Calrissian|Lando Griffin]]\" at the [[Winter Formal|Winter Snowball dance]]. \n* '''Gina''' (voiced by [[Alex Borstein]] in earlier appearances, [[Camille Guaty]] in later appearances, [[Nina Dobrev]] in \"[[Trading Places (Family Guy)|Trading Places]]\") \u2013 A popular student and cheerleader at James Woods Regional High School who is Connie D'Amico's best friend.\n* '''Esther''' (voiced by [[Tamera Mowry]] in \"[[Barely Legal (Family Guy)|Barely Legal]]\" and \"[[Peter's Daughter]]\", [[Christina Milian]] in later episodes) \u2013 An African-American girl who is one of Meg's friends.\n* '''Patty''' (voiced by [[Alexandra Breckenridge]] in \"[[Barely Legal (Family Guy)|Barely Legal]]\", Barclay DeVeau in \"[[Halloween on Spooner Street]]\", [[Martha MacIsaac]] in later episodes) \u2013 A redheaded girl who is one of Meg's friends.

In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Mayor Adam West attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Beer where he was sitting next to [[Mayor Quimby|Mayor Joe Quimby]]. In \"Adam West High\", Mayor Adam West has passed away as Brian persuades Principal Shepherd to rename his high school after him.\n* {{anchor|Bruce}}'''Bruce''' (voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]]) \u2013 A mustached man who speaks effeminately in a calm, drawn-out voice with a slight lisp, as well as occasionally smacking his lips before a sentence. Though he was not given a name until the episode \"[[No Chris Left Behind]]\", he has appeared in several episodes without being named on-screen; however, he is referred to in commentary tracks prior to that episode as \"the Performance Artist\". He even comments on it the first time his name is spoken in the series. He has several catchphrases, the most notable being \"Oh, no!\". He first appeared as the clerk of an \"exotic entertainment\" shop in the Season 1 episode \"[[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]]\", and was then seen sitting astride an obese donkey at the [[Renaissance fair]] when Peter fought the [[Black Knight (Arthurian legend)|Black Knight]]. He has since been seen with a variety of jobs including a deacon, a therapist, a medium, a lawyer, a masseur and a barman. More recently, he was seen working at the bowling alley selling rental shoes as seen in \"The Splended Source\", refereeing the boxing match where Lois fought Deirdre Jackson in \"Baby, You Knock Me Out\", and working at Quahog Laser Tag in \"Forget-Me-Not\". He has also been seen training to be a police officer, teaching a CPR course, chairing the Quahog [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings and entertaining children at the Quahog Library. He is a member of the school board committee of James Woods Regional High School. Although Bruce himself is generally limited to occasional appearances, his voice is lent to a number of anthropomorphic creatures including a large bee, the shark in a parody of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorph]] from a parody of ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', a [[Tetris]] block, and a giant mutant [[rat]]. In \"[[Blue Harvest]]\", he played the role of Greedo. He makes an appearance as Admiral Piett on the Imperial [[Super Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] in the episode \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\". Bruce often talks to his roommate Jeffrey. It is implied that Bruce is gay and that Jeffrey is his domestic partner, as in \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\" where he states in the song \"All I Want for Christmas\" that he wants a wedding ring from a guy named Jeffrey. In the episode \"BFFs\" of ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', Peter says that Bruce was his therapist and referred to him as \"that gay guy who has, like, a thousand jobs\". Another character voiced by Mike Henry who was heavily implied to be Jeffrey appeared in both the ''Family Guy'' episodes \"[[Friends of Peter G.]]\" and \"[[Finders Keepers (Family Guy)|Finders Keepers]]\", and ''The Cleveland Show'' episode \"[[Die Semi-Hard]]\" before being confirmed to be Jeffrey in \"[[Underage Peter]].\" Bruce is also noted for his tendency to give unsolicited advice about mundane subjects, often during critical events. This occurs most notably during his training as a 911 operator. When a victim calls to report a man in her home, he provides tips for being a good host to unexpected guests. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Bruce attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale where he was sitting next to [[Waylon Smithers]].\n* '''Carl''' (voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) \u2013 The manager of the local [[gas station]] and convenience store called the ''Quahog Mini Mart''. He speaks in a calm, monotone voice and shows almost no emotion regarding anything happening around him. Carl is a [[cinephile]], having an obsession with films and attractive actresses. In \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\", he wants a [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] of ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' for Christmas. He goes out of his way to discuss exciting movies. He becomes friends with Chris, when Chris worked for him in \"[[Movin' Out (Brian's Song)]]\". Their friendship is based on their mutual interest in movies. He does not get along well with Meg, although he did once hire her to work in the store. In \"[[Friends of Peter G.]]\", it is revealed that the reason that he knows so much about movies is because he is an alcoholic and he spent so much time in his house and watched every film he could get his hands on. In the ''[[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy|Star Wars]]'' episodes, Carl plays [[Yoda]].\n* {{anchor|Consuela}}'''Consuela''' (voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]]) \u2013 A maid who in one cut-away gag is shown as the head of the Maids' Union. She is [[Hispanic]] and speaks broken English. She usually says \"No, no, no...\", whenever asked to do anything. She first appears in \"[[Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air]]\" demanding [[Pledge (brand)|Lemon Pledge]] in a court case. She is seen answering the door as [[Superman]]'s maid at the [[Fortress of Solitude]] in \"[[Stewie Kills Lois]]\" telling Joe and the police officers that Superman is not home. She appears in a cutaway in \"[[Ocean's Three and a Half]]\" on the game show ''Are You Smarter Than a Hispanic Maid?''. In \"[[Dog Gone]]\", she goes to work for the Griffin family, but proves to be so annoying that they drug her with chloroform and leave her with Joe. She has a nephew named Mikey, who sells light-up yo-yos, and a son named Rodrigo, who is in prison. Another of her nephews was molested by James Woods before he committed suicide, as revealed in \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\" when she was working as Woods' maid. In \"[[Stewie Goes for a Drive]]\", Stewie runs away from home and ends up in a bad neighborhood. Consuela finds and takes him to her home and puts him in her bathtub, which is also being used to make soup for a [[Quincea\u00f1era]] celebration being held at her house. Brian tracks Stewie to Consuela's house but she refuses to let him go, claiming that Stewie is her son \"Ernesto\".  Consuela also appears as Darth Vader's maid in \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\", and as the controller of the security system at the palace of Jabba the Hutt in \"[[It's a Trap!]]\". She also appears as Donna's housekeeper in ''The Cleveland Show'' season 3 episode \"Die Semi-Hard\". In \"[[Valentine's Day in Quahog]]\", it is revealed that Consuela has a husband who is still living in Mexico, and to see him annually on Valentine's Day, she crosses the border illegally ''into'' Mexico.  In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Consuela attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale where she was sitting next to Bumblebee Man due to their both being Hispanic.

Underneath his hood is a human skull with spiders and snakes crawling in and out of the eye sockets, mouth, and ear cavities as seen in \"[[Death Lives]]\". He is present in \"[[Mr. Saturday Knight]]\" when Mr. Weed dies after choking during dinner at the Griffins'. In \"[[I Take Thee Quagmire]]\", it is revealed that anyone who touches his bones dies instantly (though in \"[[Death Is a Bitch]]\" it seems that this is contradicted, but while Stewie rubs his ankle to heal it faster, Death being out of commission, no one at all is able to die). In \"[[Wasted Talent]]\", Death comes to a college campus where a party had taken place and everybody is dead with beer bottles around the room. After doing his deed, he drinks some beer bottles to try to find a silver scroll (for Pawtucket Pat's contest). He ends up getting drunk and crashes his car. In \"[[Friends of Peter G.]]\", Death shows Peter what his life would be like if he continues to drink as much as he does, and if he does not drink at all. Peter learns to control his drinking from this. Death later ends up in a car crash in \"[[Grumpy Old Man]]\", leading him to be taken away by \"Super Death\" (a larger version of himself) who tells him he was going to be reincarnated as a Chinese child. He disappears only to reappear seconds later as he was reincarnated a Chinese baby girl. In \"[[3 Acts of God]]\", Death takes Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe to speak to God.\n* {{anchor|Dr. Hartman}}'''Dr. Elmer Hartman''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 An incompetent doctor who works at Quahog's hospital. Dr. Hartman is generally shown to be an unskilled doctor and his skills fluctuate from episode to episode. In one episode, he mentions his [[Yale School of Medicine|Yale Medical School]] degree, but then implies it is a product of his [[calligraphy]] skills. Occasionally, he seems to know exactly what he is doing and performs great medical feats, such as plastic surgery to restore Peter's face, to other episodes where he does not even understand common medical terminology, or needs a chart to find body parts and lets [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] take care of patients while he is gone, as in \"[[You Can't Do That on Television, Peter]]\". He temporarily loses his medical license in \"[[Stewie Loves Lois]]\" when Peter accuses him of rape (it turns out that Hartman had in fact merely performed a normal [[prostate]] exam, though Peter did not understand the procedure). He manages to regain his license after treating Peter's urination problem. In \"[[Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air]]\", Peter brought up the fact that Hartman sounds very similar to [[#Relatives of the Griffin family|Carter Pewterschmidt]] when he speaks. As a response, Hartman tells Peter that Carter is one of his patients and that there are only so many voices in the world; some are bound to be similar and that he never noticed because they do not talk all that much despite the fact that Carter is in fact a patient of his. This was brought up to turn the scenario that MacFarlane voices both Hartman and Carter into a comical situation. His name comes from MacFarlane's close friend and fellow animator [[Butch Hartman|Elmer \"Butch\" Hartman]]. In \"[[New Kidney in Town]]\", Hartman gives Peter one of his kidneys because the Griffin family are his last paying customers. Also in the episode, Hartman reveals that while attempting to clone a chicken, he inadvertently created [[#The Giant Chicken|the Giant Chicken]] where Peter says he is going to want to discuss with Dr. Hartman later. In \"[[Secondhand Spoke]]\", it is revealed that Hartman has a gay son. In \"[[Ratings Guy]]\", it is revealed that Hartman is the worst doctor at Quahog's hospital. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Dr. Hartman was among the Quahog citizens to attend the trial between Pawtucket Patriot Ale and Duff Beer in Springfield. He was shown to have been seated next to [[Dr. Nick|Dr. Nick Riviera]] (who was also an incompetent doctor). In \"Once Bitten\", Dr. Hartman enlisted his dad to get him and Seamus into a movie theater. In \"[[Papa Has a Rollin' Son]]\", it is revealed that Hartman has [[Dyslexia]].\n* '''[[Frank Sinatra Jr.]]''' (voiced by himself) \u2013 A singer, songwriter and conductor who meets Brian Griffin in \"Brian Sings and Swings\" following his near-death experience. Frank gives him some words of wisdom before taking the stage at the Quahog Cabana Club. Brian and Frank start to sing together, and eventually Stewie Griffin joins them, forming the \"New Rat Pack\". In \"Tales of a Third Grade Nothing,\" Frank and Brian purchase the Quahog Cabana Club. When business fails to improve, the two look to Stewie to bring in more customers. Stewie turns the club into a trendy Hollywood style night club called pLace that ultimately fails when [[Andy Dick]] shows up to party. The episode \"[[Bookie of the Year]]\" was Frank Sinatra Jr.'s final role before he died where he was shown helping Brian and Stewie with a restaurant plan.\n* {{anchor|God}}'''[[God]]''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 The father of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and the creator of life. He is a central part of the basic tenets in the religion of [[Christianity]]. Although the basic concept of God exists in other monotheistic and polytheistic religions, it is the Christian God that serves as the basis for the character in ''Family Guy''. His appearance in the show is the stereotypical appearance of an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] god in the Western world; a bald-headed Caucasian man with long white hair, a huge white beard and a white robe. Contrary to the widespread belief of a benevolent and pure God, the \"God\" character in ''Family Guy'' has often been shown to have several human flaws, especially being shown as being socially irresponsible and [[Sexual perversion|sexually perverted]]. In the episode \"[[Fifteen Minutes of Shame]]\", he aims a [[sniper rifle]] with [[red dot sight]] at Meg from the clouds after she says, \"Oh God, kill me now\", but is interrupted by a phone call before he can complete the task. In the episode \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\", God flirts with a woman at the Drunken Clam, and lights her a cigarette with lightning before accidentally vaporizing her and setting the bar on fire, to which he exclaims, \"Jesus Christ!\" Jesus then arrives, and hastily leaves the area with God in a [[Cadillac Escalade]] before they can be caught up in the blaze. In \"[[Untitled Griffin Family History]]\", God asks his roommate Chuggs for a lighter, using it to [[Fart lighting|light a fart]]. On his second attempt, the lit fart sets in motion the [[Big Bang]] that creates the universe. In \"[[The Courtship of Stewie's Father]]\", [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] quarrels with a teenage Jesus, before Jesus storms out of the room shouting, \"You're not my real father!\". He then goes on to give God a phone call asking if he can go back to live with him in [[Heaven]], but is rejected. God then turns to a young woman named Janet lying in his bed, hoping to have sex with her. Janet hands him a condom to his disappointment, and asks her to reconsider, saying it is his birthday, but Janet refuses. In \"[[Partial Terms of Endearment]]\", Peter thanks God thinking he is set to participate in a threesome with Lois and her friend Naomi, to which God replies \"Don't mention it, Peter\". A jingle is then heard singing, \"God! He knows what turns you on!\" after which God says, \"Have fun!\" In \"[[Into Fat Air]]\", God and Jesus discuss on how to name a country in the Himalayas. God says that the mountains look like nipples, to which Jesus replies by saying that he cannot just call a country \"Nipples\". In response, God suggests the name \"[[Nepal]]\" to Jesus' approval. In other episodes, God's serious side has also been shown on occasion such as in \"[[If I'm Dyin', I'm Lyin']]\" where he curses Peter with six of the [[10 plagues]] after he lied to the people of Quahog about being a healer and is then worshipped as a god.\n* {{anchor|Horace}}'''Horace''' (voiced by John G. Brennan) \u2013 The proprietor and [[bartender]] of The Drunken Clam for 30 years. Has been shown to have been working there for at least as long as Peter and his friends have been regulars. Horace has also been shot a handful of times, but has recovered from each incident. In \"[[One If by Clam, Two If by Sea]]\", Horace sold The Drunken Clam following a storm and moved to Florida. He later repurchased it after moving back to Quahog. In \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\", Horace's life is saved by Peter (who was blind at the time) when The Drunken Clam was on fire. In \"[[Save the Clam]]\", Horace is accidentally killed when a baseball hit by Jerome hits him during a baseball game between The Drunken Clam and Mort's Pharmacy. His death causes the bank to close The Drunken Clam which was enough for Peter, Joe and Quagmire to protest this until Jerome buys The Drunken Clam to keep Horace's legacy alive.\n* {{anchor|Jake Tucker}}'''Jake Tucker''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Tom Tucker's deformed son and Chris' former classmate. Jake's many appearances show him with an \"upside-down face\"; a mouth near the top of his head and eyes near the bottom. In \"[[It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One]]\", he gets a normal face, via toxic waste. Although typically depicted as a demanding and obnoxious brat, Jake craves his father's attention, which he rarely gets. It is also revealed in \"[[Peter Griffin: Husband, Father...Brother?]]\" that he \"doesn't have a bottom\". Though Tom often neglects him, he often shows that he cares when Brian accused Jake of giving Chris alcohol. However, when Chris gets his own back on Jake by planting drugs in his locker an enraged Tom declares him a \"bad boy\" and loses faith in him. In \"[[Mother Tucker]]\", Jake is noticeably neglected by Tom when Tom pays more attention to Peter. But Peter then realizes that Tom should pay more attention to Jake.\n* '''[[James Woods]]''' (voiced by himself) \u2013 An actor whose fictional persona becomes a criminal sociopath. In \"[[Peter's Got Woods]]\", he is invited by Peter to help deal with the local high school being named for Woods, i.e. James Woods Regional High School. While Brian's attentions are turned to his girlfriend, Peter becomes friends with Woods. This friendship ends when Woods becomes jealous of Brian. Peter and Brian lure Woods into a crate, forgetting to make holes for air, and ship him off to be studied by \"[[Raiders of the Lost Ark|top men]]\". Woods returns in \"[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]\", stealing Peter's wallet and assuming his identity. Peter retaliates by assuming Woods' identity and ruining his credibility on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. When Woods shows up to fight Peter, he is again lured into a crate to be studied by \"top men\". In \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\", Woods makes an appearance as General [[Maximilian Veers]]. In \"[[Brian Griffin's House of Payne]]\", the CBS producers hire Woods to star in Brian Griffin's television show, Woods making multiple changes to Brian's original script that prompt Brian to back out of the project. James Woods reappears in \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\" in which he becomes a [[born-again Christian]] due to his new relationship with young news intern Priscilla. Woods turns his life over to Jesus wishing to make amends for his sins. Woods is later killed as part of an elaborate murder plot orchestrated by Diane Simmons. In \"[[Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]\", it is revealed that the paramedics who loaded Woods' body into the ambulance recognized him and had his body rushed to a special Hollywood hospital where a teenage girl's life force was drained into Woods which successfully resurrected him. He is still a born-again Christian when he encounters Peter Griffin and Tom Tucker in Hollywood. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", James Woods was present in Springfield at the trial between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale. During this time, he interacted with his Simpsons counterpart from \"[[Homer and Apu]]\". The episode \"Inside Family Guy\" had James Woods hosting the behind the scenes-theme of the episode.\n* '''Jeffrey''' (voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]]) - Jeffrey is Bruce's boyfriend.\n* {{anchor|Jerome}}'''Jerome''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) \u2013 An African-American man who first appeared in \"[[Jerome is the New Black]]\" where he won the audition as a temporary replacement for Cleveland. It is revealed he was involved with Lois Griffin in their younger days before she met Peter, which made Peter jealous enough to burn down Jerome's house. So Lois invited him to come live with them. Peter believed that Jerome was trying to steal Lois from him and became jealous. He kicked Jerome out of his house, but later apologized to him and they remained friends. Jerome also tells Peter that he had some nasty ass sex with Meg when he was staying with the Griffins although Peter told him that he does not care about that. He returns in \"[[Save the Clam]]\" playing for Mort Goldman's softball team against Peter and his team from The Drunken Clam. He accidentally kills Horace by swinging the ball towards his face. Jerome appears at the funeral where he apologizes for accidentally killing Horace. When it came to the demolition of The Drunken Clam which Peter, Quagmire, and Joe were protesting, Jerome appears and uses his sports earnings from lacrosse (which also happens to be his brother's name) to buy The Drunken Clam in order to keep Horace's legacy alive. In \"[[Baby Got Black]]\", it is revealed that Jerome has a daughter named Pam and at first disapproved of her relationship with Chris. In \"Follow the Money\", Jerome reveals that he lost both his childhood sweetheart and their daughter shortly after their wedding. In \"Pawtucket Pete,\" it is revealed that Jerome's voice is unaffected by helium as seen when Peter fired a harpoon gun at Brian Griffin's parade balloon.\n* {{anchor|Jesus}}'''[[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane in early episodes, [[David A. Goodman|David Goodman]] in \"[[Stu and Stewie's Excellent Adventure]]\", [[Seth Green]] in \"[[The Courtship of Stewie's Father]]\", [[Alec Sulkin]] in later episodes) \u2013 The central figure of [[Christianity]]. Throughout the duration of the series, there has been a running gag that Jesus drives a [[Cadillac Escalade]]. This is first seen in the episode \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\", in which he uses it to pick up God from the Drunken Clam after He accidentally set the bar on fire. In \"[[North by North Quahog]]\", he is seen in the car in a trailer for the action film ''[[The Passion of the Christ|The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This]]'' starring [[Jim Caviezel]] as Jesus and [[Chris Tucker]], and directed by [[Mel Gibson]]. Jesus Christ's most prominent appearance on the show came in the episode \"[[I Dream of Jesus]]\", where he worked in disguise at a vinyl record store called \"Dead Format Records\" before being recognized by Peter. After a public display of his powers, including [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]], he becomes a huge celebrity in Quahog. While having dinner with the Griffins, Jesus proves to Brian that he actually is Jesus Christ by turning their dinners into ice cream sundaes, before immensely enlarging Lois' breasts at Peter's request, to the absolute shock of Brian. As the episode progresses, Jesus lets fame get to his head more and more while becoming more distant from Peter and his family, and ultimately gets himself incarcerated for drug abuse. When Peter visits him in prison, Jesus apologizes for his actions and decides that he probably was not mature enough to return to the world. He then gives Peter another record of \"[[Surfin' Bird]]\" as a gift after the first one he had was destroyed by Brian and Stewie. In \"[[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]]\", he turned water into [[funk]]. In the episode \"[[Holy Crap]]\", Francis repeatedly gives Jesus the [[employee of the week]] award, and is himself later seen in a golf course going for a fourth [[Birdie (golf)|birdie]]. Upon missing his putt, he uses his power to move the ball into the hole. In the episode \"[[And the Wiener is...]]\", Jesus and [[Moses]] use guns to defeat the Romans in a film by the National Gun Association. In the episode \"[[Deep Throats]]\", Lois asks \"What if Jesus had given up?\", after which Jesus is seen in a shabby-looking house sitting lazily in a chair, with several children running around him, and calls out to their mother asking why their ironing board is still out. In \"[[Stu and Stewie's Excellent Adventure]]\", the adult Stewie tells his infant self of a time when he went back in time on vacation to see Jesus, saying that his abilities may have been exaggerated a bit. A cutaway shows adult Stewie and other members of the public watching Jesus perform [[Art Metrano]]'s \"tricks\" while humming the song \"[[Fine and Dandy (song)|Fine and Dandy]]\". In \"[[Boys Do Cry]]\", Stewie imagines what it would be like meeting Jesus, and in a cutaway is then seen entering a room in Jesus' house to find him naked washing himself in a tub. Despite noticing Stewie, he carries on. In \"[[Jerome is the New Black]]\", he has an African-American counterpart in \"Black Jesus\" who is portrayed as a cool laid back character and is seen wearing sunglasses. In \"[[Go, Stewie, Go]]\", he is seen in a dodgeball game on the side of the [[Jock (athlete)|jocks]] pelting numerous balls at the [[nerd]]s. In \"[[Life of Brian]]\", Stewie is seen at the [[last supper]] suggesting the idea of rebellion to [[Judas Iscariot]], pointing out that Jesus ordered five margaritas while all Judas had was the salad. In other episodes, Jesus has also been portrayed as a voice of reason, such as in \"[[Family Goy]]\", where he tells Peter about his Jewish identity after Peter and Lois quarreled over whether their family should be Christian or Jewish. However, in response to Peter's question asking which religion his family should follow, Jesus says \"6 of 1, they're all complete crap\". In \"[[3 Acts of God]]\", it is shown that Jesus is dating [[Carrie Underwood]].

She is quite ignorant; for example, she does not understand that [[Adolf Hitler]] was defeated decades ago. She has a close friendship with Peter, who treats her more like a daughter than he does Meg, due to their similar levels of intelligence. The remainder of the Griffin family look on her as a figure of mockery and symbol of Brian's shallowness, although she has affection for them, involving them all in her wedding. She first appeared in \"[[Whistle While Your Wife Works]]\". She is the only girlfriend that Brian has dated for more than one episode, and was a recurring character in Season 5. He stays with her purely for sex, though after they split, he felt strong feelings of love for her. In \"[[Prick Up Your Ears (Family Guy)|Prick Up Your Ears]]\", when Brian talks about Jillian's bulimia, he goes on to compare her to [[Karen Carpenter|Karen]] from [[The Carpenters]], who succumbed to anorexia in 1983, claiming she \"overdid it\" but he thinks \"Jillian's found a good balance\". She breaks up with Brian in \"[[Movin' Out (Brian's Song)|Movin' Out]]\" when it is revealed that Brian did not want a committed relationship with her, and she briefly dated Mayor West. She got married in the episode \"[[We Love You, Conrad]]\". In \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", her husband Derek Wilcox was murdered by Diane Simmons, making Jillian a widow. She is shown dating again in \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\", where Quagmire attempts to date her to make Brian jealous, but she and [[Cheryl Tiegs]] leave together when they realize how immature both men are acting. In \"[[Valentine's Day in Quahog]]\", Jillian is among the ex-girlfriends of Brian that Stewie assembles.\n* {{anchor|Jim Kaplan}}'''Jim Kaplan''' (voiced by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]]) \u2013 A [[Confidence trick|con man]] who tricks Peter into spending money on various useless things on many occasions. He was first introduced as Doug but has been referred to as Jim in later episodes. First appearing in \"[[There's Something About Paulie]]\", he sells a car to Peter that does not have an engine under the hood but rather a picture of one by claiming that the car belonged to James Bond. He later sells Peter volcano insurance in \"[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]\" where Peter paid him with Lois' rainy day money (which she planned to use after Stewie broke Meg's glasses). With help from the accountant Max Weinstein, Peter reclaimed the money. Jim later sells Peter a TiVo in \"[[Bango Was His Name Oh!]]\". In \"[[A Fish out of Water (Family Guy)|A Fish out of Water]]\", he gives Peter a loan for Peter's new fishing boat and Peter offers up his house as collateral which later gets taken over by the bank and sold to a fashionable, artsy, neo-hippie-ish new couple named Jim and Abby. In \"[[Hell Comes to Quahog]]\", he sells Peter a tank for Meg at a car dealership for her first car and finally convinces him by saying \"Did I mention it's a tank?\"\n* '''Judge Dignified Q. Blackman''' (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) \u2013 The [[African-American]] judge who presides over trials involving any of this show's characters. His full name was revealed by the bailiff in \"Veteran Guy\" when Peter, Cleveland, and Joe were on trial for violating the [[Stolen Valor Act of 2013]].\n* '''Lou Spinazola''' - The manager of the seedy apartment building that Brian Griffin resides in from \"The D in Apartment 23\" to \"Crimes and Meg's Demeanor.\" Lou's one rule in his apartment building is to never kiss the mail carrier. In \"Married... with Cancer,\" Lou allows Brian and his terminal cancer-recovered wife Jess Schlotz to move in while having developed a sitcom catchphrase.\n* '''Paddy Tanniger''' \u2013 A short red-haired angry man who has been seen as a caddy manager and a Hummer salesman. He generally ends his statements with \"Big whoop, wanna fight about it?\" He was eventually killed when he was run over by a tank piloted by Brian and Stewie in \"[[Hell Comes to Quahog]]\". It is mentioned on the DVD commentary for \"The Perfect Castaway\" that the character was disliked by nearly all the writing staff, which led to his death.\n* '''Rupert''' (voiced by [[Dave Boat|David Boat]] in \"Road to the North Pole\") \u2013 A stuffed [[teddy bear]] that belongs to one-year-old [[Stewie Griffin]]. Though inanimate, Rupert has become his personal confidant and best friend. Stewie confides all his secrets and machinations in Rupert, and often gets upset when Rupert does not respond. Rupert has been known to double as a pistol when needed \"[[Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater]]\". Rupert has been damaged several times. The first time in a flashback in \"[[Stu & Stewie's Excellent Adventure]]\", Stewie argued with Brian about the economy and Brian decided to eat one of Rupert's legs. Stewie got the leg back after a while. The second time involved encountering an unfamiliar [[Rottweiler]] dog in \"[[Stewie Loves Lois]]\". Rupert was torn to shreds but was later sewn back together by Lois. In \"[[A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas]]\", Stewie tears Rupert in two, after waking up from a Santa Claus-themed nightmare. In \"[[Killer Queen (Family Guy)|Killer Queen]]\", Stewie shoots Rupert in the head with a gun rather than risk letting him die a worse death when he sees the cover of a Queen album. In \"[[The Man with Two Brians]]\", he is humped by New Brian for two hours. Stewie is then shown dragging a body into the garbage, later revealed to be New Brian. At the end of the episode Stewie is shown crying in the shower and washing Rupert in despair, constantly reassuring him that it was not his fault. In \"[[Chick Cancer]]\", when Stewie married [[Olivia Fuller]], he had Rupert officiate the ceremony. \"[[8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter]]\" had the creation of Stewpert, a being where Stewie and Rupert were fused together after Stewie activated his teleportation device before he realized Rupert was inside, in reference to Brundlefly of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''. Stewie had several times referred to him as gay. Stewie accused Rupert of choosing to watch the boys in \"[[Road to Rhode Island]]\" as opposed to watching their bags as Stewie has told him to, much to Stewie's chagrin. In the episode \"[[Road to Rupert]]\". Brian accidentally sells Rupert causing both Brian and Stewie (after Brian confesses to selling Rupert by accident) to head off to the Swiss Alps to retrieve him from the family that he was sold to, eventually challenging the father of the family to a ski race to either get him back or give the family Brian as the stakes, Stewie does not respect the rules and throws hot tea in the other young boy' eyes blinding him long enough to grab Rupert, but Stewie later says that he was through with Rupert and was too old for him, saying \"...after all, Brian, I'm nearly one.\"  Stewie has also imagined Rupert as a muscular, human male a few times, including in \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\", where he builds a buff Rupert snowman in the opening credit sequence. However, Rupert retains his Teddy Bear head. In a DVD exclusive scene in \"[[Excellence in Broadcasting]]\", Stewie explores the experience of masturbating and in his fantasy buff Rupert makes out with an equally buff Brian while Stewie is tied to the bed. In the episode \"Lois Comes Out of Her Shell\", Rupert's head is ripped off by Stewie's evil pet turtle Sheldon who Stewie enters a fight with in return. In \"Total Recall\", the factory that made Rupert demands all bears are sent back due to them becoming a choking hazard. Lois in shock sends him back and Brian and Stewie go on a life-threatening quest to get him back, only just saving Rupert (and Stewie) from instant death on a furnace. As they return home, Stewie celebrates with Rupert only for Rupert's eye to come off and Stewie to swallow it supposedly killing him with Chris who witnessed the scene casually shouting \"Mom, Stewie's dead\". In the episode \"[[Quagmire's Quagmire]]\", Stewie must decide whether to \"play\" with Rupert anymore after Lois finds his newborn plush toy, a blue, scruffy looking, bow-tied teddy bear named Oscar who was apparently given to him by Babs Pewterschmidt (his maternal grandmother) when Stewie was born. This fact is stated by Meg who is in the attic, organizing items from boxes along with Lois. Stewie treats Rupert like a nagging wife juxtaposed to Oscar's imaginary role as the still loved ex-girlfriend. In \"[[Stewie, Chris & Brian's Excellent Adventure]]\", Rupert tells the other stuffed animals that he is straight after Stewie and Brian leave with Chris in the time machine. In \"[[Dog Bites Bear]]\", Brian accidentally destroys Rupert while drunk but later replaces him with an identical looking bear that Stewie believes to be Rupert having returned from the dead.\n* {{anchor|Seamus Levine|Seamus}}'''Seamus Levine'''<ref>''Valentine's Day in Quahog''</ref> (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Seamus is a tough [[fisherman]] with two peg-legs as well as two peg arms. He wears a black eye-patch over his right eye. He makes his first appearance in the episode \"[[A Fish out of Water (Family Guy)|A Fish Out of Water]]\". While spending time with Peter and the gang in a steam room, it is revealed his whole body from the neck down is wood. He tends to warn Peter of danger. Seamus had his own talk show in \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\". In his premiere episode, he jokes that his [[Adendrophilia|father was a tree]], but in the episode \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\" he blames his condition on James Woods. Seamus initially claims that Woods carved him from wood and did not wish hard enough for him [[Pinocchio|to be a real boy]], but he later revealed that they both got high on acid one day and Woods ate off Seamus' arms and legs, thinking that he was a steak. In \"[[Ocean's Three and a Half]]\", when Seamus is seen naked, his body is entirely wooden while his head is human, bringing into question how he can sustain life. He played Byron Hadley in the series' portrayal of ''The Shawshank Redemption'' which was seen the second of the \"[[Three Kings (Family Guy)|Three kings]]\". In a DVD exclusive scene, Seamus tries out for Fox News Channel in \"[[FOX-y Lady]]\". He gets a ship in a bottle for Christmas in \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\". In \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\", he attends Quagmire's class on how to pick up women. In \"[[Cool Hand Peter]]\", Seamus attempts to join in Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire's road trip only to be rejected by Peter. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Seamus attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale where he was sitting next to Captain Horatio McCallister. In \"[[Family Guy (season 18)|Christmas Is Coming]]\" his son Woody was introduced; he also has two peg-legs and two peg arms.\n* {{anchor|Vinny}}'''Vinny''' (voiced by [[Tony Sirico]]) \u2013 A talking [[Italian greyhound]] whose first appearance in the franchise occurs in \"[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]\". After [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] is killed in a tragic car accident, the Griffin family decides to find another dog at the pet store to ease their grief. They meet Vinny, a pussyhound (he is 1/16th cat) of [[Italian people|Italian]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latintimes.com/articles/10581/20131125/brian-griffin-dies-4-things-know-vinny.htm#.UpPg_eJx5id|title=Brian Griffin Dies: 4 Things To Know About 'Family Guy' Newcomer Vinny|work=Latin Times|first=William |last=Cannon|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> Each member of the family is taken by the dog, save for Stewie, and he is adopted into their family. Stewie, still mourning over the death of Brian, rebuffs the hound and makes several attempts to get him out of the family. However, once Stewie learns that Vinny had also undergone a period of mourning when his owner died in a freak yoga accident, he comes to accept Vinny as a part of the family. Like Brian, Vinny is an anthropomorphized dog where he is described as having a \"tough guy attitude\", and according to executive producer [[Steve Callaghan]], \"Vinny is just a lot more rough around the edges, and is a really good match for Stewie.\"<ref name=\"DailyMail\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2513065/Family-Guy-character-KILLED-OFF-hit-car-shock-new-episode.html#ixzz2lhrycb8D|website=DailyMail.co.uk|first=Mike|title=Vinny Arrives|last=Larkin|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> His personality is that of a streetwise, \"wise guy\" Italian American. In \"[[Christmas Guy]]\", Vinny found out that Carter Pewterschmidt canceled an event at Quahog Mall upon asking around and reported this to the Griffin family. Vinny helps Stewie distract his past self so he can steal the return pad from his backpack and travel back in time to save Brian. Before Stewie goes back in time, he says his goodbyes to Vinny. Just before Stewie travels back in time, Vinny walks off shouting \"Georgette, I'm coming home!\" to which Stewie questions himself on who \"Georgette\" is. At the end of \"The Boys in the Band,\" Vinny was seen performing with Olivia Fuller.\n\n==Gag characters==\n* '''Al Harrington''' (voiced by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]]) \u2013 The owner, president, and CEO of \"Al Harrington's [[Airdancer|Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tubeman]] Emporium and Warehouse\". In an advertisement, he speaks at an incredibly fast rate and could be described as \"in-your-face\", but just in that friendly-annoying way, as described by Peter. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Al Harrington made a cameo at the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale.\n* '''[[Barbershop quartet|Barbershop Quartet]]''' (voiced by Jon Joyce, Bob Joyce, Rick Logan, and Randy Crenshaw) \u2013 A group of four men that sing close harmony songs in specific episodes.\n* ''' [[Big Bird]]''' (voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]) - Parody of a fictional character from the children's television program ''[[Sesame Street]]'', Big Bird, or sometimes referred to as \"Bird\" appears in multiple episodes such as \"I Never Met The Dead Man\", \"A Picture's Worth a Thousand Bucks\", \"[[Model Misbehavior]]\", \"[[Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air]]\", \"[[The Peter Principal]]\", and also \"[[Brian's Play]]\" were he is portrayed as a meth addict working as the resources director of [[The Muppets]].\n* {{anchor|Buzz Killington}}'''Buzz Killington''' (voiced by Danny Smith) \u2013 A man who dresses and acts as if he is a 19th-century British man of means. His name is based on the term \"[[wikt:buzzkill|buzzkill]]\". He is a stereotype of a socially popular person in the late 19th century{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}, but by today's standard would be regarded as a \"buzzkill\". He is typically introduced into otherwise fun situations, such as a wild party, but his contributions (showing etchings, telling stories) bring the party (and fun) to a grinding halt.\n* '''[[Conway Twitty]]''' \u2013 Usually seen in archival footage of his performances, which are used when one of the characters needs a distraction. The first such appearance was in the episode \"[[Peter's Daughter]]\" where Meg's wedding had just been called off and Peter said that the guests were expecting a show\u2014cut to a clip of Twitty singing his best-known song, \"[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]\". Twitty has also been featured in \"[[Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey]]\" and \"[[The Juice is Loose]]\" (which featured a 3-minute clip of him singing \"[[I See the Want To in Your Eyes]]\"). In \"[[It's a Trap!]]\", he's referred to as Darth Twitty and a Darth Vader helmet is digitally placed over his hair. In \"[[Lois Comes Out of Her Shell]]\", Peter beats up [[Justin Bieber]] just before a concert, so the scene cuts to \"Conway Bieber\" digitally sporting the young singer's floppy hair. In \"[[3 Acts of God]]\", God tells Peter that Twitty wanted him to tell Peter to quit using him in cutaway gags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/family-guy-2014/episode-13-season-12/3-acts-of-god/100148 |title=Family Guy Episode Guide 2014 Season 12 \u2013 3 Acts of God, Episode 13 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n* '''[[Cookie Monster]]''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 Cookie Monster is, like Big Bird, a fictional character from ''Sesame Street'' who has made various appearances on this show.\n\n[[File:Evil monkey.JPG|thumb|A [[stuffed animal|stuffed]] Evil Monkey hanging in a closet]]\n* {{anchor|Evil Monkey}}'''Evil Monkey''' (voiced by Danny Smith) \u2013 A monkey living in Chris's closet, who scares Chris whenever he jumps out of the closet by pointing at him with an evil grimace and a strange tremble (which the monkey claims is due to a [[copper deficiency]]). For much of the series, the family believes the Evil Monkey is a figment of Chris's imagination. In \"[[Hannah Banana]]\", Chris blames him for a bad test grade, saying that he scared him while he was trying to study. Peter and Lois are stunned when Chris catches him and shows him to them. The Evil Monkey explains that he moved into Chris's closet after his wife had an affair and divorced him, and pointing at Chris was his way of trying to make conversation. Chris is unconvinced, but when Monkey helps him write a book report, they become friends. Eventually, Monkey moves out of Chris's closet and, saying \"I'll go where I'm needed\", moves into Jake Tucker's closet.

The fight scenes are often long and melodramatic, involving the destruction of large sections of Quahog and sometimes killing bystanders. Peter always wins, but it is then shown that the Giant Chicken is still alive. This rivalry begins in \"[[Da Boom]]\" when the Giant Chicken gives Peter an expired coupon, which angers Peter (however, in \"[[Meet the Quagmires]]\", Peter's meddling in his past allows him to accidentally punch the Giant Chicken while dancing at the Country Club, giving a new origin to the rivalry). In \"[[Blind Ambition (Family Guy)|Blind Ambition]]\", the Giant Chicken turns up while the Spooner Street residents are discussing Quagmire peeping in the ladies' room watching Lois, and Peter interrupts his defense of Quagmire to rejoin the fight. In \"[[No Chris Left Behind]]\", their fight comes to a halt when Peter and the Giant Chicken forget what they have been fighting about, and Peter is cordially invited to dinner with the Chicken and his wife Nicole. Although the character's official name in scripts and production documents is simply \"the Giant Chicken\", the Chicken is referred to as \"Ernie\" in this dinner scene. When the bill comes, both Peter and Ernie try to pay. This starts out politely but quickly escalates to a fight that resumes their feud. In \"[[Big Man on Hippocampus]]\", the Chicken ends up attacking an amnesiac Peter when he insults his lawn. The blow to the head causes Peter to remember who he is, and he states that he does not remember making peace with the Chicken, who resumes smashing various objects on his head. Ernie is shown as [[Boba Fett]] in the ''[[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy|Star Wars]]'' episodes \"[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]\" and \"[[It's a Trap!]]\". In \"[[New Kidney in Town]]\", Dr. Hartman tells the Griffins about a failed cloning attempt that resulted in a violent man-sized chicken. Peter responds that they should talk. He also appears in \"[[Trading Places (Family Guy)|Trading Places]]\", when Chris makes a chicken noise and says it was fake. The Chicken's fight with Peter continues in \"[[Internal Affairs (Family Guy)|Internal Affairs]]\", where Peter accidentally backs into the front of the Chicken's car; during this brawl, the Chicken is close to killing Peter at an oil rig, but gets burned alive by the falling debris and plunges into the ocean, taking on the appearance of a roasted chicken\u2014but he reveals he is still alive by opening his eyes. In \"[[Yug Ylimaf]]\", Brian and Stewie witness a backwards fight between Peter and the Chicken that \"ends\" by Peter opening his car door in front of the Chicken's moving bicycle. He is the main antagonist in ''[[Family Guy Video Game!]]'' disguised as [[Mr. Belvedere]]. Ernie is not directly referenced in the episode \"[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life of Brian]]\", but in the veterinary surgery waiting room when Peter asks a decapitated chicken if he should be running around, the chicken says \"Don't talk to me. You have a bad reputation in the chicken community\". In the crossover episode with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', titled \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", [[Comic Book Guy]] references the aforementioned \"chicken fights\", by claiming the epic fight between Peter and [[Homer Simpson]] was the \"worst chicken fight ever\". In \"Follow the Money,\" Lois has become friends with Ernie much to the dismay of Peter and Nicole.\n* '''[[Fred Flintstone]]''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]) \u2013 Fred Flintstone is a [[caveman]] from ''[[The Flintstones]]'' who has made various appearances on the show.

In \"Believe it or Not, Joe's Walking on Air\" when at Peter Griffin's men's club, he confesses to Barney that he was walking by his house when he saw Betty undressing. Fred says that Betty saw him, but kept undressing leading to an \"erocktion.\" Fred also appeared in \"Peter's Daughter\" as they see a marriage counselor/divorce lawyer named Mr. Stoneberg over the rough parts of their marriage. In \"Quagmire's Baby,\" Fred Flintstone was seen in ''Wildest Police Chases'' being pursued by police officers which ended at a movie theater where the police officers apprehend Fred Flintstone when he tried to climb the fence. In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", Fred Flintstone is the judge who presided over the trial involving Pawtucket Patriot Beer and Duff Beer in Springfield. While he finds in favor of Duff Beer, Fred Flintstone states that they pale in comparison to his favorite beer Bud Rock.\n* '''The Greased-up Deaf Guy''' (voiced by Mike Henry) \u2013 A naked man covered in grease who first appears in \"[[The Thin White Line]]\". His speech is indicative of someone with [[prelingual deafness]]. He is always shown running; even when stopped, he will continue to run in place, flailing his arms. In \"[[North by North Quahog]]\", he mentions that he used to be a lawyer. In \"[[Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High]]\", he is seen speaking in court during the show's ''Law and Order''-parody intro. He was named Jay after an audience member by the same name in ''Family Guy Live'' queried his name in a Q&A session. He appears in the direct-to-DVD movie ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]''. He also appears in ''[[Family Guy Online]]''. The reason for his condition was revealed in \"[[Yug Ylimaf]]\" where an accident with Stewie's time machine caused Brian and Stewie to witness him on his way to work hurrying past a grease truck that explodes, burning off his suit, and covering him in grease.\n* '''James William Bottomtooth III''' (voiced by [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]]) \u2013 A character who suffers from a severe underbite ([[Prognathism|Habsburg jaw]]), which has given him a comically oversized lower jaw and has made his speech impossible to understand due to his extreme [[Locust Valley lockjaw]] accent. He has a taste for brandy, which he pours into his lower jaw. He is part of the staff of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in \"[[Brian Goes Back to College]]\". In \"[[You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives]]\", he refuses to sign Brian's petition against Mayor Adam West's gay marriage ban because he is a devout Christian. He has a son named James William Bottomtooth IV who attends Morningwood Academy and bears a strong resemblance to his father (particularly the large lower jaw and speech). Like his classmates, he holds a strong antipathy for Chris, as seen in \"[[No Chris Left Behind]]\", until he finds out that Chris is the grandson of Carter Pewterschmidt, who also attended Morningwood. He is part of the mob that rushes the Griffin home in \"[[The Juice Is Loose]]\" to deal with [[O. J. Simpson|O.J. Simpson]]. In \"[[420 (Family Guy)|420]]\", he catches a bag of marijuana in his jaw. In \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\", he attends Quagmire's class on how to pick up women.\n* '''''[[Kool-Aid Man|Kool-Aid Guy]]''''' (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) \u2013 The mascot for the popular drink ''[[Kool-Aid]]'', is parodied in several episodes. In \"[[Death Has a Shadow]]\" and \"[[Stewie Kills Lois]]\", when each family member exclaims \"Oh no!\" to the Judge's sentencing of Peter, the Kool-Aid Guy breaks through the courtroom wall yelling \"OH YEAH!\", then backs away awkwardly. In \"[[Peterotica]]\", he has an epiphany while sitting in his living room when a car crashes through his wall, which put him on the receiving end of the trademarked breaking wall for the first time. In \"[[Prick Up Your Ears (Family Guy)|Prick Up Your Ears]]\", after Stewie panics about the existence of the Tooth Fairy, Brian and Chris fail to calm Stewie, then Glenn Quagmire makes an attempt, then the Kool-Aid Guy is seen in a pair of boxing gloves at the back of a line of other characters. In \"[[The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair]]\", Evil Stewie lures him out by pretending to impersonate other people saying \"Oh no!\"; when he bursts through the wall, Evil Stewie shatters him with a baseball bat, and drinks up the spilled Kool-Aid. Thanks to Stewie's and Brian's interference, the Kool-Aid Guy misses his cue when they travel back to the events in \"Death Has a Shadow\" in \"[[Back to the Pilot]]\", when he shatters trying to back out of the courthouse. He is still able to yell at Stewie and Brian where he blamed them for messing things up. In \"[[Valentine's Day in Quahog]]\", the Kool-Aid Guy is with his parents when they meet his date in the form of an anthropomorphic [[Yoo-hoo]] bottle (much to his father's dismay). In \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", the Kool-Aid Guy attempts to break through the wall during a trial between Peter and [[Homer Simpson]] in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. However, he calls Peter to apologize that he \"went to the wrong [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]]\" as he broke through the wall of the courthouse there. This references the fact that the state in which ''The Simpsons'' version of Springfield is located has never been revealed.\n* '''Phineas and Barnaby''' \u2013 Two [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongmen]] that usually pursue two goals: working out at the Quahog Gym and riding high-wheel 'Penny Farthing' bicycles of the 1860s\u20131890s.\n* '''Tomik and Bellgarde''' (voiced by [[John Viener]] and Alec Sulkin) \u2013 Two foreign guys who have \"been living in the United States almost long enough to sound American\".

In \"[[Extra Large Medium]]\", they wonder how to celebrate Gerbitz Day, a holiday in their native country. In \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\", they participated in the musical number \"All I Really Want For Christmas\" where they revealed they do not know what Christmas is and that their home country has a similar holiday called \"Kishkev Fufleer\".

Vern will often perform a line or two of a song and then, either because he is finished or because his act is not going well, he asks Johnny to \"play me off\", at which point Johnny enthusiastically plays \"[[Galloping Gertie]]\" on the piano. They debut in the episode \"[[Holy Crap]]\" and perform in the talent show in \"[[Deep Throats]]\". They appear in two small boats connected by a rope by Carter Pewterschmidt's racing yacht in \"[[Model Misbehavior]]\".
