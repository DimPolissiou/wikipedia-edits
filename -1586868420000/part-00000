Their argument is that sequencing DNA is similar to scoring a baseball game, and that many computational biologists learned to think about science computations from an obsessive interest in baseball stats. The exercise of comparing a specific player's stats to a database of other similar players allows a baseball fan to predict future performance. This same system works with proteins and predicting functions. As tools are developed that break down and track all stats concerning baseball players, so will technology improve with genetics. With both baseball and genetics, tools are being developed that refine the models.<ref name=\"Fraser Eisen Baseball\">{{cite web|title=James Fraser & Michael Eisen: Baseball Meets Biology|url=https://www.ibiology.org/ibiomagazine/issue-6/james-fraser-michael-eisen-baseball-meets-biology.html|website=Education|publisher=iBiology|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>  In a lecture in 2015, Eisen stated that he received a computer from his grandfather for his twelfth birthday and spent the next five years teaching himself how to program so that he could keep track of baseball stats.<ref name=\"India Bio Science\">{{cite web|title=Michael Eisen: Baseball, mathematics and biology|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BACy6Lsi6-U|publisher=India Bio Science|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nHis academic research focuses on the [[evolution]] of [[gene regulation]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Eisen | first1 = M. \n| authorlink1 = Michael Eisen\n| last2 = Spellman | first2 = P. \n| last3 = Brown | first3 = P. \n| authorlink3 = Patrick O.

He is <!-- 8===8 --> a self-proclaimed [[Red Sox]] fanatic.<ref name=\"Mechanic Mother Jones\"/> He and computational biologist, James Fraser recorded a video for iBiology about the role baseball statistics influenced their research. Their argument is that sequencing DNA is similar to scoring a baseball game, and that many computational biologists learned to think about science computations from an obsessive interest in baseball stats. The exercise of comparing a specific player's stats to a database of other similar players allows a baseball fan to predict future performance. This same system works with proteins and predicting functions. As tools are developed that break down and track all stats concerning baseball players, so will technology improve with genetics. With both baseball and genetics, tools are being developed that refine the models.<ref name=\"Fraser Eisen Baseball\">{{cite web|title=James Fraser & Michael Eisen: Baseball Meets Biology|url=https://www.ibiology.org/ibiomagazine/issue-6/james-fraser-michael-eisen-baseball-meets-biology.html|website=Education|publisher=iBiology|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>  In a lecture in 2015, Eisen stated that he received a computer from his grandfather for his twelfth birthday and spent the next five years teaching himself how to program so that he could keep track of baseball stats.<ref name=\"India Bio Science\">{{cite web|title=Michael Eisen: Baseball, mathematics and biology|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BACy6Lsi6-U|publisher=India Bio Science|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 2002, Eisen was awarded the inaugural [[Benjamin Franklin Award (Bioinformatics)|Benjamin Franklin Award]] in bioinformatics, for his work on [[PLOS]] and the open-access availability of his microarray cluster analysis software.<ref name=\"franklin-award\">{{cite web|title=Benjamin Franklin Award - Bioinformatics.org|url=http://www.bioinformatics.org/franklin/|website=www.bioinformatics.org|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*[http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/ It is NOT junk - Personal blog of Michael Eisen]\n*[http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1967 Open letter to President Trump to replace [[Francis Collins]] as NIH Director]\n*[http://www.eisen2018.com/ Michael Eisen (I) for Senate]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{PLoS}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eisen, Michael}}\n[[Category:1967 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:21st-century American biologists]]\n[[Category:American bioinformaticians]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty]]\n[[Category:Howard Hughes Medical Investigators]]\n[[Category:Founders]]\n[[Category:Public Library of Science people]]\n", "name_user": "Amkilpatrick", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reordering.
