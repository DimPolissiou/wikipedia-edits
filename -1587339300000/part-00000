In the architectural boom that followed the [[Great Chicago Fire]], architects in what would become known as the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]] of commercial architecture competed with each other to create the world's first true skyscrapers.  By mixing modern building techniques, such as metal framing, fireproofing, elevators and plate glass, together with traditional ones, such as brick facades and elaborate ornamentation, Burnham and Root sought to create a bold architectural statement.  At the same time, they intended their buildings to be commercially successful.<ref name=therookery>{{cite book | last=Pridmore | first=Jay |author2=Hedrich Blessing  |\ntitle=The Rookery | publisher=Pomegranate Communications | year=2007 | isbn=0-7649-2306-4 }}</ref>  This building is one of the few results of their partnership that is still standing.<ref name=PW>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/chicago/the-rookery-us-il-rook.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2007|title=Chicago - The Rookery|publisher=PlanetWare Inc.|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nAs the master artisan, Root drew upon a variety of influences in designing the interior and exterior spaces, including [[Moorish]], [[Byzantine]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque]] motifs.<ref name=therookery/> He also provided the architectural innovations that brought together many contemporary cutting edge building techniques. Of particular note was a \"floating\" foundation\u2014a reinforced concrete slab that provided the building's weight with a solid platform atop Chicago's notoriously swampy soil.<ref name=therookery/>  The term for the type of foundation that Root designed is [[grillage foundation]], a foundation where iron rails and the structural beams are combined in a crisscross pattern and encased in concrete to support the building's immense weight without heavy foundation stones.<ref name=EMP/>  This construction is particularly useful when structural loads are high compared to the natural [[bearing capacity]] of the soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sereneinteriors.com/dictionaries/interior-design-dictionary-g.html|accessdate=May 26, 2007|year=2006|publisher=Serene Interiors|title=Dictionary of Interior Designing}}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n[[Image:Chicago rookery escalier face.jpg|thumb|225px|The Rookery's light court, redesigned by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1905, serves as a focal point for the entire building]]\n\n===Light court===\nMaking prodigious use of light and ornamentation, Root and Burnham designed a central light court to serve as the focal point for the entire building and provide daylight to interior offices.  Rising two stories, the light court received immediate critical acclaim. \"There is nothing bolder, more original, or more inspiring in modern civic architecture than its glass-covered court\", wrote Eastern critic Henry Van Brunt.<ref name=therookery/> At a time when Chicago's bold experiment in architecture was looking eastward for affirmation, this was welcome praise.<ref name=therookery/>  The light court provides natural illumination for the interior offices.<ref name=PS/><ref name=PW/>\n\n[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was a young architectural assistant working with [[Dankmar Adler|Adler]] and [[Louis Sullivan|Sullivan]] at the time the Rookery was built in 1888. Architect Daniel Burnham was a friend of Wright patron Edward  C. Waller.  Waller managed the Rookery; Wright had his offices in the building in 1898&ndash;1899.  In 1905 Wright received the commission to redesign the lobby in the building; at the time considered the grandest in Chicago.<ref name=ogorman/> Wright's work on the Rookery recast the entryway in his [[Prairie style]] and added a sense of modernity through his simple but effective lighting design.<ref name=ogorman>O'Gorman, Thomas J., ''Frank Lloyd Wright's Chicago'', Thunder Bay Press, San Diego: 2004, pp.189&ndash;193, ({{ISBN|1592231276}}).</ref> Wright's work on the Rookery is his only work on any building within the downtown cityscape.<ref name=ogorman/>\n\nAmong Wright's most significant alterations was the addition of white [[marble]] with [[Persian architecture|Persian]]-style ornamentation.

The building remains a commercially successful rental office building, as it was when it was first built.<ref name=therookery/>\n\nBeginning in the early 20th century, the building underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was retained to remake the interior spaces. In keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved [[Carrara]] marble surfaces. Wright was highly regarded by the public at this point, and his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery one of the most sought after buildings of Chicago.<ref name=therookery/> Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures.<ref name=EMP/>\n\nThe second renovation, completed August 24, 1931 by former Wright assistant William Drummond, modernized many of the interior elements, including new elevators, and brought period touches to the building, such as [[Art Deco]] detailing.<ref name=ogorman/> The third renovation, in 1992, brought the building back to much of its original splendor, reopening the light court ceiling after it had been covered over to protect against leaks.<ref name=therookery/>\n\nAfter their purchase of the Rookery in October 2007, the new owners announced plans for an extensive renovation of the building's common areas.<ref name=Trib_20071027_2_1/>  Award-winning state-of-the-art LED lighting was added to the exterior of the building in 2011 to highlight the architectural features and in 2014 The Rookery achieved LEED Gold certification.  In 2015 the restrooms were upgraded to marble-rich, five-star quality as well as a full-featured bike room was added.

In the architectural boom that followed the [[Great Chicago Fire]], architects in what would become known as the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]] of commercial architecture competed with each other to create the world's first true skyscrapers.  By mixing modern building techniques, such as metal framing, fireproofing, elevators and plate glass, together with traditional ones, such as brick facades and elaborate ornamentation, Burnham and Root sought to create a bold architectural statement.  At the same time, they intended their buildings to be commercially successful.<ref name=therookery>{{cite book | last=Pridmore | first=Jay |author2=Hedrich Blessing  |\ntitle=The Rookery | publisher=Pomegranate Communications | year=2007 | isbn=0-7649-2306-4 }}</ref>  This building is one of the few results of their partnership that is still standing.<ref name=PW>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/chicago/the-rookery-us-il-rook.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2007|title=Chicago - The Rookery|publisher=PlanetWare Inc.|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nAs the master artisan, Root drew upon a variety of influences in designing the interior and exterior spaces, including [[Moorish]], [[Byzantine]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque]] motifs.<ref name=therookery/> He also provided the architectural innovations that brought together many contemporary cutting edge building techniques.

Rising two stories, the light court received immediate critical acclaim. \"There is nothing bolder, more original, or more inspiring in modern civic architecture than its glass-covered court\", wrote Eastern critic Henry Van Brunt.<ref name=therookery/> At a time when Chicago's bold experiment in architecture was looking eastward for affirmation, this was welcome praise.<ref name=therookery/>  The light court provides natural illumination for the interior offices.<ref name=PS/><ref name=PW/>\n\n[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was a young architectural assistant working with [[Dankmar Adler|Adler]] and [[Louis Sullivan|Sullivan]] at the time the Rookery was built in 1888. Architect Daniel Burnham was a friend of Wright patron Edward  C. Waller.  Waller managed the Rookery; Wright had his offices in the building in 1898&ndash;1899.  In 1905 Wright received the commission to redesign the lobby in the building; at the time considered the grandest in Chicago.<ref name=ogorman/> Wright's work on the Rookery recast the entryway in his [[Prairie style]] and added a sense of modernity through his simple but effective lighting design.<ref name=ogorman>O'Gorman, Thomas J., ''Frank Lloyd Wright's Chicago'', Thunder Bay Press, San Diego: 2004, pp.189&ndash;193, ({{ISBN|1592231276}}).</ref> Wright's work on the Rookery is his only work on any building within the downtown cityscape.<ref name=ogorman/>\n\nAmong Wright's most significant alterations was the addition of white [[marble]] with [[Persian architecture|Persian]]-style ornamentation.

In the first, from 1905 to 1907, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was retained to remake the interior spaces. In keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved [[Carrara]] marble surfaces. Wright was highly regarded by the public at this point, and his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery one of the most sought after buildings of Chicago.<ref name=therookery/> Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures.<ref name=EMP/>\n\nThe second renovation, completed August 24, 1931 by former Wright assistant William Drummond, modernized many of the interior elements, including new elevators, and brought period touches to the building, such as [[Art Deco]] detailing.<ref name=ogorman/> The third renovation, in 1992, brought the building back to much of its original splendor, reopening the light court ceiling after it had been covered over to protect against leaks.<ref name=therookery/>\n\nAfter their purchase of the Rookery in October 2007, the new owners announced plans for an extensive renovation of the building's common areas.<ref name=Trib_20071027_2_1/>  Award-winning state-of-the-art LED lighting was added to the exterior of the building in 2011 to highlight the architectural features and in 2014 The Rookery achieved LEED Gold certification.

The only construction documents that exist are the contractor's blueprints, several measured studies for furniture and interior details, and a couple of perspective renderings. \"The Robie House of Frank Lloyd Wright,\" Connors, Joseph, University of Chicago Press, 1984, p. 46. The original blueprints, a survey of the Robie House lot, a set of the original specifications, the contractor's account book, and copies of 30 photographs of the house during construction are in the collection of the Department of Special Collections of the University of Chicago, donated in 1978 by William Bernard, the son of the original contractor, Harrison B.

See \"Down to Earth: An Insider's View of Frank Lloyd Wright's Tomek House,\" Moran, Maya, Southern Illinois University Press, 1995. One commentator has suggested that Wright's designs for the Yahara Boat Club of 1902 in Madison, Wisconsin, and the River Forest Tennis Club of 1906 in River Forest, Illinois, also served as design precedents for the Robie House. \"The Robie House of Frank Lloyd Wright,\" Connors, Joseph, University of Chicago Press, 1984, pp. 46-57.</ref> At the time that he commissioned Wright to design his home, Robie was only 28 years old and the assistant manager of the Excelsior Supply Company, a company on the South Side of Chicago owned and managed by his father. Although later drawings of the Robie House show a date of 1906, Wright could not have started the design for the building earlier than the spring of 1908 because Robie had actually purchased the property only in May of that year.<ref>Id., p. 6.</ref> He and his wife, Lora Hieronymus Robie, a 1900 graduate of the University of Chicago, had selected the property at 5757 South Woodlawn Avenue in order to remain close to the campus and the social life of the university.<ref>Id., pp. 5-6.</ref> The property was a typical urban lot in Hyde Park, measuring {{convert|60|ft|m}} by {{convert|180|ft|m}}.\n\nThe contractor for the project, H.B. Barnard Co. of Chicago, began construction on April 15, 1909.<ref>Id., p. 27.</ref> Wright did not supervise the construction of the house except in the earliest stages. He closed his Oak Park studio in the fall of 1909 and left for Europe to undertake the work which led to the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]]. He turned over his existing commissions to [[Hermann V. von Holst|Hermann von Holst]], who retained [[Marion Lucy Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], a draughtswoman in Wright's office, and George Mann Niedecken, an interior designer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin who had worked with Wright on the [[Dana-Thomas House|Susan Lawrence Dana House]] in Springfield, Illinois, the [[Coonley House|Avery Coonley House]] in Riverside, Illinois, and the [[Meyer May House]] in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to continue their work on the project.<ref>Id., pp. 32-33. For an in depth description of the working relationship between Wright and Niedecken in connection with the Robie House, see \"Frank Lloyd Wright and George Mann Niedecken: Prairie School Collaborators,\" Robertson, Cheryl, Milwaukee Art Museum and the Museum of Our National Heritage, 1999.</ref> Niedecken's influence can be seen in the design of some of the furnishings for the house as well as the carpets in the entrance hall, the living room, and the dining room.\n\nThe Robie family\u2014Frederick, Laura, and their two children, Frederick Jr. and Lorraine\u2014moved into the home in May 1910, although all of the final details, including rugs and furniture, were not completed until January 1911.<ref>Id., p. 34.</ref> The final cost of the home was $58,500--$13,500 for the land, $35,000 for the design and construction of the building, and $10,000 for the furnishings.<ref>Id., pp. 6, 14.</ref> (Simple inflation adjusted equivalents of $58,500 in 1910 hover around $1.5 million in 2015, although other ways of comparing price and value over time could place that figure as high as $10 million without accounting for any potential premium as a result of the historical fame of the house.)<ref>See [http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ The Inflation Calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718031608/http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ |date=2011-07-18 }}.

As a result of financial problems incurred by the death of his father in July 1908, who was plagued by gambling debts that Robie unknowingly inherited (allegedly totaling roughly $1 million, or the equivalent of $27 million today), and the deterioration of his marriage, Robie was forced to sell the house after living in it for only fourteen months.<ref>Id., p. 89. See also [http://www.antiquemotorcycle.org/TheMag/features/200802/flr_excelsior.html Frank Lloyd Wright and the Excelsior].</ref> David Lee Taylor, president of Taylor-Critchfield Company, an advertising agency, bought the house and all of its Wright-designed contents in December 1911. Taylor died less than a year later, and his widow, Ellen Taylor, sold the house and most of its contents to Marshall D. Wilber, treasurer of the Wilber Mercantile Agency, in November 1912. The Wilbers were the last family to live in Robie House, living there for fourteen years.<ref>Id. pp. 89-94.</ref>\n\nIn June 1926, the Wilbers sold the house and its contents to the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]], who used the house as a dormitory and dining hall although it was primarily interested in the site for purposes of future expansion.<ref>Id., p. 94.</ref> Consequently, Robie House suffered major interior damage, including the destruction of nearly all the characteristically gold wall sconces. Furthermore, at the time, a janitor discovered Wright's handcrafted rocking chair discarded in a trash heap and saved it. Years later, the janitor contacted the [[University of Chicago]] when the museum opened up and regifted the chair to Robie House, where it is currently on display in one of the bedrooms. In 1941, a graduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology accidentally discovered that the Seminary was moving ahead with a plan to demolish the Robie House and informed his instructors, including [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=\"smith\">Smith, \"How the Robie House was Saved,\" Frank Lloyd Wright Quarterly, pp. 4-19, vol. 19, no. 4 (Fall, 2008).</ref> The threat of demolition aroused a storm of protest. Although the Seminary's plans were subsequently postponed, the crisis was averted more by the onset of World War II than by acquiescence of the property's owner.\n\nThe most serious threat to the existence of the Robie House arose 16 years later. On March 1, 1957, the Seminary announced plans to demolish the Robie House on September 15 in order to begin the construction of a dormitory for its students.<ref>Id. See also \"The Frederick C. Robie House, Frank Lloyd Wright, Architect,\" The Prairie School Review, pp. 10-19, vol. IV, no. 4 (1967).</ref> This time an international outcry arose, and Wright himself, then 90 years old, returned to the Robie House on March 18, accompanied by the media, students and neighborhood organizers to protest the intended demolition of the house. Commenting on the threatened demolition, Wright quipped, \"It all goes to show the danger of entrusting anything spiritual to the clergy.\"<ref>Hoffman, p. 94. See \"Many Masks,\" Gill, Brendan, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1987, p. 494.</ref> Two fraternities at the University of Chicago provided the Seminary with a realistic alternative to its plans of demolition. During his very brief tenure as a student at the University of Wisconsin, Wright had been a member of the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity. The University of Chicago's Phi Delt chapter house was located two doors north of the Robie house at 5737 Woodlawn Avenue, and the Seminary was already the owner of the lot between the two properties. The Phi Delts offered to vacate their house, and the [[Zeta Beta Tau]] fraternity, located next to the Phi Delt house, offered to vacate their house as well. These offers were a turning point in the effort to save the Robie house since the three properties provided the Seminary with sufficient land for the dormitory they sought to build.<ref>Smith, pp. 14-15. Bob Miller, President Emeritus and now Historian of Phi Delta Theta confirmed that the chapter moved a block away to 5625 University Avenue in 1958.</ref>\n\nIn August 1958, [[William Zeckendorf]], a friend of Wright's and a New York real estate developer then involved in several development projects on Chicago's south side, acquired the Robie House at Wright's urging from the seminary through his development company Webb & Knapp.<ref name=\"smith\" /> In February 1963, Zeckendorf donated the building to the University of Chicago. The University used Robie House as the Adlai E. Stevenson Institute of International Affairs, and later the building served as the headquarters for the University's Alumni Association.<ref>Hoffman, p. 94. Prior to its use as the Adlai E. Stevenson Institute of International Affairs, the Robie House was partially restored between 1965 and 1967 under the direction of [[Walter Netsch]] of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]]. \"The Frederick C. Robie House, Frank Lloyd Wright, Architect,\" The Prairie School Review, pp. 10-19, vol. IV, no. 4 (1967).</ref> On September 15, 1971, the [[Commission on Chicago Landmarks]], with the support of Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], declared the Robie House a Chicago landmark.\n\nIn January 1997 the University moved their offices out and turned over tours, operations, fundraising and restoration to the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust on February 1.<ref>\"Conserving a Masterpiece: The Frederick C.

The horizontal lines of the new expression appeal to the disciples of this school as echoing the spirit of the prairies of the great Middle West, which to them embodies the essence of democracy.\") Although Wright used the term \"Prairie School\" in writings as early as 1936 (see ''Architect's Journal,'' London, 1936, reprinted in ''The Natural House,'' New York, 1954, p. 27), he referred to his work and that of other similarly inspired architects at the time as \"The New School of the Middle West\" in his noted article \"In the Cause of Architecture,\" ''The Architectural Record,'' March 1908. Wright believed that the American Mid-West, rather than the East Coast, was the appropriate breeding ground for an indigenous American architecture because residents of the East Coast were too suspectible to the influences of the Old World styles of Europe. Instead, <blockquote>[t]he real American spirit, capable of judging an issue for itself upon its merits, lies in the West and Middle West, where breadth of view, independent thought, and a tendency to take common sense into the realm of art, as in life, are more characteristic. ... The people themselves are part and parcel and helpful in producing the organic thing. They can comprehend it and make it theirs, and it is thus the only form art expression to be considered for a democracy, and I will go so far as to say, the truest of all forms.</blockquote> \"Ausgef\u00fchrte Bauten und Entw\u00fcrfe von Frank Lloyd Wright,\" Wright, Frank Lloyd, Ernst Wasmuth, Berlin, 1910.  For a discussion of Wright's conception of the New School of the Middle West, see generally \"Frank Lloyd Wright: His Life and His Architecture,\" Twombly, Robert C., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1979, pp. 106-109, 145-148, 158-163. For a discussion of the development and use of the term \"Prairie School,\" see \"The Prairie School: Frank Lloyd Wright and His Midwest Contemporaries,\" Brooks, H. Allen, W.W. Norton & Co., New York, 1972, pp. 9-13.</ref> Typical of Wright's Prairie houses, he designed not only the house, but all of the interiors, the windows, lighting, rugs, furniture and textiles. As Wright wrote in 1910, \"it is quite impossible to consider the building one thing and its furnishings another.  ... They are all mere structural details of its character and completeness.\"<ref>\"Ausgefuhrte Bauten und Entwurfe von Frank Lloyd Wright,\" Wright, Frank Lloyd, Ernst Wasmuth, Berlin, 1910, quoted in \"Frank Lloyd Wright's Dana House,\" Hoffman, Donald, Dover Publications, Inc., 1996.</ref>\n\n===Exterior===\nThe projecting [[cantilever]]ed roof eaves, continuous bands of art-glass windows, and the use of [[Roman brick]] emphasize the horizontal, which had rich associations for Wright. The horizontal line reminded him of the American prairie and was a line of repose and shelter, appropriate for a house.\nThe exterior walls are double-[[wythe]] construction of a Chicago common brick core with a red-orange iron-spotted Roman brick veneer. To further emphasize the horizontal of the bricks, the horizontal joints were filled with a cream-colored mortar and the small vertical joints were filled with brick-colored mortar. From a distance, this complex and expensive [[tuckpointing]] creates an impression of continuous lines of horizontal color and minimizes the appearance of individual bricks.\nThe design of the art glass windows is an abstract pattern of colored and clear glass using Wright's favorite 30 and 60-degree angles. Wright used similar designs in tapestries inside the house and for gates surrounding the outdoor spaces and enclosing the garage courtyard. \nRobie's generous budget allowed Wright to design a house with a largely steel structure, which accounts for the minimal deflection of the eaves.<ref name=\"Hoffman Robie House\">\"Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,\" Hoffman, Donald, Dover Publications, Inc., 1984.</ref>\nThe planter urns, copings, lintels, sills and other exterior trimwork are of [[Indiana Limestone|Bedford limestone]].\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:Chicago, robie house di frank lloyd wright, 1908-1910, ingresso 02 scale.jpg|thumb|Muted natural colors are used throughout]]\n[[File:Chicago, robie house di frank lloyd wright, 1908-1910, salone al primo piano, 01.jpg|thumb|The main hall showcases the lack of structural columns]]\n[[File:Chicago, robie house di frank lloyd wright, 1908-1910, camera al secondo piano, vetrata.jpg|thumb|Instead of stylized forms from Nature, a favorite Wright motif, geometric patterns are featured]]\nIn plan, the house is designed as two large rectangles that seem to slide by one another.<ref>[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/PDFs/200493.pdf National Register of Historic Places Inventory\u2014Nomination Form, Frederick C. Robie House], p. 16-18. Retrieved October 23, 2008.</ref> Mr. Wright referred to the rectangle on the southwest portion of the site, which contains the principal living spaces of the house, as \"the major vessel.\" On the first floor are the \"billiards\" room (west end) and children's playroom (east end). The billiards room provided access to a large walk-in safe and a storage area built underneath the front porch projection at the west end of the site. The billiards and playroom open into a small passage and doors near the center of the building to an enclosed garden on the south side of the building. Another door from the playroom opens into the courtyard on the east end of the site. On the second floor are the entry hall at the top of the central stairway, the living room (west end) and the dining room (east end). Built-in inglenook bench cabinetry originally separated the entry hallway from the living room. The living and dining rooms flow into one another along the south side of the building and open through a series of twelve French doors containing art glass panels to an exterior balcony running the length of the south side of the building that overlooks the enclosed garden. The west end of the living room contains a \"[[prow house#Prow window|prow]]\" with art glass windows and two art glass doors that open onto the west porch beneath the cantilevered roof. Wright intended that the users of the building move freely from the interior space to the exterior space.\n\nThe rectangle on the northeast portion of the site, called \"the minor vessel,\" contains the more functional and service-related rooms of the house. On the first floor is the main door and entrance hall (west end) from which a stairway leads to the second floor living and dining rooms. A half bath is located on the north side of the entrance hall. Further east are a coat closet and back stairway, the boiler room, laundry room, and coal storage room, followed by a small workshop, half bath, and a three-car garage. The westernmost bay of the garage originally contained a mechanic's pit, and the easternmost bay contained equipment to wash and clean automobiles. On the second floor of the minor vessel is a guest bedroom above the entrance hall and an adjoining full bath. East of the back stairway are the kitchen and butler's pantry, and the servants' sitting room. Two bedrooms and a full bathroom above the garage complete the quarters for the live-in servants.\n\nThe third floor overlaps the major and minor vessels in the center of the building. Wright referred to the third floor as the \"belvedere,\" the \"place in command of beautiful views.\" The south side of the third floor contains the master bedroom, dressing area, a full bathroom, and, through a small closet and an art glass door, a balcony facing south and west. Two additional bedrooms and a full bathroom are located on the north side of this floor. All of the windows on this level contain art glass panels. Dresser drawers are built into the walls of the bedrooms underneath the windows, and project into the eave spaces.\n\nThe entire building is approximately {{convert|9062|sqft|m2}}.\n\nThe chimney mass containing four fireplaces\u2014one in the billiards room, playroom, living room and master bedroom\u2014and the main stairway from the entrance hall to the second floor living and dining rooms rise through the center of the house, from which the rest of the building radiates. The chimney mass is constructed of the same brick and limestone as the exterior.\n\nThe front door and main entrance is partially hidden on the northwest side of the building beneath an overhanging balcony in order to create a sense of privacy and protection for the family. The entrance hall itself is low-ceilinged and dark, but the stairs to the second floor create a sense of anticipation as the visitor moves upward. Once upstairs, the light filled living and dining rooms create a sharp contrast to the dark entrance hall making the living and dining rooms seem even more special. These two rooms are separated by the central chimney mass, but the spaces are connected along their south sides, and the chimney mass has an opening above the fireplace through which the rooms are visually connected. These features unite the two spaces, creating an openness of plan which, for Wright, was a metaphor for the openness of American political and social life.\n\nAs with all Prairie houses, Wright designed the light fixtures for the Robie House. Throughout the house, wall sconces can be found in the shape of a hemispherical shade suspended beneath a square bronze fixture. On the second floor living and dining rooms, spherical globes within wooden squares are integrated into the ceiling trim, further tying the two spaces together visually. Soffit lighting running the length of the north and south sides of the living and dining rooms, as well as soffit lighting in the prows of the living and dining rooms, are covered with Wright-designed wooden grilles, backed with translucent colored glass diffusers. Because these lights are all independently operable, different effects can be created within these spaces. Finally, a Wright-designed table lamp with an art glass shade stood on a Wright-designed library table in the living room.\n\nThe steel beams in the ceilings and floors carry most of the building's weight to piers at the east and west ends. As a result, the exterior walls have little structural function, and thus are filled with doors and windows containing 174 art glass panels in 29 different designs. Instead of stylized forms from Nature, a favorite Wright motif, geometric forms predominate. The combination of so much glass and lack of internal structural columns resulted in an airy space that appeared larger than it is, accenting the open plan Wright favored.\n\n[[File:Chicago, robie house di frank lloyd wright, 1908-1910, bagno al secondo piano, 00.jpg|thumb|left|Adornment was kept to a minimum everywhere]]\nWright also designed the furniture, carpets, and textiles for most Prairie houses. However, Wright-designed furniture in the Robie House was only constructed for the entrance hall, the living and dining rooms, guest bedroom, and one bed for the third-floor bedrooms. Some of these pieces are attributed to Wright's interior design collaborator George Mann Niedecken. Robie's financial situation following his father's death may be the explanation for why the entire house was not furnished with furniture of Wright's designs. Most of the original furniture is currently in the collection of the [[Smart Museum of Art]] at the University of Chicago, although only the dining room table and chairs are on more or less permanent display.<ref>[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/smart/smart.pl?maker=wright&title=&accession=&materials=&curatorclass=&curatortype=&registrartype= Smart Museum of Art On-Line Database Project].

Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah.</ref> This publication featured most of Wright's designs, including those unbuilt, during his Oak Park years and brought them to the attention of students of the [[Bauhaus]] school in Germany and the [[De Stijl]] school in the Netherlands. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] among other great 20th Century architects, claimed Wright was a major influence on their careers. Mies van der Rohe later visited the Robie House and Wright's home ([[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]) in Spring Green, WI.\n\nThe architectural significance of the Robie House was probably best stated in a 1957 article in ''House and Home'' magazine:\n\n<blockquote>During the decades of eclecticism's triumph there were also many innovators\u2014less heralded than the fashionable practitioners, but exerting more lasting influence. Of these innovators, none could rival Frank Lloyd Wright. By any standard his Robie house was the House of the 1900s\u2014indeed the House of the Century.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Above all else, the Robie House is a magnificent work of art. But, in addition, the house introduced so many concepts in planning and construction that its full influence cannot be measured accurately for many years to come. Without this house, much of modern architecture as we know it today, might not exist.<ref>\"One Hundred Years of the American House,\" ''House and Home,'' May 1957, pp. 110 and 116, quoted in \"Frank Lloyd Wright: Master Builder,\" Pfeiffer, Bruce Brooks, Thames & Hudson, 1997, p. 72. Another commentator described the architectural significance of the Robie House as follows:<blockquote>Wright's [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]] of 1893 was already a synthesis of the practical with the beautiful in home building. By 1908 he was able to bring about, in the Robie House on the campus of the University of Chicago, what is for many Americans the finest work of art turned out by any of our architects in our history as a nation. In this house Wright blends the sonorous long lines of the machinelike form with a rich decorative effect that is ages old. Both the old and the new come together in this adult prairie house. Here for the first time since the days of our great colonial builders--Bulfinch, Jefferson, and McIntire--a man creates a home for Americans that can stand the test of international comparison. When his work was published in a sumptuous monograph in Berlin, Germany, in 1910, it was the design of the Robie House that caught everyone's eye. European builders had been enmeshed in their dependence on historical forms. Wright and the Robie House of 1908 showed them the way to the fundamental patterns of modern architectural expression. So much so, in fact, that even the extremes of cubistic modern architecture, the \"cigar-box covered with cold-cream\" style may be traced back to the influence of Wright's Robie House.</blockquote>\n\nKienitz, John Fabian, \"Fifty-Two Years of Frank Lloyd Wright's Progressivism,\" ''The Wisconsin Magazine of History,'' Vol. 29, No. 1 (Sept. 1945), p.&nbsp;64.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1956, ''The Archectural Record'' selected the Robie House as \"one of the seven most notable residences ever built in America.\"<ref>\"Frank Lloyd Wright: His Life and His Architecture,\" Twombly, Robert C., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1979, p. 384.</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the American Institute of Architects named Robie House among the Top All-Time Work of American Architects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek07/0413/0413n_polls.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217071702/http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek07/0413/0413n_polls.cfm |archivedate=2013-12-17 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the [[United States Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]] submitted the Robie house, along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties, to a tentative list for World Heritage Status.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/oia/topics/worldheritage/New_Tentative_List.htm DOI Secretary Kempthorne Selects New U.S. World Heritage Tentative List, National Park Service].

The lots to the south were vacant and afforded uninterrupted views to the [[Midway Plaisance]] parkland, one of the sites of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. To the west, a full block of vacant land separated the site from the growing University of Chicago campus, but by 1930 [[Rockefeller Chapel]] (1928), the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] (1928), and the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] (1930) buildings had been constructed.\n\nDirectly south across 58th Street from Robie House is the Charles M.

He closed his Oak Park studio in the fall of 1909 and left for Europe to undertake the work which led to the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]]. He turned over his existing commissions to [[Hermann V. von Holst|Hermann von Holst]], who retained [[Marion Lucy Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], a draughtswoman in Wright's office, and George Mann Niedecken, an interior designer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin who had worked with Wright on the [[Dana-Thomas House|Susan Lawrence Dana House]] in Springfield, Illinois, the [[Coonley House|Avery Coonley House]] in Riverside, Illinois, and the [[Meyer May House]] in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to continue their work on the project.<ref>Id., pp. 32-33.

As a result of financial problems incurred by the death of his father in July 1908, who was plagued by gambling debts that Robie unknowingly inherited (allegedly totaling roughly $1 million, or the equivalent of $27 million today), and the deterioration of his marriage, Robie was forced to sell the house after living in it for only fourteen months.<ref>Id., p. 89.

Taylor died less than a year later, and his widow, Ellen Taylor, sold the house and most of its contents to Marshall D. Wilber, treasurer of the Wilber Mercantile Agency, in November 1912. The Wilbers were the last family to live in Robie House, living there for fourteen years.<ref>Id. pp. 89-94.</ref>\n\nIn June 1926, the Wilbers sold the house and its contents to the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]], who used the house as a dormitory and dining hall although it was primarily interested in the site for purposes of future expansion.<ref>Id., p. 94.</ref> Consequently, Robie House suffered major interior damage, including the destruction of nearly all the characteristically gold wall sconces. Furthermore, at the time, a janitor discovered Wright's handcrafted rocking chair discarded in a trash heap and saved it. Years later, the janitor contacted the [[University of Chicago]] when the museum opened up and regifted the chair to Robie House, where it is currently on display in one of the bedrooms. In 1941, a graduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology accidentally discovered that the Seminary was moving ahead with a plan to demolish the Robie House and informed his instructors, including [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=\"smith\">Smith, \"How the Robie House was Saved,\" Frank Lloyd Wright Quarterly, pp. 4-19, vol. 19, no. 4 (Fall, 2008).</ref> The threat of demolition aroused a storm of protest. Although the Seminary's plans were subsequently postponed, the crisis was averted more by the onset of World War II than by acquiescence of the property's owner.\n\nThe most serious threat to the existence of the Robie House arose 16 years later. On March 1, 1957, the Seminary announced plans to demolish the Robie House on September 15 in order to begin the construction of a dormitory for its students.<ref>Id. See also \"The Frederick C. Robie House, Frank Lloyd Wright, Architect,\" The Prairie School Review, pp. 10-19, vol. IV, no. 4 (1967).</ref> This time an international outcry arose, and Wright himself, then 90 years old, returned to the Robie House on March 18, accompanied by the media, students and neighborhood organizers to protest the intended demolition of the house. Commenting on the threatened demolition, Wright quipped, \"It all goes to show the danger of entrusting anything spiritual to the clergy.\"<ref>Hoffman, p. 94. See \"Many Masks,\" Gill, Brendan, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1987, p. 494.</ref> Two fraternities at the University of Chicago provided the Seminary with a realistic alternative to its plans of demolition. During his very brief tenure as a student at the University of Wisconsin, Wright had been a member of the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity. The University of Chicago's Phi Delt chapter house was located two doors north of the Robie house at 5737 Woodlawn Avenue, and the Seminary was already the owner of the lot between the two properties. The Phi Delts offered to vacate their house, and the [[Zeta Beta Tau]] fraternity, located next to the Phi Delt house, offered to vacate their house as well. These offers were a turning point in the effort to save the Robie house since the three properties provided the Seminary with sufficient land for the dormitory they sought to build.<ref>Smith, pp. 14-15. Bob Miller, President Emeritus and now Historian of Phi Delta Theta confirmed that the chapter moved a block away to 5625 University Avenue in 1958.</ref>\n\nIn August 1958, [[William Zeckendorf]], a friend of Wright's and a New York real estate developer then involved in several development projects on Chicago's south side, acquired the Robie House at Wright's urging from the seminary through his development company Webb & Knapp.<ref name=\"smith\" /> In February 1963, Zeckendorf donated the building to the University of Chicago. The University used Robie House as the Adlai E. Stevenson Institute of International Affairs, and later the building served as the headquarters for the University's Alumni Association.<ref>Hoffman, p. 94. Prior to its use as the Adlai E.

The horizontal lines of the new expression appeal to the disciples of this school as echoing the spirit of the prairies of the great Middle West, which to them embodies the essence of democracy.\") Although Wright used the term \"Prairie School\" in writings as early as 1936 (see ''Architect's Journal,'' London, 1936, reprinted in ''The Natural House,'' New York, 1954, p. 27), he referred to his work and that of other similarly inspired architects at the time as \"The New School of the Middle West\" in his noted article \"In the Cause of Architecture,\" ''The Architectural Record,'' March 1908. Wright believed that the American Mid-West, rather than the East Coast, was the appropriate breeding ground for an indigenous American architecture because residents of the East Coast were too suspectible to the influences of the Old World styles of Europe. Instead, <blockquote>[t]he real American spirit, capable of judging an issue for itself upon its merits, lies in the West and Middle West, where breadth of view, independent thought, and a tendency to take common sense into the realm of art, as in life, are more characteristic. ... The people themselves are part and parcel and helpful in producing the organic thing. They can comprehend it and make it theirs, and it is thus the only form art expression to be considered for a democracy, and I will go so far as to say, the truest of all forms.</blockquote> \"Ausgef\u00fchrte Bauten und Entw\u00fcrfe von Frank Lloyd Wright,\" Wright, Frank Lloyd, Ernst Wasmuth, Berlin, 1910.  For a discussion of Wright's conception of the New School of the Middle West, see generally \"Frank Lloyd Wright: His Life and His Architecture,\" Twombly, Robert C., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1979, pp. 106-109, 145-148, 158-163. For a discussion of the development and use of the term \"Prairie School,\" see \"The Prairie School: Frank Lloyd Wright and His Midwest Contemporaries,\" Brooks, H. Allen, W.W. Norton & Co., New York, 1972, pp. 9-13.</ref> Typical of Wright's Prairie houses, he designed not only the house, but all of the interiors, the windows, lighting, rugs, furniture and textiles. As Wright wrote in 1910, \"it is quite impossible to consider the building one thing and its furnishings another.  ... They are all mere structural details of its character and completeness.\"<ref>\"Ausgefuhrte Bauten und Entwurfe von Frank Lloyd Wright,\" Wright, Frank Lloyd, Ernst Wasmuth, Berlin, 1910, quoted in \"Frank Lloyd Wright's Dana House,\" Hoffman, Donald, Dover Publications, Inc., 1996.</ref>\n\n===Exterior===\nThe projecting [[cantilever]]ed roof eaves, continuous bands of art-glass windows, and the use of [[Roman brick]] emphasize the horizontal, which had rich associations for Wright. The horizontal line reminded him of the American prairie and was a line of repose and shelter, appropriate for a house.\nThe exterior walls are double-[[wythe]] construction of a Chicago common brick core with a red-orange iron-spotted Roman brick veneer. To further emphasize the horizontal of the bricks, the horizontal joints were filled with a cream-colored mortar and the small vertical joints were filled with brick-colored mortar. From a distance, this complex and expensive [[tuckpointing]] creates an impression of continuous lines of horizontal color and minimizes the appearance of individual bricks.\nThe design of the art glass windows is an abstract pattern of colored and clear glass using Wright's favorite 30 and 60-degree angles. Wright used similar designs in tapestries inside the house and for gates surrounding the outdoor spaces and enclosing the garage courtyard. \nRobie's generous budget allowed Wright to design a house with a largely steel structure, which accounts for the minimal deflection of the eaves.<ref name=\"Hoffman Robie House\">\"Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House,\" Hoffman, Donald, Dover Publications, Inc., 1984.</ref>\nThe planter urns, copings, lintels, sills and other exterior trimwork are of [[Indiana Limestone|Bedford limestone]].\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:Chicago, robie house di frank lloyd wright, 1908-1910, ingresso 02 scale.jpg|thumb|Muted natural colors are used throughout]]\n[[File:Chicago, robie house di frank lloyd wright, 1908-1910, salone al primo piano, 01.jpg|thumb|The main hall showcases the lack of structural columns]]\n[[File:Chicago, robie house di frank lloyd wright, 1908-1910, camera al secondo piano, vetrata.jpg|thumb|Instead of stylized forms from Nature, a favorite Wright motif, geometric patterns are featured]]\nIn plan, the house is designed as two large rectangles that seem to slide by one another.<ref>[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/PDFs/200493.pdf National Register of Historic Places Inventory\u2014Nomination Form, Frederick C. Robie House], p. 16-18. Retrieved October 23, 2008.</ref> Mr. Wright referred to the rectangle on the southwest portion of the site, which contains the principal living spaces of the house, as \"the major vessel.\" On the first floor are the \"billiards\" room (west end) and children's playroom (east end). The billiards room provided access to a large walk-in safe and a storage area built underneath the front porch projection at the west end of the site. The billiards and playroom open into a small passage and doors near the center of the building to an enclosed garden on the south side of the building. Another door from the playroom opens into the courtyard on the east end of the site. On the second floor are the entry hall at the top of the central stairway, the living room (west end) and the dining room (east end). Built-in inglenook bench cabinetry originally separated the entry hallway from the living room. The living and dining rooms flow into one another along the south side of the building and open through a series of twelve French doors containing art glass panels to an exterior balcony running the length of the south side of the building that overlooks the enclosed garden. The west end of the living room contains a \"[[prow house#Prow window|prow]]\" with art glass windows and two art glass doors that open onto the west porch beneath the cantilevered roof. Wright intended that the users of the building move freely from the interior space to the exterior space.\n\nThe rectangle on the northeast portion of the site, called \"the minor vessel,\" contains the more functional and service-related rooms of the house. On the first floor is the main door and entrance hall (west end) from which a stairway leads to the second floor living and dining rooms. A half bath is located on the north side of the entrance hall. Further east are a coat closet and back stairway, the boiler room, laundry room, and coal storage room, followed by a small workshop, half bath, and a three-car garage. The westernmost bay of the garage originally contained a mechanic's pit, and the easternmost bay contained equipment to wash and clean automobiles. On the second floor of the minor vessel is a guest bedroom above the entrance hall and an adjoining full bath. East of the back stairway are the kitchen and butler's pantry, and the servants' sitting room. Two bedrooms and a full bathroom above the garage complete the quarters for the live-in servants.\n\nThe third floor overlaps the major and minor vessels in the center of the building. Wright referred to the third floor as the \"belvedere,\" the \"place in command of beautiful views.\" The south side of the third floor contains the master bedroom, dressing area, a full bathroom, and, through a small closet and an art glass door, a balcony facing south and west. Two additional bedrooms and a full bathroom are located on the north side of this floor. All of the windows on this level contain art glass panels. Dresser drawers are built into the walls of the bedrooms underneath the windows, and project into the eave spaces.\n\nThe entire building is approximately {{convert|9062|sqft|m2}}.\n\nThe chimney mass containing four fireplaces\u2014one in the billiards room, playroom, living room and master bedroom\u2014and the main stairway from the entrance hall to the second floor living and dining rooms rise through the center of the house, from which the rest of the building radiates. The chimney mass is constructed of the same brick and limestone as the exterior.\n\nThe front door and main entrance is partially hidden on the northwest side of the building beneath an overhanging balcony in order to create a sense of privacy and protection for the family. The entrance hall itself is low-ceilinged and dark, but the stairs to the second floor create a sense of anticipation as the visitor moves upward. Once upstairs, the light filled living and dining rooms create a sharp contrast to the dark entrance hall making the living and dining rooms seem even more special. These two rooms are separated by the central chimney mass, but the spaces are connected along their south sides, and the chimney mass has an opening above the fireplace through which the rooms are visually connected. These features unite the two spaces, creating an openness of plan which, for Wright, was a metaphor for the openness of American political and social life.\n\nAs with all Prairie houses, Wright designed the light fixtures for the Robie House. Throughout the house, wall sconces can be found in the shape of a hemispherical shade suspended beneath a square bronze fixture. On the second floor living and dining rooms, spherical globes within wooden squares are integrated into the ceiling trim, further tying the two spaces together visually. Soffit lighting running the length of the north and south sides of the living and dining rooms, as well as soffit lighting in the prows of the living and dining rooms, are covered with Wright-designed wooden grilles, backed with translucent colored glass diffusers. Because these lights are all independently operable, different effects can be created within these spaces. Finally, a Wright-designed table lamp with an art glass shade stood on a Wright-designed library table in the living room.\n\nThe steel beams in the ceilings and floors carry most of the building's weight to piers at the east and west ends. As a result, the exterior walls have little structural function, and thus are filled with doors and windows containing 174 art glass panels in 29 different designs. Instead of stylized forms from Nature, a favorite Wright motif, geometric forms predominate. The combination of so much glass and lack of internal structural columns resulted in an airy space that appeared larger than it is, accenting the open plan Wright favored.\n\n[[File:Chicago, robie house di frank lloyd wright, 1908-1910, bagno al secondo piano, 00.jpg|thumb|left|Adornment was kept to a minimum everywhere]]\nWright also designed the furniture, carpets, and textiles for most Prairie houses. However, Wright-designed furniture in the Robie House was only constructed for the entrance hall, the living and dining rooms, guest bedroom, and one bed for the third-floor bedrooms. Some of these pieces are attributed to Wright's interior design collaborator George Mann Niedecken. Robie's financial situation following his father's death may be the explanation for why the entire house was not furnished with furniture of Wright's designs. Most of the original furniture is currently in the collection of the [[Smart Museum of Art]] at the University of Chicago, although only the dining room table and chairs are on more or less permanent display.<ref>[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/smart/smart.pl?maker=wright&title=&accession=&materials=&curatorclass=&curatortype=&registrartype= Smart Museum of Art On-Line Database Project].

Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah.</ref> This publication featured most of Wright's designs, including those unbuilt, during his Oak Park years and brought them to the attention of students of the [[Bauhaus]] school in Germany and the [[De Stijl]] school in the Netherlands. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] among other great 20th Century architects, claimed Wright was a major influence on their careers. Mies van der Rohe later visited the Robie House and Wright's home ([[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]) in Spring Green, WI.\n\nThe architectural significance of the Robie House was probably best stated in a 1957 article in ''House and Home'' magazine:\n\n<blockquote>During the decades of eclecticism's triumph there were also many innovators\u2014less heralded than the fashionable practitioners, but exerting more lasting influence. Of these innovators, none could rival Frank Lloyd Wright. By any standard his Robie house was the House of the 1900s\u2014indeed the House of the Century.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Above all else, the Robie House is a magnificent work of art. But, in addition, the house introduced so many concepts in planning and construction that its full influence cannot be measured accurately for many years to come. Without this house, much of modern architecture as we know it today, might not exist.<ref>\"One Hundred Years of the American House,\" ''House and Home,'' May 1957, pp. 110 and 116, quoted in \"Frank Lloyd Wright: Master Builder,\" Pfeiffer, Bruce Brooks, Thames & Hudson, 1997, p. 72. Another commentator described the architectural significance of the Robie House as follows:<blockquote>Wright's [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]] of 1893 was already a synthesis of the practical with the beautiful in home building. By 1908 he was able to bring about, in the Robie House on the campus of the University of Chicago, what is for many Americans the finest work of art turned out by any of our architects in our history as a nation. In this house Wright blends the sonorous long lines of the machinelike form with a rich decorative effect that is ages old. Both the old and the new come together in this adult prairie house. Here for the first time since the days of our great colonial builders--Bulfinch, Jefferson, and McIntire--a man creates a home for Americans that can stand the test of international comparison. When his work was published in a sumptuous monograph in Berlin, Germany, in 1910, it was the design of the Robie House that caught everyone's eye. European builders had been enmeshed in their dependence on historical forms. Wright and the Robie House of 1908 showed them the way to the fundamental patterns of modern architectural expression. So much so, in fact, that even the extremes of cubistic modern architecture, the \"cigar-box covered with cold-cream\" style may be traced back to the influence of Wright's Robie House.</blockquote>\n\nKienitz, John Fabian, \"Fifty-Two Years of Frank Lloyd Wright's Progressivism,\" ''The Wisconsin Magazine of History,'' Vol. 29, No. 1 (Sept. 1945), p.&nbsp;64.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1956, ''The Archectural Record'' selected the Robie House as \"one of the seven most notable residences ever built in America.\"<ref>\"Frank Lloyd Wright: His Life and His Architecture,\" Twombly, Robert C., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1979, p. 384.</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the American Institute of Architects named Robie House among the Top All-Time Work of American Architects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek07/0413/0413n_polls.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217071702/http://info.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek07/0413/0413n_polls.cfm |archivedate=2013-12-17 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the [[United States Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]] submitted the Robie house, along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties, to a tentative list for World Heritage Status.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/oia/topics/worldheritage/New_Tentative_List.htm DOI Secretary Kempthorne Selects New U.S. World Heritage Tentative List, National Park Service].

To the east of the site and across a municipal service alley, a French Provincial style house for Nobel prize winning physicist [[Albert A. Michelson]] was built around 1923. The lots to the south were vacant and afforded uninterrupted views to the [[Midway Plaisance]] parkland, one of the sites of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. To the west, a full block of vacant land separated the site from the growing University of Chicago campus, but by 1930 [[Rockefeller Chapel]] (1928), the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] (1928), and the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] (1930) buildings had been constructed.\n\nDirectly south across 58th Street from Robie House is the Charles M.

The district hired [[Turner Construction]] to construct the school, designed by Fanning Howey. Liberty features a number of facilities, including eight athletic fields, a football stadium, two baseball fields, two softball fields, four tennis courts, a 1,800-seat main gymnasium, an auxiliary gymnasium, a choir rehearsal room, a band rehearsal room, and an 815-seat theater. The building has two academic wings, two stories tall, that fork out from the rest of the building. At the center of these two wings is a two-story library. Through a floor-to-ceiling glass wall, students are able to look into the library while passing by in the hallways on the first and second floor. The building's center houses the student services and administration area and is flanked on its east side by a reception area with many windows above, providing natural light. The buildings Visual Arts hall provides a connection to the academic wing and houses four studio classrooms, a kiln room, a photography lab, and a digital imaging lab. Another major space of the building is The Commons. This large space is mainly used for the Stars and Stripes cafe, the school cafeteria. The Commons also serves as a breakout space for school events. The school is painted in a color scheme of browns, yellows, and grays. The school colors of blue, silver, and white are incorporated throughout all areas of the building.

Al-Fia'atul-Baghiyyah, or \"the transgressing faction\", refers to a specific meaning; when two Muslim groups fight against each other, the group that is in the wrong is referred to as being \"the transgressing faction\". Whenever there was a call to fight the enemies of Islam, 'Ammar bin Yasir did not tarry, but instead hurried to join the ranks of the Muslim army - and so it was for him during the battles of the apostates, which occurred during the caliphate of abu bakr. 'Ammar left with the army of Khalid bin Al-Walid. They were to fight the army of Musailamah bin Habib, who was known by the title, \"the Liar\". Musailamah apostatized by claiming to be a prophet, and his people followed him, not so much because they believed him, but more from a sense of tribal pride. During the early stages of the battle, the Muslims were losing, and when the situation looked grim, 'Ammar bin Yasir stood on top of a stone and called out as loudly as he could: \"O Muslims, is it from Paradise that you are fleeing? I am 'Ammar bin Yasir ... gather around me\". He then rushed with his horse into the heart of the enemy's army, advancing with no intention of retreating. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar later said, \"I saw 'Ammar bin Yasir on the Day of Al-Yamamah (the said battle) fighting intrepidly and skillfully. And I saw his ear; it had been cut off and was making a sound (perhaps as it was dangling)\".

And even after the Prophet's death, 'Ammar continued to fight in the way of Allah until the very end; after all, the Prophet foretold that he was to die during battle, at the hands of a transgressing faction. Al-Fia'atul-Baghiyyah, or \"the transgressing faction\", refers to a specific meaning; when two Muslim groups fight against each other, the group that is in the wrong is referred to as being \"the transgressing faction\". Whenever there was a call to fight the enemies of Islam, 'Ammar bin Yasir did not tarry, but instead hurried to join the ranks of the Muslim army - and so it was for him during the battles of the apostates, which occurred during the caliphate of abu bakr. 'Ammar left with the army of Khalid bin Al-Walid. They were to fight the army of Musailamah bin Habib, who was known by the title, \"the Liar\". Musailamah apostatized by claiming to be a prophet, and his people followed him, not so much because they believed him, but more from a sense of tribal pride. During the early stages of the battle, the Muslims were losing, and when the situation looked grim, 'Ammar bin Yasir stood on top of a stone and called out as loudly as he could: \"O Muslims, is it from Paradise that you are fleeing? I am 'Ammar bin Yasir ... gather around me\". He then rushed with his horse into the heart of the enemy's army, advancing with no intention of retreating. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar later said, \"I saw 'Ammar bin Yasir on the Day of Al-Yamamah (the said battle) fighting intrepidly and skillfully. And I saw his ear; it had been cut off and was making a sound (perhaps as it was dangling)\".
