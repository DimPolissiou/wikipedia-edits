[[Absolute monarchy]] (such as [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Oman]], [[Brunei]] and [[Eswatini]]) and [[dictatorships]] (also including [[North Korea]]) are the main modern day forms of autocracy.\n|\n* [[Aztec Empire]]\n* [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)]]\n* [[Saudi Arabia]]\n* [[Brunei]]\n|-\n|[[Democracy]]\n|Democracy, meaning \"rule of the people\", is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a [[parliament]]. Democracy is sometimes referred to as \"rule of the majority\". Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes. This includes citizens being able to vote for different laws and leaders.\n|\n* [[India]]\n* [[Indonesia]]\n* [[Nigeria]]\n* [[Germany]]\n*[[United States]]\n|-\n|[[Oligarchy]]\n|Oligarchy, meaning \"rule of the few\", is a form of [[power structure]] in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] rests with a small number of people. These people might be distinguished by [[nobility]], [[wealth]], [[family ties]], [[education]] or [[corporate]], [[religious]] or [[military]] control. Such states are often controlled by families who typically pass their influence from one [[generation]] to the next, but [[inheritance]] is not a necessary condition for the application of this term.\n|\n* [[Apartheid|South Africa (1948-early 1990s)]]\n|}\n\n=== Types of democracy ===\n{{further|Outline of democracy}}\nIn [[Democracy|democracies]], large proportions of the population are provided the means either to make decisions themselves or to elect representatives to make those decisions instead. Usually, though not necessarily (see Demarchy), this means voting.  Significant in most vote-based democracies are political parties: groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties will have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. \n \n''Note: These categories are not exclusive.''\n\nMany democracies are vulnerable to various forms of abuse, which may transform the government into an autocracy or oligarchy. Most autocracies or oligarchies still call themselves democracies.

These groups, sometimes termed \"policy juries\", \"citizens' juries\", or \"consensus conferences\", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that [[jury|juries]] decide criminal cases. Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional [[representative democracy]], which is widely subject to manipulation by [[special interests]] and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher [[John Burnheim]], random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.\n\nMore generally, random selection of decision makers from a larger group is known as [[sortition]] (from the Latin base for lottery). The [[Athenian democracy]] made much use of sortition, with nearly all government offices filled by lottery (of full citizens) rather than by election. Candidates were almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of wealth and status.\n|\n* Ancient Athens<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian democracy in the age of Demosthenes : structure, principles, and ideology|last=Hansen, Mogens Herman, 1940-|date=1999|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=1853995851|edition=[2nd ed.]|location=[Bristol]|oclc=45392658}}</ref>\n* Northern Italy and Venice (12th\u201318th century)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The political potential of sortition a study of the random selection of citizens for public office / Oliver Dowlen.|last=Dowlen, Oliver, 1953-|date=2008|publisher=Exeter, UK ; Charlottesville, VA|isbn=9781845401795|oclc=213307148}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Direct democracy]] || Variant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves and vote directly for new laws and public policy.\n|[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]\n|-\n|[[Electocracy]]|| Variant of democracy; a form of representative democracy where citizens are able to vote for their government but cannot participate directly in governmental decision making and where the government does not share any power almost as the government has absolute power\n|\n* [[Iraq]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/09/05/hypocrisy_in_sowing_democracy/|title=Hypocrisy in sowing democracy|last=Greenway|first=H.

It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]] or [[Spain]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], or [[Portugal]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], or [[New Zealand]]).\n|\n* [[India]]\n* [[Germany]]\n* [[United Kingdom]]\n* [[Indonesia]]\n|-\n|[[Liquid democracy]]  ||\nVariant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves or choose to temporarily delegate their vote to another voter to vote for new laws and public policy.\n|Experiments have mostly been conducted on a local-level or exclusively through online platforms\n|-\n| [[Representative democracy]] || Variant of democracy; wherein the people or citizens of a country elect representatives to create and implement public policy in place of active participation by the people.\n|Almost all democratic systems\n|-\n| [[Social democracy]] || Variant of democracy; social democracy rejects the \"either/or\" phobiocratic/polarization interpretation of capitalism versus socialism. Social democracy argues that all citizens should be legally entitled to certain social rights. These are made up of universal access to public services such as: education, health care, workers' compensation, public transportation, and other services including child care and care for the elderly. Social democracy is connected with the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers. Contemporary social democracy advocates freedom from discrimination based on differences of: ability/disability, age, ethnicity, sex, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and social class.\n|\n* [[Germany]]\n* [[Austria]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbuch der \u00f6sterreichischen Wirtschaftspolitik|last=Abele|first=Hanns|publisher=Manz|others=|year=1982|isbn=3214070509|location=Wien|page=145|oclc=10694901}}</ref>\n* [[Sweden]]\n* [[Norway]]\n* [[Denmark]]\n* [[Finland]]\n* [[Iceland]]\n|-\n| [[Soviet democracy]] || Variant of democracy; The citizens are governing by directly elected councils. The councils are directly responsible to their electors and are bound by their instructions. Such an imperative mandate is in contrast to a free mandate, in which the elected delegates are only responsible to their conscience. Delegates may accordingly be dismissed from their post at any time or be voted out (recall).\n|In some degree the final years of the Russian Empire, and early years of the Soviet Union\n|-\n|[[Totalitarian democracy]]|| Variant of democracy; a form of electocracy in which lawfully elected representatives maintain the integrity of a nation state whose citizens, while granted the right to vote, have little or no participation in the decision-making process of the government.\n|\n* [[German Democratic Republic]]\n|}\n\n=== Types of oligarchy ===\n[[Oligarchy|Oligarchies]] are societies controlled and organised by a small ''class'' of privileged people, with no intervention from the most part of society; this small elite is defined as sharing some common trait.\n\n''[[De jure]]'' democratic governments with a ''[[de facto]]'' oligarchy are ruled by a small group of segregated, powerful or influential people who usually share similar interests or family relations. These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.\n\nSome historical examples of oligarchy are the [[Roman Republic]], in which only males of the nobility could run for office and only wealthy males could vote, and the [[Athenian democracy]], which used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status. Some critics of [[capitalism]] and/or [[representative democracy]] think of [[Oligarchy#United States|the United States and the United Kingdom as oligarchies]].\n\n''Note: These categories are not exclusive.''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n|[[Aristocracy]]\n|Rule by the nobility; a system of governance where political power is in the hands of a small class of privileged individuals who claim a higher birth than the rest of society.\n|-\n|[[Ergatocracy]]\n|Rule by the [[proletariat]], the workers, or the working class. Examples of ergatocracy include communist revolutionaries and rebels which control most of society and create an alternative economy for people and workers. See [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n|-\n| [[Geniocracy]] || Rule by the intelligent; a system of governance where creativity, innovation, intelligence and wisdom are required for those who wish to govern.

A portmanteau of Internet and aristocracy, netocracy refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a bourgeoisie of a gradually diminishing importance. The netocracy concept has been compared with [[Richard Florida]]'s concept of the [[creative class]]. Bard and S\u00f6derqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the [[netocracy]], which they refer to as the consumitariat.\n|-\n|[[Noocracy]]\n|Rule by the wise; a system of governance in which decision making is in the hands of philosophers. (advocated by [[Plato]])\n|-\n| [[Plutocracy]] || Rule by the wealthy; a system wherein governance is indebted to, dependent upon or heavily influenced by the desires of the rich. Plutocratic influence can alter any form of government. For instance, in a republic, if a significant number of elected representative positions are dependent upon financial support from wealthy sources, it is a plutocratic republic.\n|-\n|[[Particracy]]\n|Rule by a dominant [[political party]] (or parties).\n|-\n|[[Stratocracy]]\n|Rule by military service; a system of governance composed of military government in which the state and the military are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity. Citizens with mandatory or voluntary active military service or who have been honorably discharged have the right to govern. (Therefore, stratocracy is not to be confused with \"[[military junta]]\" or \"[[military dictatorship]]\".) The [[Sparta]]n [[city-state]] is a historical example; its social system and constitution were completely focused on military training and excellence. Stratocratic ideology often attaches to the honor-oriented [[timocracy]].\n|-\n| [[Technocracy]] || Rule by the educated or technical experts; a system of governance where people who are skilled or proficient govern in their respective areas of expertise in technology would be in control of all decision making. Doctors, engineers, scientists, professionals and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills would compose the governing body instead of politicians, businessmen and economists.<ref>Ernst R. Berndt, (1982).[http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2023/SWP-1353-09057784.pdf \"From Technocracy To Net Energy Analysis: Engineers, Economists And Recurring Energy Theories Of Value\"], Studies in Energy and the American Economy, Discussion Paper No. 11, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Revised September 1982</ref> In a technocracy, decision makers would be selected based upon how knowledgeable and skillful they are in their field.\n|-\n|[[Theocracy]]\n|Rule by a religious elite; a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity. [[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.\n|-\n| [[Timocracy]] || Rule by the [[honour]]able; a system of governance ruled by honorable citizens and property owners. [[Socrates]] defines a timocracy as a government ruled by people who love honour and are selected according to the degree of honour they hold in society. This form of timocracy is very similar to [[meritocracy]], in the sense that individuals of outstanding character or faculty are placed in the seat of power.\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Types of autocracy ===\n[[Autocracy|Autocracies]] are ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in a [[dictatorship]] or it may be a group, as in a [[one-party state]]. The word [[despotism]] means to \"rule in the fashion of despots\" and is often used to describe autocracy.\n\nHistorical examples of autocracy include the [[Roman Empire]], [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Dictatorship|Civilian Dictatorship]] || A dictatorship where power resides in the hands of one single person or [[polity]]. That person may be, for example, an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] or a [[dictatorship|dictator]], but can also be an elected [[President (government title)|president]]. The [[Roman Republic]] made dictators to lead during times of war; but the Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, an autocrat's rule is one that not stopped by any rules of law, [[constitution]]s, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by autocratic governments. Examples of dictators include: [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]].\n|-\n| [[Military dictatorship|Military Dictatorship]] ||A dictatorship primarily enforced by the military. Military dictators are different from [[Civilian dictatorship|civilian dictators]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \u201cneutral\u201d arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many juntas adopt titles, such as \u201cNational Redemption Council\", \u201cCommittee of National Restoration\", or \u201cNational Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of them as the head. \n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pejorative attributes ===\nRegardless of the form of government, the actual governance may be influenced by sectors with [[Power (social and political)|political power]] which are not part of the formal government.

In strict terms kleptocracy is not a form of government but a characteristic of a government engaged in such behavior. Examples include Mexico as being considered a \"narcokleptocracy\", ([[narco-state]]) since its democratic government is perceived to be corrupted by those who profit from trade in illegal drugs smuggled into the United States.\n|-\n| [[Nepotism|Nepotocracy]] || Rule by nephews; [[In-group favoritism|favouritism]] granted to [[Kinship|relatives]] regardless of [[:wikt:merit|merit]]; a system of governance in which importance is given to the relatives of those already in power, like a ''nephew'' (where the word comes from). In such governments even if the relatives aren't qualified they are given positions of authority just because they know someone who already has authority. [[Pope Alexander VI]] ([[Borgia]]) was accused of this.\n|-\n| [[Ochlocracy]] || Rule by the crowd; a system of governance where mob rule is government by mob or a mass of people, or the [[intimidation]] of legitimate authorities. As a pejorative for [[majoritarianism]], it is akin to the [[Latin]] phrase ''mobile vulgus'' meaning \"the fickle crowd\", from which the English term \"mob\" was originally derived in the 1680s. Ochlocratic governments are often a democracy spoiled by [[demagoguery]], \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\" and the rule of passion over reason; such governments can be as oppressive as autocratic tyrants.

For example, a 2010 [[International Alert]] publication defined anocracies as \"countries that are neither autocratic nor democratic, most of which are making the risky transition between autocracy and democracy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/MDG.pdf|title=Working with the Grain to Change the Grain: Moving Beyond the Millennium Development Goals|publisher=[[International Alert]]|location=London|date=September 2010|last=Vernon|first=Phil|last2=Baksh|first2=Deborrah|page=29|accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref> Alert noted that the number of anocracies had increased substantially since the end of the Cold War. Anocracy is not surprisingly the least resilient political system to short-term shocks: it creates the promise but not yet the actuality of an inclusive and effective political economy, and threatens members of the established elite; and is therefore very vulnerable to disruption and armed violence.\n|-\n|[[Band society]]\n|Rule by a government based on small (usually family) unit with a semi-informal hierarchy, with strongest (either physical strength or strength of character) as leader.

A constitution is normally used so the people of that government has civil and ethical rights. \n|-\n|[[Monarchy]]\n|A monarchy is a [[form of government]] in which a group, generally a family representing a [[dynasty]], embodies the country's [[national identity]] and its head, the [[monarch]], exercises the role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ([[crowned republic]]), to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]), to completely autocratic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally the monarch's post is [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] and lasts until death or abdication. In contrast, [[Elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] require the monarch to be elected. Both types have further variations as there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. For example, in some<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Avoid weasel words|which?]]'']</sup>elected monarchies only pedigrees are taken into account for eligibility of the next ruler, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, etc. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is subject to effective election. There have been cases where the term of a monarch's [[reign]] is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance.\n|-\n|[[Republic]]\n|A republic ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''[[res publica]]'') is a [[form of government]] in which the country is considered a \"public matter\", not the [[Res privata|private concern or property]] of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited, but are attained through elections expressing the [[consent of the governed]]. Such leadership positions are therefore expected to fairly represent the citizen body. It is a form of government under which the head of state is not a [[monarch]]. In American English, the definition of a republic can also refer specifically to a government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body, also known as a [[representative democracy]] (a [[democratic republic]]) and exercise power according to the [[rule of law]] (a [[Constitutionalism|constitutional]] republic).\n|}\n\n==== Types of monarchy ====\nCountries with [[monarchy]] attributes are those where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Absolute monarchy]] || A traditional and historical system where the monarch exercises ultimate governing authority as [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

Typically, laws cannot be passed which violate said constitution, unless the constitution itself is altered by law.

Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom belonged to the king. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.\nA similar system is the [[Iqta]], used by medieval [[Islamic]] societies of the middle east and north Africa. This functioned much like the feudal system but generally had titles that weren't granted to a family dynasty but to individuals at the behest of the sultan and generally only required a tax from the lower classes, instead of military service and/or manual labour like in the feudal system.\n|-\n|[[Minarchism]]\n|A variant of [[capitalism]] which advocates for the [[State (polity)|State]] to exist solely to provide a very small number of services. A popular model of the State proposed by minarchists is known as the [[night-watchman state]], in which the only governmental functions are to protect citizens from [[aggression]], [[theft]], [[breach of contract]], and [[fraud]] as defined by [[property law]]s, limiting it to three institutions: the [[military]], the [[police]], and [[courts]].\n|-\n|[[Monarchism]]\n|A system in which the government is headed by an agreed upon head of the [[nobility]] who is known as the [[monarch]], usually in the form of a [[king]] or [[emperor]] (but also less commonly a [[Queen regnant|queen]] or empress). In most monarchical systems the position of monarch is one [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] from a previous ruler by [[Heredity|bloodline]] or marriage, but in other cases it may be a position elected by the [[nobility]] themselves, as was the case in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]] and the medieval [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n|-\n|[[Republicanism]]\n|A system in which the laws and governmental policies of the state are considered a \"public matter\" and decided by the citizens of the society, whoever they may be.

This is the same thing as a [[Federation|federal government]] which may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states, though the adjective 'central' is sometimes used to describe it. The structure of central governments varies. Many countries have created autonomous regions by delegating powers from the central government to governments at a sub national level, such as a regional, state or local level. Based on a broad definition of a basic political system, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a [[constitution]] or other law.\n|-\n|[[City-state|City-State]]\n|A [[sovereign state]], also described as a type of small independent country, that usually consists of a single city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as [[Rome]], [[Athens]], [[Carthage]], and the [[Italian city-states]] during the [[Renaissance]]. Today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies currently to [[Singapore]], [[Monaco]], and [[Vatican City]].

Democracy is sometimes referred to as \"rule of the majority\".

Usually, though not necessarily (see Demarchy), this means voting.  Significant in most vote-based democracies are political parties: groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties will have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. \n \n''Note: These categories are not exclusive.''\n\nMany democracies are vulnerable to various forms of abuse, which may transform the government into an autocracy or oligarchy. Most autocracies or oligarchies still call themselves democracies.

These groups, sometimes termed \"policy juries\", \"citizens' juries\", or \"consensus conferences\", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that [[jury|juries]] decide criminal cases. Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional [[representative democracy]], which is widely subject to manipulation by [[special interests]] and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher [[John Burnheim]], random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.\n\nMore generally, random selection of decision makers from a larger group is known as [[sortition]] (from the Latin base for lottery). The [[Athenian democracy]] made much use of sortition, with nearly all government offices filled by lottery (of full citizens) rather than by election. Candidates were almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of wealth and status.\n|\n* Ancient Athens<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian democracy in the age of Demosthenes : structure, principles, and ideology|last=Hansen, Mogens Herman, 1940-|date=1999|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=1853995851|edition=[2nd ed.]|location=[Bristol]|oclc=45392658}}</ref>\n* Northern Italy and Venice (12th\u201318th century)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The political potential of sortition a study of the random selection of citizens for public office / Oliver Dowlen.|last=Dowlen, Oliver, 1953-|date=2008|publisher=Exeter, UK ; Charlottesville, VA|isbn=9781845401795|oclc=213307148}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Direct democracy]] || Variant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves and vote directly for new laws and public policy.\n|[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]\n|-\n|[[Electocracy]]|| Variant of democracy; a form of representative democracy where citizens are able to vote for their government but cannot participate directly in governmental decision making and where the government does not share any power almost as the government has absolute power\n|\n* [[Iraq]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/09/05/hypocrisy_in_sowing_democracy/|title=Hypocrisy in sowing democracy|last=Greenway|first=H.

It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]] or [[Spain]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], or [[Portugal]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], or [[New Zealand]]).\n|\n* [[India]]\n* [[Germany]]\n* [[United Kingdom]]\n* [[Indonesia]]\n|-\n|[[Liquid democracy]]  ||\nVariant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves or choose to temporarily delegate their vote to another voter to vote for new laws and public policy.\n|Experiments have mostly been conducted on a local-level or exclusively through online platforms\n|-\n| [[Representative democracy]] || Variant of democracy; wherein the people or citizens of a country elect representatives to create and implement public policy in place of active participation by the people.\n|Almost all democratic systems\n|-\n| [[Social democracy]] || Variant of democracy; social democracy rejects the \"either/or\" phobiocratic/polarization interpretation of capitalism versus socialism. Social democracy argues that all citizens should be legally entitled to certain social rights. These are made up of universal access to public services such as: education, health care, workers' compensation, public transportation, and other services including child care and care for the elderly. Social democracy is connected with the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers. Contemporary social democracy advocates freedom from discrimination based on differences of: ability/disability, age, ethnicity, sex, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and social class.\n|\n* [[Germany]]\n* [[Austria]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbuch der \u00f6sterreichischen Wirtschaftspolitik|last=Abele|first=Hanns|publisher=Manz|others=|year=1982|isbn=3214070509|location=Wien|page=145|oclc=10694901}}</ref>\n* [[Sweden]]\n* [[Norway]]\n* [[Denmark]]\n* [[Finland]]\n* [[Iceland]]\n|-\n| [[Soviet democracy]] || Variant of democracy; The citizens are governing by directly elected councils.

These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.\n\nSome historical examples of oligarchy are the [[Roman Republic]], in which only males of the nobility could run for office and only wealthy males could vote, and the [[Athenian democracy]], which used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status. Some critics of [[capitalism]] and/or [[representative democracy]] think of [[Oligarchy#United States|the United States and the United Kingdom as oligarchies]].\n\n''Note: These categories are not exclusive.''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n|[[Aristocracy]]\n|Rule by the nobility; a system of governance where political power is in the hands of a small class of privileged individuals who claim a higher birth than the rest of society.\n|-\n|[[Ergatocracy]]\n|Rule by the [[proletariat]], the workers, or the working class.

A portmanteau of Internet and aristocracy, netocracy refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a bourgeoisie of a gradually diminishing importance. The netocracy concept has been compared with [[Richard Florida]]'s concept of the [[creative class]]. Bard and S\u00f6derqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the [[netocracy]], which they refer to as the consumitariat.\n|-\n|[[Noocracy]]\n|Rule by the wise; a system of governance in which decision making is in the hands of philosophers. (advocated by [[Plato]])\n|-\n| [[Plutocracy]] || Rule by the wealthy; a system wherein governance is indebted to, dependent upon or heavily influenced by the desires of the rich. Plutocratic influence can alter any form of government. For instance, in a republic, if a significant number of elected representative positions are dependent upon financial support from wealthy sources, it is a plutocratic republic.\n|-\n|[[Particracy]]\n|Rule by a dominant [[political party]] (or parties).\n|-\n|[[Stratocracy]]\n|Rule by military service; a system of governance composed of military government in which the state and the military are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity. Citizens with mandatory or voluntary active military service or who have been honorably discharged have the right to govern. (Therefore, stratocracy is not to be confused with \"[[military junta]]\" or \"[[military dictatorship]]\".) The [[Sparta]]n [[city-state]] is a historical example; its social system and constitution were completely focused on military training and excellence. Stratocratic ideology often attaches to the honor-oriented [[timocracy]].\n|-\n| [[Technocracy]] || Rule by the educated or technical experts; a system of governance where people who are skilled or proficient govern in their respective areas of expertise in technology would be in control of all decision making. Doctors, engineers, scientists, professionals and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills would compose the governing body instead of politicians, businessmen and economists.<ref>Ernst R. Berndt, (1982).[http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2023/SWP-1353-09057784.pdf \"From Technocracy To Net Energy Analysis: Engineers, Economists And Recurring Energy Theories Of Value\"], Studies in Energy and the American Economy, Discussion Paper No. 11, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Revised September 1982</ref> In a technocracy, decision makers would be selected based upon how knowledgeable and skillful they are in their field.\n|-\n|[[Theocracy]]\n|Rule by a religious elite; a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity. [[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.\n|-\n| [[Timocracy]] || Rule by the [[honour]]able; a system of governance ruled by honorable citizens and property owners. [[Socrates]] defines a timocracy as a government ruled by people who love honour and are selected according to the degree of honour they hold in society. This form of timocracy is very similar to [[meritocracy]], in the sense that individuals of outstanding character or faculty are placed in the seat of power.\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Types of autocracy ===\n[[Autocracy|Autocracies]] are ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in a [[dictatorship]] or it may be a group, as in a [[one-party state]]. The word [[despotism]] means to \"rule in the fashion of despots\" and is often used to describe autocracy.\n\nHistorical examples of autocracy include the [[Roman Empire]], [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Dictatorship|Civilian Dictatorship]] || A dictatorship where power resides in the hands of one single person or [[polity]]. That person may be, for example, an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] or a [[dictatorship|dictator]], but can also be an elected [[President (government title)|president]]. The [[Roman Republic]] made dictators to lead during times of war; but the Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, an autocrat's rule is one that not stopped by any rules of law, [[constitution]]s, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by autocratic governments. Examples of dictators include: [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]].\n|-\n| [[Military dictatorship|Military Dictatorship]] ||A dictatorship primarily enforced by the military. Military dictators are different from [[Civilian dictatorship|civilian dictators]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \u201cneutral\u201d arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many juntas adopt titles, such as \u201cNational Redemption Council\", \u201cCommittee of National Restoration\", or \u201cNational Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of them as the head. \n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pejorative attributes ===\nRegardless of the form of government, the actual governance may be influenced by sectors with [[Power (social and political)|political power]] which are not part of the formal government.

A constitution is normally used so the people of that government has civil and ethical rights. \n|-\n|[[Monarchy]]\n|A monarchy is a [[form of government]] in which a group, generally a family representing a [[dynasty]], embodies the country's [[national identity]] and its head, the [[monarch]], exercises the role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ([[crowned republic]]), to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]), to completely autocratic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally the monarch's post is [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] and lasts until death or abdication. In contrast, [[Elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] require the monarch to be elected. Both types have further variations as there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. For example, in some<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Avoid weasel words|which?]]'']</sup>elected monarchies only pedigrees are taken into account for eligibility of the next ruler, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, etc. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is subject to effective election. There have been cases where the term of a monarch's [[reign]] is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance.\n|-\n|[[Republic]]\n|A republic ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''[[res publica]]'') is a [[form of government]] in which the country is considered a \"public matter\", not the [[Res privata|private concern or property]] of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited, but are attained through elections expressing the [[consent of the governed]]. Such leadership positions are therefore expected to fairly represent the citizen body. It is a form of government under which the head of state is not a [[monarch]]. In American English, the definition of a republic can also refer specifically to a government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body, also known as a [[representative democracy]] (a [[democratic republic]]) and exercise power according to the [[rule of law]] (a [[Constitutionalism|constitutional]] republic).\n|}\n\n==== Types of monarchy ====\nCountries with [[monarchy]] attributes are those where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Absolute monarchy]] || A traditional and historical system where the monarch exercises ultimate governing authority as [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

Typically, laws cannot be passed which violate said constitution, unless the constitution itself is altered by law.

Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom belonged to the king. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.\nA similar system is the [[Iqta]], used by medieval [[Islamic]] societies of the middle east and north Africa. This functioned much like the feudal system but generally had titles that weren't granted to a family dynasty but to individuals at the behest of the sultan and generally only required a tax from the lower classes, instead of military service and/or manual labour like in the feudal system.\n|-\n|[[Minarchism]]\n|A variant of [[capitalism]] which advocates for the [[State (polity)|State]] to exist solely to provide a very small number of services. A popular model of the State proposed by minarchists is known as the [[night-watchman state]], in which the only governmental functions are to protect citizens from [[aggression]], [[theft]], [[breach of contract]], and [[fraud]] as defined by [[property law]]s, limiting it to three institutions: the [[military]], the [[police]], and [[courts]].\n|-\n|[[Monarchism]]\n|A system in which the government is headed by an agreed upon head of the [[nobility]] who is known as the [[monarch]], usually in the form of a [[king]] or [[emperor]] (but also less commonly a [[Queen regnant|queen]] or empress). In most monarchical systems the position of monarch is one [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] from a previous ruler by [[Heredity|bloodline]] or marriage, but in other cases it may be a position elected by the [[nobility]] themselves, as was the case in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]] and the medieval [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n|-\n|[[Republicanism]]\n|A system in which the laws and governmental policies of the state are considered a \"public matter\" and decided by the citizens of the society, whoever they may be.

This is the same thing as a [[Federation|federal government]] which may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states, though the adjective 'central' is sometimes used to describe it. The structure of central governments varies. Many countries have created autonomous regions by delegating powers from the central government to governments at a sub national level, such as a regional, state or local level. Based on a broad definition of a basic political system, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a [[constitution]] or other law.\n|-\n|[[City-state|City-State]]\n|A [[sovereign state]], also described as a type of small independent country, that usually consists of a single city and its dependent territories.

She thinks that Henry is a little girl called Henrietta (or Henny in ''Horrid Henry's Underpants''), and that Peter is a teenager. This is reflected in the presents that she sends to the boys. Although Henry's Mum and Dad have told her countless times that Henry is a boy and that Peter is six, Greta refuses to believe this, and usually doesn't hear, most likely due to her senility. Her senility is such that she once cooked cat food for the boys and believed that Fluffy is a dog named Fido. She also mistook it to be the middle of the night when in fact it was only half past five in the afternoon. She wears a light pink sweater, a gold button studded in her white blouse, dark pink skirt, lavender shoes and a walking stick.\n\n===Greedy Graham===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Graham\n| series             = Horrid Henry\n| portrayer          = Wayne Forester\n| nickname           = Greedy Graham\n| gender             = Male\n}}\nGreedy Graham is a brown-haired obese boy who is always hungry and is often seen eating carrots and junk food in the earlier episodes.

He believes that life is unfair as the rest of the world is against him, so he fights \"against the tyranny of adults\". He is resistant to defeat as teachers, relatives and babysitters in the series try their best to avoid him. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him.\n\nHenry is very selfish, inconsiderate, stubborn, and rarely learns from his mistakes. He can also be bluntly honest, as seen when he tells his mother's boss what she calls her at work behind her back and is unafraid of telling people how much he hates them right to their faces. However, he is willing to act nice and collude with Margaret and even Peter, but only if it means he will get to have his own way. Most likely because of his young age, Henry can get frightened by talk of ghosts or monsters, and in one episode, is revealed to have a [[fear of needles]]. He is very imaginative, as he indulges in fantasies, usually transforming into terrifying creatures and attacking the source of his frustrations, and often has \"Eureka moments\" when the stories mention what he thinks is a \"spectacularly wonderful idea\". In every story, there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire.\n\nWhenever Henry thinks of a plan it is simply to get his own way, never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He is more often than not seen taking life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing, making him something of a complex character as well. It has also been further hinted that deep down, Henry never really means to be horrid, and only acts that way as a wanting to get attention and needing to feel important, especially when dealing with his younger brother Peter, implying he has low self-esteem.\n\n===Helpful Hari===\nShe is invited to Peter's party in ''Perfect Peter's Pirate Party'' and is in Peter's class.\n\n==I==\n\n===Inky Ian===\n\nInky Ian is a pupil who isn't very much in Henry's [[classroom]] who is only seen in the book version ''Horrid Henry and the Football Fiend''.\n\n==J==\n\n===Jazzy Jim===\nJazzy Jim is a minor character in Henry's class who likes music.

She teaches [[Horrid Henry (Character)|Horrid Henry]], and many of his classmates such as [[Rude Ralph]], [[Moody Margaret]] and [[Sour Susan]]. She seems to have a particular disliking towards Henry, which would be because it is usually his horrid behaviour which disrupts her class. She once said that Henry's class was the worst she ever taught. In very few episodes, her mother, Mrs Battle-Axe, has appeared, who appears to discipline her daughter greatly. She wears pointy glasses and has gray hair. She also wears a green cardigan, pale chartreuse top, brown skirt, and brownish stockings.

She is a spoilt brat. She is portrayed as the secondary main antagonist in the series and serves as Horrid Henry's archenemy. She lives next door to Horrid Henry and her best friend is Sour Susan. She has magenta hair in a spiky ponytail.\nHenry and Margaret are enemies; Margaret has a secret club and Henry has the Purple Hand Gang. She has an ability of screaming and always competes with Henry. She might have a crush on Henry, because in ''Perfect Peter's Revenge'', she is happy when Peter sends her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret. This is also seen in other episodes. She wears a violet [[tank top]] with white stripes, green [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] and a bottle-green skirt. Margaret, however, occasionally assists Henry in his plans, as seen in ''Horrid Henry's Horrid Revenge'' and ''Horrid Henry and the Big Dig'', though under the word of being the leader of the Purple Hand Gang for a day or a month or even a whole year you will never know how long it will be maybe a week or even every month/year/day/second/minute. She is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols. In the episode ''Horrid Henry Rockstar'' it is suggested that her full name is Margaret Millicent Maudita Smythe which she also uses in subsequent episodes. However she denies this when Rude Ralph asks her if this is true.\n\nAs the primary antagonist of the series, Moody Margaret is the most prominent arch-enemy of the series' protagonist, [[Horrid Henry]]. When Francesca Simon was in the process of creating this character, she suggested a boy called Moody Martin. However, her husband did not approve of the idea as it would be too much like Horrid Henry the main character. Thus, Martin became a female called Margaret. Margaret is depicted as being a self-absorbed, grumpy, spiteful, and cantankerous girl who shares an intense rivalry with Henry, and their opposing neighborhood clubs continuously develop practical jokes or conspiracies against one another. They have resorted to each other's companionship when left with no other options, but nonetheless detest one another and continuously plot against one another, especially in an attempt to soil each other's reputations. Margaret has a tendency to gloat about her various accomplishments in a ridiculously [[narcissistic]] fashion, looking down on others and domineering her friends and peers. True to this, she is resented by her best friend Sour Susan because of her rudeness, but Susan seems to have no other choice than to reluctantly obey Margaret's constant commands. Margaret viciously domineers the Secret Club in various plots formulated against Henry's corresponding Purple Hang Gang, and the two opposing sides share a mutual animosity. She is used to having her own way and is capable of releasing violent, piercing screeches when her demands remain unfulfilled.\n\n====Live-action====\n\n[[File:Scarlet Stitt Moody Margaret.jpg|150px|thumb|Movie poster for ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'' featuring Scarlet Stitt as Moody Margaret.]]\n* Scarlet Stitt portrays Moody Margaret in the 2011 movie, ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]''. At the beginning of the movie, She, Sour Susan and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Singing Soroya|Singing Soroya]] are in the Secret Club treehouse eating biscuits and arguing. Henry disguises himself as a spy, steals the biscuits and runs away but Margaret has also stolen his mighty magnet yoyo. Later, on his way home from school, Henry dodges a water balloon thrown by Margaret. He ducks behind a lamppost, waits for Margaret to walk past, throws a balloon filled with water that hovers over her head and finally, flicks a yoyo at the balloon which bursts and soaks Margaret. Margaret shrieks and throws another balloon at Henry but he ducks and it hits [[Perfect Peter]] instead.<br>The next day at school, Margaret hangs a pail filled with purple paint over the door, ties one end of a rope to it and the other end to the door's handle. Instead of Henry who gets painted, it is their teacher [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Battle-Axe|Miss Battle-Axe]] who falls for the trick. Battle-Axe blames it on Henry, giving Margaret a lucky escape. The next day, Miss Battle Axe's class is moved to [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Lovely|Miss Lovely]]'s class after the head sacks Miss Battle-Axe for not controlling the pupils. Margaret snatches Henry's bag and Henry tries to pull it back, resulting in a pot of \"Exploding Gross-Glue\" placed by the school inspectors to fly out. The glue bursts and hits Miss Lovely in the face. She too gets sacked and the head, and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Oddbod|Miss Oddbod]] bans Henry from entering the school's talent contest. As the school is going bankrupt, many children transfer to another school. Margaret and Henry both get transferred to a girls' school (Henry's Great-Aunt Greta transferred him there as she thinks he is a girl).<br>The girls in the school attack Henry for being a boy and try to attack Margaret too for being with Henry. The two of them escape and form an alliance to save their school. They do this by making Henry sneak into the talent contest and win it so he would be so famous but the plan fails. They try another plan which involves Henry going onto a game show to win the big cash prize so he can give it to Miss Oddbod so she can give it to the school inspectors to bribe them away as they were the ones trying to get the school closed down under the order of the head of a boys' school called [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]]. However, although Henry wins, the Best Boy's Club, Miss Lovely and Miss Oddbod had got Vic and the inspectors arrested so she lets Henry keep the money. At the very end, Margaret is seen in a fairy costume at Henry's party.\n\n====Animation====\n\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Moody Margaret is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols and is the series' most recurring villain.

He is often referred to as a \"worm\" by Henry. Peter has a very effeminate attitude, liking flowers much like [[Walter the Softy]] in the [[Dennis the Menace (UK comics)|Dennis the Menace]] comic strips and [[Dennis the Menace (1996 TV series)|cartoon series]], believes in fairy tales, and is known to always do as he is told and treat others with respect. On several occasions, however, he has revealed that he is in reality, very whiny and spoiled. It is obvious that Peter likes to get back at Henry with the help of his parents, and he always [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally bribes]] them (e.g.: \"You're the best mum in the world! So Henry won't be getting any biscuits will he?\"), resulting in his parents favouring him. Aside from being spoiled, he shows aspects of being sort of like Moody Margaret, except that instead of using a bossy tone, he adopts a crying and sorrowful look to get what he wants.\n\nOften, Henry gets into trouble as a result of Peter telling Mum or Dad when he has done something wrong, usually with the phrases \"Mum/Dad! Henry's being horrid/mean!\" or \"Mum/Dad! Henry called me a [[worm]]/a toad/told me to shut up!\", and he even blames Henry for the most minor offences. He has been known to blame Henry for things Henry doesn't do. He is also similar to his friends as he hates dirt, is always tidy and always does as he is told, unlike Henry. He also expects praise for even the most minor things, such as \"being normal\", using his fork and knife, and also shows off how good he is, especially when Henry is being reprimanded. This, and the fact that he always asks them politely.\n\nAt times, Peter can be desperate for praise and attention; he gets his toys out just to tidy them again in the episode \"Horrid Henry And The Best Boys Club\". In the same episode, it is hinted he sees the other members of \"The Best Boys Club\" as underlings rather than actual friends as he immediately refuses Gordon's suggestion of taking turns to decide things. This suggests that he only acts perfect because he gets praised. At times, he tries to take credit for Henry's rare good deeds, as shown in ''Horrid Henry's Perfect Day'', and in ''Horrid Henry Horrid Headmaster'', when he recorded what Henry said when Henry discovered he had to fill end of term reports (\"No holiday for me, then.\"), then modified it into \"No holiday!\", causing the students to rebel. He seldom defies orders or complains about said orders, though it has been revealed that his sweet-natured personality is soiled with narcissism; he has indeed defied adults or rules in revenge against Henry or while attempting to frame him, and he derives pleasure from Henry's suffering and punishments for poor behavior, implying that he may actually not be much better than his brother. Despite all this, Henry will still help Peter out on occasion, such as rescuing him from a falling shelf in the cellar in ''Horrid Henry Trapped''.\n\n====Live-action====\n* In 2011's ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'', Perfect Peter is shown as a pure goody-goody and never shows his bad side. He is one of the very few people who help save the school from [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]].\n\n====Animation====\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Perfect Peter is the most recurring character apart from Henry.\n\n===Perky Parveen===\nShe is in Peter's class and is invited to Peter's birthday party.

She thinks that Henry is a little girl called Henrietta (or Henny in ''Horrid Henry's Underpants''), and that Peter is a teenager. This is reflected in the presents that she sends to the boys. Although Henry's Mum and Dad have told her countless times that Henry is a boy and that Peter is six, Greta refuses to believe this, and usually doesn't hear, most likely due to her senility. Her senility is such that she once cooked cat food for the boys and believed that Fluffy is a dog named Fido. She also mistook it to be the middle of the night when in fact it was only half past five in the afternoon. She wears a light pink sweater, a gold button studded in her white blouse, dark pink skirt, lavender shoes and a walking stick.\n\n===Greedy Graham===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Graham\n| series             = Horrid Henry\n| portrayer          = Wayne Forester\n| nickname           = Greedy Graham\n| gender             = Male\n}}\nGreedy Graham is a brown-haired obese boy who is always hungry and is often seen eating carrots and junk food in the earlier episodes.

He believes that life is unfair as the rest of the world is against him, so he fights \"against the tyranny of adults\". He is resistant to defeat as teachers, relatives and babysitters in the series try their best to avoid him. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him.\n\nHenry is very selfish, inconsiderate, stubborn, and rarely learns from his mistakes. He can also be bluntly honest, as seen when he tells his mother's boss what she calls her at work behind her back and is unafraid of telling people how much he hates them right to their faces. However, he is willing to act nice and collude with Margaret and even Peter, but only if it means he will get to have his own way. Most likely because of his young age, Henry can get frightened by talk of ghosts or monsters, and in one episode, is revealed to have a [[fear of needles]]. He is very imaginative, as he indulges in fantasies, usually transforming into terrifying creatures and attacking the source of his frustrations, and often has \"Eureka moments\" when the stories mention what he thinks is a \"spectacularly wonderful idea\". In every story, there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire.\n\nWhenever Henry thinks of a plan it is simply to get his own way, never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He is more often than not seen taking life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing, making him something of a complex character as well. It has also been further hinted that deep down, Henry never really means to be horrid, and only acts that way as a wanting to get attention and needing to feel important, especially when dealing with his younger brother Peter, implying he has low self-esteem.\n\n===Helpful Hari===\nShe is invited to Peter's party in ''Perfect Peter's Pirate Party'' and is in Peter's class.\n\n==I==\n\n===Inky Ian===\n\nInky Ian is a pupil who isn't very much in Henry's [[classroom]] who is only seen in the book version ''Horrid Henry and the Football Fiend''.\n\n==J==\n\n===Jazzy Jim===\nJazzy Jim is a minor character in Henry's class who likes music.

She teaches [[Horrid Henry (Character)|Horrid Henry]], and many of his classmates such as [[Rude Ralph]], [[Moody Margaret]] and [[Sour Susan]]. She seems to have a particular disliking towards Henry, which would be because it is usually his horrid behaviour which disrupts her class. She once said that Henry's class was the worst she ever taught. In very few episodes, her mother, Mrs Battle-Axe, has appeared, who appears to discipline her daughter greatly. She wears pointy glasses and has gray hair. She also wears a green cardigan, pale chartreuse top, brown skirt, and brownish stockings. In ''Horrid Henry Delivers a Message'', it is shown that Miss Battle-Axe secretly has a crush on [[Soggy Sid]].

She is a spoilt brat. She is portrayed as the secondary main antagonist in the series and serves as Horrid Henry's archenemy. She lives next door to Horrid Henry and her best friend is Sour Susan. She has magenta hair in a spiky ponytail.\nHenry and Margaret are enemies; Margaret has a secret club and Henry has the Purple Hand Gang. She has an ability of screaming and always competes with Henry. She might have a crush on Henry, because in ''Perfect Peter's Revenge'', she is happy when Peter sends her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret. This is also seen in other episodes. She wears a violet [[tank top]] with white stripes, green [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] and a bottle-green skirt. Margaret, however, occasionally assists Henry in his plans, as seen in ''Horrid Henry's Horrid Revenge'' and ''Horrid Henry and the Big Dig'', though under the word of being the leader of the Purple Hand Gang for a day or a month or even a whole year you will never know how long it will be maybe a week or even every month/year/day/second/minute. She is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols. In the episode ''Horrid Henry Rockstar'' it is suggested that her full name is Margaret Millicent Maudita Smythe which she also uses in subsequent episodes. However she denies this when Rude Ralph asks her if this is true.\n\nAs the primary antagonist of the series, Moody Margaret is the most prominent arch-enemy of the series' protagonist, [[Horrid Henry]]. When Francesca Simon was in the process of creating this character, she suggested a boy called Moody Martin. However, her husband did not approve of the idea as it would be too much like Horrid Henry the main character. Thus, Martin became a female called Margaret. Margaret is depicted as being a self-absorbed, grumpy, spiteful, and cantankerous girl who shares an intense rivalry with Henry, and their opposing neighborhood clubs continuously develop practical jokes or conspiracies against one another. They have resorted to each other's companionship when left with no other options, but nonetheless detest one another and continuously plot against one another, especially in an attempt to soil each other's reputations. Margaret has a tendency to gloat about her various accomplishments in a ridiculously [[narcissistic]] fashion, looking down on others and domineering her friends and peers. True to this, she is resented by her best friend Sour Susan because of her rudeness, but Susan seems to have no other choice than to reluctantly obey Margaret's constant commands. Margaret viciously domineers the Secret Club in various plots formulated against Henry's corresponding Purple Hang Gang, and the two opposing sides share a mutual animosity. She is used to having her own way and is capable of releasing violent, piercing screeches when her demands remain unfulfilled.\n\n====Live-action====\n\n[[File:Scarlet Stitt Moody Margaret.jpg|150px|thumb|Movie poster for ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'' featuring Scarlet Stitt as Moody Margaret.]]\n* Scarlet Stitt portrays Moody Margaret in the 2011 movie, ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]''. At the beginning of the movie, She, Sour Susan and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Singing Soroya|Singing Soroya]] are in the Secret Club treehouse eating biscuits and arguing. Henry disguises himself as a spy, steals the biscuits and runs away but Margaret has also stolen his mighty magnet yoyo. Later, on his way home from school, Henry dodges a water balloon thrown by Margaret. He ducks behind a lamppost, waits for Margaret to walk past, throws a balloon filled with water that hovers over her head and finally, flicks a yoyo at the balloon which bursts and soaks Margaret. Margaret shrieks and throws another balloon at Henry but he ducks and it hits [[Perfect Peter]] instead.<br>The next day at school, Margaret hangs a pail filled with purple paint over the door, ties one end of a rope to it and the other end to the door's handle. Instead of Henry who gets painted, it is their teacher [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Battle-Axe|Miss Battle-Axe]] who falls for the trick. Battle-Axe blames it on Henry, giving Margaret a lucky escape. The next day, Miss Battle Axe's class is moved to [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Lovely|Miss Lovely]]'s class after the head sacks Miss Battle-Axe for not controlling the pupils. Margaret snatches Henry's bag and Henry tries to pull it back, resulting in a pot of \"Exploding Gross-Glue\" placed by the school inspectors to fly out. The glue bursts and hits Miss Lovely in the face. She too gets sacked and the head, and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Oddbod|Miss Oddbod]] bans Henry from entering the school's talent contest. As the school is going bankrupt, many children transfer to another school. Margaret and Henry both get transferred to a girls' school (Henry's Great-Aunt Greta transferred him there as she thinks he is a girl).<br>The girls in the school attack Henry for being a boy and try to attack Margaret too for being with Henry. The two of them escape and form an alliance to save their school. They do this by making Henry sneak into the talent contest and win it so he would be so famous but the plan fails. They try another plan which involves Henry going onto a game show to win the big cash prize so he can give it to Miss Oddbod so she can give it to the school inspectors to bribe them away as they were the ones trying to get the school closed down under the order of the head of a boys' school called [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]]. However, although Henry wins, the Best Boy's Club, Miss Lovely and Miss Oddbod had got Vic and the inspectors arrested so she lets Henry keep the money. At the very end, Margaret is seen in a fairy costume at Henry's party.\n\n====Animation====\n\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Moody Margaret is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols and is the series' most recurring villain.

He is often referred to as a \"worm\" by Henry. Peter has a very effeminate attitude, liking flowers much like [[Walter the Softy]] in the [[Dennis the Menace (UK comics)|Dennis the Menace]] comic strips and [[Dennis the Menace (1996 TV series)|cartoon series]], believes in fairy tales, and is known to always do as he is told and treat others with respect. On several occasions, however, he has revealed that he is in reality, very whiny and spoiled. It is obvious that Peter likes to get back at Henry with the help of his parents, and he always [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally bribes]] them (e.g.: \"You're the best mum in the world! So Henry won't be getting any biscuits will he?\"), resulting in his parents favouring him. Aside from being spoiled, he shows aspects of being sort of like Moody Margaret, except that instead of using a bossy tone, he adopts a crying and sorrowful look to get what he wants.\n\nOften, Henry gets into trouble as a result of Peter telling Mum or Dad when he has done something wrong, usually with the phrases \"Mum/Dad! Henry's being horrid/mean!\" or \"Mum/Dad! Henry called me a [[worm]]/a toad/told me to shut up!\", and he even blames Henry for the most minor offences. He has been known to blame Henry for things Henry doesn't do. He is also similar to his friends as he hates dirt, is always tidy and always does as he is told, unlike Henry. He also expects praise for even the most minor things, such as \"being normal\", using his fork and knife, and also shows off how good he is, especially when Henry is being reprimanded. This, and the fact that he always asks them politely.\n\nAt times, Peter can be desperate for praise and attention; he gets his toys out just to tidy them again in the episode \"Horrid Henry And The Best Boys Club\". In the same episode, it is hinted he sees the other members of \"The Best Boys Club\" as underlings rather than actual friends as he immediately refuses Gordon's suggestion of taking turns to decide things. This suggests that he only acts perfect because he gets praised. At times, he tries to take credit for Henry's rare good deeds, as shown in ''Horrid Henry's Perfect Day'', and in ''Horrid Henry Horrid Headmaster'', when he recorded what Henry said when Henry discovered he had to fill end of term reports (\"No holiday for me, then.\"), then modified it into \"No holiday!\", causing the students to rebel. He seldom defies orders or complains about said orders, though it has been revealed that his sweet-natured personality is soiled with narcissism; he has indeed defied adults or rules in revenge against Henry or while attempting to frame him, and he derives pleasure from Henry's suffering and punishments for poor behavior, implying that he may actually not be much better than his brother. Despite all this, Henry will still help Peter out on occasion, such as rescuing him from a falling shelf in the cellar in ''Horrid Henry Trapped''.\n\n====Live-action====\n* In 2011's ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'', Perfect Peter is shown as a pure goody-goody and never shows his bad side. He is one of the very few people who help save the school from [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]].\n\n====Animation====\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Perfect Peter is the most recurring character apart from Henry.\n\n===Perky Parveen===\nShe is in Peter's class and is invited to Peter's birthday party.

Eldegiz chose [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]] as his residence, and attracted the local emirs to his camp.\n\nHe made himself virtually independent ruler of Azerbaijan by 1146. His marriage with the widow of Sultan [[Toghrul II]] (1132\u20131133; Masud's brother and predecessor) afforded him to intervene in the dynastic strife which erupted upon Mas'ud's death in 1152. He succeeded, in 1160, in deposing [[Suleiman-Shah]] and installing his stepson [[Arslan-Shah]] ({{Circa}}1160\u20131175) as a Sultan. Conferred with the rank of [[Atabeg]], Eldiguz now became a chief protector of the Sultan's authority.<ref name=\"hodgson260\" />\n\nThe word ''Azam'' (meaning \"great\") was added to his title and he was also known as \"Atabek-e Azam\". All of the state's subsequent rulers used to hold this title. During his reign, Eldiguz could subdue a spacious territory between the Caucasus and Persian Gulf. The territory belonging to him stretched from the gate of Tbilisi up to [[Makran]]. He had possessed [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]], [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]], [[Shirvan]], [[Jibal]], [[Hamadan]], [[Gilan Province|Gilan]], [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]. The Atabegs of [[Mosul]], [[Kerman]] and [[Fars Province|Fars]] as well as the feudals of Shirvan, [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], [[Ahlat]], [[Erzurum|Arzan-ar-Rum]] and [[Maragheh|Maragha]] became his liegemen.\n\n=== Campaigns against Georgia ===\n[[Kingdom of Georgia]], whose army was additionally strengthened by the [[Kipchaks in Georgia|Kipchak]] mercenaries,<ref>See also [[David IV of Georgia]]</ref> became the strongest rival of the [[Eldiguz|Shams al-Din Eldiguz]]. In 1138, Georgian king [[Demetrius I of Georgia|Demetrius I]], attacked the earthquake-ridden city of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]].{{clarify|date=September 2018}} While leaving the city, his troops carried off the well-known [[Ancient Gates of Ganja|gate of Ganja]] as their trophy, which up to this date remains on display at the [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati monastery]]. From 1161 onwards Georgians began to make plundering [[Siege of Ani (1161)|raids on Ani]], [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], Ganja, Nakhchivan and other regions controlled by Atabegs.\n\nEldiguz formed a coalition with other Seljuqids in the beginning of the 1160s to fight against the Georgians, and in 1163. the [[Shams al-Din Eldiguz's invasion of Georgia|allies inflicted a defeat]] on king [[George III of Georgia]]. The Seljuqid rulers were jubilant, and they prepared for a new campaign. However, this time they were forestalled by George III, who marched into [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] at the beginning of 1166, occupied a region extending to faraway cities as Nakhchivan and Beylagan, devastated the land and returned with prisoners and booty. There seemed to be no end to the war between George III and atabeg Eldiguz. But the belligerents were exhausted to such an extent that Eldiguz proposed an [[armistice]]. George had no alternative but to make concessions. Eldiguz restored Ani to its former rulers, the [[Shaddadids]], who became his vassals.\n\nIn 1173, Atabeg Eldiguz began another campaign against Georgia but he was defeated. Atabeg's troops retreated and Eldiguz died in 1174 in Nakhchivan.\n\n== Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan ==\n[[File:Momine Hatoon Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]] was commissioned by Eldiguzid Atabeg Jahan Pahlawan in honor of his first wife, Mu'mine Khatun]]\nAfter the death of Shams al-Din Eldiguz, in 1175, the Seljuq Sultan Arslan Shah tried to escape from the yoke of the Grand Atabeg of Azerbaijan but failed, and was poisoned to death by Shams ad-Din's son, the new Grand Atabeg [[Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan]] ({{Circa}}1174\u20131186).<ref>Antoine Constant.

He apportioned each of them any region or town as [[Iqta'|Iqta]]. The twelve years of his rule are considered the most peaceful period of the state's existence. Under his reign the central power was strengthened and no foreign enemy invaded the territory belonging to the Atabegs. Friendly relations with [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazm Shahs]], the rulers of Central Asia, were founded. All those facts had positive influence on the development of science, handicraft, trade and arts.\n\n== Qizil Arslan ==\n[[File:Medieval azerbaijani helmet 4.JPG|thumb|357x357px|relating to the period of Eldiguzids. [[Museum of Art of Azerbaijan]], [[Baku]]|alt=]]After Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan's death his brother [[Qizil Arslan]] ({{Circa}}1186\u20131191) ascended the throne. He continued his successful struggle against the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq rulers]]. At the same time the central power began to get weaker as mamluks who had strengthened their power in their allotments did not want to obey the Sultan. Even [[Shirvanshah]] [[Akhsitan I]] who used to be Atabegs\u2019 liegeman attempted to intervene the interior affairs of the Eldiguzids and opposed [[Qizil Arslan]]s aspiration to the throne. In the response to this, Qizil Arslan invaded Shirvan in 1191, reached to Derbent and subordinated the whole Shirvan to his authority. In 1191 [[Toghrul III]], the last Seljuq ruler was overthrown by Qizil Arslan. Then, by [[Caliphate|Khalif]]\u2019s leave, he proclaimed himself a Sultan.\n\nThe same year Qizil Arslan, who had become the sole ruler of the [[Seljuk Empire|Great Seljuq Empire]], was assassinated. The power was divided among his three sons: [[Nusrat al-Din Abu Bakr|Abu Bakr]], [[Qutluq Inandj]] and [[Amir Mihran]]. Abu Bakr governed Azerbaijan and Arran, and his brothers were the rulers of Khorasan and several neighboring regions. Soon, these three successors began to fight for the throne. Victorious in power struggle, Abu Bakr ''\"Jahan-pahlavan\"'' ({{Circa}} 1195-1210) had his elder brother Qutluq Inandj assassinated and forced the younger brother, Amir Mihran, to take refuge at the court of the latter's brother-in-law, Shirvanshah [[Akhsitan I]] ({{Circa}}1160-1196). The Shirvanshah together with Amir Mihran headed for [[Tbilisi]], the capital of [[Kingdom of Georgia]], and appealed for help to Queen [[Tamar of Georgia]], an official [[Protector (title)|protector]] of [[Shirvan]]. Received with great honors at the Georgian court, they were given desired support, and the Georgian army led by Consort [[David Soslan]] marched to Shirvan.\n\nThe Eldiguzid atabeg [[Nusrat al-Din Abu Bakr|Abu Bakr]] attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at the [[Battle of Shamkor]]<ref name=\"Suny-39\">{{harvnb|Suny|1994|p=39}}.</ref> and lost his capital to a Georgian [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] in 1195.

Arslan, last of the Great Seljuq rulers of Iraq and Persia, the Ildenizids ruled as theoretical subordinates of the Sultans,\nacknowledging this dependence on their coins almost down to the end of the Seljuqs.<ref name=\"BoswrthEIs\"/> Thereafter, they were in effect an independent dynasty, until the westward expansion of the Mongols and the [[Khw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101h dynasty|Khwarazm-Shahs]] weakened and then brought the line to its close.<ref name=\"BoswrthEIs\"/>\n\n[[Atabeg]] (literally means ''\"fatherly lord\"'' in Turkic) was the title conferred upon the Turkic officers who served as guardians of minor [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] rulers.<ref name=\"hodgson260\">Hodgson, Marshall G.S.

Eldegiz chose [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]] as his residence, and attracted the local emirs to his camp.\n\nHe made himself virtually independent ruler of Azerbaijan by 1146. His marriage with the widow of Sultan [[Toghrul II]] (1132\u20131133; Masud's brother and predecessor) afforded him to intervene in the dynastic strife which erupted upon Mas'ud's death in 1152. He succeeded, in 1160, in deposing [[Suleiman-Shah]] and installing his stepson [[Arslan-Shah]] ({{Circa}}1160\u20131175) as a Sultan. Conferred with the rank of [[Atabeg]], Eldiguz now became a chief protector of the Sultan's authority.<ref name=\"hodgson260\" />\n\nThe word ''Azam'' (meaning \"great\") was added to his title and he was also known as \"Atabek-e Azam\". All of the state's subsequent rulers used to hold this title. During his reign, Eldiguz could subdue a spacious territory between the Caucasus and Persian Gulf. The territory belonging to him stretched from the gate of Tbilisi up to [[Makran]]. He had possessed [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]], [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]], [[Shirvan]], [[Jibal]], [[Hamadan]], [[Gilan Province|Gilan]], [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]. The Atabegs of [[Mosul]], [[Kerman]] and [[Fars Province|Fars]] as well as the feudals of Shirvan, [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], [[Ahlat]], [[Erzurum|Arzan-ar-Rum]] and [[Maragheh|Maragha]] became his liegemen.\n\n=== Campaigns against Georgia ===\n[[Kingdom of Georgia]], whose army was additionally strengthened by the [[Kipchaks in Georgia|Kipchak]] mercenaries,<ref>See also [[David IV of Georgia]]</ref> became the strongest rival of the [[Eldiguz|Shams al-Din Eldiguz]]. In 1138, Georgian king [[Demetrius I of Georgia|Demetrius I]], attacked the earthquake-ridden city of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]].{{clarify|date=September 2018}} While leaving the city, his troops carried off the well-known [[Ancient Gates of Ganja|gate of Ganja]] as their trophy, which up to this date remains on display at the [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati monastery]]. From 1161 onwards Georgians began to make plundering [[Siege of Ani (1161)|raids on Ani]], [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], Ganja, Nakhchivan and other regions controlled by Atabegs.\n\nEldiguz formed a coalition with other Seljuqids in the beginning of the 1160s to fight against the Georgians, and in 1163. the [[Shams al-Din Eldiguz's invasion of Georgia|allies inflicted a defeat]] on king [[George III of Georgia]]. The Seljuqid rulers were jubilant, and they prepared for a new campaign. However, this time they were forestalled by George III, who marched into [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] at the beginning of 1166, occupied a region extending to faraway cities as Nakhchivan and Beylagan, devastated the land and returned with prisoners and booty. There seemed to be no end to the war between George III and atabeg Eldiguz. But the belligerents were exhausted to such an extent that Eldiguz proposed an [[armistice]]. George had no alternative but to make concessions. Eldiguz restored Ani to its former rulers, the [[Shaddadids]], who became his vassals.\n\nIn 1173, Atabeg Eldiguz began another campaign against Georgia but he was defeated. Atabeg's troops retreated and Eldiguz died in 1174 in Nakhchivan.\n\n== Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan ==\n[[File:Momine Hatoon Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]] was commissioned by Eldiguzid Atabeg Jahan Pahlawan in honor of his first wife, Mu'mine Khatun]]\nAfter the death of Shams al-Din Eldiguz, in 1175, the Seljuq Sultan Arslan Shah tried to escape from the yoke of the Grand Atabeg of Azerbaijan but failed, and was poisoned to death by Shams ad-Din's son, the new Grand Atabeg [[Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan]] ({{Circa}}1174\u20131186).<ref>Antoine Constant.

He apportioned each of them any region or town as [[Iqta'|Iqta]]. The twelve years of his rule are considered the most peaceful period of the state's existence. Under his reign the central power was strengthened and no foreign enemy invaded the territory belonging to the Atabegs. Friendly relations with [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazm Shahs]], the rulers of Central Asia, were founded. All those facts had positive influence on the development of science, handicraft, trade and arts.\n\n== Qizil Arslan ==\n[[File:Medieval azerbaijani helmet 4.JPG|thumb|357x357px|relating to the period of Eldiguzids. [[Museum of Art of Azerbaijan]], [[Baku]]|alt=]]After Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan's death his brother [[Qizil Arslan]] ({{Circa}}1186\u20131191) ascended the throne. He continued his successful struggle against the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq rulers]]. At the same time the central power began to get weaker as mamluks who had strengthened their power in their allotments did not want to obey the Sultan. Even [[Shirvanshah]] [[Akhsitan I]] who used to be Atabegs\u2019 liegeman attempted to intervene the interior affairs of the Eldiguzids and opposed [[Qizil Arslan]]s aspiration to the throne. In the response to this, Qizil Arslan invaded Shirvan in 1191, reached to Derbent and subordinated the whole Shirvan to his authority. In 1191 [[Toghrul III]], the last Seljuq ruler was overthrown by Qizil Arslan. Then, by [[Caliphate|Khalif]]\u2019s leave, he proclaimed himself a Sultan.\n\nThe same year Qizil Arslan, who had become the sole ruler of the [[Seljuk Empire|Great Seljuq Empire]], was assassinated. The power was divided among his three sons: [[Nusrat al-Din Abu Bakr|Abu Bakr]], [[Qutluq Inandj]] and [[Amir Mihran]]. Abu Bakr governed Azerbaijan and Arran, and his brothers were the rulers of Khorasan and several neighboring regions. Soon, these three successors began to fight for the throne. Victorious in power struggle, Abu Bakr ''\"Jahan-pahlavan\"'' ({{Circa}} 1195-1210) had his elder brother Qutluq Inandj assassinated and forced the younger brother, Amir Mihran, to take refuge at the court of the latter's brother-in-law, Shirvanshah [[Akhsitan I]] ({{Circa}}1160-1196). The Shirvanshah together with Amir Mihran headed for [[Tbilisi]], the capital of [[Kingdom of Georgia]], and appealed for help to Queen [[Tamar of Georgia]], an official [[Protector (title)|protector]] of [[Shirvan]]. Received with great honors at the Georgian court, they were given desired support, and the Georgian army led by Consort [[David Soslan]] marched to Shirvan.\n\nThe Eldiguzid atabeg [[Nusrat al-Din Abu Bakr|Abu Bakr]] attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at the [[Battle of Shamkor]]<ref name=\"Suny-39\">{{harvnb|Suny|1994|p=39}}.</ref> and lost his capital to a Georgian [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] in 1195.

He rose to international fame with his role as [[Dominic Toretto]] in ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' franchise.\n\nDiesel began his career in 1990, but initially struggled to gain roles until he created and starred in the short film ''[[Multi-Facial]]'' (1995), which attracted the attention of [[Steven Spielberg]], who was developing the film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' at the time. Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear in it, which helped kickstart Diesel's acting career. He subsequently voiced the titular character in ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999), while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining ''The Fast and the Furious'', the [[XXX (franchise)|''XXX'']] series, and [[The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)|''The Chronicles of Riddick'']].\n\nLater in his career, Diesel became known for lending his voice to the character of [[Groot]] in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), and voicing a cameo of the same character in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' (2018). He also founded the production company [[One Race Films]]. Away from action films, Diesel has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as in the comedy film ''[[The Pacifier]]'' (2005), while his performance in ''[[Find Me Guilty]]'' (2006) was praised.\n\nDiesel portrayed the comic book character [[Bloodshot (comics)|Bloodshot]] in its 2020 [[Bloodshot (film)|film adaptation]], and is slated to appear in the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' sequels.\n\n==Early life==\nDiesel was born Mark Sinclair<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/10851668.Diesel_breaks_silence_over_Walker/ | publisher=[[Press Association]] via [[The Press]] (Christchurch, New Zealand)| title=Diesel breaks silence over Walker| date= December 3, 2013| accessdate=March 21, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102309/http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/10851668.Diesel_breaks_silence_over_Walker/| archivedate=October 6, 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> on July 18, 1967,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|title=Famous birthdays for July 18: Vin Diesel, Kristen Bell|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019|archivedate=July 19, 2019|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190719181941/https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|url-status=live|quote=Actor Vin Diesel in 1967 (age 52)}}</ref> in [[Alameda County, California]],<!--- He was born in Alameda County, California, where his mother was also born.

He rose to international fame with his role as [[Dominic Toretto]] in ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' franchise.\n\nDiesel began his career in 1990, but initially struggled to gain roles until he created and starred in the short film ''[[Multi-Facial]]'' (1995), which attracted the attention of [[Steven Spielberg]], who was developing the film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' at the time. Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear in it, which helped kick start his career. He subsequently voiced the titular character in ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999), while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining ''The Fast and the Furious'', the [[XXX (franchise)|''XXX'']] series, and [[The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)|''The Chronicles of Riddick'']].\n\nLater in his career, Diesel also became known for lending his voice to the character of [[Groot]] in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), and voicing a cameo of the same character in ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' (2018). He also founded the production company [[One Race Films]]. Away from action films, Diesel has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as in the comedy film ''[[The Pacifier]]'' (2005), while his performance in ''[[Find Me Guilty]]'' (2006) was praised.\n\nDiesel portrayed the comic book character [[Bloodshot (comics)|Bloodshot]] in its 2020 [[Bloodshot (film)|film adaptation]], and is slated to appear in the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' sequels.\n\n==Early life==\nDiesel was born Mark Sinclair<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/10851668.Diesel_breaks_silence_over_Walker/ | publisher=[[Press Association]] via [[The Press]] (Christchurch, New Zealand)| title=Diesel breaks silence over Walker| date= December 3, 2013| accessdate=March 21, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102309/http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/10851668.Diesel_breaks_silence_over_Walker/| archivedate=October 6, 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> on July 18, 1967,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|title=Famous birthdays for July 18: Vin Diesel, Kristen Bell|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=August 7, 2019|archivedate=July 19, 2019|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190719181941/https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|url-status=live|quote=Actor Vin Diesel in 1967 (age 52)}}</ref> in [[Alameda County, California]],<!--- He was born in Alameda County, California, where his mother was also born.
