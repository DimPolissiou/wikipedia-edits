Sails may be made from a combination of woven materials\u2014including canvas or polyester cloth, laminated membranes or bonded filaments\u2014usually in a three- or four-sided shape.\n\nA sail provides propulsive force via a combination of lift and drag, depending on its ''[[angle of attack]]''\u2014its angle with respect to the ''[[apparent wind]]''. Apparent wind is the air velocity experienced on the moving craft and is the combined effect of the true wind velocity with the velocity of the sailing craft. Angle of attack is often constrained by the sailing craft's orientation to the wind or ''[[point of sail]]''. On points of sail where it is possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind, the  sail may act as an [[airfoil]], generating propulsive force as air passes along its surface\u2014just as an airplane wing generates [[lift (force)|lift]]\u2014which predominates over [[aerodynamic drag]] retarding forward motion. The more that the angle of attack diverges from the apparent wind as a sailing craft turns downwind, the more drag increases and lift decreases as propulsive forces, until a sail going downwind is predominated by drag forces. Sails are unable to generate propulsive force if they are aligned too closely to the wind.\n\nSails may be attached to a [[Mast (sailing)|mast]], boom or other [[Spar (sailing)|spar]] or may be attached to a wire that is suspended by a mast. They are typically raised by a line, called a ''[[halyard]]'', and their angle with respect to the wind is usually controlled by a line, called a ''[[sheet (sailing)|sheet]]''. In use, they may be designed to be curved in both directions along their surface, often as a result of their curved edges. [[Sail batten|Batten]]s may be used to extend the trailing edge of a sail beyond the line of its attachment points.\n\nOther non-rotating airfoils that power sailing craft include [[wingsail]]s, which are rigid wing-like structures, and [[kite]]s that power [[kite rig|kite-rigged vessels]], but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article.\n\n==Rigs==\n{{Main|Square rig|Fore-and-aft rig}}\nSailing craft employ two types of rig, the [[square rig]] and the [[fore-and-aft rig]].\n\nThe ''square rig'' carries the primary driving sails are carried on horizontal [[spar (sailing)|spars]], which are perpendicular or [[wikt:square#Adjective|square]], to the [[keel]] of the vessel and to the masts. These spars are called ''[[Yard (sailing)|yards]]'' and their tips, beyond the last stay, are called the ''[[yardarms]]<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>''.

Northern Europeans were resistant to adopting the fore-and-aft rig, despite having seen its use in the course of trade and during the [[Crusades]].  The Renaissance changed this: beginning in 1475, their use increased and within a hundred years the fore-and-aft rig was in common use on rivers and in estuaries in Britain, northern France, and the Low Countries, though the square rig remained standard for the harsher conditions of the open [[North Sea]] as well as for trans-Atlantic sailing.

The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the ''true wind'' (the wind direction and speed over the surface) is called the \"point of sail\". The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the apparent wind ( '''V<sub>A</sub>''')\u2014the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft.

Depending on the alignment of the sail with the apparent wind, lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Total aerodynamic force also resolves into a forward, propulsive, driving force\u2014resisted by the medium through or over which the craft is passing (e.g. through water, air, or over ice, sand)\u2014and a lateral force, resisted by the underwater foils, ice runners, or wheels of the sailing craft.<ref name = Clancy>\n{{Citation\n | last = Clancy\n | first = L.J.\n | title = Aerodynamics\n | place = London\n | publisher = Pitman Publishing Limited\n | year = 1975\n | pages = 638\n | isbn = 0-273-01120-0 }}</ref>\n\nFor apparent wind angles aligned with the entry point of the sail, the sail acts as an [[airfoil]] and lift is the predominant component of propulsion.

For a given true wind velocity over the surface, a sail can propel a craft to a higher speed, on points of sail when the entry point of the sail is aligned with the apparent wind, than it can with the entry point not aligned, because of a combination of the diminished force from airflow around the sail and the diminished apparent wind from the velocity of the craft.

Mainsails are more likely to be bi-radial, since there is very little stress at the tack, whereas head sails (spinnakers and jibs) are more likely to be tri-radial, because they are tensioned at their corners.<ref name = Hancock/>\n\nHigher-performance sails may be laminated, constructed directly from multiple plies of [[Thread (yarn)|filament]]s, [[fiber]]s, [[taffeta]]s, and [[Plastic film|films]]\u2014instead of woven textiles\u2014and adhered together.

Sails are tensile structures, so the role of a seam is to transmit a tensile load from panel to panel.

Sails may be made from a combination of woven materials\u2014including canvas or polyester cloth, laminated membranes or bonded filaments\u2014usually in a three- or four-sided shape.\n\nA sail provides propulsive force via a combination of lift and drag, depending on its ''[[angle of attack]]''\u2014its angle with respect to the ''[[apparent wind]]''. Apparent wind is the air velocity experienced on the moving craft and is the combined effect of the true wind velocity with the velocity of the sailing craft. Angle of attack is often constrained by the sailing craft's orientation to the wind or ''[[point of sail]]''. On points of sail where it is possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind, the  sail may act as an [[airfoil]], generating propulsive force as air passes along its surface\u2014just as an airplane wing generates [[lift (force)|lift]]\u2014which predominates over [[aerodynamic drag]] retarding forward motion. The more that the angle of attack diverges from the apparent wind as a sailing craft turns downwind, the more drag increases and lift decreases as propulsive forces, until a sail going downwind is predominated by drag forces. Sails are unable to generate propulsive force if they are aligned too closely to the wind.\n\nSails may be attached to a [[Mast (sailing)|mast]], boom or other [[Spar (sailing)|spar]] or may be attached to a wire that is suspended by a mast. They are typically raised by a line, called a ''[[halyard]]'', and their angle with respect to the wind is usually controlled by a line, called a ''[[sheet (sailing)|sheet]]''. In use, they may be designed to be curved in both directions along their surface, often as a result of their curved edges. [[Sail batten|Batten]]s may be used to extend the trailing edge of a sail beyond the line of its attachment points.\n\nOther non-rotating airfoils that power sailing craft include [[wingsail]]s, which are rigid wing-like structures, and [[kite]]s that power [[kite rig|kite-rigged vessels]], but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article.\n\n==Rigs==\n{{Main|Square rig|Fore-and-aft rig}}\nSailing craft employ two types of rig, the [[square rig]] and the [[fore-and-aft rig]].\n\nThe ''square rig'' carries the primary driving sails are carried on horizontal [[spar (sailing)|spars]], which are perpendicular or [[wikt:square#Adjective|square]], to the [[keel]] of the vessel and to the masts. These spars are called ''[[Yard (sailing)|yards]]'' and their tips, beyond the last stay, are called the ''[[yardarms]]<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>''.

Northern Europeans were resistant to adopting the fore-and-aft rig, despite having seen its use in the course of trade and during the [[Crusades]].  The Renaissance changed this: beginning in 1475, their use increased and within a hundred years the fore-and-aft rig was in common use on rivers and in estuaries in Britain, northern France, and the Low Countries, though the square rig remained standard for the harsher conditions of the open [[North Sea]] as well as for trans-Atlantic sailing.

The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the ''true wind'' (the wind direction and speed over the surface) is called the \"point of sail\". The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the apparent wind ( '''V<sub>A</sub>''')\u2014the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The apparent wind on the sail creates a total aerodynamic force, which may be resolved into ''drag''\u2014the force component in the direction of the apparent wind\u2014and ''lift''\u2014the force component [[normal (geometry)|normal]] (90\u00b0) to the apparent wind. Depending on the alignment of the sail with the apparent wind, lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Total aerodynamic force also resolves into a forward, propulsive, driving force\u2014resisted by the medium through or over which the craft is passing (e.g. through water, air, or over ice, sand)\u2014and a lateral force, resisted by the underwater foils, ice runners, or wheels of the sailing craft.<ref name = Clancy>\n{{Citation\n | last = Clancy\n | first = L.J.\n | title = Aerodynamics\n | place = London\n | publisher = Pitman Publishing Limited\n | year = 1975\n | pages = 638\n | isbn = 0-273-01120-0 }}</ref>\n\nFor apparent wind angles aligned with the entry point of the sail, the sail acts as an [[airfoil]] and lift is the predominant component of propulsion. For apparent wind angles behind the sail, lift diminishes and drag increases as the predominant component of propulsion. For a given true wind velocity over the surface, a sail can propel a craft to a higher speed, on points of sail when the entry point of the sail is aligned with the apparent wind, than it can with the entry point not aligned, because of a combination of the diminished force from airflow around the sail and the diminished apparent wind from the velocity of the craft. Because of limitations on speed through the water, displacement sailboats generally derive power from sails generating lift on points of sail that include close-hauled through broad reach (approximately 40\u00b0 to 135\u00b0 off the wind).<ref name=Jobson2>{{cite book | last = Jobson | first = Gary | title = Championship Tactics: How Anyone Can Sail Faster, Smarter, and Win Races | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-312-04278-7 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/championshiptact00jobs/page/323 323] | url = https://archive.org/details/championshiptact00jobs/page/323 }}</ref> Because of low friction over the surface and high speeds over the ice that create  high apparent wind speeds for most points of sail, iceboats can derive power from lift further off the wind than displacement boats.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last = Bethwaite\n |first = Frank\n |title = High Performance Sailing\n |publisher = Adlard Coles Nautical\n |year = 2007\n |isbn = 978-0-7136-6704-2}}</ref>\n<center>\n;Downwind sailing with a spinnaker\n</center>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Sailboat on broad reach with spinnaker.jpg|Spinnaker set for a broad reach, mobilizing both lift and drag.\nFile:Spinnaker trimmed for broad reach.jpg|Spinnaker cross-section trimmed for a broad reach showing air flow.\nFile:Amante Choate 48 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|Spinnaker downwind, primarily mobilizing drag.\nFile:Symmetrical spinnaker with following apparent wind.jpg|Spinnaker cross-section with following apparent wind, showing air flow.\n</gallery>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:FMIB 47800 Differents types de Voiles.jpeg|thumb|300px|Different sail types.<ref>Clerc-Rampal, G.

There are two basic configurations, ''cross-cut'' and ''radial''.\n\n''Cross-cut'' sails have the panels sewn parallel to one another, often parallel to the foot of the sail, and are the least expensive of the two sail constructions. Triangular cross-cut sail panels are designed to meet the mast and stay at an angle from either the warp or the weft (on the [[Grain (textile)#Bias|bias]]) to allow stretching along the luff, but minimize strutting on the luff and foot, where the fibers are aligned with the edges of the sail.<ref name=Colgate>\n{{cite book\n |last        = Colgate\n |first       = Stephen\n |author-link = \n |title       = Fundamentals of Sailing, Cruising, and Racing\n |publisher   = W.

A ''bi-radial'' sail has panels radiating from two of three corners; a ''tri-radial'' sail has panels radiating from all three corners. Mainsails are more likely to be bi-radial, since there is very little stress at the tack, whereas head sails (spinnakers and jibs) are more likely to be tri-radial, because they are tensioned at their corners.<ref name = Hancock/>\n\nHigher-performance sails may be laminated, constructed directly from multiple plies of [[Thread (yarn)|filament]]s, [[fiber]]s, [[taffeta]]s, and [[Plastic film|films]]\u2014instead of woven textiles\u2014and adhered together.  ''Molded sails'' are laminated sails formed over a curved mold and adhered together into a shape that does not lie flat.<ref name = Hancock/>\n\nConventional sail panels are sewn together. Sails are tensile structures, so the role of a seam is to transmit a tensile load from panel to panel. For a sewn textile sail this is done through thread and is limited by the strength of the thread and the strength of the hole in the textile through which it passes. Sail seams are often overlapped between panels and sewn with zig-zag stitches that create many connections per unit of seam length.<ref name = Hancock/><ref name = JonesStylios>\n{{Citation\n | last = Jones\n | first = I.\n | author-link =\n | last2 = Stylios\n | first2 = G.K.\n | author2-link =\n | title = Joining Textiles: Principles and Applications\n | place =\n | publisher = Elsevier\n | series = Woodhead Publishing Series in Textiles\n | year = 2013\n | pages = 624\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mw9IAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA457&dq=sail+seams&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqgt6s0rzRAhVM4SYKHfBpCsM4ChDoAQg9MAc#v=onepage&q=sail%20seams&f=false\n | access-date = 2017-01-12\n | isbn = 9780857093967 }}</ref>\n\nWhereas textiles are typically sewn together, other sail materials may be [[Ultrasonic welding|ultrasonically welded]]\u2014a technique whereby high-frequency [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[vibration]]s are locally applied to workpieces being held together under pressure to create a solid-state [[Welding|weld]].

Jacobs]] was appointed the first director of the OAM in 1992.  Initially, Jacobs' insistence on rigorous scientific methodology caused friction with the office's patrons, such as [[U.S. Senator]] [[Tom Harkin]].  Sen. Harkin, who had become convinced his allergies were cured by taking [[bee pollen]] pills, criticized the \"unbendable rules of randomized clinical trials,\" saying \"It is not necessary for the scientific community to understand the process before the American public can benefit from these therapies.\"<ref name=\"natural-causes\">{{cite book | title = Natural causes: death, lies, and politics in America's vitamin and herbal supplement industry | author = Dan Hurley | publisher = [[Broadway Books]] | year = 2006 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7679-2042-1 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/naturalcausesdea00hurl }}</ref> Harkin's office reportedly pressured the OAM to fund studies of specific \"pet theories,\" including bee pollen and [[Burzynski Clinic|antineoplastons]]. In the face of increasing resistance to the use of scientific methodology in the study of alternative medicine, one of the OAM board members, [[Barrie Cassileth]], publicly criticized the office, saying: \"The degree to which nonsense has trickled down to every aspect of this office is astonishing&nbsp;... It's the only place where opinions are counted as equal to data.\"<ref name=\"natural-causes\"/>  Finally, in 1994, Harkin appeared on television with cancer patients who blamed Jacobs for blocking their access to antineoplastons, leading Jacobs to resign from the OAM in frustration.<ref name=\"natural-causes\"/>  In an interview with ''Science'', Jacobs \"blasted politicians \u2013 especially Senator Tom Harkin... for pressuring his office, promoting certain therapies, and, he says, attempting an end run around objective science.\"<ref name=\"Marshall1994\">{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Eliot |title=The Politics of Alternative Medicine |journal=Science |volume=265 |issue=5181 |pages=2000\u201302 |year=1994 |pmid=8091220 |doi=10.1126/science.8091220}}</ref>\n\nHarkin drew support also from Iowa Representative [[Berkley Bedell]], as Bedell had used cow [[colostrum]] against his [[Lyme disease]].<ref name=\"Offit\"/>\n\nWith the OAM's increasing budget in the 1990s, the office drew increasing criticism for its perceived lack of rigorous scientific study of alternative approaches in favor of uncritical boosterism. [[Paul Berg]], a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel laureate in chemistry]], wrote to the Senate that \"[[Quackery]] will always prey on the gullible and uninformed, but we should not provide it with cover from the NIH,\" and called the office \"an embarrassment to serious scientists.\"<ref name=OAMGUB/><ref name=QMHCHF/>{{rp|175}} Allen Bromley, then-president of the [[American Physical Society]], similarly wrote to Congress that the OAM had \"emerged as an undiscriminating advocate of unconventional medicine.

NCCAM had a mandate to promote a more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of alternative medicine, research training and career development, outreach, and \"integration\".\n\nStephen Strauss was the director of NCCAM from 1999 to 2006. He tried to bring more scientific rigor to the organization.<ref name=gorski/>  In 1999 the NCCAM budget was increased from $20 million to $50 million.<ref name=WNCCAMSBD/><ref name=SSOAGGRAM/> The United States Congress approved the appropriations without dissent.

She was \"...a [[nephrologist]] with impeccable scientific credentials...\".  The appointment was considered surprising since she did not have a background in complementary and alternative medicine or integrative medicine. Writing for [[Science-Based Medicine]], [[David Gorski]] states Briggs was in an impossible position.  \"She was a real scientist trying to impose scientific rigor on an enterprise that was inherently resistant to such an imposition\".  She attempted to impose a more scientific approach with two long term strategic plans. Unfortunately the plans used \"...one of the most harmful tactics of quacks to legitimize their quackery under the banner of \"integrative medicine\", the co-opting of the opioid crisis as an excuse to claim all nonpharmacological treatments for pain as being \"integrative\". The results are threatening great harm to chronic pain patients by misguided governments wanting to force them to undergo quack treatments like acupuncture as a means of getting them off opioids\".  However she was able to eliminate studies on homeopathy and tried to counter anti vaccine beliefs. Energy healing was \"...relegated to the fringes, if not eliminated\". Most of the studies became centered around nutrition, exercise, [[pharmacognosy]] \"...and other modalities within the realm of science-based medicine\".<ref name=gorski>{{cite web |last1=Gorski |first1=David |authorlink=David Gorski|title=NCCIH has a new director, and she's a true believer in acupuncture. |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/nccih-has-a-new-director-and-shes-a-true-believer-in-acupuncture/ |website=Science-Based Medicine |accessdate=15 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, after 17 years of government testing at a cost of $2.5 billion, almost no clearly proven efficacy of alternative therapies had been found.<ref name=\"$2.5 billion\">{{cite news |url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31190909 |title= $2.5 billion spent, no alternative cures found |work= [[NBCNews.com]] |department= Alternative Medicine |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= 2009-06-10 }}</ref> Senator Harkin complained, \"One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches.

Writing for [[Science-Based Medicine]], [[David Gorski]] states Briggs was in an impossible position.  \"She was a real scientist trying to impose scientific rigor on an enterprise that was inherently resistant to such an imposition\".  She attempted to impose a more scientific approach with two long term strategic plans. Unfortunately the plans used \"...one of the most harmful tactics of quacks to legitimize their quackery under the banner of \"integrative medicine\", the co-opting of the opioid crisis as an excuse to claim all nonpharmacological treatments for pain as being \"integrative\". The results are threatening great harm to chronic pain patients by misguided governments wanting to force them to undergo quack treatments like acupuncture as a means of getting them off opioids\".  However she was able to eliminate studies on homeopathy and tried to counter anti vaccine beliefs. Energy healing was \"...relegated to the fringes, if not eliminated\".

As an example, the authors described a trial of [[gemcitabine]] with the [[Gonzalez regimen]] for stage II to IV [[pancreatic cancer]], in the belief that cancer is caused by a deficiency of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes.

The study found no discoveries in complementary and alternative medicine that would justify the existence of this center. The authors argued that, after 20 years and an expenditure of $2 billion, the failure of NCCIH was evidenced by the lack of publications and the failure to report clinical trials in peer-reviewed medical journals. They recommended that NCCIH be defunded or abolished, and the concept of funding alternative medicine be discontinued.<ref name=Skept/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://nccih.nih.gov/ NCCIH home page]\n\n{{National Institutes of Health}}\n\n[[Category:1991 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Alternative medicine organizations]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1991]]\n[[Category:National Institutes of Health|Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]\n", "name_user": "Nemadude", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Complementary_and_Integrative_Health"}

The most recent trip was to Cuba in the summer of 2017\n\n===String Orchestra===\n\nThe String Orchestra is gauged for the intermediate playing level for only those who play the violin, cello, or bass. The orchestra provides these players with a comprehensive string ensemble experience. The literature for the students is designed to broaden their repertoire and learn more advanced techniques for both playing and following a condcutor. The students learn how to successfully navigate difficult passages on their instrument and learn how to listen for orchestral intonation.\n\n===Philharmonic Orchestra===\n\nThe Philharmonic Orchestra, which is designed to be a full symphony [[orchestra| ]], is placed at the advanced intermediate playing level. The literature is a combination of arranged and unedited works designed to expose students to a symphony orchestra experience. During rehearsals, there is time set aside for sectionals to iron out specific passages along with exploring different ways to play a passage and nuances to the piece.\n\nPieces that have been played by the Philharmonic Orchestra include ''[[Carmen Suites (Bizet/Guiraud)|Carmen Suites]]'' by [[Georges Bizet]], ''Dance of the Tumblers from [[The Snow Maiden]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], a [[Merle J.

{"title_page": "Modes of mechanical ventilation", "text_new": "{{short description|The methods of inspiratory support}}\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2020}}\n'''Modes of mechanical ventilation''' are one of the most important aspects of the usage of [[mechanical ventilation]]. The mode refers to the method of inspiratory support. In general, mode selection is based on [[Respiratory therapist|clinician]] familiarity and institutional preferences, since there is a paucity of evidence indicating that the mode affects clinical outcome.  The most frequently used forms of volume-limited mechanical ventilation are intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) and continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Esteban A, Anzueto A, Al\u00eda I, Gordo F, Apeztegu\u00eda C, P\u00e1lizas F, Cide D, Goldwaser R, Soto L, Bugedo G, Rodrigo C, Pimentel J, Raimondi G, Tobin MJ |title=How is mechanical ventilation employed in the intensive care unit?

Inspiratory time is defined as the period from the start of positive flow to the start of negative flow. Expiratory time is defined as the period from the start of expiratory flow to the start of inspiratory flow. The flow-time curve is the basis for many variables related to ventilator settings.\n#A breath is assisted if the ventilator does work on the patient. An assisted breath is one for which the ventilator does some portion of the work of breathing. For constant flow inflation, work is defined as inspiratory pressure multiplied by tidal volume. Therefore, an assisted breath is identified as a breath for which airway pressure (displayed on the ventilator) rises above baseline during inspiration. An unassisted breath is one for which the ventilator simply provides the inspiratory flow demanded by the patient and pressure stays constant throughout the breath. \n#A ventilator assists breathing using either pressure control or volume control based on the equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact is known as the equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: <blockquote>Pressure = (Elastance \u00d7 Volume) + (Resistance \u00d7 Flow)</blockquote>In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.<blockquote>Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified by the criteria that trigger (start) and cycle (stop) inspiration. The start of inspiration is called the trigger event. The end of inspiration is called the cycle event.\n#Trigger and cycle events can be initiated by the patient or the machine. Inspiration can be patient triggered or patient cycled by a signal representing inspiratory effort. Inspiration may also be machine triggered or machine cycled by preset ventilator thresholds. <blockquote>Patient triggering means starting inspiration based on a patient signal independent of a machine trigger signal. Machine triggering means starting inspiratory flow based on a signal from the ventilator, independent of a patient trigger signal. Patient cycling means ending inspiratory time based on signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion, (ie, elastance or resistance and including effects due to inspiratory effort). Flow cycling is a form of patient cycling because the rate of flow decay to the cycle threshold is determined by patient mechanics.  Machine cycling means ending inspiratory time independent of signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous breath is a breath for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath is, by definition, assisted.\n#There are 3 breath sequences: Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV), Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV), and Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation (CSV). A breath sequence is a particular pattern of spontaneous and/or mandatory breaths. The 3 possible breath sequences are: continuous mandatory ventilation, (CMV, spontaneous breaths are not allowed between mandatory breaths), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV, spontaneous breaths may occur between mandatory breaths), and continuous spontaneous ventilation (CSV, all breaths are spontaneous).\n#There are 5 basic ventilatory patterns: VC-CMV, VC-IMV, PC-CMV, PC-IMV, and PC-CSV. The combination VC-CSV is not possible because volume control implies machine cycling and machine cycling makes every breath mandatory, not spontaneous. A sixth pattern, TC-IMV is possible but rare.  \n#Within each ventilatory pattern there are several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a \u201czone of comfort\u201d (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: <blockquote>Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all the parameters of the pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).<br>Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.<br>Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.<br>Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.<br>Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).<br>Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).<br>Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as [[fuzzy logic]], rule based [[expert system]]s, and [[artificial neural network]]s.</blockquote>\n#A mode of ventilation is classified according to its control variable, breath sequence, and targeting scheme(s). The preceding 9 maxims create a theoretical foundation for a taxonomy of mechanical ventilation. The taxonomy is based on these theoretical constructs and has 4 hierarchical levels:\n*Control Variable (Pressure or Volume, for the primary breath)\n*Breath Sequence (CMV, IMV, or CSV)\n*Primary Breath Targeting Scheme (for CMV or CSV)\n*Secondary Breath Targeting Scheme (for IMV)\n\n<blockquote>The \u201cprimary breath\u201d is either the only breath there is (mandatory for CMV and spontaneous for CSV) or it is the mandatory breath in IMV. The targeting schemes can be represented by single, lower case letters: set-point = s, dual = d, servo = r, bio-variable = b, adaptive = a, optimal = o, intelligent = i. \nA tag is an abbreviation for a mode classification, such as PC-IMVs,s. Compound tags are possible, eg, PC-IMVoi,oi.</blockquote>\n\n=== How modes are classified ===\nStep 1: Identify the primary breath control variable. If inspiration starts with a preset inspiratory pressure, or if pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort, then the control variable is pressure. If inspiration starts with a preset tidal volume and inspiratory flow, then the control variable is volume. If neither is true, the control variable is time.\n\nStep 2: Identify the breath sequence. Determine whether trigger and cycle events are patient or machine determined. Then, use this information to determine the breath sequence.\n\nStep 3: Identify the targeting schemes for the primary breaths and (if applicable) secondary breaths.\n\n=== Example mode classification is given below ===\nMode Name: A/C Volume Control (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#Inspiratory volume and flow are preset, so the control variable is volume.\n#Every breath is volume cycled, which is a form of machine cycling. Any breath for which inspiration is machine cycled is classified as a mandatory breath. Hence, the breath sequence is continuous mandatory ventilation. \n#The operator sets all the parameters of the volume and flow waveforms so the targeting scheme is set-point. Thus, the mode is classified as volume control continuous mandatory ventilation with set-point targeting (VC-CMVs).\nMode Name: SIMV Volume Control Plus (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#The operator sets the tidal volume but not the inspiratory flow. Because setting volume alone (like setting flow alone) is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for volume control, the control variable is pressure. \n#Spontaneous breaths are allowed between mandatory breaths so the breath sequence is IMV{{what?|date=March 2020}}. \n#The ventilator adjusts inspiratory pressure between breaths to achieve an average preset tidal volume, so the targeting scheme is adaptive. The mode tag is PC-IMVa,s.\n\n== Descriptions of common modes ==\n\nMechanical ventilation machines are available with both invasive modes (such as [[intubation]]) and non-invasive modes (such as [[BPAP machine|BPAP]].  Invasive has to do with the insertion of medical devices or tubes internal to the patient, while non-invasive is completely external to the patient, as for example in using a tightly-fitting mask or other device that covers the patient's nose and mouth.\n\n=== Assist mode, control mode, and assist-control mode ===\nA basic distinction in mechanical ventilation is whether each breath is initiated by the patient (assist mode) or by the machine (control mode). Dynamic hybrids of the two (assist-control modes) are also possible, and control mode without assist is now mostly obsolete.\n\n=== Airway pressure release ventilation ===\n[[File:Airway pressure release ventilation graph.png|thumb|Airway pressure release ventilation graph]]\n[[Airway pressure release ventilation]] is a time-cycled alternant between two levels of positive airway pressure, with the main time on the high level and a brief expiratory release to facilitate ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Dietrich Henzler | title = What on earth is APRV? | journal = [[Critical Care (journal)|Critical Care]] | location = London, England | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 115 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1186/cc9419 | pmid = 21345265 | pmc=3222047| author-link = Dietrich Henzler }}</ref>\n\nAirway pressure release ventilation is usually utilized as a type of inverse ratio ventilation.

Although similar in modality, these terms describe how a mode is intended to inflate the lung, rather than defining the characteristics of synchronization or the way spontaneous breathing efforts are supported.\n\nIntermittent mandatory ventilation has not always had the synchronized feature, so the division of modes were understood to be SIMV (synchronized) vs IMV (not-synchronized). Since the [[American Association for Respiratory Care]] established a [[nomenclature of mechanical ventilation]] the \"synchronized\" part of the title has been dropped and now there is only IMV.\n\n=== Mandatory minute ventilation ===\nMandatory minute ventilation (MMV) allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient's preset minimum minute volume requirement. If the patient maintains the minute volume settings for V<sub>T</sub> x f, no mandatory breaths are delivered.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIf the patient's minute volume is insufficient, mandatory delivery of the preset tidal volume will occur until the minute volume is achieved.  The method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) differs by ventilator brand and model, but, in general, there is a window of monitored time, and a smaller window checked against the larger window (i.e., in the Dr\u00e4ger Evita\u00ae line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window, and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured) to decide whether a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMMV is an optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long-term complications related to mechanical ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal  | author = [[Scott O.

Pressure-regulated volume control utilizes pressure-limited, volume-targeted, time-cycled breaths that can be either ventilator- or patient-initiated.\n\nThe peak inspiratory pressure delivered by the ventilator is varied on a breath-to-breath basis to achieve a target tidal volume that is set by the clinician.\n\nFor example, if a target tidal volume of 500 mL is set but the ventilator delivers 600 mL, the next breath will be delivered with a lower inspiratory pressure to achieve a lower tidal volume.  Though PRVC is regarded as a hybrid mode because of its tidal-volume (VC) settings and pressure-limiting (PC) settings fundamentally PRVC is a pressure-control mode with adaptive targeting.\n\n===Continuous positive airway pressure===\n[[Continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) is a non-invasive positive pressure mode of respiratory support. CPAP is a pressure applied at the end of exhalation to keep the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, an appropriate increase in CPAP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>. CPAP is not technically a mode of \"ventilation\" as it does not directly affect the [[minute volume]].\n\n====Automatic positive airway pressure====\n[[Positive airway pressure#Automatic positive airway pressure|Automatic positive airway pressure]] (APAP) is a form of CPAP that automatically tunes the amount of pressure delivered to the patient to the minimum required to maintain an unobstructed airway on a breath-by-breath basis by measuring the resistance in the patient's breathing.\n\n=== Bilevel positive airway pressure ===\n[[Bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BPAP) is a mode used during [[non-invasive ventilation]] (NIV).  First used in 1988 by Professor Benzer in Austria,<ref>Benzer H (1988) Ventilatory support by intermittent changes in PEEP levels. 4th European Congress on Intensive Care Medicine. Baveno-Stresa</ref> it delivers a preset inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP).

In a HFV-P scenario, the ventilator uses pressure to apply an inspiratory breath and then returns to atmospheric pressure to allow for a passive expiration.  This is seen in High-Frequency Jet Ventilation, sometimes abbreviated HFJV. Also categorized under High Frequency Ventilation  is High Frequency Percussive Ventilation, sometimes abbreviated HFPV. With HFPV it utilizes an open circuit to deliver its subtidal volumes by way of the patient interface known as the Phasitron.\n\n=== Volume guarantee ===\nVolume guarantee an additional parameter available in many types of ventilators that allows the ventilator to change its inspiratory pressure setting to achieve a minimum tidal volume.  This is utilized most often in neonatal patients who need a pressure controlled mode with a consideration for volume control to minimize [[volutrauma]].\n\n== Spontaneous breathing and support settings ==\n\n=== Positive end-expiratory pressure ===\n[[Positive end expiratory pressure]] (PEEP) is pressure applied upon expiration.  PEEP is applied using either a valve that is connected to the expiratory port and set manually or a valve managed internally by a mechanical ventilator.\n\nPEEP is a pressure that an exhalation has to bypass, in effect causing [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] to remain open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, and an increase in PEEP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"D. P. Schuster, M.

The patient triggers all breaths. If there is a change in the mechanical properties of the lung/thorax and patient effort, the delivered tidal volume will be affected.

Inspiratory time is defined as the period from the start of positive flow to the start of negative flow. Expiratory time is defined as the period from the start of expiratory flow to the start of inspiratory flow. The flow-time curve is the basis for many variables related to ventilator settings.\n#A breath is assisted if the ventilator does work on the patient. An assisted breath is one for which the ventilator does some portion of the work of breathing. For constant flow inflation, work is defined as inspiratory pressure multiplied by tidal volume. Therefore, an assisted breath is identified as a breath for which airway pressure (displayed on the ventilator) rises above baseline during inspiration. An unassisted breath is one for which the ventilator simply provides the inspiratory flow demanded by the patient and pressure stays constant throughout the breath. \n#A ventilator assists breathing using either pressure control or volume control based on the equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact is known as the equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: <blockquote>Pressure = (Elastance \u00d7 Volume) + (Resistance \u00d7 Flow)</blockquote>In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.<blockquote>Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified by the criteria that trigger (start) and cycle (stop) inspiration. The start of inspiration is called the trigger event. The end of inspiration is called the cycle event.\n#Trigger and cycle events can be initiated by the patient or the machine. Inspiration can be patient triggered or patient cycled by a signal representing inspiratory effort. Inspiration may also be machine triggered or machine cycled by preset ventilator thresholds. <blockquote>Patient triggering means starting inspiration based on a patient signal independent of a machine trigger signal. Machine triggering means starting inspiratory flow based on a signal from the ventilator, independent of a patient trigger signal. Patient cycling means ending inspiratory time based on signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion, (ie, elastance or resistance and including effects due to inspiratory effort). Flow cycling is a form of patient cycling because the rate of flow decay to the cycle threshold is determined by patient mechanics.  Machine cycling means ending inspiratory time independent of signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous breath is a breath for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath is, by definition, assisted.\n#There are 3 breath sequences: Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV), Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV), and Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation (CSV). A breath sequence is a particular pattern of spontaneous and/or mandatory breaths. The 3 possible breath sequences are: continuous mandatory ventilation, (CMV, spontaneous breaths are not allowed between mandatory breaths), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV, spontaneous breaths may occur between mandatory breaths), and continuous spontaneous ventilation (CSV, all breaths are spontaneous).\n#There are 5 basic ventilatory patterns: VC-CMV, VC-IMV, PC-CMV, PC-IMV, and PC-CSV. The combination VC-CSV is not possible because volume control implies machine cycling and machine cycling makes every breath mandatory, not spontaneous. A sixth pattern, TC-IMV is possible but rare.  \n#Within each ventilatory pattern there are several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a \u201czone of comfort\u201d (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: <blockquote>Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all the parameters of the pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).<br>Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.<br>Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.<br>Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.<br>Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).<br>Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).<br>Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as [[fuzzy logic]], rule based [[expert system]]s, and [[artificial neural network]]s.</blockquote>\n#A mode of ventilation is classified according to its control variable, breath sequence, and targeting scheme(s). The preceding 9 maxims create a theoretical foundation for a taxonomy of mechanical ventilation. The taxonomy is based on these theoretical constructs and has 4 hierarchical levels:\n*Control Variable (Pressure or Volume, for the primary breath)\n*Breath Sequence (CMV, IMV, or CSV)\n*Primary Breath Targeting Scheme (for CMV or CSV)\n*Secondary Breath Targeting Scheme (for IMV)\n\n<blockquote>The \u201cprimary breath\u201d is either the only breath there is (mandatory for CMV and spontaneous for CSV) or it is the mandatory breath in IMV. The targeting schemes can be represented by single, lower case letters: set-point = s, dual = d, servo = r, bio-variable = b, adaptive = a, optimal = o, intelligent = i. \nA tag is an abbreviation for a mode classification, such as PC-IMVs,s. Compound tags are possible, eg, PC-IMVoi,oi.</blockquote>\n\n=== How modes are classified ===\nStep 1: Identify the primary breath control variable. If inspiration starts with a preset inspiratory pressure, or if pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort, then the control variable is pressure. If inspiration starts with a preset tidal volume and inspiratory flow, then the control variable is volume. If neither is true, the control variable is time.\n\nStep 2: Identify the breath sequence. Determine whether trigger and cycle events are patient or machine determined. Then, use this information to determine the breath sequence.\n\nStep 3: Identify the targeting schemes for the primary breaths and (if applicable) secondary breaths.\n\n=== Example mode classification is given below ===\nMode Name: A/C Volume Control (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#Inspiratory volume and flow are preset, so the control variable is volume.\n#Every breath is volume cycled, which is a form of machine cycling. Any breath for which inspiration is machine cycled is classified as a mandatory breath. Hence, the breath sequence is continuous mandatory ventilation. \n#The operator sets all the parameters of the volume and flow waveforms so the targeting scheme is set-point. Thus, the mode is classified as volume control continuous mandatory ventilation with set-point targeting (VC-CMVs).\nMode Name: SIMV Volume Control Plus (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#The operator sets the tidal volume but not the inspiratory flow. Because setting volume alone (like setting flow alone) is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for volume control, the control variable is pressure. \n#Spontaneous breaths are allowed between mandatory breaths so the breath sequence is IMV{{what?|date=March 2020}}. \n#The ventilator adjusts inspiratory pressure between breaths to achieve an average preset tidal volume, so the targeting scheme is adaptive. The mode tag is PC-IMVa,s.\n\n== Descriptions of common modes ==\n\nMechanical ventilation machines are available with both invasive modes (such as [[intubation]]) and non-invasive modes (such as [[BPAP machine|BPAP]].  Invasive has to do with the insertion of medical devices or tubes internal to the patient, while non-invasive is completely external to the patient, as for example in using a tightly-fitting mask or other device that covers the patient's nose and mouth.\n\n=== Assist mode, control mode, and assist-control mode ===\nA basic distinction in mechanical ventilation is whether each breath is initiated by the patient (assist mode) or by the machine (control mode). Dynamic hybrids of the two (assist-control modes) are also possible, and control mode without assist is now mostly obsolete.\n\n=== Airway pressure release ventilation ===\n[[File:Airway pressure release ventilation graph.png|thumb|Airway pressure release ventilation graph]]\n[[Airway pressure release ventilation]] is a time-cycled alternant between two levels of positive airway pressure, with the main time on the high level and a brief expiratory release to facilitate ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Dietrich Henzler | title = What on earth is APRV? | journal = [[Critical Care (journal)|Critical Care]] | location = London, England | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 115 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1186/cc9419 | pmid = 21345265 | pmc=3222047| author-link = Dietrich Henzler }}</ref>\n\nAirway pressure release ventilation is usually utilized as a type of inverse ratio ventilation.

Although similar in modality, these terms describe how a mode is intended to inflate the lung, rather than defining the characteristics of synchronization or the way spontaneous breathing efforts are supported.\n\nIntermittent mandatory ventilation has not always had the synchronized feature, so the division of modes were understood to be SIMV (synchronized) vs IMV (not-synchronized). Since the [[American Association for Respiratory Care]] established a [[nomenclature of mechanical ventilation]] the \"synchronized\" part of the title has been dropped and now there is only IMV.\n\n=== Mandatory minute ventilation ===\nMandatory minute ventilation (MMV) allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient's preset minimum minute volume requirement.

The method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) differs by ventilator brand and model, but, in general, there is a window of monitored time, and a smaller window checked against the larger window (i.e., in the Dr\u00e4ger Evita\u00ae line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window, and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured) to decide whether a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMMV is an optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long-term complications related to mechanical ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal  | author = [[Scott O.

Pressure-regulated volume control utilizes pressure-limited, volume-targeted, time-cycled breaths that can be either ventilator- or patient-initiated.\n\nThe peak inspiratory pressure delivered by the ventilator is varied on a breath-to-breath basis to achieve a target tidal volume that is set by the clinician.\n\nFor example, if a target tidal volume of 500 mL is set but the ventilator delivers 600 mL, the next breath will be delivered with a lower inspiratory pressure to achieve a lower tidal volume.  Though PRVC is regarded as a hybrid mode because of its tidal-volume (VC) settings and pressure-limiting (PC) settings fundamentally PRVC is a pressure-control mode with adaptive targeting.\n\n===Continuous positive airway pressure===\n[[Continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) is a non-invasive positive pressure mode of respiratory support. CPAP is a pressure applied at the end of exhalation to keep the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, an appropriate increase in CPAP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>. CPAP is not technically a mode of \"ventilation\" as it does not directly affect the [[minute volume]].\n\n====Automatic positive airway pressure====\n[[Positive airway pressure#Automatic positive airway pressure|Automatic positive airway pressure]] (APAP) is a form of CPAP that automatically tunes the amount of pressure delivered to the patient to the minimum required to maintain an unobstructed airway on a breath-by-breath basis by measuring the resistance in the patient's breathing.\n\n=== Bilevel positive airway pressure ===\n[[Bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BPAP) is a mode used during [[non-invasive ventilation]] (NIV).

In a HFV-P scenario, the ventilator uses pressure to apply an inspiratory breath and then returns to atmospheric pressure to allow for a passive expiration.  This is seen in High-Frequency Jet Ventilation, sometimes abbreviated HFJV. Also categorized under High Frequency Ventilation  is High Frequency Percussive Ventilation, sometimes abbreviated HFPV. With HFPV it utilizes an open circuit to deliver its subtidal volumes by way of the patient interface known as the Phasitron.\n\n=== Volume guarantee ===\nVolume guarantee an additional parameter available in many types of ventilators that allows the ventilator to change its inspiratory pressure setting to achieve a minimum tidal volume.  This is utilized most often in neonatal patients who need a pressure controlled mode with a consideration for volume control to minimize [[volutrauma]].\n\n== Spontaneous breathing and support settings ==\n\n=== Positive end-expiratory pressure ===\n[[Positive end expiratory pressure]] (PEEP) is pressure applied upon expiration.  PEEP is applied using either a valve that is connected to the expiratory port and set manually or a valve managed internally by a mechanical ventilator.\n\nPEEP is a pressure that an exhalation has to bypass, in effect causing [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] to remain open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, and an increase in PEEP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"D. P. Schuster, M.

The patient initiates every breath and the ventilator delivers support with the preset pressure value. With support from the ventilator, the patient also regulates their own [[respiratory rate]] and their [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]].\n\nIn Pressure Support, the set inspiratory pressure support level is kept constant and there is a decelerating flow. The patient triggers all breaths. If there is a change in the mechanical properties of the lung/thorax and patient effort, the delivered tidal volume will be affected. The user must then regulate the pressure support level to obtain desired ventilation.<ref>MAQUET, \"Modes of ventilation in SERVO-i, invasive and non-invasive\", 2008 MAQUET [[Intensive care medicine|Critical Care]] AB, Order No 66 14 692</ref><ref>MAQUET, \"Modes of ventilation in SERVO-s, invasive and non-invasive\", 2009 MAQUET Critical Care AB, Order No 66 61 131</ref>\n\nPressure support improves oxygenation,<ref name=\"pmid21263322\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Spieth PM, Carvalho AR, G\u00fcldner A, etal | title = Pressure support improves oxygenation and lung protection compared to pressure-controlled ventilation and is further improved by random variation of pressure support | journal = [[Critical Care Medicine]] | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 746\u201355 |date=April 2011 | pmid = 21263322 | doi = 10.1097/CCM.0b013e318206bda6 | issn = }}</ref> ventilation and decreases work of breathing.\n\nAlso see adaptive support ventilation.\n\n== Other ventilation modes and strategies ==\n\n===Negative pressure ventilation===\n:''[[Negative pressure ventilator|Main article:Negative pressure ventilator]]''\nNegative-pressure ventilation stimulates (or forces) breathing by periodic application of partial vacuum (air pressure reduced below ambient pressure), applied externally to the patient's torso (specifically, chest and abdomen), to assist or force the chest to expand, expanding the lungs, resulting in voluntary or involuntary inhalation through the patient's airway.  Various \"negative pressure ventilators\" (NPVs) have been developed to serve this function -- most famously the \"[[Iron lung]],\" a tank in which the patient lays, with only their head exposed to ambient air, while air pressure on the remainder of their body, inside the tank, was varied by pumping, to stimulate chest and lung expansion and contraction).
