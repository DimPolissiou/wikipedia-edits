These are the the Yavapai province (1800\u20131700 Mya), the Mazatzal province (1700\u20131650 Mya), the Granite-Rhyolite province (1500\u20131300 Mya), and the Llano-Grenville province (1300\u20131000 Mya). Each is interpreted as juvenile crust of an island arc, together with smaller amounts of reworked older crust, that accreted to Laurentia in an orogenic pulse accompanied by [[pluton]] emplacement. The plutons sutured new and existing orogens together and helped convert the juvenile terranes to mature crust. The orogen pulses are identified as the Yavapai orogeny at 1710\u20131680 Mya, the [[Mazatzal orogeny]] at 1650\u20131600 Ga, the [[Picuris orogeny]] at 1450\u20131300 Mya,<ref name=\"danieletal2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Daniel |first1=C.

The research team's theoretical model proposed that [[mortality salience]] (reminding people that they will someday die) increases anti-Semitism and that anti-Semitism is often expressed as anti-Israel attitudes. The first experiment showed that mortality salience led to higher levels of anti-Semitism and lower levels of support for Israel. The study's methodology was designed to tease out anti-Semitic attitudes that are concealed by polite people. The second experiment showed that mortality salience caused people to perceive Israel as very important, but did not cause them to perceive any other country this way. The third experiment showed that mortality salience led to a desire to punish Israel for human rights violations but not to a desire to punish Russia or India for identical human rights violations. According to the researchers, their results \"suggest that Jews constitute a unique cultural threat to many people's worldviews, that anti-Semitism causes hostility to Israel, and that hostility to Israel may feed back to increase anti-Semitism.\" Furthermore, \"those claiming that there is no connection between antisemitism and hostility toward Israel are wrong.\"<ref>Modern Anti-Semitism and Anti-Israeli Attitudes, Florette Cohen, Department of Psychology, The College of Staten Island, City University New York; [[Lee Jussim]], Department of Psychology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick; Kent D.

Foxman]], the organization's national director, argued, \"It is disturbing that with all of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society, anti-Semitic beliefs continue to hold a vice-grip on a small but not insubstantial segment of the American public.\" Specifically, the polling found that 19% of Americans answered \"probably true\" to the assertion that \"Jews have too much control/influence on Wall Street\" while 15% concurred with the related statement that Jews seem \"more willing to use shady practices\" in business. Nonetheless, the survey generally reported positive attitudes for most Americans, the majority of those surveyed expressed [[philo-Semitic]] sentiments such as 64% agreeing that Jews have contributed much to U.S. social culture.<ref name=\"adl-poll\"/>\n\nA 2019 survey by the Jewish Electorate Institute found that 73% of American Jews feel less secure since the [[election of Donald Trump]] to the presidency. Antisemitic attacks against synagogues since 2016 have contributed to this fear.  The survey found that combatting antisemitism is a priority issue in domestic politics among American Jews, including [[millennials]].<ref>[https://www.jewishelectorateinstitute.org/poll-domestic-issues-dominate-the-priorities-of-the-jewish-electorate/ \"Poll: Domestic Issues Dominate The Priorities Of The Jewish Electorate.\"] ''Jewish Electorate Institute''.  22 May 2019.  22 May 2019.</ref>\n\n==Antisemitism within the African-American community==\n{{see also|African American\u2013Jewish relations}}\nSurveys which were conducted by the ADL in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 all found that the large majority of [[African-American]]s who were questioned rejected antisemitism and expressed the same kinds of generally tolerant viewpoints as other Americans who were also surveyed. For example, their 2009 study reported that 28% of African-Americans surveyed displayed antisemitic views while a 72% majority did not. However, those three surveys all found that negative attitudes towards Jews were stronger among African-Americans than among the general population at large.<ref name=presentation>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712053337/http://archive.adl.org/anti_semitism_domestic/adl-2011-anti-semitism_presentation.pdf|title=ADL 2011 Antisemitism Presentation|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to earlier ADL research, going back to 1964, the trend that African-Americans are significantly more likely than white Americans to hold antisemitic beliefs across all education levels has remained over the years. Nonetheless, the percentage of the population holding negative beliefs against Jews has waned considerably in the black community during this period as well. In a 1967 ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]]'' article entitled \"Negroes are Anti-Semitic Because They're Anti-White,\" the [[African-American]] author [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] sought to explain the prevalence of black antisemitism.<ref>{{cite web|title=To what degree does Anti-Semitism among African Americans simply reflect Anti-White sentiment?|url=http://www.dominican.edu/query/ncur/display_ncur.php?id=2045|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020102407/http://www.dominican.edu/query/ncur/display_ncur.php?id=2045|archivedate=2007-10-20}}</ref> An ADL poll from 1992 stated that 37% of African-Americans surveyed displayed antisemitism;<ref name=November>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/antisemitism_survey/survey_print.asp|title=Anti-Semitism and Prejudice in America: Highlights from an ADL Survey - November 1998|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref> in contrast, a poll from 2011 found that only 29% did so.<ref name=presentation/>\n\nPersonal backgrounds play a huge role in terms of holding prejudiced versus tolerant views.

In their view, the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of Israel and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism.\n\nIn the context of the \"Global [[War on Terrorism]]\" statements have been made by both the South Carolina Democrat Senator [[Ernest Hollings]] and the Republican populist columnist [[Pat Buchanan]] which suggest that the [[George W.

In 2004, a number of prominent public figures accused Jewish members of the Bush administration of tricking America into war against [[Saddam Hussein]] in order to help Israel.

The research team's theoretical model proposed that [[mortality salience]] (reminding people that they will someday die) increases anti-Semitism and that anti-Semitism is often expressed as anti-Israel attitudes. The first experiment showed that mortality salience led to higher levels of anti-Semitism and lower levels of support for Israel. The study's methodology was designed to tease out anti-Semitic attitudes that are concealed by polite people. The second experiment showed that mortality salience caused people to perceive Israel as very important, but did not cause them to perceive any other country this way. The third experiment showed that mortality salience led to a desire to punish Israel for human rights violations but not to a desire to punish Russia or India for identical human rights violations. According to the researchers, their results \"suggest that Jews constitute a unique cultural threat to many people's worldviews, that anti-Semitism causes hostility to Israel, and that hostility to Israel may feed back to increase anti-Semitism.\" Furthermore, \"those claiming that there is no connection between antisemitism and hostility toward Israel are wrong.\"<ref>Modern Anti-Semitism and Anti-Israeli Attitudes, Florette Cohen, Department of Psychology, The College of Staten Island, City University New York; [[Lee Jussim]], Department of Psychology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick; Kent D.

[[Abraham H.

Antisemitic attacks against synagogues since 2016 have contributed to this fear.

For example, their 2009 study reported that 28% of African-Americans surveyed displayed antisemitic views while a 72% majority did not.

Nonetheless, the percentage of the population holding negative beliefs against Jews has waned considerably in the black community during this period as well. In a 1967 ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]]'' article entitled \"Negroes are Anti-Semitic Because They're Anti-White,\" the [[African-American]] author [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] sought to explain the prevalence of black antisemitism.<ref>{{cite web|title=To what degree does Anti-Semitism among African Americans simply reflect Anti-White sentiment?|url=http://www.dominican.edu/query/ncur/display_ncur.php?id=2045|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020102407/http://www.dominican.edu/query/ncur/display_ncur.php?id=2045|archivedate=2007-10-20}}</ref> An ADL poll from 1992 stated that 37% of African-Americans surveyed displayed antisemitism;<ref name=November>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/antisemitism_survey/survey_print.asp|title=Anti-Semitism and Prejudice in America: Highlights from an ADL Survey - November 1998|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref> in contrast, a poll from 2011 found that only 29% did so.<ref name=presentation/>\n\nPersonal backgrounds play a huge role in terms of holding prejudiced versus tolerant views.

It's called ''American Made'', [and it's got songs from] [[ZZ Top]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[James Gang]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]] \u2014 all these cover tunes that we modernized them and not really thrashed them up, but we made kind of metal versions of them.

McCallum's role as the mysterious Russian agent [[Illya Kuryakin]] was originally conceived as a peripheral one. McCallum, however, took the opportunity to construct a complex character whose appeal rested largely in what was shadowy and enigmatic about him.<ref name=\"manfromuncle.org\" /> Kuryakin's popularity with the audience and Vaughn's and McCallum's on-screen chemistry were quickly recognized by the producers, and McCallum was elevated to co-star status.\n\nAlthough the show aired at the height of the [[Cold War]], McCallum's Russian alter ego became a pop culture phenomenon.

In 1975 he played the title character in a short-lived U.S. version of ''[[The Invisible Man (1975 TV series)|The Invisible Man]]''.\n\nMcCallum appeared on stage in Australia in ''[[Run for Your Wife (play)|Run for Your Wife]]'' (1987\u201388), and the production toured the country. Other members of the cast were [[Jack Smethurst]], [[Eric Sykes]] and [[Katy Manning]].\n\nMcCallum played supporting parts in a number of feature films, although he played the title role in the 1968 thriller, ''[[Sol Madrid]]''.\n\nMcCallum starred with [[Diana Rigg]] in the 1989 TV miniseries ''[[Mother Love (TV series)|Mother Love]]''. In 1991 and 1992 McCallum played gambler John Grey, one of the principal characters in the television series ''[[Trainer (TV series)|Trainer]]''.\nHe appeared as a British double agent in a 1989 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''.\nIn the 1990s McCallum guest-starred in two U.S. television series. In season 1 of ''[[seaQuest DSV]],'' he appeared as the law-enforcement officer Frank Cobb of the fictional Broken Ridge of the Ausland Confederation, an underwater mining camp off the coast of Australia by the [[Great Barrier Reef]]; he also had a guest-star role in one episode of ''[[Babylon 5]].''\n\nIn 1994, McCallum narrated the acclaimed documentaries ''[[Titanic: The Complete Story]]'' for [[A&E Networks]]. This was the second project about the ''Titanic'' on which he had worked: the first was the 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]'', in which he had had a small role.\n\nIn the same year McCallum hosted and narrated the TV special ''Ancient Prophecies''. This special, which was followed soon after by three others, told of people and places historically associated with foretelling the [[Eschatology|end of the world]] and the beginnings of new eras for mankind.\n\n===''NCIS''===\n[[File:DavidMcCallumHWOFOct2012.jpg|thumb|left|150px|McCallum in October 2012.]]\n\nSince 2003 McCallum has starred in the CBS television series ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' as Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard, the team's chief medical examiner and one of the show's most popular characters.

In the feature, [[Donald P. Bellisario]] says that McCallum's knowledge became so vast that at the time of the interview he was considering making him a technical adviser on the show.\n\nMcCallum appeared at the 21st Annual James Earl Ash Lecture, held 19 May 2005 at the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], an evening for honouring America's service members.

(Capitol ST 2651, 1967), and ''McCallum'' (Capitol ST 2748, 1968). The best known of his pieces today is \"The Edge\", which was sampled by [[Dr. Dre]] as the intro and riff to the track \"[[The Next Episode]]\", \"M.I.A\" by Missin' Linx, and \"No Regrets\" by [[Masta Ace]]. McCallum's version of \"The Edge\" appears on the soundtrack to the 2017 film [[Baby Driver]].\n\nMcCallum did not sing on these records, as many television stars of the 1960s did when offered recording contracts. As a classically trained musician, he conceived a blend of oboe, English horn and strings with guitar and drums, and presented instrumental interpretations of hits of the day. The official arranger on the albums was H. B. Barnum. However, McCallum conducted, and contributed several original compositions of his own, over the course of four LPs. The first two, ''Music...A Part of Me'' and ''Music...A Bit More of Me'', have been issued together on CD on the Zonophone label. On ''Open Channel D'', McCallum did sing on the first four tracks, \"Communication\", \"House on Breckenridge Lane\", \"In the Garden, Under the Tree\" (the theme song from the film ''Three Bites of the Apple'') and \"My Carousel\". The music tracks are the same as the Zonophone CD. This CD was released on the Rev-Ola label. The [[single (music)|single]] release of \"Communication\" reached No. 32 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in April 1966.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location= London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page= 337}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' episode \"The Discotheque Affair\", McCallum plays the double bass as part of a band in a night club. He also played guitar and sang his own composition, \"Trouble,\" with Nancy Sinatra on \"The Take Me to Your Leader Affair,\" and played several instruments in \"The Off-Broadway Affair\".\n\nIn the 1970s, McCallum also recorded three H.P. Lovecraft tales for Caedmon Records, an imprint of August Derleth's Arkham House publishing venture: \"The Rats in the Walls\" (TC 1347, 1973); \"The Dunwich Horror\" (\"slightly abridged\"; TC 1467, 1976); and \"The Haunter of the Dark\" (TC 1617, 1979).\n\n===Fiction===\nIn 2016, McCallum published a crime novel entitled ''Once a Crooked Man''. The narrative is set in New York and London and centres on a young actor who tries to foil a murder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/at-82-ncis-actor-david-mccallum-has-written-a-delicious-crime-caper/2016/01/11/b71995fa-b872-11e5-829c-26ffb874a18d_story.html|title=At 82, \u2018NCIS\u2019 actor David McCallum has written a delicious crime caper|first1=Neely|last1=Tucker|first2=Neely|last2=Tucker|date=11 January 2016|access-date=31 August 2017|via=WashingtonPost.com}}</ref> McCallum has stated that a second novel is in progress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/14193287.Why_Man_from_U_N_C_L_E_star_David_McCallum_is_learning_new_lines/|title=Why Man from U.N.C.L.E star David McCallum is learning new lines|website=HeraldScotland|access-date=31 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 11 May 1957, McCallum  married actress [[Jill Ireland]] in London. The couple had met during production of the film ''[[Hell Drivers (film)|Hell Drivers]]''. The marriage lasted 10 years. After leaving McCallum, Ireland married [[Charles Bronson]], whom McCallum had introduced to her while McCallum and Bronson were filming ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963). McCallum and Ireland had three sons: Paul, Jason and Valentine (Val). Jason, who was adopted, died from an accidental drug overdose in 1989.<ref name=\"People\" /> [[Val McCallum]] is a guitar player, playing with [[Jackson Browne]] most recently in 2014 and is a member of the faux country band, Jackshit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2014/07/at-65-jackson-browne-continues-to-rock-and-roll-announcing-an-international-tour-and-a-new-studio-album.html/|title=At 65, Jackson Browne continues to rock and roll, announcing a new album and world tour|access-date=25 July 2015|date=18 July 2014|first=Michael|last=Granberry|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103132/http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2014/07/at-65-jackson-browne-continues-to-rock-and-roll-announcing-an-international-tour-and-a-new-studio-album.html/|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Lisa Respers |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/03/david.mccallum.ncis/index.html?imw=Y&iref=mpstoryemail|title='NCIS' actor's portrayal is dead on|publisher=CNN.com|date=3 February 2009|access-date=16 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, McCallum married Katherine Carpenter.

He took the role of [[Judas Iscariot]] in 1965's ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]''.

McCallum's role as the mysterious Russian agent [[Illya Kuryakin]] was originally conceived as a peripheral one. McCallum, however, took the opportunity to construct a complex character whose appeal rested largely in what was shadowy and enigmatic about him.<ref name=\"manfromuncle.org\" /> Kuryakin's popularity with the audience and Vaughn's and McCallum's on-screen chemistry were quickly recognized by the producers, and McCallum was elevated to co-star status.\n\nAlthough the show aired at the height of the [[Cold War]], McCallum's Russian alter ego became a pop culture phenomenon. The actor was inundated with fan letters, and a Beatles-like frenzy followed him everywhere he went.<ref name=\"manfromuncle.org\" /> While playing Kuryakin, McCallum received more fan mail than any other actor in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s history, including such popular MGM stars as [[Clark Gable]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2008/11/01/in_the_company_of_spies/?page=2|title=Audiences in the 1960s swooned over the cool men from U.N.C.L.E.|publisher=Boston Globe|first=Mark|last=Feeney|date=2 November 2008|accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref> Hero worship even led to a record, ''Love Ya, Illya'', performed by [[Alma Cogan]] under the name Angela and the Fans, which was a [[pirate radio]] hit in Britain in 1966.

In 1975 he played the title character in a short-lived U.S. version of ''[[The Invisible Man (1975 TV series)|The Invisible Man]]''.\n\nMcCallum appeared on stage in Australia in ''[[Run for Your Wife (play)|Run for Your Wife]]'' (1987\u201388), and the production toured the country. Other members of the cast were [[Jack Smethurst]], [[Eric Sykes]] and [[Katy Manning]].\n\nMcCallum played supporting parts in a number of feature films, although he played the title role in the 1968 thriller, ''[[Sol Madrid]]''.\n\nMcCallum starred with [[Diana Rigg]] in the 1989 TV miniseries ''[[Mother Love (TV series)|Mother Love]]''. In 1991 and 1992 McCallum played gambler John Grey, one of the principal characters in the television series ''[[Trainer (TV series)|Trainer]]''.\nHe appeared as a British double agent in a 1989 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''.\nIn the 1990s McCallum guest-starred in two U.S. television series. In season 1 of ''[[seaQuest DSV]],'' he appeared as the law-enforcement officer Frank Cobb of the fictional Broken Ridge of the Ausland Confederation, an underwater mining camp off the coast of Australia by the [[Great Barrier Reef]]; he also had a guest-star role in one episode of ''[[Babylon 5]].''\n\nIn 1994, McCallum narrated the acclaimed documentaries ''[[Titanic: The Complete Story]]'' for [[A&E Networks]]. This was the second project about the ''Titanic'' on which he had worked: the first was the 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]'', in which he had had a small role.\n\nIn the same year McCallum hosted and narrated the TV special ''Ancient Prophecies''. This special, which was followed soon after by three others, told of people and places historically associated with foretelling the [[Eschatology|end of the world]] and the beginnings of new eras for mankind.\n\n===''NCIS''===\n[[File:DavidMcCallumHWOFOct2012.jpg|thumb|left|150px|McCallum in October 2012.]]\n\nSince 2003 McCallum has starred in the CBS television series ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' as Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard, the team's chief medical examiner and one of the show's most popular characters. In Season 2 Episode 13 \"The Meat Puzzle\", NCIS Special Agent [[Caitlin Todd]] ([[Sasha Alexander]]) asks Special Agent [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs]] ([[Mark Harmon]]), \"What did Ducky look like when he was younger?\" and Gibbs replies, \"Illya Kuryakin\".<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Meat Puzzle|episodelink=List of NCIS episodes#ep36|series=NCIS|serieslink=NCIS (TV series)|airdate=8 February 2005|season=2|number=13|minutes=21:37<!--|accessdate=7 January 2016-->}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the behind-the-scenes feature on the 2006 DVD of [[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]] season 1, McCallum became an expert in forensics to play Mallard, including attending [[medical examiner]] conventions. In the feature, [[Donald P. Bellisario]] says that McCallum's knowledge became so vast that at the time of the interview he was considering making him a technical adviser on the show.\n\nMcCallum appeared at the 21st Annual James Earl Ash Lecture, held 19 May 2005 at the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], an evening for honouring America's service members. His lecture, \"Reel to Real Forensics\", with Cmdr. Craig T.

(Capitol ST 2651, 1967), and ''McCallum'' (Capitol ST 2748, 1968). The best known of his pieces today is \"The Edge\", which was sampled by [[Dr. Dre]] as the intro and riff to the track \"[[The Next Episode]]\", \"M.I.A\" by Missin' Linx, and \"No Regrets\" by [[Masta Ace]]. McCallum's version of \"The Edge\" appears on the soundtrack to the 2017 film [[Baby Driver]].\n\nMcCallum did not sing on these records, as many television stars of the 1960s did when offered recording contracts. As a classically trained musician, he conceived a blend of oboe, English horn and strings with guitar and drums, and presented instrumental interpretations of hits of the day. The official arranger on the albums was H. B. Barnum. However, McCallum conducted, and contributed several original compositions of his own, over the course of four LPs. The first two, ''Music...A Part of Me'' and ''Music...A Bit More of Me'', have been issued together on CD on the Zonophone label. On ''Open Channel D'', McCallum did sing on the first four tracks, \"Communication\", \"House on Breckenridge Lane\", \"In the Garden, Under the Tree\" (the theme song from the film ''Three Bites of the Apple'') and \"My Carousel\". The music tracks are the same as the Zonophone CD. This CD was released on the Rev-Ola label.

It appears in the [[Vana Parva]], [[Aranyaka-parva]] or [[Araneya-parva]] and the story is set as the Pandavas end their twelve years of exile in the forest.\n\n==Vana Parva==\nAt the end of their 12 years of exile in the forests, time had come for the pandavas to live in Agyat Vasa (living Incognito). As they were discussing their course of action the [[Pandava]] Princes came across a [[Brahmin]] who complained that a deer has taken on its antlers his [[Arani, Hindu|Arani]][1] \u2013 a pair of wooden blocks to generate fire by friction \u2013 and therefore he was not able to light the fire for the performance of Vedic rituals. The valorous Pandava Princes set out to retrieve the Brahmin's Arani and followed the hoof-marks of the deer.\n\nIn the quest of the mysterious deer, [[Yudhishthira]], became exhausted and thirsty. His brother [[Nakula]] thus ventured out to fetch water and found a beautiful lake. The lake was devoid of any living creature except a crane (Baka). When he attempted to take water from the lake, the crane spoke, \"O Nakula! The water of this lake will turn into poison if you take it without satisfactorily answering my questions.\" Nakula, in arrogance, did not pay heed and hurriedly took water from the lake. Upon drinking the crystal clear water, Nakula instantly died of poisoning. Nakula's twin [[Sahadeva]], coming in search of his brother, also found the same lake, saw Nakula dead, and was warned by the crane. But Sahadeva too ignored the crane and died after drinking the water. In the same manner, both valiant [[Arjuna]], and powerful [[Bhima]] met the same fate.\n\nSince none of the brothers returned with water, Yudhishthira engaged in search of them. Upon following the same path, Yudhishthira came across the lake and found his brothers lying dead. Before searching for the killer of his brothers, Yudhishthira decided to drink some water from the lake. But when the crane warned him, Yudhishthira realised that the crane held the answer to the turn of events. The virtuous Yudhishthira proceeded to answer the questions put forth by the crane.\n\nBefore putting the questions to Yudhishthira, the crane revealed itself as a [[Yaksha]]. The Yaksha asked 18 questions with philosophical and metaphysical ramifications. This dialogue between the Yaksha and Yudhishthira is embodied in the Madhya Parva of the [[Mahabharata]], and is also known as the Dharma-Baka Upakhyan (Legend of the Virtuous Crane).\n\n==Baka Prashna/Yaksha Prashna: (The Questions of the righteous Crane or the Yaksha)==\n'''Question 1.''' \n\nThe Yaksha asked Yudhisthira, \"Who makes the sun rise and ascend in the skies? Who moves the Sun around? Who makes the sunset in the horizons? What is the true nature of the Sun and where is the Sun established\"?\n\nYudhishthira answered, \"Brahma makes the sun rise and ascend. The Gods perambulate about the Sun. The [[Dharm]] sets the Sun. Truth is the actual Sun and the Sun is established in Truth only\".\n\n'''Question No. 2:''' \n\nYaksha enquired: What instils 'divinity' in [[Brahmin]]s? What is the quality of virtuosity in a Brahmin? What is the humanlike quality of a  Brahmin? What is the conduct akin to a non-virtuous person in a Brahmin?\n\nYudhisthira replied: The self-study (Swadhyayana) of the Vedas is divinity in a Brahmin. Penance is the quality like a virtuous person in a Brahmin. Death is human-like quality in a Brahmin. Criticising others is conduct in a Brahmin like a non-virtuous person.\n\n'''Question 3.''' \n\nThe Yaksha asked, \"What instils divinity in [[Kshatriya]]s? What is the quality of virtuosity in a Kshatriya? What is the humanity of a Kshatriya? What is the conduct akin to a non-virtuous person in a Kshatriya\"?\n\nYudhishthira replied, \"The art of archery instils divinity in a Kshatriya. Oblation is the quality of virtuosity in a Kshatriya. Fear is his humanity. Abandoning people under the protection of the Kshatriya is conduct akin to a non-virtuous person in the Kshatriya\".\n\n'''Question 4.''' \n\nThe Yaksha asked, \"What is that thing which is like Mantra in the performance of oblations (Yajna)? Who is the performer of rites and ceremonies during Yajna? Who accepts the offerings and oblations of a Yajna? What is that which even a Yajna can not transgress\"?\n\nYudhishthira replied, \"Breath is like Mantra in the performance of rites. The mind is the performer of all rites in the course of Yajna. Only Shlokas of the [[Veda]]s, termed rucha or the [[richa]] accept oblation. The Yajna cannot surpass nor transgress the richas\".\n\n'''Question 5.''' \n\nThe Yaksha asked, \"What is heavier than Earth, higher than heavens, faster than the wind and more numerous than straws\"?\n\nYudhishthira answered, \"One's mother is heavier than the Earth, one's father is higher than the heavens, the mind is faster than the wind and our worries are more numerous than straws \".\n\n'''Question 6.''' \n\nThe Yaksha asked, \"Who is the friend of a traveller? Who is the friend of one who is ill and one who is dying\"?\n\nYudhishthira's response, \"The friend of a traveller is his companion. The physician is the friend of one who is sick and a dying man's friend is charity\".\n\n'''Question 7.''' \n\nThe Yaksha asked, \"What is that which, when renounced, makes one lovable? What is that which is renounced makes happy and wealthy\"?\n\nYudhishthira replied, \"Pride, if renounced makes one lovable, renouncing desire one becomes wealthy and to renounce avarice is to obtain happiness\".\n\n'''Question 8.''' \n\nThe Yaksha asked, \"What enemy is invincible? What constitutes an incurable disease? What sort of man is noble and what sort is ignoble\"?\n\nAnd Yudhishthira responded, \"Anger is the invincible enemy. Covetousness constitutes a disease that is incurable. He is noble who desires the well-being of all creatures, and he is ignoble who is without mercy\".\n\n'''Question 9.''' \n\nThe Yaksha asked, \"Who is truly happy? What is the greatest wonder? What is the path? And what is the news\"?\n\nWhereupon Yudhishthira replied, \"He who has no debts is truly happy. Day after day countless people die. Yet living wishes to live forever. O Lord, what can be a greater wonder? Argument leads to no certain conclusion, the Srutis are different from one another; there is not even one Rishi whose opinion can be accepted by all. The truth about Dharma and duty is hidden in the cave of our hearts, therefore that alone is the path along which the great have trod. This world full of ignorance is like a pan. The sun is fire, the days and nights are fuel. The months and the seasons constitute the wooden ladle. Time is the cook that is cooking all creatures in that pan (with such aids). This is the news\".\n\nEven though Yudhishthira had answered all questions in a satisfactory manner, the Yaksha only allowed him to choose one of his brothers to be living.\n\nYudhishthira said, \"I choose my younger brother, Nakula\"\n\nWhen the Yaksha asked him why he chose Nakula when he could choose sharp Arjuna or brave Bheema\n\nYudhishthira replied, \"I love Kunti, my mother and Madri, my stepmother equally, If I choose my blood brothers it will give injustice to Madri, hence I choose Nakula.\n\nThe Yaksha was impressed by how Yudhishthira followed Dharma in every little thing he did.  At the end of the questions, the Yaksha revealed himself to be Yama-Dharma, the god of death, who was none other than Yudhishthira's father. He also admitted to Yudhishthira that it was he who had stolen the arani disguised in the form of the deer. He blessed him saying since he had adhered to Dharma (righteousness), the Dharma would protect them and no-one would recognise them during the Ajnata Vasa. [1]He also got his brothers back from heaven.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Yudhishthira]]\n*[[Yaksha Kingdom]]\n*[[Yama Dharma]]\n\n==References==\n{{No footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n*''Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend'' by Anna Dallapiccola\n*''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' Ed. by Dr. Nagendra Kr.

The physician is the friend of one who is sick and a dying man's friend is charity\".\n\nQuestion 7. The Yaksha asked, \"What is that which, when renounced, makes one lovable? What is that which is renounced makes happy and wealthy\"?\n\nYudhishthira replied, \"Pride, if renounced makes one lovable, renouncing desire one becomes wealthy and to renounce avarice is to obtain happiness\".\n\nQuestion 8. The Yaksha asked, \"What enemy is invincible? What constitutes an incurable disease? What sort of man is noble and what sort is ignoble\"?\n\nAnd Yudhishthira responded, \"Anger is the invincible enemy. Covetousness constitutes a disease that is incurable. He is noble who desires the well-being of all creatures, and he is ignoble who is without mercy\".\n\nQuestion 9. The Yaksha asked, \"Who is truly happy? What is the greatest wonder? What is the path? And what is the news\"?\n\nWhereupon Yudhishthira replied, \"He who has no debts is truly happy. Day after day countless people die. Yet living wishes to live forever. O Lord, what can be a greater wonder? Argument leads to no certain conclusion, the Srutis are different from one another; there is not even one Rishi whose opinion can be accepted by all. The truth about Dharma and duty is hidden in the cave of our hearts, therefore that alone is the path along which the great have trod. This world full of ignorance is like a pan. The sun is fire, the days and nights are fuel. The months and the seasons constitute the wooden ladle. Time is the cook that is cooking all creatures in that pan (with such aids). This is the news\".\n\nEven though Yudhishthira had answered all questions in a satisfactory manner, the Yaksha only allowed him to choose one of his brothers to be living.\nYudhishthira said, \"I choose my younger brother, Nakula\"When the Yaksha asked him why he chose Nakula when he could choose sharp Arjuna or brave Bheema\nYudhishthira replied, \"I love Kunti, my mother and Madri, my stepmother equally, If I choose my blood brothers it will give injustice to Madri, hence I choose Nakula.\n\nThe Yaksha was impressed by how Yudhishthira followed Dharma in every little thing he did.  At the end of the questions, the Yaksha revealed himself to be Yama-Dharma, the god of death, who was none other than Yudhishthira's father. He also admitted to Yudhishthira that it was he who had stolen the arani disguised in the form of the deer. He blessed him saying since he had adhered to Dharma (righteousness), the Dharma would protect them and no-one would recognise them during the Ajnata Vasa. [1]He also got his brothers back from heaven.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Yudhishthira]]\n*[[Yaksha Kingdom]]\n*[[Yama Dharma]]\n\n==References==\n{{No footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n*''Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend'' by Anna Dallapiccola\n*''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' Ed. by Dr. Nagendra Kr.

Kaidan is born with the ability to \"manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields\" called biotics, allowing for telekinesis and other abilities.<ref name=\"Biotics\"/> \n\nThe character is initially introduced in the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'' as an Alliance Marine and primary squad member in [[Commander Shepard]]'s team. Kaidan's fate on the planet Virmire is part of a pivotal decision which the player has to make in order to advance the narrative. If Kaidan survives the events of ''Mass Effect'', by the events of ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' he is encountered on the human colony of Horizon after Shepard receives a tip that Horizon will be the next human colony to be abducted by the enigmatic race known as the Collectors. In ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', Kaidan initially appears at the Alliance base in [[Vancouver]] before taking off on a mission to Mars with Shepard and the crew of the ''Normandy'' SR-2.\n\nInitially presented as a heterosexual love interest for a female Shepard in the first game, the character is reintroduced in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a bisexual love interest, a decision by BioWare which attracted mostly praise as well as some criticism. Kaidan has received an overall mixed to positive reception throughout his appearances in the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy. \n\nKaidan is voiced by [[Raphael Sbarge]].\n\n==Character overview==\nKaidan is a human Alliance marine officer born with biotic capability after his mother is affected by \"Element Zero\" during an incident in [[Singapore]] while he was ''[[in utero]]''. In gameplay terms, Kaidan is a \"Sentinel\", who combines biotic and technological abilities to manipulate the environment, enhance defensive capabilities, disable and track enemies. Kaidan suffers from infrequent, but debilitating, migraines as a side effect of the controversial L2 implants he was fitted with during his time at Biotic Acclimatization and Temperance Training (\"BAaT\"), nicknamed \"brain camp\" by Kaidan.<ref name=\"VB\"/>  BAaT was an experimental group and a forerunner to the System Alliance's biotic training programs in the present day.<ref name=\"VB\"/> The conditions were poor, and he and his classmates were treated badly by a turian instructor named Vyrnnus who was openly racist towards his students.<ref name=\"VB\"/> After BAaT was shut down following an accident that resulted in Vyrnnus' death, Kaidan enlisted with the Alliance Navy, and he was eventually transferred onboard the SSV ''Normandy''.<ref name=\"VB\"/> Sbarge said he could relate to Kaidan in that the character is guided by his conscience and tries do the right thing.<ref name=\"Sbarge\"/> \n\nKaidan is cited as an example of the consequences that come with branching narratives in video games.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/> In the first game the player has to decide whether Kaidan or [[List_of_Mass_Effect_characters#Ashley_Williams|Ashley Williams]], both of whom serve to fulfill important mission objectives and are potential love interests for Shepard depending on their gender, would survive during a late-game mission on the planet Virmire. The squad member who survives will afterwards serve as a constant reminder of the player's choices throughout the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/> Kaidan shares the same overall story arc as Ashley in the sequels and while both characters effectively function as opposite-gender placeholders for one another throughout the trilogy, they start off differently in the first game and have distinct personalities and skills.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/>  \n\nKaidan is a romance option for a female Shepard in the first game, and their relationship could persist over the entire trilogy depending on the player's choices. He can also be romanced by a male Shepard in ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', where he would reveal his unrequited feelings for the Commander.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Kaidan's voice actor Raphael Sbarge revealed in an interview with ''Video Game Sophistry'' dated May 2013 that he had previously spoken to BioWare about it, and was \"thrilled when they introduced the Homosexual romance options in ''Mass Effect 3'' just because obviously there was a huge audience\".<ref name=\"VGS\"/> \n\n==Creation and development==\nBioWare opted to reuse Kaidan's visage from the first game and updated his face model for ''Mass Effect 3''. Kaidan's face is modeled after Luciano Costa.<ref name=\"Gentlegeek\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAq5MGARNpc&t=24s|date=November 26, 2014|title=[Interview] Rana McAnear & Luciano Costa, Samara et Kaidan dans Mass Effect|publisher=Official Gentlegeek Channel|website=YouTube|accessdate=March 19, 2020}}</ref> BioWare decided to overhaul Kaidan's look to make him more memorable: in contrast to his generic outfit in the first game, Kaidan's default armor has a blue-and-white theme. The armor design went through multiple iterations as the team was figuring out the Systems Alliance colors for human male characters before settling on the final color scheme.<ref name=\"Art\"/> The character is given a more muscular redesign in order to \"show that he's seen a lot of action and is ready to fight in the biggest war the galaxy has ever seen\".<ref name=\"Art\"/>  \n\nSbarge used his natural speaking voice for the character, but spoke slightly more formally.<ref name=\"VGS\"/> During his interview with ''GameFanatics'', Sbarge credited [[Ginny McSwain]], a voice director on the first two games, for helping him find the tone for Kaidan to balance his military background along with a solid and straightforward personality, which according to Sbarge has become the character's hallmark.<ref name=\"Sbarge\"/> He commented on the fan reaction to the fully voice acted version of the apology email Kaidan sent to Shepard after the two meet on Horizon in ''Mass Effect 2'', which he released as a sound file on November 24, 2011 as a Thanksgiving Day present for the ''Mass Effect'' fandom. He did not anticipate that it went viral and that he would receive an overwhelming amount of positive reception from fans all over the world.<ref name=\"Sbarge\"/>\n\nSbarge revealed in the 2013 interview that Kaidan was originally planned to be a romance option for both genders in the original ''Mass Effect'', and that he did work on the extra content that never made it to the final version of the game.<ref name=\"VGS\"/> In March 2017, Jessica Lachenal from ''The Mary Sue'' reported that fans have uncovered cut content from the game files of the original trilogy, which reveal entirely voice-acted lines from both Ashley and Kaidan for a same-sex romances relationship with Shepard which never made the final cut of the first game, as well as coded lines where Kaidan would address a male Shepard as if he was female.<ref name=\"MarySue\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\n====''Mass Effect''====\n{{main|Mass Effect (video game)}}\nAlenko first appears on the SSV ''Normandy'' as a Staff Lieutenant and head of the starship's marine detail. He accompanies Shepard on his first mission to Eden Prime where they learn that Saren is leading the attack with the geth. Upon encountering Gunnery Sergeant Ashley Williams, she joins the mission and following the mission on Eden Prime, he gives his recommendation to Captain Anderson that she should be assigned to the ''Normandy''.\n\nAfter several missions, the squad is ordered to the planet, Virmire, where Shepard can assign Kaidan or Ashley to work with the salarians or assemble the bomb that will be used to destroy Saren's facility. Shepard will later be given a choice between saving either Ashley or Kaidan, as Shepard's forces have only adequate resources to save one of them during the evacuation.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/> If Kaidan is chosen, he will express [[survivor's guilt]] over the fact that Ashley was left behind and killed, having prepared to sacrifice his own life for the rest of the team.\n\n====''Mass Effect 2''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 2}}\nIf Kaidan survives the events on Virmire, he will appear on the ''Normandy'' before it is destroyed by the Collector ship. Shepard will order him to an escape pod before the ''Normandy's'' demise. He will not appear again until Shepard's mission to the human colony, Horizon, having been stationed there after an anonymous tip that the colony would be attacked. He will express disappointment and anger that Shepard did not reach out to him during the two years since he/she was presumed dead and the fact that he is now working with Cerberus. Shepard will invite him to join the crew of the new ''Normandy'', but Kaidan refuses, stating that he doesn't not trust Cerberus and never will. Following this encounter, he will send Shepard a message at his private terminal apologizing for his harsh words during the exchange. He is not seen again until Mass Effect 3.\n\n====''Mass Effect 3''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 3}}\nKaidan will appear in Vancouver at the Alliance base before the Reaper attack. Following the invasion, Kaidan will accompany Lieutenant James Vega and Commander Shepard on a mission to Mars to find Asari Prothean expert, Doctor Liara T'Soni. During the mission, Kaidan is critically injured by a hi-tech Cerberus mech and is hospitalized on the Citadel. While recuperating in the hospital, Ambassador Udina makes Kaidan an offer to become a Spectre, which Shepard can encourage him to accept.\n\nShepard can choose to visit Kaidan following each main storyline mission and during this time the basis for a romance can be either established or re-established. Following a message from the Salarian Councilor to Commander Shepard regarding Councilor Udina's betrayal, Kaidan is assigned to protect the Council, something that pits him against Shepard when he comes to confront Udina. If Kaidan is unable to be convinced that Udina is guilty, either Shepard or one of his squadmates will shoot him. If Kaidan can be convinced, either he or Shepard will shoot Udina. In the aftermath, Shepard can either offer him a spot on the crew, or send him to the Alliance to become a war asset.\n\nIf Kaidan accompanies Shepard on the final mission to the Conduit in London and the player has not accrued enough war asset points, Kaidan will die. If Kaidan survives and is in a relationship with Shepard, he will place a plaque on the memorial wall on the ''Normandy''. If enough war points are accrued, Shepard will survive and Kaidan will not place the plaque, but instead will smile in reminiscence.\n\n===In Other Media===\n====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====\nKaidan is the protagonist of the fourth issue of the comic series ''Mass Effect: Foundation'', which retells his time training at BAaT. He fell in love with a girl named Rahna, but the potential for a relationship dissolves after he accidentally killed their instructor, a turian named Vyrnnus, who broke Rahna's arm during a training exercise gone wrong.\n\n==Reception==\nKaidan Alenko's characterization and story arc throughout the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy have received a mixed response from video game journalists and fans.<ref name=\"Prima\">{{cite web |url=https://primagames.com/feature/heres-why-live-action-mass-effect-series-wont-work |title=Here\u2019s Why a Live-Action Mass Effect Movie Won\u2019t Work|author= Liana Ruppert|date=January 6, 2020 |work=Prima Games |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref> Notably, ''PC Gamer'' staff do not approve of the character. Wes Fenlon explained in an article written shortly after the release of ''Mass Effect 3'' that his antipathy for Kaidan is because his voice reminded him of a character he considers to be very obnoxious: [[Carth Onasi]], a character from ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' who is also voiced by Raphael Sbarge. As a result, he did not care about whether Kaidan was a nuanced character, and paid little attention to him during his playthroughs.<ref name=\"Hate\"/> Nevertheless, he praised BioWare's dedication to carry the player's decision to save or abandon Kaidan on Virmire through the entire trilogy, calling it \"a landmark moment for interactive storytelling\" and said that he felt \"less of a content consumer and more of a collaborator in their storytelling\" as a result. In a later article, he considers Kaidan to be marginally better then [[Jacob Taylor]] and called him \"a boring male starter companion\".<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Fenlon's colleague Ben Griffin was in agreement, calling Kaidan dull and \"the only forgettable companion in the ''Mass Effect'' games\".<ref name=\"Best and Worst\"/> ''[[GamesRadar]]'s'' Jordan Baughman identified Kaidan as \"The Pile of Grey Sludge (aka The Male Support Character)\" character archetype, typically encountered as the most boring companion character in BioWare titles who is \"generic to the extreme\".<ref name=\"Recycled\"/> The ''[[Guinness World Records]] Gamer's Edition 2015 Ebook'' revealed that Kaidan was the least popular ''Mass Effect 3'' squad member who was the choice of 1.5% of the player base.<ref>''The Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2015 Ebook'', p. 74.</ref> Liana Rupert from ''Prima Games'' commented that Kaidan was one of the widely disliked characters in the ''Mass Effect'' series due to his [[social norms|\"very by-the-books\" character]].<ref name=\"Prima\"/>\n\nOther media outlets have been more positive in their evaluation of the character. Kristine Steimer from IGN revealed in an article originally dated February 2010 that she enjoyed her conversations with Kaidan, praised the character's loyalty as his best quality, and looked forward to completing the character's romance arc with her Shepard in any further DLC content or sequels for the series.<ref name=\"Idea\"/> Alex Knapp, a staff writer at ''Forbes'', initially had an \"irrational dislike\" of Kaidan due to his experiences with the character in the first game.<ref name=\"Forbes1\"/> Knapp disclosed in a later article that he had completely changed his mind about Kaidan after completing ''Mass Effect 3'' with him in his squad, praising his character development and also his gameplay utility during combat missions because his powers are well balanced.<ref name=\"Forbes2\"/> A few sources have commented that much of the fanbase missed out on Kaidan's growth as a character during ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Prima\"/><ref name=\"VB\"/> Daniel Horowitz, writing for ''[[VentureBeat]]'', said Kaidan was the most overlooked character in the series and generally not marketed well by BioWare; he drew attention to the fact that the trilogy's promo art has historically focused on a male Shepard, and Ashley was featured prominently in promos for the first ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"VB\"/> Horowitz went into detail about Kaidan's story arc in the trilogy, and argued that while his subtle characterization and understated nature does not generate as much fan interest as Shepard's other companions, he is \"the most developed, well-rounded and fully realized character in the ''Mass Effect'' universe\".<ref name=\"VB\"/> \n\nKaidan's involvement in the narrative as a potential survivor of the \"Virmire Decision\" is well received. IGN included the Virmire Decision in the first game<ref group=note>The article's author, Destin Legarie, implied a preference for Kaidan over Ashley.</ref> in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.<ref name=\"Thirteen\"/> The \"Virmire Survivor\", a role he shares with Ashley Williams in the trilogy, is discussed in the 2017 book ''100 Greatest Video Game Characters''.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/> Lynda Clark, who wrote the Virmire Survivor's entry in the book, observed that Kaidan's backstory is reminiscent of a [[superhero]] [[origin story]]; while Ashley is statistically more likely to be chosen as the Virmire Survivor by players, Kaidan is preferred by a vocal and influential minority of ''Mass Effect'' fans who primarily favor the female version of Commander Shepard.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/>\n\nThe potential romance to Kaidan has also been of some interest. In Chapter 1 of the book ''Digital Love: Romance and Sexuality in Games'', Michelle Clough presented a case study which illustrated how the character is an example of the shifting portrayal of male sexualization in the original trilogy.<ref name=\"Digital\"/> While Kaidan is presented as a love interest for a female Shepard who is conventionally attractive and has an appealing personality in the first game, she noted that there was little acknowledgment of the physical aspect of his appeal, and outside of a sex scene which mostly focuses on a female Shepard's body, little opportunity for the character to be appreciated in a sexual context. This is contrasted with Kaidan's more sexualized presentation in ''Mass Effect 3'', where the character is shirtless in multiple scenes, and more emphasis is placed on the intimacy between him and Shepard. During one scene where Kaidan is reboarding the ''Normandy'' and still in a relationship with Shepard, the camera alternates quick cuts between a close up of Kaidan's buttocks and a close up of Shepard's gaze, indicating that [[Female gaze|she enjoys looking at him in a sexual way]].<ref name=\"Digital\"/> Clough concluded that Kaidan's overall depiction in ''3'' framed him as a good choice for Shepard as a romantic and sexual partner. \n\n===Same-sex romance option===\n[[File:KaidanME3Romance.jpg|thumb|right|Shepard's response to Kaidan if a male player character reciprocates his affections in ''Mass Effect 3''.]]\nBioWare's decision to offer Kaidan as a same-sex romance option for a male Shepard player character in ''Mass Effect 3'' generated significant coverage about the sexuality of the aforementioned characters, and a broad discussion on the issue of [[LGBT themes in video games|LGBT themes in the ''Mass Effect'' series]].<ref name=\"Chaos\"/><ref name=\"Flames\"/><ref name=\"Queer\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]'' published an article on May 16, 2011, less then a day after developer [[Casey Hudson]]'s announcement about the game's incorporation of same-sex romances, reporting that some players have spoken out over their concerns about characters that have been established over the course of one or both of ''Mass Effect 3's'' prequels may undergo \"implausible and abrupt sexual transformations\" at the expense of \"narrative consistency and integrity\".<ref name=\"Worry\"/> One user comment highlighted by the article specifically claimed that the character is \"sometimes nervous with opposite sex but never with men\".<ref name=\"Worry\"/> \n\nFollowing ''Mass Effect 3's'' release, Kaidan's inclusion as a romance option for a male Shepard was mostly well received.<ref name=\"Forbes2\"/><ref name=\"IntoTheSpine\"/><ref name=\"Gaym\"/> Horowitz's article for ''VentureBeat'' argued that \"the friendship, relationship and eventual partnership with Kaidan offers far more depth and reward than the one with Ashley, or arguably any other character in the game by a wide margin\".<ref name=\"VB\"/> ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' and ''[[Gay Community News (Dublin)|Gay Community News]]'' named Kaidan as one of the best [[queer]] characters from video games of all time, both praising BioWare's decision to allow players to pursue a same-sex relationship with him in ''3'' as progressive.<ref name=\"GCN\"/><ref name=\"Advocate\"/> Conversely, ''[[Queerty]]'' noted in its positive coverage of the topic that there were some negative user-generated comments on [[Metacritic]] which focused criticism on the presence of gay male sex scenes in the game, as well as its possible correlation with the below-average Metacritic user rating for ''Mass Effect 3'' at the time.<ref name=\"Queerty\"/> Craig Takeuchi from the ''[[Georgia Straight]]'' reported on negative reception to the game's same-sex relationship content, which consisted of dismissive and homophobic comments which were posted on several websites. He compared the gaming world to the world of sports, which \"has been slow and resistant to addressing homophobia or including gay content\".<ref name=\"Straight\"/> \n\n''Kotaku's'' Denis Farr, who identifies as openly gay decided to [[Role-playing|role-play]] his version of Shepard as a [[closeted]] male soldier who show no interest in female or feminine characters throughout the series, alluding his character's experience to the [[United States government]]'s former [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy.<ref name=\"Flames\"/> He noted that he has to accept a willful suspension of belief concerning the gender and sexual politics of the world of ''Mass Effect'': prior to the introduction of same-sex romance between male characters and openly homosexual characters in ''Mass Effect 3'', he was unable to express his avatar character's romantic desires (which matches his own) in the game universe, and that his character's particular journey through ''Mass Effect 3'', which involves a late blooming romance with Kaidan that was not possible in the game's prequels<ref group=note>Kaidan would justify his belated expression of romantic interest towards a male Shepard by telling him: \"You were always so focused on the work back then. The mission was everything.\".</ref>, was a necessity born out of the series' options.<ref name=\"Queer\"/><ref name=\"Flames\"/> He concluded that the ''Mass Effect's'' series' own evolution of its concept of male same-sex romances is a direct reflection of our own world's politics on gender and sexual identity, and that as time progressed, so did the series' sexual politics.<ref name=\"Flames\"/> Todd Harper, who wrote the essay titled \"Role-Play as Queer Lens: How \"ClosetShep\" Changed My Vision of ''Mass Effect''\" published in the 2017 book ''Queer Game Studies'', compared Farr's experience to his own when attempting to interpret his version of Shepard as a queer character in a technologically advanced world where a human and an alien can have a relationship unquestioned and unchallenged by the wider society.<ref name=\"Queer\"/> As a character that can be romanced by either gender, Kaidan has what Harper terms \"[[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat in popular culture|Schr\u00f6dinger's sexuality]]\", an observation he made that Kaidan's sexuality \"exists in a sort of quantum superposition that the player can collapse into observed certainty by choosing to romance or not\", and that it is \"defined primarily by his relationship to Shepard\".<ref name=\"Queer\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<!--Mass Effect media and codex-->\n<ref name=\"Art\">{{cite book |last1=Hudson |first1=Casey |last2=Watts |first2=Derek |authorlink1=Casey Hudson |title=The Art of the Mass Effect Universe |date=February 2, 2012 |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]] |isbn=978-1-59582-768-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Biotics\">{{cite video game |title=Mass Effect |developer=BioWare |quote='''Codex - Biotics''': Biotics is the ability of rare individuals to manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through the use of electrical impulses from the brain.

''[[Mass Effect]]'' franchise, who acts as a  [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]] (or \"squadmate\") in the first and third games in the series. Kaidan is born with the ability to \"manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields\" called biotics, allowing for telekinesis and other abilities.<ref name=\"Biotics\"/> \n\nThe character is initially introduced in the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'' as an Alliance Marine and primary squad member in [[Commander Shepard]]'s team. Kaidan's fate on the planet Virmire is part of a pivotal decision which the player has to make in order to advance the narrative. If Kaidan survives the events of ''Mass Effect'', by the events of ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' he is encountered on the human colony of Horizon after Shepard receives a tip that Horizon will be the next human colony to be abducted by the enigmatic race known as the Collectors. In ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', Kaidan initially appears at the Alliance base in [[Vancouver]] before taking off on a mission to Mars with Shepard and the crew of the ''Normandy'' SR-2.\n\nInitially presented as a heterosexual love interest for a female Shepard in the first game, the character is reintroduced in ''Mass Effect 3'' as a bisexual love interest, a decision by BioWare which attracted mostly praise as well as some criticism. Kaidan has received an overall mixed to positive reception throughout his appearances in the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy. \n\nKaidan is voiced by [[Raphael Sbarge]].\n\n==Character overview==\nKaidan is a human Alliance marine officer born with biotic capability after his mother is affected by \"Element Zero\" during an incident in [[Singapore]] while he was ''[[in utero]]''. In gameplay terms, Kaidan is a \"Sentinel\", who combines biotic and technological abilities to manipulate the environment, enhance defensive capabilities, disable and track enemies. Kaidan suffers from infrequent, but debilitating, migraines as a side effect of the controversial L2 implants he was fitted with during his time at Biotic Acclimatization and Temperance Training (\"BAaT\"), nicknamed \"brain camp\" by Kaidan.<ref name=\"VB\"/>  BAaT was an experimental group and a forerunner to the System Alliance's biotic training programs in the present day.<ref name=\"VB\"/> The conditions were poor, and he and his classmates were treated badly by a turian instructor named Vyrnnus who was openly racist towards his students.<ref name=\"VB\"/> After BAaT was shut down following an accident that resulted in Vyrnnus' death, Kaidan enlisted with the Alliance Navy, and he was eventually transferred onboard the SSV ''Normandy''.<ref name=\"VB\"/> Sbarge said he could relate to Kaidan in that the character is guided by his conscience and tries do the right thing.<ref name=\"Sbarge\"/> \n\nKaidan is cited as an example of the consequences that come with branching narratives in video games.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/> In the first game the player has to decide whether Kaidan or [[List_of_Mass_Effect_characters#Ashley_Williams|Ashley Williams]], both of whom serve to fulfill important mission objectives and are potential love interests for Shepard depending on their gender, would survive during a late-game mission on the planet Virmire. The squad member who survives will afterwards serve as a constant reminder of the player's choices throughout the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/> Kaidan shares the same overall story arc as Ashley in the sequels and while both characters effectively function as opposite-gender placeholders for one another throughout the trilogy, they start off differently in the first game and have distinct personalities and skills.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/>  \n\nKaidan is a romance option for a female Shepard in the first game, and their relationship could persist over the entire trilogy depending on the player's choices. He can also be romanced by a male Shepard in ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', where he would reveal his unrequited feelings for the Commander.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Kaidan's voice actor Raphael Sbarge revealed in an interview with ''Video Game Sophistry'' dated May 2013 that he had previously spoken to BioWare about it, and was \"thrilled when they introduced the Homosexual romance options in ''Mass Effect 3'' just because obviously there was a huge audience\".<ref name=\"VGS\"/> \n\n==Creation and development==\nBioWare opted to reuse Kaidan's visage from the first game and updated his face model for ''Mass Effect 3''. Kaidan's face is modeled after Luciano Costa.<ref name=\"Gentlegeek\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAq5MGARNpc&t=24s|date=November 26, 2014|title=[Interview] Rana McAnear & Luciano Costa, Samara et Kaidan dans Mass Effect|publisher=Official Gentlegeek Channel|website=YouTube|accessdate=March 19, 2020}}</ref> BioWare decided to overhaul Kaidan's look to make him more memorable: in contrast to his generic outfit in the first game, Kaidan's default armor has a blue-and-white theme. The armor design went through multiple iterations as the team was figuring out the Systems Alliance colors for human male characters before settling on the final color scheme.<ref name=\"Art\"/> The character is given a more muscular redesign in order to \"show that he's seen a lot of action and is ready to fight in the biggest war the galaxy has ever seen\".<ref name=\"Art\"/>  \n\nSbarge used his natural speaking voice for the character, but spoke slightly more formally.<ref name=\"VGS\"/> During his interview with ''GameFanatics'', Sbarge credited [[Ginny McSwain]], a voice director on the first two games, for helping him find the tone for Kaidan to balance his military background along with a solid and straightforward personality, which according to Sbarge has become the character's hallmark.<ref name=\"Sbarge\"/> He commented on the fan reaction to the fully voice acted version of the apology email Kaidan sent to Shepard after the two meet on Horizon in ''Mass Effect 2'', which he released as a sound file on November 24, 2011 as a Thanksgiving Day present for the ''Mass Effect'' fandom. He did not anticipate that it went viral and that he would receive an overwhelming amount of positive reception from fans all over the world.<ref name=\"Sbarge\"/>\n\nSbarge revealed in the 2013 interview that Kaidan was originally planned to be a romance option for both genders in the original ''Mass Effect'', and that he did work on the extra content that never made it to the final version of the game.<ref name=\"VGS\"/> In March 2017, Jessica Lachenal from ''The Mary Sue'' reported that fans have uncovered cut content from the game files of the original trilogy, which reveal entirely voice-acted lines from both Ashley and Kaidan for a same-sex romances relationship with Shepard which never made the final cut of the first game, as well as coded lines where Kaidan would address a male Shepard as if he was female.<ref name=\"MarySue\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\n====''Mass Effect''====\n{{main|Mass Effect (video game)}}\nAlenko first appears on the SSV ''Normandy'' as a Staff Lieutenant and head of the starship's marine detail. He accompanies Shepard on his first mission to Eden Prime where they learn that Saren is leading the attack with the geth. Upon encountering Gunnery Sergeant Ashley Williams, she joins the mission and following the mission on Eden Prime, he gives his recommendation to Captain Anderson that she should be assigned to the ''Normandy''.\n\nAfter several missions, the squad is ordered to the planet, Virmire, where Shepard can assign Kaidan or Ashley to work with the salarians or assemble the bomb that will be used to destroy Saren's facility. Shepard will later be given a choice between saving either Ashley or Kaidan, as Shepard's forces have only adequate resources to save one of them during the evacuation.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/> If Kaidan is chosen, he will express [[survivor's guilt]] over the fact that Ashley was left behind and killed, having prepared to sacrifice his own life for the rest of the team.\n\n====''Mass Effect 2''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 2}}\nIf Kaidan survives the events on Virmire, he will appear on the ''Normandy'' before it is destroyed by the Collector ship. Shepard will order him to an escape pod before the ''Normandy's'' demise. He will not appear again until Shepard's mission to the human colony, Horizon, having been stationed there after an anonymous tip that the colony would be attacked. He will express disappointment and anger that Shepard did not reach out to him during the two years since he/she was presumed dead and the fact that he is now working with Cerberus. Shepard will invite him to join the crew of the new ''Normandy'', but Kaidan refuses, stating that he doesn't not trust Cerberus and never will. Following this encounter, he will send Shepard a message at his private terminal apologizing for his harsh words during the exchange. He is not seen again until Mass Effect 3.\n\n====''Mass Effect 3''====\n{{main|Mass Effect 3}}\nKaidan will appear in Vancouver at the Alliance base before the Reaper attack. Following the invasion, Kaidan will accompany Lieutenant James Vega and Commander Shepard on a mission to Mars to find Asari Prothean expert, Doctor Liara T'Soni. During the mission, Kaidan is critically injured by a hi-tech Cerberus mech and is hospitalized on the Citadel. While recuperating in the hospital, Ambassador Udina makes Kaidan an offer to become a Spectre, which Shepard can encourage him to accept.\n\nShepard can choose to visit Kaidan following each main storyline mission and during this time the basis for a romance can be either established or re-established. Following a message from the Salarian Councilor to Commander Shepard regarding Councilor Udina's betrayal, Kaidan is assigned to protect the Council, something that pits him against Shepard when he comes to confront Udina. If Kaidan is unable to be convinced that Udina is guilty, either Shepard or one of his squadmates will shoot him. If Kaidan can be convinced, either he or Shepard will shoot Udina. In the aftermath, Shepard can either offer him a spot on the crew, or send him to the Alliance to become a war asset.\n\nIf Kaidan accompanies Shepard on the final mission to the Conduit in London and the player has not accrued enough war asset points, Kaidan will die. If Kaidan survives and is in a relationship with Shepard, he will place a plaque on the memorial wall on the ''Normandy''. If enough war points are accrued, Shepard will survive and Kaidan will not place the plaque, but instead will smile in reminiscence.\n\n===In Other Media===\n====''Mass Effect: Homeworlds''====\nKaidan is the protagonist of the fourth issue of the comic series ''Mass Effect: Foundation'', which retells his time training at BAaT. He fell in love with a girl named Rahna, but the potential for a relationship dissolves after he accidentally killed their instructor, a turian named Vyrnnus, who broke Rahna's arm during a training exercise gone wrong.\n\n==Reception==\nKaidan Alenko's characterization and story arc throughout the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy have received a mixed response from video game journalists and fans.<ref name=\"Prima\">{{cite web |url=https://primagames.com/feature/heres-why-live-action-mass-effect-series-wont-work |title=Here\u2019s Why a Live-Action Mass Effect Movie Won\u2019t Work|author= Liana Ruppert|date=January 6, 2020 |work=Prima Games |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref> Notably, ''PC Gamer'' staff do not approve of the character. Wes Fenlon explained in an article written shortly after the release of ''Mass Effect 3'' that his antipathy for Kaidan is because his voice reminded him of a character he considers to be very obnoxious: [[Carth Onasi]], a character from ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' who is also voiced by Raphael Sbarge. As a result, he did not care about whether Kaidan was a nuanced character, and paid little attention to him during his playthroughs.<ref name=\"Hate\"/> Nevertheless, he praised BioWare's dedication to carry the player's decision to save or abandon Kaidan on Virmire through the entire trilogy, calling it \"a landmark moment for interactive storytelling\" and said that he felt \"less of a content consumer and more of a collaborator in their storytelling\" as a result. In a later article, he considers Kaidan to be marginally better then [[Jacob Taylor]] and called him \"a boring male starter companion\".<ref name=\"PCGamer\"/> Fenlon's colleague Ben Griffin was in agreement, calling Kaidan dull and \"the only forgettable companion in the ''Mass Effect'' games\".<ref name=\"Best and Worst\"/> ''[[GamesRadar]]'s'' Jordan Baughman identified Kaidan as \"The Pile of Grey Sludge (aka The Male Support Character)\" character archetype, typically encountered as the most boring companion character in BioWare titles who is \"generic to the extreme\".<ref name=\"Recycled\"/> The ''[[Guinness World Records]] Gamer's Edition 2015 Ebook'' revealed that Kaidan was the least popular ''Mass Effect 3'' squad member who was the choice of 1.5% of the player base.<ref>''The Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2015 Ebook'', p. 74.</ref> Liana Rupert from ''Prima Games'' commented that Kaidan was one of the widely disliked characters in the ''Mass Effect'' series due to his [[social norms|\"very by-the-books\" character]].<ref name=\"Prima\"/>\n\nOther media outlets have been more positive in their evaluation of the character. Kristine Steimer from IGN revealed in an article originally dated February 2010 that she enjoyed her conversations with Kaidan, praised the character's loyalty as his best quality, and looked forward to completing the character's romance arc with her Shepard in any further DLC content or sequels for the series.<ref name=\"Idea\"/> Alex Knapp, a staff writer at ''Forbes'', initially had an \"irrational dislike\" of Kaidan due to his experiences with the character in the first game.<ref name=\"Forbes1\"/> Knapp disclosed in a later article that he had completely changed his mind about Kaidan after completing ''Mass Effect 3'' with him in his squad, praising his character development and also his gameplay utility during combat missions because his powers are well balanced.<ref name=\"Forbes2\"/> A few sources have commented that much of the fanbase missed out on Kaidan's growth as a character during ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Prima\"/><ref name=\"VB\"/> Daniel Horowitz, writing for ''[[VentureBeat]]'', said Kaidan was the most overlooked character in the series and generally not marketed well by BioWare; he drew attention to the fact that the trilogy's promo art has historically focused on a male Shepard, and Ashley was featured prominently in promos for the first ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"VB\"/> Horowitz went into detail about Kaidan's story arc in the trilogy, and argued that while his subtle characterization and understated nature does not generate as much fan interest as Shepard's other companions, he is \"the most developed, well-rounded and fully realized character in the ''Mass Effect'' universe\".<ref name=\"VB\"/> \n\nKaidan's involvement in the narrative as a potential survivor of the \"Virmire Decision\" is well received. IGN included the Virmire Decision in the first game<ref group=note>The article's author, Destin Legarie, implied a preference for Kaidan over Ashley.</ref> in their list of 13 Best Mass Effect Moments.<ref name=\"Thirteen\"/> The \"Virmire Survivor\", a role he shares with Ashley Williams in the trilogy, is discussed in the 2017 book ''100 Greatest Video Game Characters''.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/> Lynda Clark, who wrote the Virmire Survivor's entry in the book, observed that Kaidan's backstory is reminiscent of a [[superhero]] [[origin story]]; while Ashley is statistically more likely to be chosen as the Virmire Survivor by players, Kaidan is preferred by a vocal and influential minority of ''Mass Effect'' fans who primarily favor the female version of Commander Shepard.<ref name=\"Greatest\"/>\n\nThe potential romance to Kaidan has also been of some interest. In Chapter 1 of the book ''Digital Love: Romance and Sexuality in Games'', Michelle Clough presented a case study which illustrated how the character is an example of the shifting portrayal of male sexualization in the original trilogy.<ref name=\"Digital\"/> While Kaidan is presented as a love interest for a female Shepard who is conventionally attractive and has an appealing personality in the first game, she noted that there was little acknowledgment of the physical aspect of his appeal, and outside of a sex scene which mostly focuses on a female Shepard's body, little opportunity for the character to be appreciated in a sexual context. This is contrasted with Kaidan's more sexualized presentation in ''Mass Effect 3'', where the character is shirtless in multiple scenes, and more emphasis is placed on the intimacy between him and Shepard. During one scene where Kaidan is reboarding the ''Normandy'' and still in a relationship with Shepard, the camera alternates quick cuts between a close up of Kaidan's buttocks and a close up of Shepard's gaze, indicating that [[Female gaze|she enjoys looking at him in a sexual way]].<ref name=\"Digital\"/> Clough concluded that Kaidan's overall depiction in ''3'' framed him as a good choice for Shepard as a romantic and sexual partner. \n\n===Same-Sex Romance Option===\n[[File:KaidanME3Romance.jpg|thumb|right|Shepard's response to Kaidan if a male player character reciprocates his affections in ''Mass Effect 3''.]]\nBioWare's decision to offer Kaidan as a same-sex romance option for a male Shepard player character in ''Mass Effect 3'' generated significant coverage about the sexuality of the aforementioned characters, and a broad discussion on the issue of [[LGBT themes in video games|LGBT themes in the ''Mass Effect'' series]].<ref name=\"Chaos\"/><ref name=\"Flames\"/><ref name=\"Queer\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]'' published an article on May 16, 2011, less then a day after developer [[Casey Hudson]]'s announcement about the game's incorporation of same-sex romances, reporting that some players have spoken out over their concerns about characters that have been established over the course of one or both of ''Mass Effect 3's'' prequels may undergo \"implausible and abrupt sexual transformations\" at the expense of \"narrative consistency and integrity\".<ref name=\"Worry\"/> One user comment highlighted by the article specifically claimed that the character is \"sometimes nervous with opposite sex but never with men\".<ref name=\"Worry\"/> \n\nFollowing ''Mass Effect 3's'' release, Kaidan's inclusion as a romance option for a male Shepard was mostly well received.<ref name=\"Forbes2\"/><ref name=\"IntoTheSpine\"/><ref name=\"Gaym\"/> Horowitz's article for ''VentureBeat'' argued that \"the friendship, relationship and eventual partnership with Kaidan offers far more depth and reward than the one with Ashley, or arguably any other character in the game by a wide margin\".<ref name=\"VB\"/> ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' and ''[[Gay Community News (Dublin)|Gay Community News]]'' named Kaidan as one of the best [[queer]] characters from video games of all time, both praising BioWare's decision to allow players to pursue a same-sex relationship with him in ''3'' as progressive.<ref name=\"GCN\"/><ref name=\"Advocate\"/> Conversely, ''[[Queerty]]'' noted in its positive coverage of the topic that there were some negative user-generated comments on [[Metacritic]] which focused criticism on the presence of gay male sex scenes in the game, as well as its possible correlation with the below-average Metacritic user rating for ''Mass Effect 3'' at the time.<ref name=\"Queerty\"/> Craig Takeuchi from the ''[[Georgia Straight]]'' reported on negative reception to the game's same-sex relationship content, which consisted of dismissive and homophobic comments which were posted on several websites. He compared the gaming world to the world of sports, which \"has been slow and resistant to addressing homophobia or including gay content\".<ref name=\"Straight\"/> \n\n''Kotaku's'' Denis Farr, who identifies as openly gay decided to [[Role-playing|role-play]] his version of Shepard as a [[closeted]] male soldier who show no interest in female or feminine characters throughout the series, alluding his character's experience to the [[United States government]]'s former [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy.<ref name=\"Flames\"/> He noted that he has to accept a willful suspension of belief concerning the gender and sexual politics of the world of ''Mass Effect'': prior to the introduction of same-sex romance between male characters and openly homosexual characters in ''Mass Effect 3'', he was unable to express his avatar character's romantic desires (which matches his own) in the game universe, and that his character's particular journey through ''Mass Effect 3'', which involves a late blooming romance with Kaidan that was not possible in the game's prequels<ref group=note>Kaidan would justify his belated expression of romantic interest towards a male Shepard by telling him: \"You were always so focused on the work back then. The mission was everything.\".</ref>, was a necessity born out of the series' options.<ref name=\"Queer\"/><ref name=\"Flames\"/> He concluded that the ''Mass Effect's'' series' own evolution of its concept of male same-sex romances is a direct reflection of our own world's politics on gender and sexual identity, and that as time progressed, so did the series' sexual politics.<ref name=\"Flames\"/> Todd Harper, who wrote the essay titled \"Role-Play as Queer Lens: How \"ClosetShep\" Changed My Vision of ''Mass Effect''\" published in the 2017 book ''Queer Game Studies'', compared Farr's experience to his own when attempting to interpret his version of Shepard as a queer character in a technologically advanced world where a human and an alien can have a relationship unquestioned and unchallenged by the wider society.<ref name=\"Queer\"/> As a character that can be romanced by either gender, Kaidan has what Harper terms \"[[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat in popular culture|Schr\u00f6dinger's sexuality]]\", an observation he made that Kaidan's sexuality \"exists in a sort of quantum superposition that the player can collapse into observed certainty by choosing to romance or not\", and that it is \"defined primarily by his relationship to Shepard\".<ref name=\"Queer\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<!--Mass Effect media and codex-->\n<ref name=\"Art\">{{cite book |last1=Hudson |first1=Casey |last2=Watts |first2=Derek |authorlink1=Casey Hudson |title=The Art of the Mass Effect Universe |date=February 2, 2012 |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]] |isbn=978-1-59582-768-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Biotics\">{{cite video game |title=Mass Effect |developer=BioWare |quote='''Codex - Biotics''': Biotics is the ability of rare individuals to manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through the use of electrical impulses from the brain.

They are not in any sense \"dialects\" of standard Italian, which itself started off as one of these local tongues, but [[sister language]]s of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general.

Dante's epic poems, known collectively as the ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]],'' to which another Tuscan poet [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] later affixed the title ''Divina'', were read throughout the peninsula and his written dialect became the \"canonical standard\" that all educated [[Italians]] could understand. Dante is still credited with standardizing the Italian language. In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects.{{r|\":0\"|page=22}} Thus the dialect of [[Florence]] became the basis for what would become the official language of Italy.\n\nItalian was progressively made an official language of most of the Italian states predating unification, slowly replacing Latin, even when ruled by foreign powers (like Spain in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], or Austria in the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]), even though the masses kept speaking primarily their local vernaculars. Italian was also one of the many recognised languages in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\nItaly has always had a distinctive dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as [[city-state]]s. Those dialects now have considerable [[variety (linguistics)|variety]]. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between [[Rome|Roman]] Italian and [[Milan]]ese Italian are the [[consonant length|gemination]] of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed \"e\", and of \"s\" in some cases: e.g. ''va bene'' \"all right\" is pronounced {{IPA|[vab\u02c8b\u025b\u02d0ne]}} by a Roman (and by any standard Italian speaker), {{IPA|[va\u02c8be\u02d0ne]}} by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies to the north of the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]); ''a casa'' \"at home\" is {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} for Roman, {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} or {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for standard, {{IPA|[a\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for Milanese and generally northern.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n\nIn contrast to the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic linguistic panorama]] of [[northern Italy]], the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and its related dialects were largely unaffected by the Franco-[[Occitan language|Occitan]] influences introduced to Italy mainly by [[bard]]s from France during the [[Middle Ages]], but after the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]], Sicily became the first Italian land to adopt Occitan lyric moods (and words) in poetry. Even in the case of Northern Italian languages, however, scholars are careful not to overstate the effects of outsiders on the natural indigenous developments of the languages.\n\nThe economic might and relatively advanced development of Tuscany at the time ([[Late Middle Ages]]) gave its language weight, though [[Venetian language|Venetian]] remained widespread in medieval Italian commercial life, and [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian (or Genoese)]] remained in use in maritime trade alongside the Mediterranean. The increasing political and cultural relevance of [[Florence]] during the periods of the rise of the ''[[Medici bank|Banco Medici]]'', [[Humanism]], and the [[Renaissance]] made its dialect, or rather a refined version of it, a standard in the arts.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe [[Renaissance]] era, known as {{lang|it|il Rinascimento}} in Italian, was seen as a time of \"rebirth\", which is the literal meaning of both {{lang|fr|renaissance}} (from French) and {{lang|it|rinascimento}} (Italian).\n\n[[File:Pietro Bembo2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.63|[[Pietro Bembo]] was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language from the Tuscan dialect, as a literary medium, codifying the language for standard modern usage.]]\n\nDuring this time, long-existing beliefs stemming from the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] began to be understood from new perspectives as [[humanists]]\u2014individuals who placed emphasis on the human body and its full potential\u2014began to shift focus from the church to human beings themselves.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A history of Western society|last=P.|first=McKay, John|date=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Hill, Bennett D., Buckler, John.|isbn=978-0-618-52273-6|edition=8th|location=Boston|oclc=58837884}}</ref> Humanists began forming new beliefs in various forms: social, political, and intellectual. The ideals of the Renaissance were evident throughout the [[Protestant Reformation]], which took place simultaneously with the Renaissance. The Protestant Reformation began with [[Martin Luther]]'s rejection of the selling of indulgences by [[Johann Tetzel]] and other authorities within the Roman Catholic Church, resulting in Luther's eventual break-off from the Roman Catholic Church in the [[Diet of Worms]]. After Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, he founded what was then understood to be a sect of [[Catholicism]], later referred to as [[Lutheranism]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Luther's preaching in favor of faith and scripture rather than tradition led him to translate the [[Bible]] into many other languages, which would allow for people from all over Europe to read the Bible. Previously, the Bible was only translated into [[Latin]], but after this development it could be understood in many other languages, including Italian. The Italian language was able to spread even more with the help of Luther and the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]. The printing press facilitated the spread of Italian because it was able to rapidly produce texts, such as the Bible, and cut the costs of books which allowed for more people to have access to the translated Bible and new pieces of literature.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=Steven|last2=Harris|first2=Beth|title=An Introduction to the Protestant Reformation|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/renaissance-and-reformation/protestant-reformation/a/an-introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation|website=khanacademy|publisher=khanacademy|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman Catholic Church was losing its control over the population, as it was not open to change, and there was an increasing number of reformers with differing beliefs.<ref name=\":0x\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Renaissance|title=Renaissance|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc|last1=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nItalian became the language used in the courts of every state in the [[Italian peninsula]], as well as the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variety]] in the island of [[Corsica]] (but not in [[Sardinia]], which on the contrary [[Sardinian language#Savoyard period \u2013 Italian influence|underwent Italianization]] well into the late 18th century because of the prestige enjoyed by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the widespread use of Sardinian<ref>Cardia, Amos.

This discussion, known as {{lang|it|questione della lingua}} (i. e., the ''problem of the language''), ran through the Italian culture until the end of the 19th century, often linked to the political debate on achieving a united Italian state. Renaissance scholars divided into three main factions:\n* The [[purism (language)|purists]], headed by Venetian [[Pietro Bembo]] (who, in his ''[[Gli Asolani]]'', claimed the language might be based only on the great literary classics, such as [[Petrarch]] and some part of Boccaccio). The purists thought the Divine Comedy was not dignified enough because it used elements from non-lyric registers of the language.\n* [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] and other [[Florence|Florentines]] preferred the version spoken by ordinary people in their own times.\n* The [[courtier]]s, like [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], insisted that each local vernacular contribute to the new standard.\n\nA fourth faction claimed that the best Italian was the one that the papal court adopted, which was a mixture of the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] and [[Roman dialect|Roman]] dialects. \nEventually, Bembo's ideas prevailed, and the foundation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Florence (1582\u20131583), the official legislative body of the Italian language led to publication of [[Agnolo Monosini]]'s Latin tome {{lang|la|[[Floris Italicae lingue libri novem|Floris italicae linguae libri novem]]|italic=yes}} in 1604 followed by the first Italian dictionary in 1612.\n\nThe continual advancements in technology plays a crucial role in the diffusion of languages. After the invention of the [[printing press]] in the fifteenth century, the number of printing presses in Italy grew rapidly and by the year 1500 reached a total of 56, the biggest number of printing presses in all of Europe. This allowed to produce more pieces of literature at a lower cost and as the dominant language, Italian spread.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Information Technology and Economic Change: The Impact of the Printing Press|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=126|issue=3|pages=1133\u20131172|last1=Dittmar|first1=Jeremiah|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr035|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8ab843701523883bb51bb7752f2891fdfc841d18}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern era ===\nAn important event that helped the diffusion of Italian was the conquest and occupation of Italy by [[Napoleon]] in the early 19th century (who was himself of Italian-Corsican descent).

Examples are [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]], where [[Talian dialect|Talian]] is used, and the town of [[Chipilo]] near Puebla, [[Mexico]]; each continues to use a derived form of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] dating back to the nineteenth century. Another example is [[Cocoliche]], an Italian\u2013Spanish [[pidgin]] once spoken in [[Argentina]] and especially in [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Lunfardo]].\n\n=== Lingua franca ===\n{{See also|Mediterranean Lingua Franca}}\n\nStarting in late [[medieval]] times in much of Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin was replaced as the primary commercial language by Italian language variants (especially Tuscan and Venetian). These variants were consolidated during the [[Renaissance]] with the strength of Italy and the rise of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] and [[the arts]].\n\nDuring that period, Italy held artistic sway over the rest of Europe. It was the norm for all educated gentlemen to make the [[Grand Tour]], visiting Italy to see its great historical monuments and works of art. It thus became expected to learn at least some Italian. In England, while the classical languages [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] were the first to be learned, Italian became the second most common modern language after French, a position it held until the late eighteenth century when it tended to be replaced by German. [[John Milton]], for instance, wrote some of his early poetry in Italian.\n\nWithin the [[Catholic church]], Italian is known by a large part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and is used in substitution for Latin in some official documents.\n\nItalian [[loanword]]s continue to be used in most languages in matters of art and [[music]] (especially [[classical music]] including [[opera]]), in the [[design]] and [[fashion]] industries, in some sports like [[football (association)|football]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilsonline.it/italy/italianlanguage.html|title=Italian Language|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ilsonline.it|access-date=7 October 2016}}</ref> and especially, in culinary terms.\n\n== Languages and dialects ==\n{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}\n[[File:Dialetti Italia 1939.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Linguistic map of Italy according to Clemente Merlo and Carlo Tagliavini (1937)]]\n[[File:Minoranze linguistiche it.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Italy's ethno-linguistic minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|title=Lingue di Minoranza e Scuola: Carta Generale|website=Minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010152621/http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\nIn Italy, almost all the [[Languages of Italy|other languages spoken as the vernacular]] \u2014 other than standard Italian and some languages spoken among immigrant communities \u2014 are often imprecisely called \"[[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]\",<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/facts-figures-italian-language/ | title=Major Dialects of Italian|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=22 October 2015 }}</ref> even though they are quite different, with some belonging to different linguistic branches. The only exceptions to this are twelve groups considered \"[[Languages of Italy#Recognition by the Italian state|historical language minorities]]\", which are officially recognized as distinct [[minority language]]s by the law. On the other hand, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (a language spoken on the [[France|French]] island of [[Corsica]]) is closely related to medieval [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], from which Standard Italian derives and evolved.\n\nThe differences in the evolution of Latin in the different regions of Italy can be attributed to the presence of three other types of languages: [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrata, superstrata, and adstrata]]. The most prevalent were substrata (the language of the original inhabitants), as the Italian dialects were most likely simply Latin as spoken by native cultural groups. Superstrata and adstrata were both less important. Foreign conquerors of Italy that dominated different regions at different times left behind little to no influence on the dialects. Foreign cultures with which Italy engaged in peaceful relations with, such as trade, had no significant influence either.{{r|\":0\"|page=19-20}}\n\nThroughout Italy, regional variations of Standard Italian, called [[Regional Italian]], are spoken. Regional differences can be recognized by various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local language (for example, in informal situations ''{{wiktit|and\u00e0}}'', ''{{wiktit|ann\u00e0}}'' and ''{{wiktit|nare}}'' replace the standard Italian ''{{wiktit|andare}}'' in the area of Tuscany, Rome and Venice respectively for the infinitive \"to go\").\n\nThere is no definitive date when the various Italian variants of Latin\u2014including varieties that contributed to modern Standard Italian\u2014began to be distinct enough from Latin to be considered separate languages. One criterion for determining that two language variants are to be considered separate languages rather than variants of a single language is that they have evolved so that they are no longer [[mutually intelligible]]; this diagnostic is effective if mutual intelligibility is minimal or absent (e.g. in Romance, Romanian and Portuguese), but it fails in cases such as Spanish-Portuguese or Spanish-Italian, as native speakers of either pairing can understand each other well if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, on the basis of accumulated differences in morphology, syntax, phonology, and to some extent lexicon, it is not difficult to identify that for the Romance varieties of Italy, the first extant written evidence of languages that can no longer be considered Latin comes from the ninth and tenth centuries C.E. These written sources demonstrate certain vernacular characteristics and sometimes explicitly mention the use of the vernacular in Italy. Full literary manifestations of the vernacular began to surface around the 13th century in the form of various religious texts and poetry.{{r|\":0\"|page=21}}Although these are the first written records of Italian varieties separate from Latin, the spoken language had likely diverged long before the first written records appear, since those who were literate generally wrote in Latin even if they spoke other Romance varieties in person.\n\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of Standard Italian became increasingly widespread and was mirrored by a decline in the use of the dialects. An increase in literacy was one of the main driving factors (one can assume that only literates were capable of learning Standard Italian, whereas those who were illiterate had access only to their native dialect). The percentage of literates rose from 25% in 1861 to 60% in 1911, and then on to 78.1% in 1951. [[Tullio De Mauro]], an Italian linguist, has asserted that in 1861 only 2.5% of the population of Italy could speak Standard Italian. He reports that in 1951 that percentage had risen to 87%. The ability to speak Italian did not necessarily mean it was in everyday use, and most people (63.5%) still usually spoke their native dialects. In addition, other factors such as mass emigration, industrialization, and urbanization, and internal migrations after [[World War II]] contributed to the proliferation of Standard Italian. The Italians who emigrated during the [[Italian diaspora]] beginning in 1861 were often of the uneducated lower class, and thus the emigration had the effect of increasing the percentage of literates, who often knew and understood the importance of Standard Italian, back home in Italy. A large percentage of those who had emigrated also eventually returned to Italy, often more educated than when they had left.{{r|\":0\"|page=35}}\n\nThe Italian dialects have declined in the modern era, as Italy unified under Standard Italian and continues to do so aided by mass media, from newspapers to radio to television.{{r|\":0\"|page=37}}\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n[[File:It-Vangeli.ogg|thumb|[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Luke#Chapter 2|Luke 2]], 1\u20137 of the Bible being read by a speaker of Italian from [[Milan]]]]\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{transcluded section|source=Italian phonology|part=yes}}\n{{trim|{{#section-h:Italian phonology|Consonants}}}}\nItalian has a seven-vowel system, consisting of {{IPA|/a, \u025b, e, i, \u0254, o, u/}}, as well as 23 consonants. Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian phonology is conservative, preserving many words nearly unchanged from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Some examples:\n* Italian ''{{wiktita|quattordici}}'' \"fourteen\" < Latin {{smallcaps|{{wiktlat|quattuordecim}}}} (cf. Romanian ''{{wiktron|paisprezece}}/{{wiktron|pai\u0219pe}}'', Spanish ''{{wiktspa|catorce}}'', French ''{{wiktfra|quatorze}}'' {{IPA|/ka\u02c8t\u0254\u0281z/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[wikt:catorze|catorze]]|italic=yes}})\n* Italian ''settimana'' \"week\" < Latin {{smallcaps|septim\u0101na}} (cf. Romanian ''s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2n\u0103'', Spanish and Portuguese ''semana'', French ''semaine'' {{IPA|/s(\u0259)\u02c8m\u025bn/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''setmana'')\n* Italian ''medesimo'' \"same\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|medi(p)simum}} (cf. Spanish ''mismo'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mesmo'', French ''m\u00eame'' {{IPA|/m\u025bm/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''mateix''; note that Italian usually uses the shorter ''stesso'')\n* Italian ''guadagnare'' \"to win, earn, gain\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|guadany\u0101re}} < [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] {{IPA|/waidanjan/}} (cf. Spanish ''ganar'', Portuguese ''ganhar'', French ''gagner'' {{IPA|/\u0261a\u02c8\u0272e/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''guanyar'')\n\nThe conservativeness of Italian phonology is partly explained by its origin. Italian stems from a literary language that is derived from the 13th-century speech of the city of [[Florence]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], and has changed little in the last 700 years or so. Furthermore, the Tuscan dialect is the most conservative of all [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]], radically different from the [[Gallo-Italian languages]] less than 100 miles to the north (across the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]).\n\nThe following are some of the conservative phonological features of Italian, as compared with the common [[Western Romance]] languages (French, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). Some of these features are also present in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n* Little or no [[lenition]] of consonants between vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|v\u012bta}} > ''vita'' \"life\" (cf. Romanian ''via\u021b\u0103'', Spanish ''vida'' {{IPA|[bi\u00f0a]}}, French ''vie''), {{smallcaps|pedem}} > ''piede'' \"foot\" (cf. Spanish ''pie'', French ''pied'' {{IPA|/pje/}}).\n* Preservation of geminate consonants, e.g. {{smallcaps|annum}} > {{IPA|/\u02c8an.no/}} ''anno'' \"year\" (cf. Spanish ''a\u00f1o'' {{IPA|/a\u0272o/}}, French ''an'' {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}}, Portuguese ''ano'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u00e3.nu/}}).\n* Preservation of all [[Proto-Romance]] final vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|pacem}} > ''pace'' \"peace\" (cf. Romanian ''pace'', Spanish ''paz'', French ''paix'' {{IPA|/p\u025b/}}), {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Romanian ''opt'', Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit'' {{IPA|/\u0265i(t)/}}), {{smallcaps|f\u0113c\u012b}} > ''feci'' \"I did\" (cf. Spanish ''hice'', French ''fis'' {{IPA|/fi/}}).\n* Preservation of most intertonic vowels (those between the stressed syllable and either the beginning or ending syllable). This accounts for some of the most noticeable differences, as in the forms ''quattordici'' and ''settimana'' given above.\n* Slower consonant development, e.g. {{smallcaps|folia}} > Italo-Western {{IPA|/f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} > ''foglia'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} \"leaf\" (cf. Romanian ''foaie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u032faje/}}, Spanish ''hoja'' {{IPA|/\u02c8oxa/}}, French ''feuille'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0153j/}}; but note Portuguese ''folha'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u028e\u0250/}}).\n\nCompared with most other Romance languages, Italian has many inconsistent outcomes, where the same underlying sound produces different results in different words, e.g. {{smallcaps|lax\u0101re}} > ''lasciare'' and ''lassare'', {{smallcaps|capti\u0101re}} > ''cacciare'' and ''cazzare'', {{smallcaps|(ex)d\u0113roteol\u0101re}} > ''sdrucciolare'', ''druzzolare'' and ''ruzzolare'', {{smallcaps|r\u0113g\u012bna}} > ''regina'' and ''reina''. Although in all these examples the second form has fallen out of usage, the dimorphism is thought to reflect the several-hundred-year period during which Italian developed as a literary language divorced from any native-speaking population, with an origin in 12th/13th-century Tuscan but with many words borrowed from [[Languages of Italy|languages]] farther to the north, with different sound outcomes. (The [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]], the most important [[isogloss]] in the entire Romance-language area, passes only about 20 miles to the north of Florence.) Dual outcomes of Latin /p t k/ between vowels, such as {{smallcaps|l\u014fcum}} > '' luogo'' but {{smallcaps|f\u014fcum}} > '' fuoco'', was once thought to be due to borrowing of northern voiced forms, but is now generally viewed as the result of early phonetic variation within Tuscany.\n\nSome other features that distinguish Italian from the Western Romance languages:\n* Latin {{smallcaps|ce-,ci-}} becomes {{IPA|/t\u0283e, t\u0283i/}} rather than {{IPA|/(t)se, (t)si/}}.\n* Latin {{smallcaps|-ct-}} becomes {{IPA|/tt/}} rather than {{IPA|/jt/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}: {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit,'' Portuguese ''oito'').\n* Vulgar Latin {{smallcaps|-cl-}} becomes ''cchi'' {{IPA|/kkj/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u028e/}}: {{smallcaps|oclum}} > ''occhio'' \"eye\" (cf. Portuguese ''olho'' {{IPA|/o\u028eu/}}, French ''oeil'' {{IPA|/\u0153j/}} < {{IPA|/\u0153\u028e/}}); but Romanian ''ochi'' {{IPA|/ok\u02b2/}}.\n* Final {{IPA|/s/}} is not preserved, and vowel changes rather than {{IPA|/s/}} are used to mark the plural: ''amico, amici'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amica, amiche'' \"female friend(s)\" (cf. Romanian ''amic, amici'',''amic\u0103, amice'', Spanish ''amigo(s)'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amiga(s)'' \"female friend(s)\"); {{smallcaps|tr\u0113s, sex}} \u2192 ''tre, sei'' \"three, six\" (cf. Romanian ''trei, \u0219ase'', Spanish ''tres, seis'').\n\nStandard Italian also differs in some respects from most nearby Italian languages:\n* Perhaps most noticeable is the total lack of [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]], though metaphony is a feature characterizing nearly every other [[Languages of Italy|Italian language]].\n* No simplification of original {{IPA|/nd/}}, {{IPA|/mb/}} (which often became {{IPA|/nn/, /mm/}} elsewhere).\n\n=== Assimilation ===\nItalian [[phonotactics]] do not usually permit verbs and polysyllabic nouns to end with consonants, excepting poetry and song, so foreign words may receive [[Epenthetic vowel#Epenthesis of a vowel, or anaptyxis|extra terminal vowel sounds]].<!--(Maybe this should go under history?)--->\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Italian alphabet}}\nThe Italian alphabet is typically considered to consist of 21 letters. The letters j, k, w, x, y are traditionally excluded, though they appear in loanwords such as ''jeans'', ''whisky'', ''taxi'', ''xenofobo'', ''xilofono''. The letter {{angle bracket|x}} has become common in standard Italian with the prefix ''extra-'', although ''(e)stra-'' is traditionally used; it is also common to use the Latin particle ''ex(-)'' to mean \"former(ly)\" as in: ''la mia ex'' (\"my ex-girlfriend\"), \"Ex-Jugoslavia\" (\"Former Yugoslavia\"). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} appears in the first name ''Jacopo'' and in some Italian place-names, such as [[Bajardo]], [[Bojano]], [[Joppolo]], [[Jerzu]], [[Jesolo]], [[Jesi]], [[Ajaccio]], among others, and in ''Mar Jonio'', an alternative spelling of ''Mar Ionio'' (the [[Ionian Sea]]). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} may appear in dialectal words, but its use is discouraged in contemporary standard Italian.<ref name=\"Clivio\">{{cite book|title=The Sounds, Forms, and Uses of Italian: An Introduction to Italian Linguistics|first=Gianrenzo|last=Clivio|first2=Marcel|last2=Danesi|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000|pages=21, 66}}</ref> Letters used in foreign words can be replaced with [[phonetics|phonetically]] equivalent native Italian letters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: {{angle bracket|gi}}, {{angle bracket|ge}}, or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|j}}; {{angle bracket|c}} or {{angle bracket|ch}} for {{angle bracket|k}} (including in the standard prefix ''kilo-''); {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}} or {{angle bracket|v}} for {{angle bracket|w}}; {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|ss}}, {{angle bracket|z}}, {{angle bracket|zz}} or {{angle bracket|cs}} for {{angle bracket|x}}; and {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|y}}.\n* The [[acute accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|front close-mid vowel]], as in ''perch\u00e9'' \"why, because\". In dictionaries, it is also used over {{angle bracket|o}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid back rounded vowel|back close-mid vowel]] (''azi\u00f3ne''). The [[grave accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|front open-mid vowel]], as in ''t\u00e8'' \"tea\". The grave accent is used over any vowel to indicate word-final stress, as in ''giovent\u00f9'' \"youth\". Unlike {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}, which is a ''close''-mid vowel, a stressed final {{angle bracket|o}} is always a [[Open-mid back rounded vowel|back open-mid vowel]] (''andr\u00f2''), making {{angle bracket|\u00f3}} unnecessary outside of dictionaries. Most of the time, the penultimate syllable is stressed. But if the stressed vowel is the final letter of the word, the accent is mandatory, otherwise it is virtually always omitted. Exceptions are typically either in dictionaries, where all or most stressed vowels are commonly marked. Accents can optionally be used to disambiguate words that differ only by stress, as for ''pr\u00ecncipi'' \"princes\" and ''princ\u00ecpi'' \"principles\", or ''\u00e0ncora'' \"anchor\" and ''anc\u00f3ra'' \"still''/''yet\". For monosyllabic words, the rule is different: when two orthographically identical monosyllabic words with different meanings exist, one is accented and the other is not (example: ''\u00e8'' \"is\", ''e'' \"and\").\n* The letter {{angle bracket|h}} distinguishes ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'' (present indicative of ''avere'' \"to have\") from ''o'' (\"or\"), ''ai'' (\"to the\"), ''a'' (\"to\"), ''anno'' (\"year\"). In the spoken language, the letter is always silent. The {{angle bracket|h}} in ''ho'' additionally marks the contrasting open pronunciation of the {{angle bracket|o}}. The letter {{angle bracket|h}} is also used in combinations with other letters. No [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/h/}} exists in Italian. In nativized foreign words, the {{angle bracket|h}} is silent. For example, ''hotel'' and ''hovercraft'' are pronounced {{IPA|/o\u02c8t\u025bl/}} and {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254verkraft/}} respectively. (Where {{angle bracket|h}} existed in Latin, it either disappeared or, in a few cases before a back vowel, changed to {{IPA|[\u0261]}}: ''traggo'' \"I pull\" \u2190 Lat. {{smallcaps|trah\u014d}}.)\n* The letters {{angle bracket|s}} and {{angle bracket|z}} can symbolize [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants. {{angle bracket|z}} symbolizes {{IPA|/dz/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on context, with few minimal pairs. For example: ''zanzara'' {{IPA|/dzan\u02c8dza\u02d0ra/}} \"mosquito\" and ''nazione'' {{IPA|/nat\u02c8tsjo\u02d0ne/}} \"nation\". {{angle bracket|s}} symbolizes {{IPA|/s/}} word-initially before a vowel, when clustered with a voiceless consonant ({{angle bracket|p, f, c, ch}}), and when doubled; it symbolizes {{IPA|/z/}} when between vowels and when clustered with voiced consonants. Intervocalic {{angle bracket|s}} varies regionally between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, with {{IPA|/z/}} being more dominant in northern Italy and {{IPA|/s/}} in the south.\n* The letters {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} vary in pronunciation between [[plosives]] and [[affricates]] depending on following vowels. The letter {{angle bracket|c}} symbolizes {{IPA|/k/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|t\u0283}} as in ''chair'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. The letter {{angle bracket|g}} symbolizes {{IPA|/\u0261/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|d\u0292}} as in ''gem'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Other Romance languages and, to an extent, English have similar variations for {{angle bracket|c, g}}. Compare [[hard and soft C]], [[hard and soft G]]. (See also [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].)\n* The [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|gh}} indicate ({{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) before {{angle bracket|i, e}}. The digraphs {{angle bracket|ci}} and {{angle bracket|gi}} indicate softness ({{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}) before {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. For example:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before back vowel (A, O, U)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before front vowel (I, E)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Plosive\n!

For example, it is silent in ''[[ciao]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283a\u02d0.o/}} and cielo {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u025b\u02d0.lo/}}, but it is pronounced in ''farmacia'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.a/}} and ''farmacie'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.e/}}.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n<!--\n* There are three other special [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] in Italian: [[gn (digraph)|{{angle bracket|gn}}]], {{angle bracket|gl}} and {{angle bracket|sc}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|gn}} represents {{IPAslink|\u0272}}. {{angle bracket|gl}} represents {{IPAslink|\u028e}} before {{angle bracket|i}}, and never at the beginning of a word, except in the [[personal pronoun]] and [[definite article]] ''gli''. An exception is the word ''glicerina'' (\"glycerin\"), which is pronounced with a hard {{angle bracket|g}}. (Compare with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} and {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{angle bracket|nh}} and {{angle bracket|lh}}.) {{angle bracket|sc}} represents a fricative {{IPAslink|\u0283}} before {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Except in the speech of some Northern Italians, all of these are normally [[geminate]] between vowels.\n* In general, there is a clear one-to-one correspondence between letters or digraphs and phonemes, as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; in standard varieties of Italian, there is little allophonic variation. The most notable exceptions are assimilation of /n/ in point of articulation before consonants, assimilatory voicing of /s/ to following voiced consonants, and vowel length (vowels are long in stressed open syllables, except at the end of words, and short elsewhere) \u2014 compare with the substantial number of [[allophone]]s of the English phoneme /t/. Spelling is mostly phonemic and usually difficult to mistake, given a clear pronunciation. Exceptions exist, especially in foreign borrowings. There are fewer cases of [[dyslexia]] than among speakers of languages such as English,<ref>E. Paulescu et al., Dyslexia \u2013 cultural diversity and biological unity, \"Science\", vol. 291, pp. 2165\u20132167.</ref> and the concept of a [[spelling bee]] is strange to Italians.\n\n=== Common variations ===\nSome variations in the usage of the writing system may be present in practical use. These are scorned by educated people and normal written language, but they are so common in certain limited contexts that knowledge of them may be useful.\n* Usage of ''x'' instead of ''per'' \"for\". This is common among teenagers and in [[Text messaging|SMS]] abbreviations. The multiplication operator is read \"per\" in Italian. For example, ''per te'' (\"for you\") is shortened to ''x te'' (compare with English ''4 u''). The ''per'' within words can also be replaced with ''x''. For example: ''perch\u00e9'' (\"why, because\") to ''xch\u00e9'' or ''xk\u00e9''; ''sapere'' (\"to know\") to ''saxe''). This usage is useful shorthand in quick notes or in SMS, but it is unacceptable in formal writing.\n* Usage of foreign letters such as {{angle bracket|k}}, {{angle bracket|j}} and {{angle bracket|y}}, especially in nicknames and SMS language: ''ke'' instead of ''che'', ''Giusy'' instead of ''Giuseppina''. This is mirrored in the usage of ''i'' in English names such as ''Staci'' instead of ''Stacey'' or in the usage of ''c'' in [[Northern Europe]] (''Jacob'' instead of ''Jakob''). The use of {{angle bracket|k}} instead of {{angle bracket|ch}} or {{angle bracket|c}} to represent a plosive sound is documented in some historical texts from before the standardization of the Italian language. The usage is no longer standard in Italian. The letter {{angle bracket|k}} has sometimes been used in satire to suggest a political figure is an authoritarian or even a \"pseudo-nazi\". For example, [[Francesco Cossiga]] was famously nicknamed ''Kossiga'' by rioting students during his tenure as minister of internal affairs. Compare the [[satiric misspelling#\"K\" replacing \"C\"|politicized spelling ''Amerika'']] in the USA. Although not a letter in the standard Italian alphabet, the letter {{angle bracket|j}} is found in many of the languages of southern Italy, including [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. In modern texts written in any such language, the {{angle bracket|j}} is often replaced with {{angle bracket|i}}.\n* The following abbreviations are limited to electronic-communications media: ''nn'' for ''non'' \"not\"; ''cmq'' for ''comunque'' \"anyway, however\"; ''cm'' for ''come'' \"how, like, as\"; ''d'' for ''di'' \"of\"; ''(io/loro) sn'' for ''(io/loro) sono'' \"I am, they are\"; ''(io) dv'' for ''(io) devo'' \"I must, I have to\" or for ''dove'' \"where\"; ''(tu) 6'' for ''(tu) sei'' \"you are\"; ''dmn'' for ''domani'' \"tomorrow\".\n* Whenever non-[[ASCII]] characters are unavailable or unreliable (as in e-mail), accents may be replaced with adjacent apostrophes. For example: in ''perche<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' instead of ''perch\u00e9''. The practice was standard on manual typewriters that had no accents and is still common for uppercase accented letters. Uppercase {{angle bracket|[[\u00c8]]}} is rare and is absent from the [[Keyboard layout#Italian|Italian keyboard layout]]. It is often substituted with {{angle bracket|E<nowiki>'</nowiki>}}, even though there are [[:it:Aiuto:Manuale di stile#Scrivere \u00c8|several ways]] of producing the uppercase \u00c8 on a computer.\n\n== Sounds ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n{{IPA notice|lang=it}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nItalian has seven [[vowel]] phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, represented by five letters: \"a, e, i, o, u\". The pairs {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/\u025b/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/\u0254/}} are seldom distinguished in writing and often confused, even though most varieties of Italian employ both phonemes consistently. Compare, for example standard \"perch\u00e9\" {{IPA|[per\u02c8ke]}} (why, because) and \"senti\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u025bnti]}} (you hear), as pronounced by most central and southern speakers, with {{IPA|[per\u02c8k\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8senti]}}, employed by most northern speakers. As a result, the usage is strongly indicative of a person's origin. The standard (Tuscan) usage of these vowels is listed in vocabularies, and employed outside Tuscany mainly by specialists, especially actors and a few (television) journalists.\nThese are truly different [[phonemes]], however: compare {{IPA|/\u02c8peska/}} (fishing) and {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u025bska/}} (peach), both spelled ''pesca'' ({{Audio|It-pesca.ogg|listen}}). Similarly {{IPA|/\u02c8botte/}} ('barrel') and {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254tte/}} ('beatings'), both spelled ''botte'', discriminate {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} ({{Audio|It-botte-mp.ogg|listen}}).\n\nIn general, vowel combinations usually pronounce each vowel separately. [[Diphthong]]s exist (e.g. ''uo'', ''iu'', ''ie'', ''ai''), but are limited to an unstressed ''u'' or ''i'' before or after a stressed vowel.\n\nThe unstressed ''u'' in a diphthong approximates the English semivowel ''w'', and the unstressed ''i'' approximates the semivowel ''y''. E.g.: ''buono'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bw\u0254\u02d0no]}}, ''ieri'' {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025b\u02d0ri]}}.\n\n[[Triphthong]]s exist in Italian as well, like \"contin''uia''mo\" (\"we continue\"). Three vowel combinations exist only in the form semiconsonant ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}), followed by a vowel, followed by a [[:wikt:desinence|desinence]] vowel (usually {{IPA|/i/}}), as in ''miei'', ''suoi'', or two semiconsonants followed by a vowel, as the group ''-uia-'' exemplified above, or ''-iuo-'' in the word ''aiuola''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Serianni | first=Luca | author2=Castelvecchi, Alberto |title=Italiano | publisher=Garzanti | year=1997 | page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile diphthongs ===\nMany Latin words with a short ''e'' or ''o'' have Italian counterparts with a so-called mobile diphthong (''ie'' and ''uo'' respectively). The mobility, however, is of stress: when the vowel sound is stressed, it is pronounced and written as a diphthong, e.g. ''buono'' 'good'; when not stressed, it is pronounced and written as a single vowel, as in ''bont\u00e0'' 'goodness'.\n\nSo Latin ''focus'' gave rise to Italian ''fuoco'' (meaning both \"fire\" and \"optical focus\"): when unstressed, as in ''focale'' (\"focal\") the \"o\" remains alone. Latin ''pes'' (more precisely its accusative form ''pedem'') is the source of Italian ''piede'' (foot): but unstressed \"e\" was left unchanged in ''pedone'' (pedestrian) and ''pedale'' (pedal). From Latin ''jocus'' comes Italian ''giuoco'' (\"play\", \"game\"), though in this case ''gioco'' is more common: ''giocare'' means \"to play (a game)\". From Latin ''homo'' comes Italian ''uomo'' (man), but also ''umano'' (human) and ''ominide'' (hominid). From Latin ''ovum'' comes Italian ''uovo'' (egg) and ''ovaie'' (ovaries). (The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''juego'' (play, game) and ''jugar'' (to play), ''nieve'' (snow) and ''nevar'' (to snow)). Stress-conditioned historical diphthongization can also produce alternating verb stems, as in stem-stressed ''siedo'' 'I sit' and suffix-stressed ''sediamo'' 'we sit'.\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{{See also|Syntactic doubling}}\n\nTwo symbols in a table cell denote the voiceless and voiced consonant, respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Consonants of Italian<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rogers & d'Arcangeli|2004|p=117}}</ref>\n!\n!

More generally, nasals assimilate to the point of articulation of whatever consonant they precede. -->\n\nItalian has geminate, or double, consonants, which are distinguished by [[Consonant length|length]] and intensity. Length is distinctive for all consonants except for {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/\u028e/}}, {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, which are always geminate when between vowels, and {{IPA|/z/}}, which is always single.\nGeminate plosives and affricates are realized as lengthened closures. Geminate fricatives, nasals, and {{IPA|/l/}} are realized as lengthened [[continuant]]s. There is only one vibrant phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} but the actual pronunciation depends on context and regional accent. Generally one can find a flap consonant {{IPA|[\u027e]}} in unstressed position whereas {{IPA|[r]}} is more common in stressed syllables, but there may be exceptions. Especially people from the Northern part of Italy ([[Parma]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[South Tyrol]]) may pronounce {{IPA|/r/}} as {{IPA|[\u0280]}}, {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, or {{IPA|[\u028b]}}.<ref>{{cite book |last= Canepari |first= Luciano |title= Il M\u00aaPI \u2013 Manuale di pronuncia italiana |edition= second |date=January 1999 |publisher= Zanichelli |location= Bologna |isbn= 978-88-08-24624-0}}</ref>\n\nOf special interest to the linguistic study of [[Regional Italian]] is the ''[[Tuscan gorgia|gorgia toscana]]'', or \"Tuscan Throat\", the weakening or [[lenition]] of [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} in the [[Tuscan language]].\n\nThe [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0292/}} is present as a phoneme only in loanwords: for example, ''garage'' {{IPA|[\u0261a\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0292]}}. Phonetic {{IPA|[\u0292]}} is common in Central and Southern Italy as an intervocalic allophone of {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}: ''gente'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'people' but ''la gente'' {{IPA|[la\u02c8\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'the people', ''ragione'' {{IPA|[ra\u02c8\u0292o\u02d0ne]}} 'reason'.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Italian grammar}}\n{{See also|Italian verbs}}\n\nItalian grammar is typical of the grammar of [[Romance languages]] in general. [[Grammatical case|Cases]] exist for personal pronouns ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Dative case|dative]]), but not for nouns.\n\nThere are two basic classes of nouns in Italian, referred to as [[Grammatical gender|genders]], masculine and feminine. Gender may be [[natural gender|natural]] (''ragazzo'' 'boy', ''ragazza'' 'girl') or simply grammatical with no possible reference to biological gender (masculine ''costo'' 'cost', feminine ''costa'' 'coast'). Masculine nouns typically end in ''-o'' (''ragazzo'' 'boy'), with plural marked by ''-i'' (''ragazzi'' 'boys'), and feminine nouns typically end in ''-a'', with plural marked by ''-e'' (''ragazza'' 'girl', ''ragazze'' 'girls'). For a group composed of boys and girls, ''ragazzi'' is the plural, suggesting that ''-i'' is a general plural. A third category of nouns is [[Marker (linguistics)|unmarked]] for gender, ending in ''-e'' in the singular and ''-i'' in the plural: ''legge'' 'law, f. sg.', ''leggi'' 'laws, f. pl.'; ''fiume'' 'river, m. sg.', ''fiumi'' 'rivers, m. pl.', thus assignment of gender is arbitrary in terms of form, enough so that terms may be identical but of distinct genders: ''fine'' meaning 'aim', 'purpose' is masculine, while ''fine'' meaning 'end, ending' (e.g. of a movie) is feminine, and both are ''fini'' in the plural, a clear instance of ''-i'' as a non-gendered default plural marker. These nouns often, but not always, denote [[Animacy|inanimates]]. There are a number of nouns that have a masculine singular and a feminine plural, most commonly of the pattern m. sg. ''-o'', f. pl. ''-a'' (''miglio'' 'mile, m. sg.', ''miglia'' 'miles, f. pl.'; ''paio'' 'pair, m. sg., ''paia'' 'pairs, f. pl.'), and thus are sometimes considered neuter (these are usually derived from [[Grammatical gender|neuter]] Latin nouns). An instance of neuter gender also exists in pronouns of the third person singular.{{sfn|Simone|2010}}\n\nExamples:<ref name=\":6\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"Accademia della Crusca\"\n! href=\"Floris Italicae lingue libri novem\" |Definition\n!Gender\n! href=\"Napoleon\" |Singular Form\n! href=\"lingua franca\" |Plural Form\n|- href=\"bourgeoisie\"\n|Son\n| href=\"The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)\" |Masculine\n|Figlio\n|Figli\n|- href=\"Alessandro Manzoni\"\n| href=\"Arno River\" |House\n| href=\"Florence\" |Feminine\n|Casa\n| href=\"ciao\" |Case\n|- href=\"Venetian language\"\n|Love\n| href=\"panettone\" |Masculine\n| href=\"Lombard language\" |Amore\n|Amori\n|- href=\"Romance language\"\n| href=\"Vulgar Latin\" |Art\n| href=\"Tuscan language\" |Feminine\n| href=\"Florentine dialect\" |Arte\n| href=\"Italo-Dalmatian languages\" |Arti\n|}\nNouns, adjectives, and articles [[Inflection|inflect]] for gender and number (singular and plural).\n\nLike in English, common nouns are capitalized when occurring at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike English, nouns referring to languages (e.g. Italian), speakers of languages, or inhabitants of an area (e.g. Italians) are not capitalized.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three types of [[adjective]]s: descriptive, invariable and form-changing. Descriptive adjectives are the most common, and their endings change to match the number and gender of the noun they modify. Invariable adjectives are adjectives whose endings do not change. The form changing adjectives \"buono (good), bello (beautiful), grande (big), and santo (saint)\" change in form when placed before different types of nouns. Italian has three degrees for comparison of adjectives: positive, comparative, and superlative.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe order of words in the phrase is relatively free compared to most European languages.<ref name=\"Clivio\" /> The position of the verb in the phrase is highly mobile. Word order often has a lesser grammatical function in Italian than in [[English language|English]]. Adjectives are sometimes placed before their noun and sometimes after. Subject nouns generally come before the verb. Italian is a [[null-subject language]], so that nominative pronouns are usually absent, with subject indicated by verbal [[inflection]]s (e.g. ''amo'' 'I love', ''ama'' 's/he loves', ''amano'' 'they love'). Noun objects normally come after the verb, as do pronoun objects after imperative verbs, infinitives and gerunds, but otherwise pronoun objects come before the verb.\n\nThere are both indefinite and definite [[Article (grammar)|articles]] in Italian. There are four indefinite articles, selected by the gender of the noun they modify and by the phonological structure of the word that immediately follows the article. ''Uno'' is masculine singular, used before ''z'' ({{IPA|ts/}} or {{IPA|/dz/}}), ''s+consonant'', ''gn'' ({{IPA|/\u0272/}}), or ''ps'', while masculine singular ''un'' is used before a word beginning with any other sound. The noun ''zio'' 'uncle' selects masculine singular, thus ''uno zio'' 'an uncle' or ''uno zio anziano'' 'an old uncle,' but ''un mio zio'' 'an uncle of mine'. The feminine singular indefinite articles are ''una'', used before any consonant sound, and its abbreviated form, written ''un','' used before vowels: ''una camicia'' 'a shirt', ''una camicia bianca'' 'a white shirt', ''un'altra camicia'' 'a different shirt'. There are seven forms for definite articles, both singular and plural. In the singular: ''lo'', which corresponds to the uses of ''uno''; ''il'', which corresponds to the uses with consonant of ''un''; ''la,'' which corresponds to the uses of ''una''; ''l','' used for both masculine and feminine singular before vowels. In the plural: ''gli'' is the masculine plural of ''lo and l<nowiki>'</nowiki>''; ''i'' is the plural of ''il''; and ''le'' is the plural of feminine ''la'' and ''l''<nowiki/>'.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are numerous [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] of [[preposition]]s with subsequent [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. There are numerous productive [[suffix]]es for [[Italian diminutive|diminutive]], [[Augmentative#Italian|augmentative]], pejorative, attenuating etc., which are also used to create [[neologism]]s.\n\nThere are 27 pronouns, grouped in [[clitic]] and tonic pronouns. Personal pronouns are separated into three groups: subject, object (which take the place of both direct and indirect objects), and reflexive. Second person subject pronouns have both a polite and a familiar form. These two different types of address are very important in Italian social distinctions. All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed (clitics). Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb (''Lo vedo''. 'I see him.'). Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required, for contrast, or to avoid ambiguity (''Vedo lui, ma non lei''. 'I see him, but not her'). Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three regular sets of verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], and various verbs are irregularly conjugated. Within each of these sets of conjugations, there are four simple (one-word) verbal conjugations by person/number in the [[indicative mood]] ([[present tense]]; [[past tense]] with [[imperfective aspect]], past tense with [[perfective aspect]], and [[future tense]]), two simple conjugations in the [[subjunctive mood]] (present tense and past tense), one simple conjugation in the [[conditional mood]], and one simple conjugation in the [[imperative mood]]. Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of \"to be\" or \"to have\" followed by a [[past participle]]. \"To have\" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive (\"Ha detto\", \"ha fatto\": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while \"to be\" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs (\"\u00c8 andato\", \"\u00e8 stato\": he/she has gone, he/she has been). \"To be\" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive (\"\u00ca detto\", \"\u00e8 fatto\": it is said, it is made/done). This rule is not absolute, and some exceptions do exist.\n\n== Words ==\n===Conversation===\nNote: the plural form of verbs could also be used as an extremely formal (for example to [[Nobility|noble]] people in [[Monarchy|monarchies]]) singular form (see [[royal we]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

They are not in any sense \"dialects\" of standard Italian, which itself started off as one of these local tongues, but [[sister language]]s of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general.

Dante's epic poems, known collectively as the ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]],'' to which another Tuscan poet [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] later affixed the title ''Divina'', were read throughout the peninsula and his written dialect became the \"canonical standard\" that all educated [[Italians]] could understand. Dante is still credited with standardizing the Italian language. In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects.{{r|\":0\"|page=22}} Thus the dialect of [[Florence]] became the basis for what would become the official language of Italy.\n\nItalian was progressively made an official language of most of the Italian states predating unification, slowly replacing Latin, even when ruled by foreign powers (like Spain in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], or Austria in the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]), even though the masses kept speaking primarily their local vernaculars. Italian was also one of the many recognised languages in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\nItaly has always had a distinctive dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as [[city-state]]s. Those dialects now have considerable [[variety (linguistics)|variety]]. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between [[Rome|Roman]] Italian and [[Milan]]ese Italian are the [[consonant length|gemination]] of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed \"e\", and of \"s\" in some cases: e.g. ''va bene'' \"all right\" is pronounced {{IPA|[vab\u02c8b\u025b\u02d0ne]}} by a Roman (and by any standard Italian speaker), {{IPA|[va\u02c8be\u02d0ne]}} by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies to the north of the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]); ''a casa'' \"at home\" is {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} for Roman, {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} or {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for standard, {{IPA|[a\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for Milanese and generally northern.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n\nIn contrast to the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic linguistic panorama]] of [[northern Italy]], the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and its related dialects were largely unaffected by the Franco-[[Occitan language|Occitan]] influences introduced to Italy mainly by [[bard]]s from France during the [[Middle Ages]], but after the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]], Sicily became the first Italian land to adopt Occitan lyric moods (and words) in poetry. Even in the case of Northern Italian languages, however, scholars are careful not to overstate the effects of outsiders on the natural indigenous developments of the languages.\n\nThe economic might and relatively advanced development of Tuscany at the time ([[Late Middle Ages]]) gave its language weight, though [[Venetian language|Venetian]] remained widespread in medieval Italian commercial life, and [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian (or Genoese)]] remained in use in maritime trade alongside the Mediterranean. The increasing political and cultural relevance of [[Florence]] during the periods of the rise of the ''[[Medici bank|Banco Medici]]'', [[Humanism]], and the [[Renaissance]] made its dialect, or rather a refined version of it, a standard in the arts.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe [[Renaissance]] era, known as {{lang|it|il Rinascimento}} in Italian, was seen as a time of \"rebirth\", which is the literal meaning of both {{lang|fr|renaissance}} (from French) and {{lang|it|rinascimento}} (Italian).\n\n[[File:Pietro Bembo2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.63|[[Pietro Bembo]] was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language from the Tuscan dialect, as a literary medium, codifying the language for standard modern usage.]]\n\nDuring this time, long-existing beliefs stemming from the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] began to be understood from new perspectives as [[humanists]]\u2014individuals who placed emphasis on the human body and its full potential\u2014began to shift focus from the church to human beings themselves.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A history of Western society|last=P.|first=McKay, John|date=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Hill, Bennett D., Buckler, John.|isbn=978-0-618-52273-6|edition=8th|location=Boston|oclc=58837884}}</ref> Humanists began forming new beliefs in various forms: social, political, and intellectual. The ideals of the Renaissance were evident throughout the [[Protestant Reformation]], which took place simultaneously with the Renaissance. The Protestant Reformation began with [[Martin Luther]]'s rejection of the selling of indulgences by [[Johann Tetzel]] and other authorities within the Roman Catholic Church, resulting in Luther's eventual break-off from the Roman Catholic Church in the [[Diet of Worms]]. After Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, he founded what was then understood to be a sect of [[Catholicism]], later referred to as [[Lutheranism]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Luther's preaching in favor of faith and scripture rather than tradition led him to translate the [[Bible]] into many other languages, which would allow for people from all over Europe to read the Bible. Previously, the Bible was only translated into [[Latin]], but after this development it could be understood in many other languages, including Italian. The Italian language was able to spread even more with the help of Luther and the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]. The printing press facilitated the spread of Italian because it was able to rapidly produce texts, such as the Bible, and cut the costs of books which allowed for more people to have access to the translated Bible and new pieces of literature.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=Steven|last2=Harris|first2=Beth|title=An Introduction to the Protestant Reformation|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/renaissance-and-reformation/protestant-reformation/a/an-introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation|website=khanacademy|publisher=khanacademy|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman Catholic Church was losing its control over the population, as it was not open to change, and there was an increasing number of reformers with differing beliefs.<ref name=\":0x\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Renaissance|title=Renaissance|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc|last1=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nItalian became the language used in the courts of every state in the [[Italian peninsula]], as well as the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variety]] in the island of [[Corsica]] (but not in [[Sardinia]], which on the contrary [[Sardinian language#Savoyard period \u2013 Italian influence|underwent Italianization]] well into the late 18th century because of the prestige enjoyed by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the widespread use of Sardinian<ref>Cardia, Amos.

This discussion, known as {{lang|it|questione della lingua}} (i. e., the ''problem of the language''), ran through the Italian culture until the end of the 19th century, often linked to the political debate on achieving a united Italian state. Renaissance scholars divided into three main factions:\n* The [[purism (language)|purists]], headed by Venetian [[Pietro Bembo]] (who, in his ''[[Gli Asolani]]'', claimed the language might be based only on the great literary classics, such as [[Petrarch]] and some part of Boccaccio). The purists thought the Divine Comedy was not dignified enough because it used elements from non-lyric registers of the language.\n* [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] and other [[Florence|Florentines]] preferred the version spoken by ordinary people in their own times.\n* The [[courtier]]s, like [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], insisted that each local vernacular contribute to the new standard.\n\nA fourth faction claimed that the best Italian was the one that the papal court adopted, which was a mixture of the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] and [[Roman dialect|Roman]] dialects. \nEventually, Bembo's ideas prevailed, and the foundation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Florence (1582\u20131583), the official legislative body of the Italian language led to publication of [[Agnolo Monosini]]'s Latin tome {{lang|la|[[Floris Italicae lingue libri novem|Floris italicae linguae libri novem]]|italic=yes}} in 1604 followed by the first Italian dictionary in 1612.\n\nThe continual advancements in technology plays a crucial role in the diffusion of languages. After the invention of the [[printing press]] in the fifteenth century, the number of printing presses in Italy grew rapidly and by the year 1500 reached a total of 56, the biggest number of printing presses in all of Europe. This allowed to produce more pieces of literature at a lower cost and as the dominant language, Italian spread.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Information Technology and Economic Change: The Impact of the Printing Press|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=126|issue=3|pages=1133\u20131172|last1=Dittmar|first1=Jeremiah|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr035|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8ab843701523883bb51bb7752f2891fdfc841d18}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern era ===\nAn important event that helped the diffusion of Italian was the conquest and occupation of Italy by [[Napoleon]] in the early 19th century (who was himself of Italian-Corsican descent).

Examples are [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]], where [[Talian dialect|Talian]] is used, and the town of [[Chipilo]] near Puebla, [[Mexico]]; each continues to use a derived form of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] dating back to the nineteenth century. Another example is [[Cocoliche]], an Italian\u2013Spanish [[pidgin]] once spoken in [[Argentina]] and especially in [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Lunfardo]].\n\n=== Lingua franca ===\n{{See also|Mediterranean Lingua Franca}}\n\nStarting in late [[medieval]] times in much of Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin was replaced as the primary commercial language by Italian language variants (especially Tuscan and Venetian). These variants were consolidated during the [[Renaissance]] with the strength of Italy and the rise of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] and [[the arts]].\n\nDuring that period, Italy held artistic sway over the rest of Europe. It was the norm for all educated gentlemen to make the [[Grand Tour]], visiting Italy to see its great historical monuments and works of art. It thus became expected to learn at least some Italian. In England, while the classical languages [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] were the first to be learned, Italian became the second most common modern language after French, a position it held until the late eighteenth century when it tended to be replaced by German. [[John Milton]], for instance, wrote some of his early poetry in Italian.\n\nWithin the [[Catholic church]], Italian is known by a large part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and is used in substitution for Latin in some official documents.\n\nItalian [[loanword]]s continue to be used in most languages in matters of art and [[music]] (especially [[classical music]] including [[opera]]), in the [[design]] and [[fashion]] industries, in some sports like [[football (association)|football]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilsonline.it/italy/italianlanguage.html|title=Italian Language|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ilsonline.it|access-date=7 October 2016}}</ref> and especially, in culinary terms.\n\n== Languages and dialects ==\n{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}\n[[File:Dialetti Italia 1939.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Linguistic map of Italy according to Clemente Merlo and Carlo Tagliavini (1937)]]\n[[File:Minoranze linguistiche it.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Italy's ethno-linguistic minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|title=Lingue di Minoranza e Scuola: Carta Generale|website=Minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010152621/http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\nIn Italy, almost all the [[Languages of Italy|other languages spoken as the vernacular]] \u2014 other than standard Italian and some languages spoken among immigrant communities \u2014 are often imprecisely called \"[[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]\",<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/facts-figures-italian-language/ | title=Major Dialects of Italian|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=22 October 2015 }}</ref> even though they are quite different, with some belonging to different linguistic branches. The only exceptions to this are twelve groups considered \"[[Languages of Italy#Recognition by the Italian state|historical language minorities]]\", which are officially recognized as distinct [[minority language]]s by the law. On the other hand, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (a language spoken on the [[France|French]] island of [[Corsica]]) is closely related to medieval [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], from which Standard Italian derives and evolved.\n\nThe differences in the evolution of Latin in the different regions of Italy can be attributed to the presence of three other types of languages: [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrata, superstrata, and adstrata]]. The most prevalent were substrata (the language of the original inhabitants), as the Italian dialects were most likely simply Latin as spoken by native cultural groups. Superstrata and adstrata were both less important. Foreign conquerors of Italy that dominated different regions at different times left behind little to no influence on the dialects. Foreign cultures with which Italy engaged in peaceful relations with, such as trade, had no significant influence either.{{r|\":0\"|page=19-20}}\n\nThroughout Italy, regional variations of Standard Italian, called [[Regional Italian]], are spoken. Regional differences can be recognized by various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local language (for example, in informal situations ''{{wiktit|and\u00e0}}'', ''{{wiktit|ann\u00e0}}'' and ''{{wiktit|nare}}'' replace the standard Italian ''{{wiktit|andare}}'' in the area of Tuscany, Rome and Venice respectively for the infinitive \"to go\").\n\nThere is no definitive date when the various Italian variants of Latin\u2014including varieties that contributed to modern Standard Italian\u2014began to be distinct enough from Latin to be considered separate languages. One criterion for determining that two language variants are to be considered separate languages rather than variants of a single language is that they have evolved so that they are no longer [[mutually intelligible]]; this diagnostic is effective if mutual intelligibility is minimal or absent (e.g. in Romance, Romanian and Portuguese), but it fails in cases such as Spanish-Portuguese or Spanish-Italian, as native speakers of either pairing can understand each other well if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, on the basis of accumulated differences in morphology, syntax, phonology, and to some extent lexicon, it is not difficult to identify that for the Romance varieties of Italy, the first extant written evidence of languages that can no longer be considered Latin comes from the ninth and tenth centuries C.E. These written sources demonstrate certain vernacular characteristics and sometimes explicitly mention the use of the vernacular in Italy. Full literary manifestations of the vernacular began to surface around the 13th century in the form of various religious texts and poetry.{{r|\":0\"|page=21}}Although these are the first written records of Italian varieties separate from Latin, the spoken language had likely diverged long before the first written records appear, since those who were literate generally wrote in Latin even if they spoke other Romance varieties in person.\n\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of Standard Italian became increasingly widespread and was mirrored by a decline in the use of the dialects. An increase in literacy was one of the main driving factors (one can assume that only literates were capable of learning Standard Italian, whereas those who were illiterate had access only to their native dialect). The percentage of literates rose from 25% in 1861 to 60% in 1911, and then on to 78.1% in 1951. [[Tullio De Mauro]], an Italian linguist, has asserted that in 1861 only 2.5% of the population of Italy could speak Standard Italian. He reports that in 1951 that percentage had risen to 87%. The ability to speak Italian did not necessarily mean it was in everyday use, and most people (63.5%) still usually spoke their native dialects. In addition, other factors such as mass emigration, industrialization, and urbanization, and internal migrations after [[World War II]] contributed to the proliferation of Standard Italian. The Italians who emigrated during the [[Italian diaspora]] beginning in 1861 were often of the uneducated lower class, and thus the emigration had the effect of increasing the percentage of literates, who often knew and understood the importance of Standard Italian, back home in Italy. A large percentage of those who had emigrated also eventually returned to Italy, often more educated than when they had left.{{r|\":0\"|page=35}}\n\nThe Italian dialects have declined in the modern era, as Italy unified under Standard Italian and continues to do so aided by mass media, from newspapers to radio to television.{{r|\":0\"|page=37}}\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n[[File:It-Vangeli.ogg|thumb|[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Luke#Chapter 2|Luke 2]], 1\u20137 of the Bible being read by a speaker of Italian from [[Milan]]]]\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{transcluded section|source=Italian phonology|part=yes}}\n{{trim|{{#section-h:Italian phonology|Consonants}}}}\nItalian has a seven-vowel system, consisting of {{IPA|/a, \u025b, e, i, \u0254, o, u/}}, as well as 23 consonants. Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian phonology is conservative, preserving many words nearly unchanged from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Some examples:\n* Italian ''{{wiktita|quattordici}}'' \"fourteen\" < Latin {{smallcaps|{{wiktlat|quattuordecim}}}} (cf. Romanian ''{{wiktron|paisprezece}}/{{wiktron|pai\u0219pe}}'', Spanish ''{{wiktspa|catorce}}'', French ''{{wiktfra|quatorze}}'' {{IPA|/ka\u02c8t\u0254\u0281z/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[wikt:catorze|catorze]]|italic=yes}})\n* Italian ''settimana'' \"week\" < Latin {{smallcaps|septim\u0101na}} (cf. Romanian ''s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2n\u0103'', Spanish and Portuguese ''semana'', French ''semaine'' {{IPA|/s(\u0259)\u02c8m\u025bn/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''setmana'')\n* Italian ''medesimo'' \"same\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|medi(p)simum}} (cf. Spanish ''mismo'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mesmo'', French ''m\u00eame'' {{IPA|/m\u025bm/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''mateix''; note that Italian usually uses the shorter ''stesso'')\n* Italian ''guadagnare'' \"to win, earn, gain\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|guadany\u0101re}} < [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] {{IPA|/waidanjan/}} (cf. Spanish ''ganar'', Portuguese ''ganhar'', French ''gagner'' {{IPA|/\u0261a\u02c8\u0272e/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''guanyar'')\n\nThe conservativeness of Italian phonology is partly explained by its origin. Italian stems from a literary language that is derived from the 13th-century speech of the city of [[Florence]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], and has changed little in the last 700 years or so. Furthermore, the Tuscan dialect is the most conservative of all [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]], radically different from the [[Gallo-Italian languages]] less than 100 miles to the north (across the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]).\n\nThe following are some of the conservative phonological features of Italian, as compared with the common [[Western Romance]] languages (French, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). Some of these features are also present in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n* Little or no [[lenition]] of consonants between vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|v\u012bta}} > ''vita'' \"life\" (cf. Romanian ''via\u021b\u0103'', Spanish ''vida'' {{IPA|[bi\u00f0a]}}, French ''vie''), {{smallcaps|pedem}} > ''piede'' \"foot\" (cf. Spanish ''pie'', French ''pied'' {{IPA|/pje/}}).\n* Preservation of geminate consonants, e.g. {{smallcaps|annum}} > {{IPA|/\u02c8an.no/}} ''anno'' \"year\" (cf. Spanish ''a\u00f1o'' {{IPA|/a\u0272o/}}, French ''an'' {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}}, Portuguese ''ano'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u00e3.nu/}}).\n* Preservation of all [[Proto-Romance]] final vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|pacem}} > ''pace'' \"peace\" (cf. Romanian ''pace'', Spanish ''paz'', French ''paix'' {{IPA|/p\u025b/}}), {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Romanian ''opt'', Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit'' {{IPA|/\u0265i(t)/}}), {{smallcaps|f\u0113c\u012b}} > ''feci'' \"I did\" (cf. Spanish ''hice'', French ''fis'' {{IPA|/fi/}}).\n* Preservation of most intertonic vowels (those between the stressed syllable and either the beginning or ending syllable). This accounts for some of the most noticeable differences, as in the forms ''quattordici'' and ''settimana'' given above.\n* Slower consonant development, e.g. {{smallcaps|folia}} > Italo-Western {{IPA|/f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} > ''foglia'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} \"leaf\" (cf. Romanian ''foaie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u032faje/}}, Spanish ''hoja'' {{IPA|/\u02c8oxa/}}, French ''feuille'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0153j/}}; but note Portuguese ''folha'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u028e\u0250/}}).\n\nCompared with most other Romance languages, Italian has many inconsistent outcomes, where the same underlying sound produces different results in different words, e.g. {{smallcaps|lax\u0101re}} > ''lasciare'' and ''lassare'', {{smallcaps|capti\u0101re}} > ''cacciare'' and ''cazzare'', {{smallcaps|(ex)d\u0113roteol\u0101re}} > ''sdrucciolare'', ''druzzolare'' and ''ruzzolare'', {{smallcaps|r\u0113g\u012bna}} > ''regina'' and ''reina''. Although in all these examples the second form has fallen out of usage, the dimorphism is thought to reflect the several-hundred-year period during which Italian developed as a literary language divorced from any native-speaking population, with an origin in 12th/13th-century Tuscan but with many words borrowed from [[Languages of Italy|languages]] farther to the north, with different sound outcomes. (The [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]], the most important [[isogloss]] in the entire Romance-language area, passes only about 20 miles to the north of Florence.) Dual outcomes of Latin /p t k/ between vowels, such as {{smallcaps|l\u014fcum}} > '' luogo'' but {{smallcaps|f\u014fcum}} > '' fuoco'', was once thought to be due to borrowing of northern voiced forms, but is now generally viewed as the result of early phonetic variation within Tuscany.\n\nSome other features that distinguish Italian from the Western Romance languages:\n* Latin {{smallcaps|ce-,ci-}} becomes {{IPA|/t\u0283e, t\u0283i/}} rather than {{IPA|/(t)se, (t)si/}}.\n* Latin {{smallcaps|-ct-}} becomes {{IPA|/tt/}} rather than {{IPA|/jt/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}: {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit,'' Portuguese ''oito'').\n* Vulgar Latin {{smallcaps|-cl-}} becomes ''cchi'' {{IPA|/kkj/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u028e/}}: {{smallcaps|oclum}} > ''occhio'' \"eye\" (cf. Portuguese ''olho'' {{IPA|/o\u028eu/}}, French ''oeil'' {{IPA|/\u0153j/}} < {{IPA|/\u0153\u028e/}}); but Romanian ''ochi'' {{IPA|/ok\u02b2/}}.\n* Final {{IPA|/s/}} is not preserved, and vowel changes rather than {{IPA|/s/}} are used to mark the plural: ''amico, amici'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amica, amiche'' \"female friend(s)\" (cf. Romanian ''amic, amici'',''amic\u0103, amice'', Spanish ''amigo(s)'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amiga(s)'' \"female friend(s)\"); {{smallcaps|tr\u0113s, sex}} \u2192 ''tre, sei'' \"three, six\" (cf. Romanian ''trei, \u0219ase'', Spanish ''tres, seis'').\n\nStandard Italian also differs in some respects from most nearby Italian languages:\n* Perhaps most noticeable is the total lack of [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]], though metaphony is a feature characterizing nearly every other [[Languages of Italy|Italian language]].\n* No simplification of original {{IPA|/nd/}}, {{IPA|/mb/}} (which often became {{IPA|/nn/, /mm/}} elsewhere).\n\n=== Assimilation ===\nItalian [[phonotactics]] do not usually permit verbs and polysyllabic nouns to end with consonants, excepting poetry and song, so foreign words may receive [[Epenthetic vowel#Epenthesis of a vowel, or anaptyxis|extra terminal vowel sounds]].<!--(Maybe this should go under history?)--->\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Italian alphabet}}\nThe Italian alphabet is typically considered to consist of 21 letters. The letters j, k, w, x, y are traditionally excluded, though they appear in loanwords such as ''jeans'', ''whisky'', ''taxi'', ''xenofobo'', ''xilofono''. The letter {{angle bracket|x}} has become common in standard Italian with the prefix ''extra-'', although ''(e)stra-'' is traditionally used; it is also common to use the Latin particle ''ex(-)'' to mean \"former(ly)\" as in: ''la mia ex'' (\"my ex-girlfriend\"), \"Ex-Jugoslavia\" (\"Former Yugoslavia\"). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} appears in the first name ''Jacopo'' and in some Italian place-names, such as [[Bajardo]], [[Bojano]], [[Joppolo]], [[Jerzu]], [[Jesolo]], [[Jesi]], [[Ajaccio]], among others, and in ''Mar Jonio'', an alternative spelling of ''Mar Ionio'' (the [[Ionian Sea]]). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} may appear in dialectal words, but its use is discouraged in contemporary standard Italian.<ref name=\"Clivio\">{{cite book|title=The Sounds, Forms, and Uses of Italian: An Introduction to Italian Linguistics|first=Gianrenzo|last=Clivio|first2=Marcel|last2=Danesi|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000|pages=21, 66}}</ref> Letters used in foreign words can be replaced with [[phonetics|phonetically]] equivalent native Italian letters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: {{angle bracket|gi}}, {{angle bracket|ge}}, or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|j}}; {{angle bracket|c}} or {{angle bracket|ch}} for {{angle bracket|k}} (including in the standard prefix ''kilo-''); {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}} or {{angle bracket|v}} for {{angle bracket|w}}; {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|ss}}, {{angle bracket|z}}, {{angle bracket|zz}} or {{angle bracket|cs}} for {{angle bracket|x}}; and {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|y}}.\n* The [[acute accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|front close-mid vowel]], as in ''perch\u00e9'' \"why, because\". In dictionaries, it is also used over {{angle bracket|o}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid back rounded vowel|back close-mid vowel]] (''azi\u00f3ne''). The [[grave accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|front open-mid vowel]], as in ''t\u00e8'' \"tea\". The grave accent is used over any vowel to indicate word-final stress, as in ''giovent\u00f9'' \"youth\". Unlike {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}, which is a ''close''-mid vowel, a stressed final {{angle bracket|o}} is always a [[Open-mid back rounded vowel|back open-mid vowel]] (''andr\u00f2''), making {{angle bracket|\u00f3}} unnecessary outside of dictionaries. Most of the time, the penultimate syllable is stressed. But if the stressed vowel is the final letter of the word, the accent is mandatory, otherwise it is virtually always omitted. Exceptions are typically either in dictionaries, where all or most stressed vowels are commonly marked. Accents can optionally be used to disambiguate words that differ only by stress, as for ''pr\u00ecncipi'' \"princes\" and ''princ\u00ecpi'' \"principles\", or ''\u00e0ncora'' \"anchor\" and ''anc\u00f3ra'' \"still''/''yet\". For monosyllabic words, the rule is different: when two orthographically identical monosyllabic words with different meanings exist, one is accented and the other is not (example: ''\u00e8'' \"is\", ''e'' \"and\").\n* The letter {{angle bracket|h}} distinguishes ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'' (present indicative of ''avere'' \"to have\") from ''o'' (\"or\"), ''ai'' (\"to the\"), ''a'' (\"to\"), ''anno'' (\"year\"). In the spoken language, the letter is always silent. The {{angle bracket|h}} in ''ho'' additionally marks the contrasting open pronunciation of the {{angle bracket|o}}. The letter {{angle bracket|h}} is also used in combinations with other letters. No [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/h/}} exists in Italian. In nativized foreign words, the {{angle bracket|h}} is silent. For example, ''hotel'' and ''hovercraft'' are pronounced {{IPA|/o\u02c8t\u025bl/}} and {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254verkraft/}} respectively. (Where {{angle bracket|h}} existed in Latin, it either disappeared or, in a few cases before a back vowel, changed to {{IPA|[\u0261]}}: ''traggo'' \"I pull\" \u2190 Lat. {{smallcaps|trah\u014d}}.)\n* The letters {{angle bracket|s}} and {{angle bracket|z}} can symbolize [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants. {{angle bracket|z}} symbolizes {{IPA|/dz/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on context, with few minimal pairs. For example: ''zanzara'' {{IPA|/dzan\u02c8dza\u02d0ra/}} \"mosquito\" and ''nazione'' {{IPA|/nat\u02c8tsjo\u02d0ne/}} \"nation\". {{angle bracket|s}} symbolizes {{IPA|/s/}} word-initially before a vowel, when clustered with a voiceless consonant ({{angle bracket|p, f, c, ch}}), and when doubled; it symbolizes {{IPA|/z/}} when between vowels and when clustered with voiced consonants. Intervocalic {{angle bracket|s}} varies regionally between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, with {{IPA|/z/}} being more dominant in northern Italy and {{IPA|/s/}} in the south.\n* The letters {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} vary in pronunciation between [[plosives]] and [[affricates]] depending on following vowels. The letter {{angle bracket|c}} symbolizes {{IPA|/k/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|t\u0283}} as in ''chair'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. The letter {{angle bracket|g}} symbolizes {{IPA|/\u0261/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|d\u0292}} as in ''gem'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Other Romance languages and, to an extent, English have similar variations for {{angle bracket|c, g}}. Compare [[hard and soft C]], [[hard and soft G]]. (See also [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].)\n* The [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|gh}} indicate ({{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) before {{angle bracket|i, e}}. The digraphs {{angle bracket|ci}} and {{angle bracket|gi}} indicate softness ({{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}) before {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. For example:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before back vowel (A, O, U)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before front vowel (I, E)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Plosive\n!

For example, it is silent in ''[[ciao]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283a\u02d0.o/}} and cielo {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u025b\u02d0.lo/}}, but it is pronounced in ''farmacia'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.a/}} and ''farmacie'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.e/}}.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n<!--\n* There are three other special [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] in Italian: [[gn (digraph)|{{angle bracket|gn}}]], {{angle bracket|gl}} and {{angle bracket|sc}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|gn}} represents {{IPAslink|\u0272}}. {{angle bracket|gl}} represents {{IPAslink|\u028e}} before {{angle bracket|i}}, and never at the beginning of a word, except in the [[personal pronoun]] and [[definite article]] ''gli''. An exception is the word ''glicerina'' (\"glycerin\"), which is pronounced with a hard {{angle bracket|g}}. (Compare with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} and {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{angle bracket|nh}} and {{angle bracket|lh}}.) {{angle bracket|sc}} represents a fricative {{IPAslink|\u0283}} before {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Except in the speech of some Northern Italians, all of these are normally [[geminate]] between vowels.\n* In general, there is a clear one-to-one correspondence between letters or digraphs and phonemes, as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; in standard varieties of Italian, there is little allophonic variation. The most notable exceptions are assimilation of /n/ in point of articulation before consonants, assimilatory voicing of /s/ to following voiced consonants, and vowel length (vowels are long in stressed open syllables, except at the end of words, and short elsewhere) \u2014 compare with the substantial number of [[allophone]]s of the English phoneme /t/. Spelling is mostly phonemic and usually difficult to mistake, given a clear pronunciation. Exceptions exist, especially in foreign borrowings. There are fewer cases of [[dyslexia]] than among speakers of languages such as English,<ref>E. Paulescu et al., Dyslexia \u2013 cultural diversity and biological unity, \"Science\", vol. 291, pp. 2165\u20132167.</ref> and the concept of a [[spelling bee]] is strange to Italians.\n\n=== Common variations ===\nSome variations in the usage of the writing system may be present in practical use. These are scorned by educated people and normal written language, but they are so common in certain limited contexts that knowledge of them may be useful.\n* Usage of ''x'' instead of ''per'' \"for\". This is common among teenagers and in [[Text messaging|SMS]] abbreviations. The multiplication operator is read \"per\" in Italian. For example, ''per te'' (\"for you\") is shortened to ''x te'' (compare with English ''4 u''). The ''per'' within words can also be replaced with ''x''. For example: ''perch\u00e9'' (\"why, because\") to ''xch\u00e9'' or ''xk\u00e9''; ''sapere'' (\"to know\") to ''saxe''). This usage is useful shorthand in quick notes or in SMS, but it is unacceptable in formal writing.\n* Usage of foreign letters such as {{angle bracket|k}}, {{angle bracket|j}} and {{angle bracket|y}}, especially in nicknames and SMS language: ''ke'' instead of ''che'', ''Giusy'' instead of ''Giuseppina''. This is mirrored in the usage of ''i'' in English names such as ''Staci'' instead of ''Stacey'' or in the usage of ''c'' in [[Northern Europe]] (''Jacob'' instead of ''Jakob''). The use of {{angle bracket|k}} instead of {{angle bracket|ch}} or {{angle bracket|c}} to represent a plosive sound is documented in some historical texts from before the standardization of the Italian language. The usage is no longer standard in Italian. The letter {{angle bracket|k}} has sometimes been used in satire to suggest a political figure is an authoritarian or even a \"pseudo-nazi\". For example, [[Francesco Cossiga]] was famously nicknamed ''Kossiga'' by rioting students during his tenure as minister of internal affairs. Compare the [[satiric misspelling#\"K\" replacing \"C\"|politicized spelling ''Amerika'']] in the USA. Although not a letter in the standard Italian alphabet, the letter {{angle bracket|j}} is found in many of the languages of southern Italy, including [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. In modern texts written in any such language, the {{angle bracket|j}} is often replaced with {{angle bracket|i}}.\n* The following abbreviations are limited to electronic-communications media: ''nn'' for ''non'' \"not\"; ''cmq'' for ''comunque'' \"anyway, however\"; ''cm'' for ''come'' \"how, like, as\"; ''d'' for ''di'' \"of\"; ''(io/loro) sn'' for ''(io/loro) sono'' \"I am, they are\"; ''(io) dv'' for ''(io) devo'' \"I must, I have to\" or for ''dove'' \"where\"; ''(tu) 6'' for ''(tu) sei'' \"you are\"; ''dmn'' for ''domani'' \"tomorrow\".\n* Whenever non-[[ASCII]] characters are unavailable or unreliable (as in e-mail), accents may be replaced with adjacent apostrophes. For example: in ''perche<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' instead of ''perch\u00e9''. The practice was standard on manual typewriters that had no accents and is still common for uppercase accented letters. Uppercase {{angle bracket|[[\u00c8]]}} is rare and is absent from the [[Keyboard layout#Italian|Italian keyboard layout]]. It is often substituted with {{angle bracket|E<nowiki>'</nowiki>}}, even though there are [[:it:Aiuto:Manuale di stile#Scrivere \u00c8|several ways]] of producing the uppercase \u00c8 on a computer.\n\n== Sounds ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n{{IPA notice|lang=it}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nItalian has seven [[vowel]] phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, represented by five letters: \"a, e, i, o, u\". The pairs {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/\u025b/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/\u0254/}} are seldom distinguished in writing and often confused, even though most varieties of Italian employ both phonemes consistently. Compare, for example standard \"perch\u00e9\" {{IPA|[per\u02c8ke]}} (why, because) and \"senti\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u025bnti]}} (you hear), as pronounced by most central and southern speakers, with {{IPA|[per\u02c8k\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8senti]}}, employed by most northern speakers. As a result, the usage is strongly indicative of a person's origin. The standard (Tuscan) usage of these vowels is listed in vocabularies, and employed outside Tuscany mainly by specialists, especially actors and a few (television) journalists.\nThese are truly different [[phonemes]], however: compare {{IPA|/\u02c8peska/}} (fishing) and {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u025bska/}} (peach), both spelled ''pesca'' ({{Audio|It-pesca.ogg|listen}}). Similarly {{IPA|/\u02c8botte/}} ('barrel') and {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254tte/}} ('beatings'), both spelled ''botte'', discriminate {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} ({{Audio|It-botte-mp.ogg|listen}}).\n\nIn general, vowel combinations usually pronounce each vowel separately. [[Diphthong]]s exist (e.g. ''uo'', ''iu'', ''ie'', ''ai''), but are limited to an unstressed ''u'' or ''i'' before or after a stressed vowel.\n\nThe unstressed ''u'' in a diphthong approximates the English semivowel ''w'', and the unstressed ''i'' approximates the semivowel ''y''. E.g.: ''buono'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bw\u0254\u02d0no]}}, ''ieri'' {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025b\u02d0ri]}}.\n\n[[Triphthong]]s exist in Italian as well, like \"contin''uia''mo\" (\"we continue\"). Three vowel combinations exist only in the form semiconsonant ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}), followed by a vowel, followed by a [[:wikt:desinence|desinence]] vowel (usually {{IPA|/i/}}), as in ''miei'', ''suoi'', or two semiconsonants followed by a vowel, as the group ''-uia-'' exemplified above, or ''-iuo-'' in the word ''aiuola''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Serianni | first=Luca | author2=Castelvecchi, Alberto |title=Italiano | publisher=Garzanti | year=1997 | page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile diphthongs ===\nMany Latin words with a short ''e'' or ''o'' have Italian counterparts with a so-called mobile diphthong (''ie'' and ''uo'' respectively). The mobility, however, is of stress: when the vowel sound is stressed, it is pronounced and written as a diphthong, e.g. ''buono'' 'good'; when not stressed, it is pronounced and written as a single vowel, as in ''bont\u00e0'' 'goodness'.\n\nSo Latin ''focus'' gave rise to Italian ''fuoco'' (meaning both \"fire\" and \"optical focus\"): when unstressed, as in ''focale'' (\"focal\") the \"o\" remains alone. Latin ''pes'' (more precisely its accusative form ''pedem'') is the source of Italian ''piede'' (foot): but unstressed \"e\" was left unchanged in ''pedone'' (pedestrian) and ''pedale'' (pedal). From Latin ''jocus'' comes Italian ''giuoco'' (\"play\", \"game\"), though in this case ''gioco'' is more common: ''giocare'' means \"to play (a game)\". From Latin ''homo'' comes Italian ''uomo'' (man), but also ''umano'' (human) and ''ominide'' (hominid). From Latin ''ovum'' comes Italian ''uovo'' (egg) and ''ovaie'' (ovaries). (The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''juego'' (play, game) and ''jugar'' (to play), ''nieve'' (snow) and ''nevar'' (to snow)). Stress-conditioned historical diphthongization can also produce alternating verb stems, as in stem-stressed ''siedo'' 'I sit' and suffix-stressed ''sediamo'' 'we sit'.\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{{See also|Syntactic doubling}}\n\nTwo symbols in a table cell denote the voiceless and voiced consonant, respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Consonants of Italian<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rogers & d'Arcangeli|2004|p=117}}</ref>\n!\n!

More generally, nasals assimilate to the point of articulation of whatever consonant they precede. -->\n\nItalian has geminate, or double, consonants, which are distinguished by [[Consonant length|length]] and intensity. Length is distinctive for all consonants except for {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/\u028e/}}, {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, which are always geminate when between vowels, and {{IPA|/z/}}, which is always single.\nGeminate plosives and affricates are realized as lengthened closures. Geminate fricatives, nasals, and {{IPA|/l/}} are realized as lengthened [[continuant]]s. There is only one vibrant phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} but the actual pronunciation depends on context and regional accent. Generally one can find a flap consonant {{IPA|[\u027e]}} in unstressed position whereas {{IPA|[r]}} is more common in stressed syllables, but there may be exceptions. Especially people from the Northern part of Italy ([[Parma]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[South Tyrol]]) may pronounce {{IPA|/r/}} as {{IPA|[\u0280]}}, {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, or {{IPA|[\u028b]}}.<ref>{{cite book |last= Canepari |first= Luciano |title= Il M\u00aaPI \u2013 Manuale di pronuncia italiana |edition= second |date=January 1999 |publisher= Zanichelli |location= Bologna |isbn= 978-88-08-24624-0}}</ref>\n\nOf special interest to the linguistic study of [[Regional Italian]] is the ''[[Tuscan gorgia|gorgia toscana]]'', or \"Tuscan Throat\", the weakening or [[lenition]] of [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} in the [[Tuscan language]].\n\nThe [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0292/}} is present as a phoneme only in loanwords: for example, ''garage'' {{IPA|[\u0261a\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0292]}}. Phonetic {{IPA|[\u0292]}} is common in Central and Southern Italy as an intervocalic allophone of {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}: ''gente'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'people' but ''la gente'' {{IPA|[la\u02c8\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'the people', ''ragione'' {{IPA|[ra\u02c8\u0292o\u02d0ne]}} 'reason'.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Italian grammar}}\n{{See also|Italian verbs}}\n\nItalian grammar is typical of the grammar of [[Romance languages]] in general. [[Grammatical case|Cases]] exist for personal pronouns ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Dative case|dative]]), but not for nouns.\n\nThere are two basic classes of nouns in Italian, referred to as [[Grammatical gender|genders]], masculine and feminine. Gender may be [[natural gender|natural]] (''ragazzo'' 'boy', ''ragazza'' 'girl') or simply grammatical with no possible reference to biological gender (masculine ''costo'' 'cost', feminine ''costa'' 'coast'). Masculine nouns typically end in ''-o'' (''ragazzo'' 'boy'), with plural marked by ''-i'' (''ragazzi'' 'boys'), and feminine nouns typically end in ''-a'', with plural marked by ''-e'' (''ragazza'' 'girl', ''ragazze'' 'girls'). For a group composed of boys and girls, ''ragazzi'' is the plural, suggesting that ''-i'' is a general plural. A third category of nouns is [[Marker (linguistics)|unmarked]] for gender, ending in ''-e'' in the singular and ''-i'' in the plural: ''legge'' 'law, f. sg.', ''leggi'' 'laws, f. pl.'; ''fiume'' 'river, m. sg.', ''fiumi'' 'rivers, m. pl.', thus assignment of gender is arbitrary in terms of form, enough so that terms may be identical but of distinct genders: ''fine'' meaning 'aim', 'purpose' is masculine, while ''fine'' meaning 'end, ending' (e.g. of a movie) is feminine, and both are ''fini'' in the plural, a clear instance of ''-i'' as a non-gendered default plural marker. These nouns often, but not always, denote [[Animacy|inanimates]]. There are a number of nouns that have a masculine singular and a feminine plural, most commonly of the pattern m. sg. ''-o'', f. pl. ''-a'' (''miglio'' 'mile, m. sg.', ''miglia'' 'miles, f. pl.'; ''paio'' 'pair, m. sg., ''paia'' 'pairs, f. pl.'), and thus are sometimes considered neuter (these are usually derived from [[Grammatical gender|neuter]] Latin nouns). An instance of neuter gender also exists in pronouns of the third person singular.{{sfn|Simone|2010}}\n\nExamples:<ref name=\":6\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"Accademia della Crusca\"\n! href=\"Floris Italicae lingue libri novem\" |Definition\n!Gender\n! href=\"Napoleon\" |Singular Form\n! href=\"lingua franca\" |Plural Form\n|- href=\"bourgeoisie\"\n|Son\n| href=\"The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)\" |Masculine\n|Figlio\n|Figli\n|- href=\"Alessandro Manzoni\"\n| href=\"Arno River\" |House\n| href=\"Florence\" |Feminine\n|Casa\n| href=\"ciao\" |Case\n|- href=\"Venetian language\"\n|Love\n| href=\"panettone\" |Masculine\n| href=\"Lombard language\" |Amore\n|Amori\n|- href=\"Romance language\"\n| href=\"Vulgar Latin\" |Art\n| href=\"Tuscan language\" |Feminine\n| href=\"Florentine dialect\" |Arte\n| href=\"Italo-Dalmatian languages\" |Arti\n|}\nNouns, adjectives, and articles [[Inflection|inflect]] for gender and number (singular and plural).\n\nLike in English, common nouns are capitalized when occurring at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike English, nouns referring to languages (e.g. Italian), speakers of languages, or inhabitants of an area (e.g. Italians) are not capitalized.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three types of [[adjective]]s: descriptive, invariable and form-changing. Descriptive adjectives are the most common, and their endings change to match the number and gender of the noun they modify. Invariable adjectives are adjectives whose endings do not change. The form changing adjectives \"buono (good), bello (beautiful), grande (big), and santo (saint)\" change in form when placed before different types of nouns. Italian has three degrees for comparison of adjectives: positive, comparative, and superlative.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe order of words in the phrase is relatively free compared to most European languages.<ref name=\"Clivio\" /> The position of the verb in the phrase is highly mobile. Word order often has a lesser grammatical function in Italian than in [[English language|English]]. Adjectives are sometimes placed before their noun and sometimes after. Subject nouns generally come before the verb. Italian is a [[null-subject language]], so that nominative pronouns are usually absent, with subject indicated by verbal [[inflection]]s (e.g. ''amo'' 'I love', ''ama'' 's/he loves', ''amano'' 'they love'). Noun objects normally come after the verb, as do pronoun objects after imperative verbs, infinitives and gerunds, but otherwise pronoun objects come before the verb.\n\nThere are both indefinite and definite [[Article (grammar)|articles]] in Italian. There are four indefinite articles, selected by the gender of the noun they modify and by the phonological structure of the word that immediately follows the article. ''Uno'' is masculine singular, used before ''z'' ({{IPA|ts/}} or {{IPA|/dz/}}), ''s+consonant'', ''gn'' ({{IPA|/\u0272/}}), or ''ps'', while masculine singular ''un'' is used before a word beginning with any other sound. The noun ''zio'' 'uncle' selects masculine singular, thus ''uno zio'' 'an uncle' or ''uno zio anziano'' 'an old uncle,' but ''un mio zio'' 'an uncle of mine'. The feminine singular indefinite articles are ''una'', used before any consonant sound, and its abbreviated form, written ''un','' used before vowels: ''una camicia'' 'a shirt', ''una camicia bianca'' 'a white shirt', ''un'altra camicia'' 'a different shirt'. There are seven forms for definite articles, both singular and plural. In the singular: ''lo'', which corresponds to the uses of ''uno''; ''il'', which corresponds to the uses with consonant of ''un''; ''la,'' which corresponds to the uses of ''una''; ''l','' used for both masculine and feminine singular before vowels. In the plural: ''gli'' is the masculine plural of ''lo and l<nowiki>'</nowiki>''; ''i'' is the plural of ''il''; and ''le'' is the plural of feminine ''la'' and ''l''<nowiki/>'.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are numerous [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] of [[preposition]]s with subsequent [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. There are numerous productive [[suffix]]es for [[Italian diminutive|diminutive]], [[Augmentative#Italian|augmentative]], pejorative, attenuating etc., which are also used to create [[neologism]]s.\n\nThere are 27 pronouns, grouped in [[clitic]] and tonic pronouns. Personal pronouns are separated into three groups: subject, object (which take the place of both direct and indirect objects), and reflexive. Second person subject pronouns have both a polite and a familiar form. These two different types of address are very important in Italian social distinctions. All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed (clitics). Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb (''Lo vedo''. 'I see him.'). Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required, for contrast, or to avoid ambiguity (''Vedo lui, ma non lei''. 'I see him, but not her'). Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three regular sets of verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], and various verbs are irregularly conjugated. Within each of these sets of conjugations, there are four simple (one-word) verbal conjugations by person/number in the [[indicative mood]] ([[present tense]]; [[past tense]] with [[imperfective aspect]], past tense with [[perfective aspect]], and [[future tense]]), two simple conjugations in the [[subjunctive mood]] (present tense and past tense), one simple conjugation in the [[conditional mood]], and one simple conjugation in the [[imperative mood]]. Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of \"to be\" or \"to have\" followed by a [[past participle]]. \"To have\" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive (\"Ha detto\", \"ha fatto\": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while \"to be\" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs (\"\u00c8 andato\", \"\u00e8 stato\": he/she has gone, he/she has been). \"To be\" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive (\"\u00ca detto\", \"\u00e8 fatto\": it is said, it is made/done). This rule is not absolute, and some exceptions do exist.\n\n== Words ==\n===Conversation===\nNote: the plural form of verbs could also be used as an extremely formal (for example to [[Nobility|noble]] people in [[Monarchy|monarchies]]) singular form (see [[royal we]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
