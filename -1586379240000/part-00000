He was a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for 23 years, from 1964 to 1987, for [[Willesden East (UK Parliament constituency)|Willesden East]] and later [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]], with 14 years on the [[front bench]].  He became a junior minister in the [[Ministry of Power (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Power]] in 1967, and then led his party on housing policy for 10 years, from 1969 to 1979, serving as [[Minister of State]] for Housing from 1969 to 1970 and then again from 1974 to 1979, and being his party's housing spokesman in the intervening period.  He continued as health and social security spokesman until 1981. His [[Soft left|soft-left]] opinions made him vulnerable to the [[hard left]] in the early 1980s, and he was deselected in 1985, leaving Parliament at the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] to be succeeded by hard-leftwinger and future London mayor [[Ken Livingstone]].\n\n==Early and private life==\nFreeson was born in [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] and raised in the Jewish [[orphanage]] in [[West Norwood]] from the age of 5.  His grandparents were [[Jew]]s who came to the UK to escape the [[pogrom]]s in [[Poland]] and [[Russia]] in the 1890s, but he was abandoned by his parents.\n\nAfter a successful school career, he volunteered to join the [[RAF Volunteer Reserve]] aged 16, but was posted to the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade]] for training in 1944 and then passed on to the [[Royal Engineers]] in [[Egypt]].  He spent some time working for the [[Inter Services Publications Unit]].\n\nHe worked as a journalist in the [[Middle East]] for one year after being demobbed in 1947, and his experiences made him a convinced [[Zionist]].  He continued his print career in [[Fleet Street]], where he worked on publications including ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull]]'', ''[[Everybody's Weekly (magazine)|Everybody's Weekly]]'', ''[[London Illustrated]]'', ''[[News Review]]'', ''[[Today (magazine)|Today]]'', ''[[Education (magazine)|Education]]'', ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' and the ''[[News Chronicle]]''.

He became active in local politics, and was elected to [[Willesden]] Borough Council in 1952 and became an alderman in 1955. He served as the council leader from 1958 until the post was abolished in 1965. He chaired the shadow council of the [[London Borough of Brent]] from 1964\u201365, and was an [[alderman]] of Brent until 1968.\n\nHe was elected as the MP for [[Willesden East (UK Parliament constituency)|Willesden East]]  with a majority of less than 2,000 votes at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]], gaining the seat from sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, [[Trevor Skeet]]. [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government was elected with a slim majority of only five seats, which was quickly reduced to three.  Within weeks, he was appointed as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Tom Fraser]], the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]], from 1964\u201367, and then [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Ministry of Power (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Power]] from 1967\u201369. He served as [[Minister of Housing and Local Government]] from 1969 until the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] the following year.\n\nHe remained as Housing Spokesman in opposition, and his mastery of the subject made him a fearsome opponent to the incumbent Conservative ministers. With [[Eric Heffer]], he led a Commons protest over the [[cloture|guillotine]] of the controversial bill which was to become the [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]].\n\nFreeson's seat was renamed [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]] in 1974, and he returned as [[Minister for Housing and Construction]] in the new [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], in a period of high interest rates and rapidly rising house prices. He later added responsibility for [[new town]]s, [[planning]], land and [[local government]] to his portfolio. He retained his ministerial office when [[James Callaghan]] succeeded Harold Wilson as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1976, becoming a [[privy counsellor]] that year, and retained his office until Labour's defeat at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. He remained on the Labour frontbench in opposition, as spokesman on Health and Social Security, but was demoted by [[Michael Foot]] in 1981.

According to Tripp, who is about 24 years older than Lewinsky, they knew one another for a year and a half before the scandal began to reach its critical stage. After Lewinsky revealed to Tripp that she had been in a physical relationship with President Clinton, Tripp, acting on the advice of literary agent [[Lucianne Goldberg]], began to secretly record phone conversations with Lewinsky while encouraging Lewinsky to document details of her relationship with the president.\n\nIn August 1997, [[Michael Isikoff]], from ''[[Newsweek]]'', reported that Tripp said that she had encountered [[Kathleen Willey]] coming out of the Oval Office \"disheveled,\" with \"her face red and her lipstick was off.\" Willey alleged that Clinton groped her.

Tripp disclosed to Starr that she was aware of the relationship between Lewinsky and President Clinton, that Lewinsky had executed a false [[affidavit]] denying the relationship that was submitted to the federal court in Arkansas in the ''[[Clinton v.
