She was his sixth wife, as all his previous wives had died childless and in quick succession. They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old  [[South Arcot|South Arcot district]], near [[Chidambaram]].  R\u0101malingam was their fifth child. The older ones were two sons Sabhapati and Parasu R\u0101man; and two daughters, Sundarammal and Unnamulai. They named their youngest child R\u0101malingam.\n\n===Childhood and divine experiences===\nOnce, R\u0101malingam's parents went to the [[Chidambaram Temple|Chidambaram Natar\u0101jar Temple]] with their five month old child, and the infant was joyous while the [[priest]]  was offering  [[Archana (Hinduism)|Deepa aradhana]] (adoration by lighted lamp being brought close to the vigrahams); this was perceived by R\u0101malingam as a deep spiritual experience. In later years he said of the experience:\n\n:\"No sooner the Light was perceived, happiness prevailed on me\", and\n\n:\"The sweet nectar was tasted by me as soon as the Arut perun jothi (Supreme Grace Of Light) became visible\".<ref>[http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf Arutperunjothi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916051722/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }}, Tamil Nadu Text books online</ref>\n\nIn 1824, his father R\u0101mayy\u0101 pillai died. Because of his untimely demise, Chinnammai shifted her residence to her mother's place at Chinna k\u0101vanam, Ponneri. Saint R\u0101malingam was a small child when he relocated with his mother to Chennai in 1826. He and his mother lived  with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at [[Sevenwells]] area of [[Chennai]], which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] After R\u0101malingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his [[formal education]]. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha sw\u0101mi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and  he told his wife not to  give R\u0101malingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. God gave food before sister in law gave food. In return, R\u0101malingam asked  for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror.  He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started [[meditation]] by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the [[Murugan|Lord Muruga]]. R\u0101malingam said:\n\n:\"The beauty endowed divine faces six, the illustrious shoulders twelve.\"<ref>Lakshmi Devnath, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm \"Compassion is the essence of Saint R\u0101malingam's philosophy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |date=2011-01-07 }}, ''The Hindu'', February 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAt one time, R\u0101malingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an [[Katha (storytelling format)|upany\u0101sam]] (religious stories) session as up\u0101sakar. His great discourse on verses from the `[[Periya Puranam|Periya pur\u0101nam]]', an epic poem by [[Sekkizhar]] about the saintly '63 [[Nayanars|N\u0101yan\u0101rs]]', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. R\u0101malingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly. R\u0101malingam says thanks to the [[divinity|Divine]] by:\n\n:\"Effulgent flame of grace, that lit in me intelligence, to know untaught.\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalar.org/WebComponents/FrontPage.aspx?ViewName=enBlogs&WebSiteId=1&ConId=294 Early life of Saint Vallal\u0101r]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nR\u0101malingam evolved in his spiritual journey from being a devout devotee of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to worshipping the formless.\n\nR\u0101malingam renounced the world at the young age of thirteen. But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the [[bridegroom]] during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the [[Tiruvasakam|Thiru v\u0101sagam]]. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.\n\n==Teachings==\n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heaps of grain bags at [[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya gnana sabha, Vadalur]] - established by R\u0101malinga adigal ]]\nAt the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858. First he went to [[Chidambaram]] where he had a debate with Kodakanallur Sundara Sw\u0101migal. At the request of one R\u0101makrishna Reddiyar he went to his house at [[Karunguzhi]] and stayed there for 9 years. He was very much against the [[caste|caste system]] because of the adverse impacts it had on society. Towards that end, he started the \"Samarasa  Vedha Sanmarga Sangam\" in 1865. In 1872 it was renamed \"Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam\",<ref name=\"ambalamyoga.org\" /> meaning \"Society for pure truth in universal self-hood\".\n\nIn 1867, he established a  facility serving free food named \"The Sathya Dharma Salai\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalarspace.com/VallalarGroups/ Image of Sathya Dharma Salai]</ref> in [[Vadalur]]. There all people are served free food without any caste distinctions. The land for the facility was donated by kind, generous people and those registered documents are available for seeing by the visitors. The free facility continues its service till the present time. R\u0101malinga disliked people eating [[non-vegetarian]] foods, about which he said:<blockquote>When I see men feeding on the coarse and vicious food of meat, it is an ever-recurring grief to me.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=\"The Hindu\" article on Vallal\u0101r |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n \n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to the Sathya Gnana Sabha. The sign above it reads \"only those who have renounced meat and murder should enter\"]]\nOn January 25th of 1872, R\u0101malingam opened the \"[[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya Gnana Sabha]]\" (Hall of True Knowledge) at [[Vadalur]]. One of the primary teachings of Valallar is \"[[community service|Service]] to [[Human beings|Living Beings]] is the path of [[Moksha|Liberation/ Moksha]]\". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is \"Arul Perum Jothi\" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.\n\nIn 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the \"Sathya Gnana Sabai\", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a [[temple]]; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the ''pooja'' to be performed in Gn\u0101na sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gn\u0101na sabai and do ''poojas''. The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that [[soul]]s are blinded by seven veils.<ref>[https://www.vallalyaar.com/enquiry-on-truth-satvisaaram-vallalar/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n \nThere are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its truth.

He said the intelligence we possess is [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is ''Jeeva Karunyam''. Looking other souls with compassion, also own soul from birth and death. He advocated a [[Caste in India|casteless society]]. Vallal\u0101r was opposed to [[superstition]]s and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth. Today there are spiritual groups spread out all over the world who practice the teachings of R\u0101malingam and follow the path of Arul Perum Jothi.\n\n\nTo attain Deathless life its important to focus mind at the Thiruvadi Of Guru.\nIn the beginning meditate on the physical form, later it will lead to non physical form.\nSathya gnana sabai is built to have same as inner experience. \nSirsabai and Porsabai represents Thiruvadi of God.\nNot Respecting a Guru and Not Offering Guru is a sin.\n\n== Chennai Temples ==\n[[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Kandha kottam Kandasw\u0101mi Temple]]<ref>Official website Kandha kottam temple [http://kandhakottam.tnhrce.in/contact.html kandhakottam.tnhrce.in],  [http://www.kaumaram.com/\u0101layam/kandha_kottam/index.php Chennai Kandha kottam at Kaumaram.com]</ref> is located in the [[George Town, Chennai|Parry's Corner]] neighbourhood of [[Chennai]] city.

R\u0101malingam composed 'Deiva mani malai' here. At this temple, there is a hall called the [[Mandapa|Mukha mandapam]], where the idols of [[Ganesha|Sarva Siddhi Vinayakar]], [[Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple|Meenakshi Sundareswarar]], Idumban, Sri R\u0101malinga sw\u0101migal,<ref>[http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/New_en.php?id=12 Dinamalar newspaper- Kandha kottam photos]</ref> and Pamban sw\u0101migal are found. The locality where he lived, has been renamed as '[[Vallalar Nagar|Vallal\u0101r nagar]]'.\n\nVallalar worshipped Thiruvottiyur Thiyagarajar and Vadivudai Amman Temple. He has written many divine songs against both. Vallalar obtained grace from vadivudai amman(sakthi).\n\n==Literary works==\nAs a musician and divine poet, he composed 5818 poems teaching universal love and peace, compiled into 'Six Thiru Muraigal', which are all available today as a single book called Thiruvarutpa<ref>[http://www.tn.gov.in/tnpsc/FINEARTSde.html Tamil Nadu Public service commission included Thiru arut pa in syllabus]</ref> (tiru-arut-pa, holy book of grace).\n\nAnother work of his is the Manumurai Kanda V\u0101sagam<ref>[http://vallalar.org/Tamil/V000000076B Manumurai Kanda V\u0101sagam ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref> describing the life of [[Manu Needhi Cholan]].\n\nJeeva Karunya Ozhukkam<ref>[http://vallalar.org/english Details on Jeeva Karunya Ozhukkam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725002210/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/Jeiva%20Karunai.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}</ref>\n\n===Songs set to music===\n* Thiruvarutpa songs of R\u0101malinga sw\u0101migal are divine sung in concerts and now at least 25 songs (in Thiru varut p\u0101 Isai M\u0101lai) are given with swara-t\u0101la notation.\n* ''Th\u0101y\u0101gi thandhaiyumai'' ([[Hamsadhwani]]), ''Idu nalla tharunam'' ([[Dheerasankarabharanam|Shankar\u0101bharanam]])\n* ''Varuvar azhaithu vadi'' (Begada) and ''Thaen ena inikkum''.\n\nSome of his songs were set to music by [[Sirkazhi Govindarajan|S\u012brk\u0101zhi Govindhar\u0101jan]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2004/11/05/stories/2004110503330900.htm Sirkazhi Govindarajan] from \"The Hindu\" newspaper</ref>\n\n==Supposed physical transformation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nPerhaps one of the most notable factors of this sage is the claim that he supposedly attained a divinization of the physical body. He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.\n\nBeyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the [[Siddhis]].\n\nEven beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.\n\nBy achieving this R\u0101malingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.\n\n==Merge with Divine as One==\nOn October 22, 1873, R\u0101malingam raised the ''flag of Brotherhood''{{what|date=October 2018}} on his one-room residence ''Siddhi Val\u0101gam'' in Mettukuppam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=Article in \"The Hindu\" narration on Siddhi Valakam |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, \"nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us,\" and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.\n\nOn January 30, 1874, R\u0101malingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be \"United with Nature & ruling the actions of 'all of the alls',\" as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues. In 1906, records about his disappearance<ref>[http://bp3.blogger.com/_ye_-S-DaxNE/R_RyHb_UkJI/AAAAAAAAAqs/98zB2rqpjDI/s1600-h/gazette+1.jpg The image of engraved stone in Vadalur] about the Madras District Gazette's note describing the R\u0101malingam's disappearance incident, that took place on January 30, 1874</ref> were published in the South Arcot District's 'The Madras District [[Gazette]]er'.\n\nThiruarutpa explains that he transmigrated the physical body to divine light body by thavam/penance.

She was his sixth wife, as all his previous wives had died childless and in quick succession. They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old  [[South Arcot|South Arcot district]], near [[Chidambaram]].  R\u0101malingam was their fifth child. The older ones were two sons Sabhapati and Parasu R\u0101man; and two daughters, Sundarammal and Unnamulai. They named their youngest child R\u0101malingam.\n\n===Childhood and divine experiences===\nOnce, R\u0101malingam's parents went to the [[Chidambaram Temple|Chidambaram Natar\u0101jar Temple]] with their five month old child, and the infant was joyous while the [[priest]]  was offering  [[Archana (Hinduism)|Deepa aradhana]] (adoration by lighted lamp being brought close to the vigrahams); this was perceived by R\u0101malingam as a deep spiritual experience. In later years he said of the experience:\n\n:\"No sooner the Light was perceived, happiness prevailed on me\", and\n\n:\"The sweet nectar was tasted by me as soon as the Arut perun jothi (Supreme Grace Of Light) became visible\".<ref>[http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf Arutperunjothi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916051722/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }}, Tamil Nadu Text books online</ref>\n\nIn 1824, his father R\u0101mayy\u0101 pillai died. Because of his untimely demise, Chinnammai shifted her residence to her mother's place at Chinna k\u0101vanam, Ponneri. Saint R\u0101malingam was a small child when he relocated with his mother to Chennai in 1826. He and his mother lived  with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at [[Sevenwells]] area of [[Chennai]], which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] After R\u0101malingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his [[formal education]]. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha sw\u0101mi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and  he told his wife not to  give R\u0101malingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. God gave food before sister in law gave food. In return, R\u0101malingam asked  for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror.  He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started [[meditation]] by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the [[Murugan|Lord Muruga]]. R\u0101malingam said:\n\n:\"The beauty endowed divine faces six, the illustrious shoulders twelve.\"<ref>Lakshmi Devnath, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm \"Compassion is the essence of Saint R\u0101malingam's philosophy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |date=2011-01-07 }}, ''The Hindu'', February 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAt one time, R\u0101malingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an [[Katha (storytelling format)|upany\u0101sam]] (religious stories) session as up\u0101sakar. His great discourse on verses from the `[[Periya Puranam|Periya pur\u0101nam]]', an epic poem by [[Sekkizhar]] about the saintly '63 [[Nayanars|N\u0101yan\u0101rs]]', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. R\u0101malingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly. R\u0101malingam says thanks to the [[divinity|Divine]] by:\n\n:\"Effulgent flame of grace, that lit in me intelligence, to know untaught.\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalar.org/WebComponents/FrontPage.aspx?ViewName=enBlogs&WebSiteId=1&ConId=294 Early life of Saint Vallal\u0101r]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nR\u0101malingam evolved in his spiritual journey from being a devout devotee of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to worshipping the formless.\n\nR\u0101malingam renounced the world at the young age of thirteen. But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the [[bridegroom]] during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the [[Tiruvasakam|Thiru v\u0101sagam]]. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.\n\n==Teachings==\n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heaps of grain bags at [[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya gnana sabha, Vadalur]] - established by R\u0101malinga adigal ]]\nAt the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858. First he went to [[Chidambaram]] where he had a debate with Kodakanallur Sundara Sw\u0101migal. At the request of one R\u0101makrishna Reddiyar he went to his house at [[Karunguzhi]] and stayed there for 9 years. He was very much against the [[caste|caste system]] because of the adverse impacts it had on society. Towards that end, he started the \"Samarasa  Vedha Sanmarga Sangam\" in 1865. In 1872 it was renamed \"Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam\",<ref name=\"ambalamyoga.org\" /> meaning \"Society for pure truth in universal self-hood\".\n\nIn 1867, he established a  facility serving free food named \"The Sathya Dharma Salai\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalarspace.com/VallalarGroups/ Image of Sathya Dharma Salai]</ref> in [[Vadalur]]. There all people are served free food without any caste distinctions. The land for the facility was donated by kind, generous people and those registered documents are available for seeing by the visitors. The free facility continues its service till the present time. R\u0101malinga disliked people eating [[non-vegetarian]] foods, about which he said:<blockquote>When I see men feeding on the coarse and vicious food of meat, it is an ever-recurring grief to me.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=\"The Hindu\" article on Vallal\u0101r |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n \n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to the Sathya Gnana Sabha. The sign above it reads \"only those who have renounced meat and murder should enter\"]]\nOn January 25th of 1872, R\u0101malingam opened the \"[[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya Gnana Sabha]]\" (Hall of True Knowledge) at [[Vadalur]]. One of the primary teachings of Valallar is \"[[community service|Service]] to [[Human beings|Living Beings]] is the path of [[Moksha|Liberation/ Moksha]]\". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is \"Arul Perum Jothi\" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.\n\nIn 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the \"Sathya Gnana Sabai\", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a [[temple]]; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the ''pooja'' to be performed in Gn\u0101na sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gn\u0101na sabai and do ''poojas''. The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that [[soul]]s are blinded by seven veils.<ref>[https://www.vallalyaar.com/enquiry-on-truth-satvisaaram-vallalar/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n \nThere are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its truth.

He said the intelligence we possess is [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is ''Jeeva Karunyam''. Looking other souls with compassion, also own soul from birth and death. He advocated a [[Caste in India|casteless society]]. Vallal\u0101r was opposed to [[superstition]]s and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth.

R\u0101malingam composed 'Deiva mani malai' here. At this temple, there is a hall called the [[Mandapa|Mukha mandapam]], where the idols of [[Ganesha|Sarva Siddhi Vinayakar]], [[Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple|Meenakshi Sundareswarar]], Idumban, Sri R\u0101malinga sw\u0101migal,<ref>[http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/New_en.php?id=12 Dinamalar newspaper- Kandha kottam photos]</ref> and Pamban sw\u0101migal are found.

He has written many divine songs against both.

He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.\n\nBeyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the [[Siddhis]].\n\nEven beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.\n\nBy achieving this R\u0101malingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.\n\n==Merge with Divine as One==\nOn October 22, 1873, R\u0101malingam raised the ''flag of Brotherhood''{{what|date=October 2018}} on his one-room residence ''Siddhi Val\u0101gam'' in Mettukuppam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=Article in \"The Hindu\" narration on Siddhi Valakam |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, \"nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us,\" and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.\n\nOn January 30, 1874, R\u0101malingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be \"United with Nature & ruling the actions of 'all of the alls',\" as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues. In 1906, records about his disappearance<ref>[http://bp3.blogger.com/_ye_-S-DaxNE/R_RyHb_UkJI/AAAAAAAAAqs/98zB2rqpjDI/s1600-h/gazette+1.jpg The image of engraved stone in Vadalur] about the Madras District Gazette's note describing the R\u0101malingam's disappearance incident, that took place on January 30, 1874</ref> were published in the South Arcot District's 'The Madras District [[Gazette]]er'.\n\nThiruarutpa explains that he transmigrated the physical body to divine light body by thavam/penance.

Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.\n\nThe ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir's case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people.

These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level. An especially egregious example, according to Amnesty International, has been occurring in Puning City, [[Guangdong Province]]. The sterilization drive in this city was in accordance with regulations outlined by the government in the Population and Family Planning Law of 2002. This drive, also known as the [[Iron Fist Campaign]], also is said to have used coercive methods in order to ensure that close to 10,000 women were sterilized, including detaining elderly family members. It is unclear whether support of the increase of the now 90% Han Chinese majority here plays a role. <ref name=\"Amnesty International\"/>\n\nThe Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, \u201cSome persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.\u201d This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.<ref>{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=September 20, 2005 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210000256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> However, it remains unclear to what extent the government has prosecuted or disciplined the officials in charge of family planning in the country.\n\nThe policy requires a \"social compensation fee\" for those who have more than the legal number of children.

Research programmes are in progress. However, individual studies and facts are already available. For example:\n\nThe report of the Institute for the History of Medicine and Public Health \"Mental Disability and Sexuality. Legal sterilization in the [[Vaud]] Canton between 1928 and 1985\" points out that coercive sterilizations took place until the 1980s, it is unclear if the ethnographic impact has been duly investigated and if Hun-descendant French have been affected, as well as prehistoric human descendant communities. The act on coercive sterilizations of the Vaud Canton was the first law of this kind in the European context.\n\nHans Wolfgang Maier, head of the Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich pointed out in a report from the beginning of the century that 70% to 80% of [[abortion|terminations]] were linked to sterilization by doctors. In the period from 1929 to 1931, 480 women and 15 men were sterilized in Zurich in connection with termination.\n\nFollowing agreements between doctors and authorities such as the 1934 \"Directive For Surgical Sterilization\" of the Medical Association in Basle, eugenic indication to sterilization was recognized as admissible.\n\nA statistical evaluation of the sterilizations performed in the Basle women's hospital between 1920 and 1934 shows a remarkable increase in sterilizations for a psychiatric indication after 1929 and a steep increase in 1934, when a coercive sterilization act came into effect in nearby National Socialist Germany.\n\nA study by the Swiss Nursing School in Zurich, published in 1991, documents that 24 mentally disabled women aged between 17 and 25 years were sterilized between 1980 and 1987. Of these 24 sterilizations, just one took place at the young woman's request.\n\nHaving evaluated sources primarily from the 1930s (psychiatric files, official directives, court files, etc.), historians have documented that the requirement for free consent to sterilization was in most of cases not satisfied. Authorities obtained the \"[[Informed consent|consent]]\" required by the law partly by persuasion, and partly by enforcing it through coercion and threats. Thus the recipients of social benefits were threatened with removal of the benefits, women were exposed to a choice between placement in an institution or sterilization, and abortions were permitted only when women simultaneously consented to sterilization.\n\nMore than fifty years after ending the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany, in which racial murder, euthanasia and coerced sterilizations belonged to the political programme, it is clear that eugenics, with its idea of \"[[life unworthy of life]]\" and \"racial purity\" permeated even democratic countries. The idea that a \"healthy nation\" should be achieved through targeted medical/social measures was designed and politically implemented in many European countries and in the U.S.A in the first half of this century. It is a policy incomparable with the inconceivable horrors of the Nazi rule; yet it is clear that authorities and the medical community were guilty of the methods and measures applied, i.e. coerced sterilizations, prohibitions of marriages and child removals \u2013 serious violations of human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}}}\n\nSwitzerland refused, however, to vote a reparations Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Further|Eugenics in the United States|Sterilization law in the United States}}\n[[File:SOU 1929 14 Bet\u00e4nkande med f\u00f6rslag till steriliseringslag s 57 Laughlin.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A map from a 1929 Swedish royal commission report displays the U.S. states that had implemented sterilization legislation by then]]\n\nThe United States During the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of eugenics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 205\u201314| doi = 10.1177/096973300000700303 | pmid = 10986944 }}</ref> [[Thomas C.

Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration.

Abortion remained heavily restricted. By 1965, approximately 34 percent of women of childbearing age had been sterilized, two thirds of whom were still in their early twenties. The law was repealed on June 8, 1960.<ref name=\"Mass\" />\n\n=====1940s\u20131950s=====\n\nUnemployment and widespread poverty would continue to grow in Puerto Rico in the 40s, threatening both U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico and acting as a deterrent for future investment.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> In an attempt to attract additional U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico, another round of liberalizing trade policies were implemented and referred to as \u201c[[Operation Bootstrap]].\u201d<ref name=\"Mass\" /> Despite these policies and their relative success, unemployment and poverty in Puerto Rico remained high, high enough to prompt an increase in [[emigration]] from Puerto Rico to the United States between 1950 and 1955.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> The issues of [[immigration]], Puerto Rican poverty, and threats to U.S. private investment made population control concerns a prime political and social issue for the United States.<ref name=\"Mass\" />\n\nThe 50s also saw the production of social science research supporting sterilization procedures in Puerto Rico.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> Princeton's [[Office of Population Research]], in collaboration with the Social Research Department at the University of Puerto Rico, conducted interviews with couples regarding sterilization and other birth control.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> Their studies concluded that there was a significant need and desire for permanent birth control among Puerto Ricans.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> In response, Puerto Rico's governor and Commissioner of health opened 160 private, temporary birth control clinics with the specific purpose of sterilization.<ref name=\"Mass\" />\n\nAlso during this era, private birth control clinics were established in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans.<ref

performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure.<ref name=\"Mass\" /><ref name=\"Nick\" /><ref name=\"Briggs\" /><ref name=\"B\" /> Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /><ref name=\"B\" /> Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /><ref name= \"B\" /> This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /><ref name=\"B\" /> There is additional evidence that true [[informed consent]] was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.<ref name=\"B\" />\n\nBy 1949 a survey of Puerto Rican women found that 21% of women interviewed had been sterilized, with sterilizations being performed in 18% of all hospital births statewide as a routine post-partum procedure, with the sterilization operation performed before women left the hospitals after giving birth.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> As for the birth control clinics founded by Sunnen, the Puerto Rican Family Planning Association reported that around 8,000 women and 3,000 men had been sterilized in Sunnen's privately funded clinics.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> At one point, the levels of sterilization in Puerto Rico were so high that they alarmed the Joint Committee for Hospital Accreditation, who then demanded that Puerto Rican hospitals limit sterilizations to ten percent of all hospital deliveries in order to receive accreditation.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> The high popularity of sterilization continued into the 60s and 70s, during which the Puerto Rican government made the procedures available for free and reduced fees.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /> The effects of the sterilization and contraception campaigns of the 1900s in Puerto Rico are still felt in Puerto Rican cultural history today.<ref name= \"Lopez\" />\n\n======Controversy and opposing viewpoints======\nThere has been much debate and scholarly analysis concerning the legitimacy of choice given to Puerto Rican women with regards to sterilization, reproduction, and birth control, as well as with the ethics of economically motivated mass sterilization programs.\n\nSome scholars, such as Bonnie Mass<ref name=\"Mass\" /> and Iris Lopez,<ref name= \"Lopez\" /> have argued that the history and popularity of

governments and physicians as evidence of a mass sterilization campaign.<ref name= \"Lopez\" /><ref name=\"B\" /><ref name= \"Elena\" />\n\nOn the other side of the debate, scholars like Laura Briggs<ref name=\"Briggs\" /> have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass sterilization program.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /> She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.<ref name=\"Briggs\" />\n\n=====Effects=====\nWhen the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people.<ref

had the highest proportion of childbearing-aged persons sterilized in the world.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> In 1993, [[ethnographic]] work done in New York by [[anthropologist]] Iris Lopez<ref name= \"Lopez\" /> showed that the history of sterilization continued to effect the lives of Puerto Rican women even after they immigrated to the United States and lived there for generations.<ref name=

These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level. An especially egregious example, according to Amnesty International, has been occurring in Puning City, [[Guangdong Province]]. The sterilization drive in this city was in accordance with regulations outlined by the government in the Population and Family Planning Law of 2002.

According to the proposal, reparation was to be provided to persons who had undergone the intervention without their consent or who had consented to sterilization under coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} According to Margrith von Felten:\n{{cquote|The history of eugenics in Switzerland remains insufficiently explored. Research programmes are in progress. However, individual studies and facts are already available. For example:\n\nThe report of the Institute for the History of Medicine and Public Health \"Mental Disability and Sexuality. Legal sterilization in the [[Vaud]] Canton between 1928 and 1985\" points out that coercive sterilizations took place until the 1980s, it is unclear if the ethnographic impact has been duly investigated and if Hun-descendant French have been affected, as well as prehistoric human descendant communities. The act on coercive sterilizations of the Vaud Canton was the first law of this kind in the European context.\n\nHans Wolfgang Maier, head of the Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich pointed out in a report from the beginning of the century that 70% to 80% of [[abortion|terminations]] were linked to sterilization by doctors. In the period from 1929 to 1931, 480 women and 15 men were sterilized in Zurich in connection with termination.\n\nFollowing agreements between doctors and authorities such as the 1934 \"Directive For Surgical Sterilization\" of the Medical Association in Basle, eugenic indication to sterilization was recognized as admissible.\n\nA statistical evaluation of the sterilizations performed in the Basle women's hospital between 1920 and 1934 shows a remarkable increase in sterilizations for a psychiatric indication after 1929 and a steep increase in 1934, when a coercive sterilization act came into effect in nearby National Socialist Germany.\n\nA study by the Swiss Nursing School in Zurich, published in 1991, documents that 24 mentally disabled women aged between 17 and 25 years were sterilized between 1980 and 1987. Of these 24 sterilizations, just one took place at the young woman's request.\n\nHaving evaluated sources primarily from the 1930s (psychiatric files, official directives, court files, etc.), historians have documented that the requirement for free consent to sterilization was in most of cases not satisfied. Authorities obtained the \"[[Informed consent|consent]]\" required by the law partly by persuasion, and partly by enforcing it through coercion and threats. Thus the recipients of social benefits were threatened with removal of the benefits, women were exposed to a choice between placement in an institution or sterilization, and abortions were permitted only when women simultaneously consented to sterilization.\n\nMore than fifty years after ending the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany, in which racial murder, euthanasia and coerced sterilizations belonged to the political programme, it is clear that eugenics, with its idea of \"[[life unworthy of life]]\" and \"racial purity\" permeated even democratic countries. The idea that a \"healthy nation\" should be achieved through targeted medical/social measures was designed and politically implemented in many European countries and in the U.S.A in the first half of this century. It is a policy incomparable with the inconceivable horrors of the Nazi rule; yet it is clear that authorities and the medical community were guilty of the methods and measures applied, i.e. coerced sterilizations, prohibitions of marriages and child removals \u2013 serious violations of human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}}}\n\nSwitzerland refused, however, to vote a reparations Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Further|Eugenics in the United States|Sterilization law in the United States}}\n[[File:SOU 1929 14 Bet\u00e4nkande med f\u00f6rslag till steriliseringslag s 57 Laughlin.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A map from a 1929 Swedish royal commission report displays the U.S. states that had implemented sterilization legislation by then]]\n\nThe United States During the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of eugenics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 205\u201314| doi = 10.1177/096973300000700303 | pmid = 10986944 }}</ref> [[Thomas C.

First, its advocates accepted as axiomatic that a range of mental and physical handicaps\u2014blindness, deafness, and many forms of mental illness\u2014were largely, if not entirely, hereditary in cause. Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration.
