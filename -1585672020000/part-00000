With specialisations in a) Irish musical and cultural history, b) the music of the Austrian baroque composer Johann Joseph Fux, and c) the development of Anglo-American musicology since 1945, he is one of the most widely published and influential academics in his areas of research. White is also a poet, with two published collections of poetry (2012, 2018).\n\n==Education==\nHarry White was born in [[Dublin]] to Frank White (1926\u20132013) and Sheila, n\u00e9e Danaher (1928\u20131998), the joint eldest (with twin brother, John) of six children. He received his early musical training at the Municipal School of Music, Dublin and at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM), where he studied cello with Aisling Drury Byrne. He was a member of the Schola Cantorum at St Finian's College, [[Mullingar]] from 1971 to 1976. He took bachelor degrees in Music and English at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) in 1981 and wrote a master's thesis on the plays of [[Harold Pinter]]. He completed an MA in musicology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1984), where he was elected a Junior Fellow of [[Massey College, Toronto|Massey College]] in 1983. Returning to Dublin, he completed his PhD at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1986 with a thesis on the oratorios of [[Johann Joseph Fux]],<ref>Robin Elliott: \"White, Harry\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2013), see Bibliography.</ref> written under the supervision of [[Hormoz Farhat]].\n\n==Teaching appointments==\nAfter teaching for a year at St Patrick's College, Maynooth (today: [[Maynooth University]]), White was appointed lecturer in music in 1985 at UCD, where he succeeded Anthony Hughes as Professor of Music in 1993. He has held visiting professorships in musicology at the [[University of Western Ontario]] (1996), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] (1999), [[King's College, Cambridge]] (2005) and the [[University of Zagreb]] (2006, 2017), and he has given invited lectures and keynote addresses at conferences and symposia across North America and Europe.<ref>Robin Elliott (2013).</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\nWhite is \"an exceptionally productive scholar, whose work has been transformative. His monographs and edited volumes have been reviewed as being major works of scholarship\".<ref>Lorraine Byrne Bodley and Robin Elliott, introduction to ''Music Preferred. Essays in Musicology, Cultural History and Analysis in Honour of Harry White'' (Vienna: Hollitzer Verlag, 2018), p. 19; see Bibliography.</ref> In 1990, he established the ongoing book series ''Irish Musical Studies'', of which he is joint general editor with [[Gerard Gillen]]. In 1992, he instituted at UCD the first Irish taught master's degree in musicology.<ref>Robin Elliott (2013).</ref> In 1994, he was appointed a national advisory editor for the revised, 2001 edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians#Second edition|The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''; and in 1995 he co-organised (with Patrick Devine) the first major international musicological conference ever to be held in Ireland, at Maynooth.\n\nThe founding of the Society for Musicology in Ireland (SMI) is largely due to his vision and effort, and he served as its inaugural president from 2003 to 2006. Likewise, the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2 volumes, 2013) would have been unthinkable without White, who has argued for such a publication repeatedly from as early as 1989.<ref>\"The Case for an Encyclopedia of Music in Ireland\", in: ''The Irish Review'' vol. 6 (1989), pp. 39\u201345.</ref> He became its joint editor, with Barra Boydell.\n\nIn his many articles on Irish music and in three monographs \u2013 ''The Keeper's Recital'' (1998), ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (2005) and ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (2008) \u2013 he has shed new light on the central role of music in Irish cultural and intellectual life; for the last-named book he was awarded the Michael J. Durkan Prize from the American Conference for Irish Studies (ACIS).<ref> https://acisweb.org/durkan-prize-recipients/; retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref>\n\n==Honours received==\nIn 2006, White became the first historical musicologist to be elected to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] after [[Aloys Fleischmann]] (1966) and [[John Blacking]] (1983). Other honours include Fellowship of the RIAM (2007) and the first DMus awarded by the [[National University of Ireland]] for published work in musicology (2007). He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of St Cecilia (London). In acknowledgement of the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', both editors received the [[Frank Ll. Harrison|Harrison]] Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland in 2014. In 2015, he was elected to the [[Academia Europaea]], and in 2018 he was elected Corresponding Fellow of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the first Irish person to receive this honour.\n\nOn the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 2018, he was honoured with a ''[[festschrift]]'', edited by Lorraine Byrne Bodley with contributions from more than 40 authors that is a testimony to White's wide research interests and his impressive circle of academic friends across the globe.<ref> Lorraine Byrne Bodley (ed.): ''Music Preferred. Essays in Musicology, Cultural History and Analysis in Honour of Harry White'' (Vienna, 2018); see Bibliography.</ref> David Hiley wrote of it: \"This book is a fine tribute to a remarkable scholar. Not only has Harry White revealed unknown musical riches in Germany and Austria, he has set the music of Ireland in a clearer, truer perspective\".<ref>Quoted from the book jacket.</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe eloquent, expressive and often poetic style of Harry White's musicological writing finds a more artistic outlet in his poetry. As a master's student in Toronto, he had already won the university's gold medal for poetry in 1984. Two published volumes of his poetry have appeared to date: ''Polite Forms'' (2012) and ''The Kenmare Occurrences'' (2018). ''Polite Forms'' has been described as \"a sequence of poems that meditates on family life\" that \"remember and reimagine scenes from childhood and adolescence\"<ref>Publisher\u2019s information, http://carysfortpress.com/art-and-the-humanities-carysfort-press/polite-forms/, retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref> Of his second collection, a Canadian critic wrote: \"White's strength is to hold both speaker and listener at a distance that is a kind of proximity; the poems acknowledge that memory is flawed, baffling, and all we have to go on.\"<ref>Chantel Lavoie, Professor of English Literature, Royal Military College of Canada, on the reverse cover of the book.</ref>\n\n==Selected writings==\n===Monographs===\n* ''The Keeper's Recital: Music and Cultural History in Ireland, 1770\u20131970'' (Cork: Cork University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|1-85918-171-6}}.\n* ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85182-879-6}}.\n* ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|978-0-19-954732-6}}.\n* ''The Musical Discourse of Servitude.

With specialisations in a) Irish musical and cultural history, b) the music of the Austrian baroque composer Johann Joseph Fux, and c) the development of Anglo-American musicology since 1945, he is one of the most widely published and influential academics in his areas of research. White is also a poet, with two published collections of poetry (2012, 2018).\n\n==Education==\nHarry White was born in [[Dublin]] to Frank White (1926\u20132013) and Sheila, n\u00e9e Danaher (1928\u20131998), the joint eldest (with twin brother, John) of six children. He received his early musical training at the Municipal School of Music, Dublin and at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM), where he studied cello with Aisling Drury Byrne. He was a member of the Schola Cantorum at St Finian's College, [[Mullingar]] from 1971 to 1976. He took bachelor degrees in Music and English at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) in 1981 and wrote a master's thesis on the plays of [[Harold Pinter]]. He completed an MA in musicology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1984), where he was elected a Junior Fellow of [[Massey College, Toronto|Massey College]] in 1983. Returning to Dublin, he completed his PhD at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1986 with a thesis on the oratorios of [[Johann Joseph Fux]],<ref>Robin Elliott: \"White, Harry\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2013), see Bibliography.</ref> written under the supervision of [[Hormoz Farhat]].\n\n==Teaching appointments==\nAfter teaching for a year at St Patrick's College, Maynooth (today: [[Maynooth University]]), White was appointed lecturer in music in 1985 at UCD, where he succeeded Anthony Hughes as Professor of Music in 1993. He has held visiting professorships in musicology at the [[University of Western Ontario]] (1996), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] (1999), [[King's College, Cambridge]] (2005) and the [[University of Zagreb]] (2006, 2017), and he has given invited lectures and keynote addresses at conferences and symposia across North America and Europe.<ref>Robin Elliott (2013).</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\nWhite is \"an exceptionally productive scholar, whose work has been transformative. His monographs and edited volumes have been reviewed as being major works of scholarship\".<ref>Lorraine Byrne Bodley and Robin Elliott, introduction to ''Music Preferred. Essays in Musicology, Cultural History and Analysis in Honour of Harry White'' (Vienna: Hollitzer Verlag, 2018), p. 19; see Bibliography.</ref> In 1990, he established the ongoing book series ''Irish Musical Studies'', of which he is joint general editor with [[Gerard Gillen]]. In 1992, he instituted at UCD the first Irish taught master's degree in musicology.<ref>Robin Elliott (2013).</ref> In 1994, he was appointed a national advisory editor for the revised, 2001 edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians#Second edition|The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''; and in 1995 he co-organised (with Patrick Devine) the first major international musicological conference ever to be held in Ireland, at Maynooth.\n\nThe founding of the Society for Musicology in Ireland (SMI) is largely due to his vision and effort, and he served as its inaugural president from 2003 to 2006. Likewise, the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2 volumes, 2013) would have been unthinkable without White, who has argued for such a publication repeatedly from as early as 1989.<ref>\"The Case for an Encyclopedia of Music in Ireland\", in: ''The Irish Review'' vol. 6 (1989), pp. 39\u201345.</ref> He became its joint editor, with Barra Boydell.\n\nIn his many articles on Irish music and in three monographs \u2013 ''The Keeper's Recital'' (1998), ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (2005) and ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (2008) \u2013 he has shed new light on the central role of music in Irish cultural and intellectual life; for the last-named book he was awarded the Michael J. Durkan Prize from the American Conference for Irish Studies (ACIS).<ref> https://acisweb.org/durkan-prize-recipients/; retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref>\n\n==Honours received==\nIn 2006, White became the first historical musicologist to be elected to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] after [[Aloys Fleischmann]] (1966) and [[John Blacking]] (1983). Other honours include Fellowship of the RIAM (2007) and the first DMus awarded by the [[National University of Ireland]] for published work in musicology (2007). He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of St Cecilia (London). In acknowledgement of the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', both editors received the [[Frank Ll. Harrison|Harrison]] Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland in 2014. In 2015, he was elected to the [[Academia Europaea]], and in 2018 he was elected Corresponding Fellow of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the first Irish person to receive this honour.\n\nOn the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 2018, he was honoured with a ''[[festschrift]]'', edited by Lorraine Byrne Bodley with contributions from more than 40 authors that is a testimony to White's wide research interests and his impressive circle of academic friends across the globe.<ref> Lorraine Byrne Bodley (ed.): ''Music Preferred. Essays in Musicology, Cultural History and Analysis in Honour of Harry White'' (Vienna, 2018); see Bibliography.</ref> David Hiley wrote of it: \"This book is a fine tribute to a remarkable scholar. Not only has Harry White revealed unknown musical riches in Germany and Austria, he has set the music of Ireland in a clearer, truer perspective\".<ref>Quoted from the book jacket.</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe eloquent, expressive and often poetic style of Harry White's musicological writing finds a more artistic outlet in his poetry. As a master's student in Toronto, he had already won the university's gold medal for poetry in 1984. Two published volumes of his poetry have appeared to date: ''Polite Forms'' (2012) and ''The Kenmare Occurrences'' (2018). ''Polite Forms'' has been described as \"a sequence of poems that meditates on family life\" that \"remember and reimagine scenes from childhood and adolescence\"<ref>Publisher\u2019s information, http://carysfortpress.com/art-and-the-humanities-carysfort-press/polite-forms/, retrieved 31 March 2020.</ref> Of his second collection, a Canadian critic wrote: \"White's strength is to hold both speaker and listener at a distance that is a kind of proximity; the poems acknowledge that memory is flawed, baffling, and all we have to go on.\"<ref>Chantel Lavoie, Professor of English Literature, Royal Military College of Canada, on the reverse cover of the book.</ref>\n\n==Selected writings==\n===Monographs===\n* ''The Keeper's Recital: Music and Cultural History in Ireland, 1770\u20131970'' (Cork: Cork University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|1-85918-171-6}}.\n* ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85182-879-6}}.\n* ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|978-0-19-954732-6}}.\n* ''The Musical Discourse of Servitude.

Brennan, Jr.|Justice Brennan]] was joined by three other justices in asserting that the Eleventh Amendment was nothing more than a reflection of common law sovereignty that could be swept aside by Congress; [[Justice Scalia]] was also joined by three other justices in taking the opposite view; and Justice [[Byron White]] wrote a separate opinion holding that Congress had such power, but stating his disagreement with Brennan's opinion (but not his own rationale).\n\nNow, the Supreme Court was once again presented with the question of whether Congress has the power to abrogate the sovereign immunity of the states, pursuant to the powers granted to it in Article One.\n\n==Supreme Court==\n===Arguments===\n===Opinion of the Court===\n[[File:William Rehnquist.jpg |thumb |left |200px |alt=photograph of Chief Justice William Rehnquist|Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], author of the opinion]]\nThe Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], struck down this abrogation as unconstitutional and further held that the doctrine of ''Ex parte Young'' does not apply in this situation.\n\nThe Court began by repudiating the precedential value of ''Union Gas'', noting that there was no single majority rationale, and characterizing it as a major departure from the 19th century case of ''[[Hans v. Louisiana]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Hans v. Louisiana|volume=134|page=1|pin=|year=1890}}.</ref> which had established the modern doctrine of sovereign immunity. The Court suggested that allowing Congress to abrogate sovereign immunity improperly expanded the jurisdiction of the federal courts beyond what [[Article Three of the U.S. Constitution]] permitted. The Eleventh Amendment, it contended, had further protected the states' sovereign immunity; the Fourteenth Amendment placed limitations on the Eleventh Amendment, but only with respect to the rights guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Court also found that the doctrine of ''Ex parte Young'' did not apply, invoking the rationale of an earlier case, ''[[Schweiker v. Chilicky]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Schweiker v. Chilicky|volume=487|page=412|pin=|year=1988}}.</ref> for the proposition that where Congress had provided a remedial scheme, the Courts would not [[implied cause of action|imply]] the existence of additional remedies.\n\n===Dissenting Opinions===\n[[Justice Souter]] wrote a lengthy dissent in which he was joined by Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]]. Souter's dissent focuses on the language of the Eleventh Amendment, which only appears to eliminate [[diversity jurisdiction]] between states and citizens of ''other'' states. He rejects the \"critical errors\" in ''Hans'', which had read common law sovereign immunity to extend the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment to suits between states and their ''own'' citizens. Souter discounts the importance of the common law in interpreting the Constitution because the Constitution itself was such a new and unprecedented device at the time of its creation that it was clearly intended as a rejection of the common law that came before it. As support for this contention, Souter notes that the framers of the U.S. Constitution did not include language adopting the common law that had already been adopted by many of the states in their own constitutions. Souter also notes that Congress had rejected proposed language for the Eleventh Amendment which would clearly have barred suits between states and their own citizens, and which would clearly have prevented Congress from abrogating this bar.\n\nSouter also disagrees with the Court's rejection of ''Ex parte Young'', noting that where ''Chilicky'' was a rejection of the extra-statutory remedy proposed, ''Young'' was merely a jurisdictional device. Souter found it implausible that Congress would wish to see their statute made ''completely'' unenforceable simply because they had included a remedy for those injured by the failure of states to abide by it.\n\nJustice Stevens dissented separately, agreeing with the points raised in Souter's dissent, but adding some additional observations. In particular, Stevens noted that neither Justice Iredell's dissent in ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'',<ref name=Chisholm>{{ussc|name=Chisholm v. Georgia|link=|volume=2|page=419|pin=|year=1793|reporter=Dall.|reporter-volume=2}}.</ref> nor the majority opinion in ''Hans'' had addressed situations in which Congress had specifically authorized a lawsuit against a state and suggested that both opinions had in fact presumed that such a suit was possible.\n\n==Subsequent developments==\nThe decision in ''Seminole Tribe'' was described as having \"exemplified the Court's increasingly adamant refusal to countenance the headlong expansion of Congress's regulatory power under the Constitution's Commerce Clause\".<ref name=\"Waltenburg 121\">Eric N.

During the time of the murders, he remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\". His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Gacy had a troubled relationship with his father, and seldom received his approval. His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Gacy later recollected he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}} Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}}\n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments. These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. He worked in this role for three months before returning to Chicago.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}}\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n===Assault of Donald Voorhees===\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him. He can produce an 'alibi' for everything. He presents himself as a victim of circumstances and blames other people who are out to get him ... the patient attempts to assure a sympathetic response by depicting himself as being at the mercy of a hostile environment.\"''\n| source = Section of report detailing Gacy's 1968 psychiatric evaluation.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}}\n| width = 30em\n}}\nOn August 30, 1968, Gacy persuaded one of his employees, 18-year-old Russell Schroeder, to [[assault|physically assault]] Voorhees in an effort to discourage the boy from testifying against him at the upcoming trial. Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H. Stone 2019 pp. 196-203\">Michael H. Stone & Gary Brucato. The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 196-203.</ref>\n\nVoorhees managed to escape, and immediately reported the assault to the police, identifying Schroeder as his attacker. Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n===Conviction and imprisonment===\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death. When he heard the news, Gacy was said to have collapsed to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, and had to be supported by prison staff.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy requested supervised compassionate leave from prison to attend his father's funeral in Chicago, but his request was denied.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|page=92}}\n\n==Return to Chicago==\nGacy was granted parole with 12 months' probation on June 18, 1970, after serving 18 months of his 10-year sentence.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=63}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1986|p=47}} Two of the conditions of his probation were for Gacy to relocate to Chicago to live with his mother and to observe a 10 p.m. [[curfew]],{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} with the Iowa Board of Parole receiving regular updates as to his progress.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}}\n\nUpon his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane\u2014who picked him up from the prison upon release and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy's innocence\u2014that he would \"never go back to jail\" and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo. However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts. By 1978, the gross of PDM's annual turnover was over $200,000.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=221}}\n[[File:Johnwaynegacyrosalynncarter.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Gacy with First Lady [[Rosalynn Carter]] on May 6, 1978, six years after his first murder and seven months before his final arrest.|alt=]]\n====Democratic Party====\nGacy became active in local Democratic Party politics, initially offering the labor services of his employees to clean party headquarters for free.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=70}} He was rewarded for his community service by being appointed to serve upon the Norwood Park Township street lighting committee,{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}} subsequently earning the title of precinct captain.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} In 1975, Gacy was appointed director of Chicago's annual [[Polish Constitution Day Parade]]\u2014he supervised the annual event from 1975 until 1978.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\".

He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. At 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}}\n\nUpon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8 p.m. on December 11, Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and turned up several suspicious items: a 1975 [[Maine West High School]] class ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.,.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}}  various [[driver's license]]s, handcuffs, a [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with holes drilled in the ends, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]],{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} a [[syringe]], male clothing too small for Gacy, a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]] and a photo receipt from the pharmacy where Robert Piest worked. Police decided to confiscate Gacy's Oldsmobile, along with other PDM vehicles, and assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to follow Gacy, while they continued their investigation of Gacy regarding Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref>\n\nThe following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}} and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in various restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his use of recreational drugs. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11: the presence of the receipt indicated that Gacy must have been in contact with Robert Piest after the youth had left the Nisson Pharmacy on December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Detective [[Joseph R.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable since he had spent the previous evening on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders to construct this device to restrain his victims, and to dupe his victim into donning handcuffs, as several victims of the Houston Mass Murders had been.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18, Dr. Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner appointed to supervise the exhumation of the victims' bodies from Gacy's home, testified as to how he and his colleagues had conducted the recovery of the remains.

Rignall repeatedly wept as he recounted his ordeal. In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977.

As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

During the time of the murders, he remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\". His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Gacy had a troubled relationship with his father, and seldom received his approval. His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Gacy later recollected he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}} Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}}\n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments. These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. He worked in this role for three months before returning to Chicago.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}}\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n===Assault of Donald Voorhees===\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n===Conviction and imprisonment===\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

Less than three weeks later, on November 24, a 20-year-old [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]] resident, James Mazzara, disappeared after sharing Thanksgiving dinner with his family; his body was found on December 28. The cause of death in the case of Landingin was certified as suffocation through the youth's own underwear being lodged down his throat, plugging his airway{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=275}} and effectively causing him to drown in his own vomit.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=276}} Mazzara had been strangled with a ligature.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=225}}\n\n=====Murder of Robert Piest=====\n[[File:Piest1.jpg|200px|thumb|Robert Piest, whose abduction and murder ultimately led to Gacy's arrest and the discoveries upon his property.]]\nOn the afternoon of December 11, 1978, Gacy visited the Nisson Pharmacy in [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] to discuss a potential remodeling deal with store owner Phil Torf. While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}} Gacy murdered him at his house; he had been interrupted by a phone call from a business colleague while strangling him.\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police. Torf named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk with about a job.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 25-26</ref>\n\nGacy denied talking to Piest when Des Plaines police visited his home the following evening,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} indicating he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store. He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. At 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}}\n\nUpon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8 p.m. on December 11, Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and turned up several suspicious items: a 1975 [[Maine West High School]] class ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.,.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}}  various [[driver's license]]s, handcuffs, a [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with holes drilled in the ends, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]],{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} a [[syringe]], male clothing too small for Gacy, a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]] and a photo receipt from the pharmacy where Robert Piest worked. Police decided to confiscate Gacy's Oldsmobile, along with other PDM vehicles, and assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to follow Gacy, while they continued their investigation of Gacy regarding Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref>\n\nThe following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}} and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in various restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his use of recreational drugs. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11: the presence of the receipt indicated that Gacy must have been in contact with Robert Piest after the youth had left the Nisson Pharmacy on December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Detective [[Joseph R. Kozenczak]] as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. {{ISBN|978-1401095314}} p. 148</ref> Upon hearing this question, Rossi refused to continue the polygraph questioning, although he did discuss further his digging trenches in the crawl space and remarked upon Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nCram himself informed investigators of Gacy's attempts to rape him in 1976 and stated that after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale upon noting a clot of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable since he had spent the previous evening on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders to construct this device to restrain his victims, and to dupe his victim into donning handcuffs, as several victims of the Houston Mass Murders had been.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18, Dr. Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner appointed to supervise the exhumation of the victims' bodies from Gacy's home, testified as to how he and his colleagues had conducted the recovery of the remains.

Rignall repeatedly wept as he recounted his ordeal. In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims. Gacy neither confirmed nor denied Ressler's suspicions.{{efn|Gacy is known to have given Ressler a painting with a written inscription reading: \"Dear Bob Ressler, You cannot hope to enjoy the harvest, without first laboring in the fields\".<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} p 343</ref>}}\n\nJeffrey Rignall, who had been assaulted and tortured by Gacy in March 1978, was adamant that at one point during his abuse and torture, a young man with brown hair, kneeling before him, watched his abuse.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=209}} When this youth realized Rignall had regained consciousness, he was again chloroformed into unconsciousness. Rignall also informed police that as Gacy was raping and assaulting him, a light was switched on in another part of the house.<ref name=\"google2963\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19790101&id=PEEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v80EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2963,232748|title=Herald-Journal \u2013 Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, on one occasion during the surveillance of Gacy prior to his arrest, two of the surveillance officers followed Gacy to a bar to which Gacy had driven to meet two of his employees. At the bar, the surveillance officers overheard a hushed conversation between Gacy and one of his employees in which the youth asked Gacy the question: \"And what? Buried like the other five?\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}}\n\nIn interviews following his arrest and conviction, Gacy repeatedly claimed that he was not present in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In one interview, he stated that at the time of his arrest, four PDM employees were also considered suspects in the disappearances of the missing individuals investigators had linked to Gacy\u2014all of whom he stated were in possession of keys to his house.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp=341\u2013342</ref> One of these employees was Philip Paske, a young man who is known to have been a close associate of John Norman.

To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared.

It was founded in 1886 by [[David Bancroft Johnson]], who served as the superintendent of [[Columbia, South Carolina]], schools. He received a $1,500 grant from [[Robert Charles Winthrop]], a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] philanthropist and chair of the [[Peabody, MA|Peabody Education Board]] in Massachusetts. The school was originally established in Columbia to educate young women to teach in the [[School district|public schools]].\n\nWinthrop has developed into a university offering undergraduate and graduate degrees through five colleges and schools. It has enrollment of about 6,000 students.  The majority of Winthrop's students are from South Carolina, with out-of-state and foreign students accounting for 13% of undergraduate enrollment. The {{convert|100|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} main academic and residential campus is located in Rock Hill, {{convert|25|mi|km}} southwest of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and {{convert|71|mi|km}} north of Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nFielding athletic teams known as [[Winthrop Eagles]], the university participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) at the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level as a member of [[Big South Conference]]. The athletic program is known for its success in volleyball, basketball, soccer, and tennis.\n\n==History==\nWinthrop University was founded In 1886, when the Peabody Education Board of Massachusetts, headed by Robert C. Winthrop, provided $1,500 to form the \"Winthrop Training School\" for white women teachers. That year the school opened its doors to twenty-one students in Columbia, South Carolina. Nine years later in 1895 it moved to Rock Hill.  The school's name had changed in 1893 to \"Winthrop Normal and Industrial College of South Carolina\", reflecting its mission to prepare some students for industrial jobs.\n\nThe college was segregated until 1964. It became fully coeducational in 1974.  Evolving from a ''training school'' to a college with a four-year full curriculum, it also developed a graduate division.

It was founded in 1886 by [[David Bancroft Johnson]], who served as the superintendent of [[Columbia, South Carolina]], schools. He received a $1,500 grant from [[Robert Charles Winthrop]], a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] philanthropist and chair of the [[Peabody, MA|Peabody Education Board]] in Massachusetts. The school was originally established in Columbia to educate young women to teach in the [[School district|public schools]].\n\nWinthrop has developed into a university offering undergraduate and graduate degrees through five colleges and schools. It has enrollment of about 6,000 students.  The majority of Winthrop's students are from South Carolina, with out-of-state and foreign students accounting for 13% of undergraduate enrollment. The {{convert|100|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} main academic and residential campus is located in Rock Hill, {{convert|25|mi|km}} southwest of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and {{convert|71|mi|km}} north of Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nFielding athletic teams known as [[Winthrop Eagles]], the university participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) at the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level as a member of [[Big South Conference]]. The athletic program is known for its success in volleyball, basketball, soccer, and tennis.\n\n==History==\nWinthrop University was founded In 1886, when the Peabody Education Board of Massachusetts, headed by Robert C. Winthrop, provided $1,500 to form the \"Winthrop Training School\" for white women teachers. That year the school opened its doors to twenty-one students in Columbia, South Carolina. Nine years later in 1895 it moved to Rock Hill.  The school's name had changed in 1893 to \"Winthrop Normal and Industrial College of South Carolina\", reflecting its mission to prepare some students for industrial jobs.\n\nThe college was segregated until 1964. It became fully coeducational in 1974.  Evolving from a ''training school'' to a college with a four-year full curriculum, it also developed a graduate division. By 1992 it reflected this development, changing its name to Winthrop University.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.winthrop.edu/aboutus/secondary.aspx?id=31352#early |title=Winthrop University Chronology |accessdate=October 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907182545/http://www.winthrop.edu/aboutus/secondary.aspx?id=31352#early |archivedate=September 7, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Tillman Hall (Winthrop University).jpg|thumb|[[Tillman Hall]], built 1894|alt=|left|265x265px]]The university's campus is in the city of Rock Hill, South Carolina.

Kontoes also got the most assists for Panionios in the season 2010\u201311. Kontoes was listed as best Left Back in the starting 11 by [[Superleague Greece]] due to his consistent performances.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Panionios===\nWhen [[Panionios]] signed him, everybody in the club trusted him and he was ready to improve himself in order to meet the expectations of Panionios. He was rewarded for his efforts as Panionios fans loved him and his passion. So, the club decided to renew his contract with Kontoes. He was teammate of [[Grigoris Makos]]. Some years later, both of them played for [[AEK Athens]].\n\n===AEK Athens===\nOn August 1, 2011, Kontoes signed a three-year deal with [[AEK Athens]] on a free transfer keeping him at the club until 2014. Kontoes was a key target for AEK Athens as he is a versatile player who can play as right back, left back and centre back. He also had a very impressive season at Panionios and was named Panionios player of the year and MVP Left back in the [[Superleague Greece]]. Just before signing with AEK Athens, Panionios tried one last attempt on keeping Kontoes at Panionios and offered a higher contract than AEK Athens, however Kontoes declined the offer and signed with AEK Athens as he wanted to play in [[Europe]]an competitions and contend for the [[Superleague Greece]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=1355&n_id=6889 |title=AEK Athens sign Kontoes |access-date=1 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604111819/http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=1355&n_id=6889 |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Kontoes made his debut for AEK Athens in a 1-0 away win against [[Skoda Xanthi]]. Kontoes' second match of the season was against his former club [[Panionios]] where he received a lot of criticism from the fans as he left the club after 4 years and joined Athens rivals, AEK. Despite the criticism, Kontoes played a very solid game and was awarded the MVP award, the final score was a 1-0 away win for AEK Athens.\n\nKontoes became quickly very important for his team and for 2012-13 season he is expected to be one of the leaders in the \"yellow-black\" squad. He played mainly as a left back, but also and as a center back.

He was rewarded for his efforts as Panionios fans loved him and his passion. So, the club decided to renew his contract with Kontoes. He was teammate of [[Grigoris Makos]]. Some years later, both of them played for [[AEK Athens]].\n\n===AEK Athens===\nOn August 1, 2011, Kontoes signed a three-year deal with [[AEK Athens]] on a free transfer keeping him at the club until 2014. Kontoes was a key target for AEK Athens as he is a versatile player who can play as right back, left back and centre back. He also had a very impressive season at Panionios and was named Panionios player of the year and MVP Left back in the [[Superleague Greece]]. Just before signing with AEK Athens, Panionios tried one last attempt on keeping Kontoes at Panionios and offered a higher contract than AEK Athens, however Kontoes declined the offer and signed with AEK Athens as he wanted to play in [[Europe]]an competitions and contend for the [[Superleague Greece]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=1355&n_id=6889 |title=AEK Athens sign Kontoes |access-date=1 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604111819/http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=1355&n_id=6889 |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Kontoes made his debut for AEK Athens in a 1-0 away win against [[Skoda Xanthi]]. Kontoes' second match of the season was against his former club [[Panionios]] where he received a lot of criticism from the fans as he left the club after 4 years and joined Athens rivals, AEK. Despite the criticism, Kontoes played a very solid game and was awarded the MVP award, the final score was a 1-0 away win for AEK Athens.\n\nKontoes became quickly very important for his team and for 2012-13 season he is expected to be one of the leaders in the \"yellow-black\" squad.

The ridership was mostly middle-class white collar workers and shoppers, for the poor and working classes worked and shopped within their own neighborhoods{{fact|date=June 2019}}{{dubious|date=June 2019}} and seldom went to the upscale venues serviced by the trams.{{fact|date=June 2019}}{{dubious|date=June 2019}} City people were much less critical of electric tramways than of the horse-drawn versions.{{fact|date=June 2019}} They helped eradicate stinking environmental hazards.{{clarify|date=June 2019}}{{Fix|text=If you mean horseshit, say so.}} By the mid-1910s, the urban population were fully accustomed to trams as a fashionable mode of transport for work and leisure, and as a very positive and visual sign of the prosperity and prestige of the city. Visitors from the farms, villages and small towns sometimes made a trip on the tram a high priority when they came to the big city.<ref>Barbara Schmucki,  \"The machine in the city: public appropriation of the tramway in Britain and Germany, 1870\u20131915.\" ''Journal of Urban History'' 38.6 (2012): 1060-1093.</ref>\n\n[[File:No 3001 Manchester Metrolink tram.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Manchester Metrolink]]\n[[File:Altstadtstrecke Stra\u00dfenbahn, Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Trams in Frankfurt am Main]], Germany]] \nMany tramways closed in the mid 20th century, as they were seen as less effective in terms of costs and use of the roadway than other forms of street transport. However in recent decades tram networks in many countries in Europe have grown considerably. The Netherlands, which already makes extensive use of trams, has plans to expand tram services to two additional cities.<ref>{{cite news |author=Edo Sturm |title=Steden willen weer terug naar de tram |url=http://www.trouw.nl/hetnieuws/economie/article915101.ece/Steden_willen_weer_terug_naar_de_tram |work=Trouw |location=Netherlands |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2008 |language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nIn Germany, many cities retain their original tram networks. In some places, tram networks have been added or expanded through the introduction of hybrid [[tram-train]] or [[stadtbahn]] systems which may combine standard railway, on-street and underground operations. Notable examples are the systems in [[Cologne Stadtbahn|Cologne]] and [[Stadtbahn Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe]]. In Frankfurt-am-Main, many [[Trams in Frankfurt am Main|tram lines]] were transferred to [[Frankfurt U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] operation.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, investment in public transport in the late 1980s turned to light rail as an alternative to more costly [[Rapid transit|underground railway]] solutions, with the opening of the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] in Newcastle (1980) and the [[Docklands Light Railway]] in London (1987) systems. However, the first British city to reintroduce on-street trams was [[Manchester]], with the opening of its [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] network in 1992.<ref name=\"docherty\">{{cite book|last1=Docherty|first1=Iain|last2=Shaw|first2=Jon|title=A New Deal for Transport?: The UK's Struggle with the Sustainable Transport Agenda|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/newdealfortransp0000unse/page/138 138]|isbn=978-1-4051-0631-3|url=https://archive.org/details/newdealfortransp0000unse/page/138}}</ref> Several other UK cities followed with their own modern tram systems, including Sheffield ([[Supertram (Sheffield)|Supertram]], opened 1994), Birmingham and Wolverhampton ([[Midland Metro]], opened 1999), London ([[Tramlink]], opened 2000, albeit in a small part of Greater London), Nottingham ([[Nottingham Express Transit]], opened 2004) and Edinburgh ([[Edinburgh Trams]], opened 2014).

Industrial freight use of city tram lines was a widespread practice until the 1960s but has since mostly disappeared. Another factor is an increasing replacement of trams with trolleybuses as cities face a rapid increase in traffic, and such replacement often allows more of the roadway to be used by cars. One of the exceptions is [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], where the last trolleybus line was closed in the year 1995 due to high maintenance costs, and replaced with buses. Czech [[CKD Tatra|\u010cKD Tatra]] and the Hungarian [[Ganz]] factories were notable manufacturers of trams.\n\n=== Austria ===\n\n[[File:Ivb streetcar-303.jpg|150px|left|thumb|A tram in Innsbruck]]\nIn [[Austria]], [[Gmunden]], [[Graz]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Linz]] and [[Vienna]] all have tramway systems.

Tramways begun to reappear in the 1980s, before once again becoming a modern means of public transport in the 1990s. Popular notions of fashion have been used by scholars to explain this cycle of acceptance rejection and restoration.\n\nGermany (where tramways are referred to as ''Stra\u00dfenbahn'', meaning ''street railway'') is notable for its large numbers of extensive tram systems, although even in this country many systems were closed after the [[Second World War]], such as the tramway in [[Hamburg]] which last ran in 1978. Following the renaissance of trams in France and positive experience with [[tram-train]] and similar concepts (e.g. the [[Karlsruhe model]]), most German tramways are expanding, including new systems in cities that had previously abandoned them or entirely new systems in cities without any tram history.\n\n==== Light rail in Germany ====\n{{Details|Stadtbahn}}\n''Stadtbahn'', literally ''city railway'' in the [[German language]], is the term for light rail in Germany and is the predecessor of the North American light rail. Most German light rail systems were started in the 1960s and 1970s with the intention of establishing full-scale underground, or [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] (short for Untergrundbahn) systems. By the 1980s virtually all cities had abandoned these plans due to the high costs of converting tramways, and the most common systems are a mixture of tramway-like operations in suburban areas, with U-Bahn style operation, featuring underground stations, in the city centre areas..\n\n=== Greece ===\n[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 26 Tram.jpg|thumb|235px|Tram in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].]]\n\n{{details|Transport in Greece}}\nTrams were the main mode of mass transportation in [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]] before [[World War II]].\n\nThe first [[Athens Tram|trams in Athens]] begun operating in 1882. They were light vehicles drawn by three horses running on an extensive network throughout the city centre and a line reaching the suburb of Faliro. After the German occupation the tramways begun to decline, with lines gradually abandoned and replaced by trolleybuses, considered more appropriate and agile for the urban environment at that time. It is frequently mentioned somehow poetically that \"The last bell of the Athens Tram rang on the midnight of October 16, 1960\".{{cn|date=June 2019}} The tram had been a trademark of Athens until that date, and it is still viewed nostalgically. One tram line was left in Perama, which remained in operation until April 1977. A modern tram line was installed for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], with vehicles designed by the famous Ferrari designer [[Sergio Pininfarina]]. There are three routes and 24&nbsp;km of tramlines, running from Syntagma Square to Eden Station, and from Peace & Friendship Stadium in [[Piraeus]] to [[Glyfada]] along the coast. Routes were extended by 0.7&nbsp;km from Glyfada to Voula in 2007, and will expand 2.5&nbsp;km further from Peace & Friendship Stadium to Piraeus centre by 2017.{{update after|2019|6|23|reason=has the line been expanded?}}\n\n=== Hungary ===\n{{Main|Transport in Hungary#Transport in cities}}\nThe Hungarian cities of [[Budapest]], [[Miskolc]], [[Debrecen]] and [[Szeged]] currently have tramways. The [[Trams in Budapest|Budapest network]], at 156&nbsp;km, is the backbone of the capital's transit system and is by far the most extensive in the country. \n\nHistorically, Hungary has had tramways in [[Sopron]] until 1923, [[P\u00e9cs]] until 1960, [[Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za]] until 1969 and [[Szombathely]] until 1974.\n\n=== Ireland ===\n[[File:Citadis dublin.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Luas]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].]]\n\n{{Main|Republic_of_Ireland#Transport}}\n\nReplacing a once-extensive network of [[Dublin tramways]] which closed in 1949, in 2004 the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] capital [[Dublin]] opened the first two lines of a new light-rail system known as [[Luas]], [[Irish language|Irish]] for \"speed\". It features on-street running in the city centre, but is considered a light-rail system as it runs along a dedicated right-of-way for much of its suburban route. Two [[Dublin Metro|light-metro]] lines fully segregated from traffic were planned to be built by 2014, but were cancelled due to the economic downturn.\n\nPlans also exist for light-rail systems in the cities of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], which had a modest system until the early 20th century, and [[Galway]].

When councils acquired these dilapidated systems, it was almost always cheaper to replace them with buses.

Tramways begun to reappear in the 1980s, before once again becoming a modern means of public transport in the 1990s. Popular notions of fashion have been used by scholars to explain this cycle of acceptance rejection and restoration.\n\nGermany (where tramways are referred to as ''Stra\u00dfenbahn'', meaning ''street railway'') is notable for its large numbers of extensive tram systems, although even in this country many systems were closed after the [[Second World War]], such as the tramway in [[Hamburg]] which last ran in 1978. Following the renaissance of trams in France and positive experience with [[tram-train]] and similar concepts (e.g. the [[Karlsruhe model]]), most German tramways are expanding, including new systems in cities that had previously abandoned them or entirely new systems in cities without any tram history.\n\n==== Light rail in Germany ====\n{{Details|Stadtbahn}}\n''Stadtbahn'', literally ''city railway'' in the [[German language]], is the term for light rail in Germany and is the predecessor of the North American light rail. Most German light rail systems were started in the 1960s and 1970s with the intention of establishing full-scale underground, or [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] (short for Untergrundbahn) systems. By the 1980s virtually all cities had abandoned these plans due to the high costs of converting tramways, and the most common systems are a mixture of tramway-like operations in suburban areas, with U-Bahn style operation, featuring underground stations, in the city centre areas..\n\n=== Greece ===\n[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 26 Tram.jpg|thumb|235px|Tram in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].]]\n\n{{details|Transport in Greece}}\nTrams were the main mode of mass transportation in [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]] before [[World War II]].\n\nThe first [[Athens Tram|trams in Athens]] begun operating in 1882. They were light vehicles drawn by three horses running on an extensive network throughout the city centre and a line reaching the suburb of Faliro. After the German occupation the tramways begun to decline, with lines gradually abandoned and replaced by trolleybuses, considered more appropriate and agile for the urban environment at that time. It is frequently mentioned somehow poetically that \"The last bell of the Athens Tram rang on the midnight of October 16, 1960\".{{cn|date=June 2019}} The tram had been a trademark of Athens until that date, and it is still viewed nostalgically. One tram line was left in Perama, which remained in operation until April 1977. A modern tram line was installed for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], with vehicles designed by the famous Ferrari designer [[Sergio Pininfarina]]. There are three routes and 24&nbsp;km of tramlines, running from Syntagma Square to Eden Station, and from Peace & Friendship Stadium in [[Piraeus]] to [[Glyfada]] along the coast. Routes were extended by 0.7&nbsp;km from Glyfada to Voula in 2007, and will expand 2.5&nbsp;km further from Peace & Friendship Stadium to Piraeus centre by 2017.{{update after|2019|6|23|reason=has the line been expanded?}}\n\n=== Hungary ===\n{{Main|Transport in Hungary#Transport in cities}}\nThe Hungarian cities of [[Budapest]], [[Miskolc]], [[Debrecen]] and [[Szeged]] currently have tramways. The [[Trams in Budapest|Budapest network]], at 156&nbsp;km, is the backbone of the capital's transit system and is by far the most extensive in the country. \n\nHistorically, Hungary has had tramways in [[Sopron]] until 1923, [[P\u00e9cs]] until 1960, [[Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za]] until 1969 and [[Szombathely]] until 1974.\n\n=== Ireland ===\n[[File:Citadis dublin.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Luas]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].]]\n\n{{Main|Republic_of_Ireland#Transport}}\n\nReplacing a once-extensive network of [[Dublin tramways]] which closed in 1949, in 2004 the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] capital [[Dublin]] opened the first two lines of a new light-rail system known as [[Luas]], [[Irish language|Irish]] for \"speed\". It features on-street running in the city centre, but is considered a light-rail system as it runs along a dedicated right-of-way for much of its suburban route. Two [[Dublin Metro|light-metro]] lines fully segregated from traffic were planned to be built by 2014, but were cancelled due to the economic downturn.\n\nPlans also exist for light-rail systems in the cities of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], which had a modest system until the early 20th century, and [[Galway]].

The tram, which was initially horse-drawn, got converted to steam in 1877. In 1888 the second electric tram system in the world was inaugurated in [[Vevey]], linking the city to [[Montreux]] and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chillon]]. By 1923, a total of 29 towns and cities in the country operated tram networks, and at 170km's in extension and operating beyond the country's borders into France, Geneva's tram network became Europe's largest system <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grand-geneve.org/chiffre-du-mois/50-km-pour-le-reseau-de-tramway|website=Grand Gen\u00e8ve|accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter WW2 and the introduction of buses and trolleybuses, many of the networks shrunk. Geneva lost all but one of its lines, and some cities closed their trams, including [[Fribourg]], [[Lausanne]], [[Lugano]], [[Biel/Bienne]], [[Luzern]], [[Vevey]], [[Montreux]], [[St. Gallen]], [[Schaffhausen]], or [[Zug]]. \n\nHowever, Switzerland is remarkable in that a few major cities kept their networks mostly intact until today. For example, although some of the tram lines extending beyond the city of [[Trams in Zurich|Zurich]] closed down, the vast majority of lines within the city did not suffer any closures. Similarly, [[Trams in Bern|Bern]] and [[Trams in Basel|Basel]] kept most if their tram lines intact.\n\nBecause, with the exception of Geneva and Lausanne, the country's major cities have not lost their tram systems,  Switzerland has not witnessed a major re-construction of trams as happened in the rest of Europe in the decades following the 1990s. The major exception is Geneva, where the system has been growing back again from the one line and 8km's that was left out of its original network, to 5 lines and 36km's. By the end of 2019, with the opening of line 17, the network had once again extended over the border to the French city of [[Annemasse]], with planned future extensions to over 50km's by 2026 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ge.ch/dossier/organiser-avenir-transports/developpement-du-reseau-tramway|website=Geneva cantonal government|accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref>.\n\n=== Turkey ===\n{{Main|Transport in Turkey}}\n{{See also|IETT}}\n[[File:Kadik\u00f6ymodadtrassenbahn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Recently revived historic tram line in [[Kadik\u00f6y]], [[Istanbul]]]]\n\nThe first tram line in [[Istanbul]] was constructed by Konstantin Karapano Efendi, and started operating on 31 July 1871 between the districts of Azapkapi and Ortak\u00f6y.

For example, one could travel by tram across northwest England, from [[Liverpool]] to [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] (approx. 43 miles) using connecting systems. Most UK systems were municipally owned. These had often been inherited from private sector operators, who had been granted limited-term leases and did not maintain their networks beyond bare necessities as the time for a forced handover approached. When councils acquired these dilapidated systems, it was almost always cheaper to replace them with buses. The 1931 Royal Commission on traffic argued that trams held up cars.<ref>[http://www.storyoflondon.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=123&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 London Trams and Trolleybuses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323215530/http://www.storyoflondon.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=123&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 |date=23 March 2010 }}.

After Muhammad meets with Abraham, he continues on to meet Allah without Gabriel. Allah tells Muhammad that his people must pray 50 times a day, but as Muhammad descends back to Earth, he meets Moses who tells Muhammad to go back to God and ask for fewer prayers because 50 is too many. Muhammad goes between Moses and God nine times, until the prayers are reduced to the five daily prayers, which God will reward tenfold.<ref>{{cite book|last1=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari volume VI: Muhammad at Mecca|date=1989|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0-88706-706-9}}</ref> That again, Moses told Muhammad to ask for even lesser but Muhammad felt ashamed and said that even with lesser prayer times, his followers might not even perform diligently and said he is thankful for the five.\n\n[[Al-Tabari]] is a classic and authentic source for Islamic research. His description of the Mi\u02bfraj is just as simplified as the description given above, which is where other narratives and hadiths of the Mi\u02bfraj stem from, as well as word of mouth. While this is the simplest description of the Mi\u02bfraj, others include more details about the prophets that Muhammad meets. In accounts written by Muslim, [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], [[Ibn Ishaq]], Ahmad b. Hanbal and others, physical descriptions of the prophets are given. [[Adam]] is described first as being Muhammad's father, which establishes a link between them as first and last prophets.<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{cite book|last1=Vuckovic|first1=Brooke Olsen|title=Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi\u02bfraj in the Formation of Islam|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96785-6}}</ref> Physical descriptions of Adam show him as tall and handsome with long hair. Idris, who is not mentioned as much as the other prophets Muhammad meets, is described as someone who was raised to a higher status by God. Joseph, is described as the most beautiful man who is like the moon. His presence in the Mi\u02bfraj is to show his popularity and how it relates to Muhammad's. Aaron is described as Muhammad's brother who is older and one of the most beautiful men that Muhammad had met. Again, the love for Aaron by his people relates to Muhammad and his people. Abraham is described with likeness to Muhammad in ways that illustrate him to be Muhammad's father. Jesus is usually linked to John the Baptist, who is not mentioned much. The physical descriptions of Jesus vary, but he is said to be tall with long hair and either red or white skin. Moses is different than the other prophets that Muhammad meets in that Moses stands as a point of difference rather than similarities.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nSome narratives also record events that preceded the heavenly ascent. Some scholars believe that the opening of Muhammad's chest was a cleansing ritual that purified Muhammad before he ascended into heaven. Muhammad's chest was opened up and water of Zamzam was poured on his heart giving him wisdom, belief, and other necessary characteristics to help him in his ascent. This purification is also seen in the trial of the drinks. It is debated when it took place\u2014before or after the ascent\u2014but either way it plays an important role in determining Muhammad's spiritual righteousness.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\n====Ibn \u2018Abbas' Primitive Version====\nIbn \u02bfAbbas' Primitive Version narrates all that Muhammad encounters throughout his journey through heaven. This includes seeing other angels, and seas of light, darkness, and fire. With Gabriel as his companion, Muhammad meets four key angels as he travels through the heavens. These angels are the Rooster angel (whose call influences all earthly roosters), [[Ishim (angel)#In Islam|Half-Fire Half-Snow angel]] (who provides an example of God's power to bring fire and ice in harmony), the [[Azrael|Angel of Death]] (who describes the process of death and the sorting of souls), and the [[Maalik|Guardian of Hellfire]] (who shows Muhammad what hell looks like). These four angels are met in the beginning of Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative. They are mentioned in other accounts of Muhammad's ascension, but they are not talked about with as much detail as Ibn \u02bfAbbas provides. As the narrative continues, Ibn Abbas focuses mostly on the angels that Muhammad meets rather than the prophets. There are rows of angels that Muhammad encounters throughout heaven, and he even meets certain deeply devoted angels called [[cherub]]im. These angels instill fear in Muhammad, but he later sees them as God's creation, and therefore not harmful. Other important details that Ibn \u2018Abbas adds to the narrative are the Heavenly Host Debate, the Final Verses of the Cow Chapter, and the Favor of the Prophets.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\">{{cite book|last1=Colby|first1=Frederick S|title=Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey: Tracing the Development of the Ibn 'Abbas Ascension Discourse|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7518-8}}</ref> These important topics help to outline the greater detail that Ibn \u2018Abbas uses in his Primitive Version.\n\nSome debates that Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative brings about have to do with his description of Muhammad's encounter with God. Ibn \u02bfAbbas illustrates God as [[Anthropomorphization|anthropomorphed]] being who touches and speaks to Muhammad as a human would. This is seen as an abomination and thus takes away Ibn \u02bfAbbas's authenticity. In an attempt to reestablish Ibn \u2018Abbas as authentic, it seems as though a translator added the descent of Muhammad and the meeting with the prophets. The narrative only briefly states the encounters with the prophets, and does so in a way that is in chronological order rather than the normal order usually seen in ascension narratives. Ibn \u02bfAbbas may have left out the meeting of the prophets and the encounter with Moses that led to the reduction of daily prayers because those events were already written elsewhere. Whether he included that in his original narrative or if it was added by a later translator is unknown, but often a point of contention when discussing Ibn \u2018Abbas's Primitive Version.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\"/>\n\n==Modern Muslim observance==\nThe ''Lailat al-Mi\u02bfraj'' ({{lang-ar|\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|ar|Lailatu 'l-Mi\u02bfr\u0101j}}), also known as ''Shab-e-Mi'raj'' ({{lang-bn|\u09b6\u09ac\u09c7 \u09ae\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u099c|\u0160obe Meraj}}, {{lang-fa|\u0634\u0628 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|fa|\u0160ab-e Mi'r\u00e2j}}) in Iran, [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], and ''Mira\u00e7 Kandili'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is the [[Muslim holidays|Muslim holiday]] celebrating the Isra and Mi\u02bfraj.

[[Adam]] is described first as being Muhammad's father, which establishes a link between them as first and last prophets.<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{cite book|last1=Vuckovic|first1=Brooke Olsen|title=Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi\u02bfraj in the Formation of Islam|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96785-6}}</ref> Physical descriptions of Adam show him as tall and handsome with long hair. Idris, who is not mentioned as much as the other prophets Muhammad meets, is described as someone who was raised to a higher status by God. Joseph, is described as the most beautiful man who is like the moon. His presence in the Mi\u02bfraj is to show his popularity and how it relates to Muhammad's. Aaron is described as Muhammad's brother who is older and one of the most beautiful men that Muhammad had met. Again, the love for Aaron by his people relates to Muhammad and his people. Abraham is described with likeness to Muhammad in ways that illustrate him to be Muhammad's father. Jesus is usually linked to John the Baptist, who is not mentioned much. The physical descriptions of Jesus vary, but he is said to be tall with long hair and either red or white skin. Moses is different than the other prophets that Muhammad meets in that Moses stands as a point of difference rather than similarities.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nSome narratives also record events that preceded the heavenly ascent. Some scholars believe that the opening of Muhammad's chest was a cleansing ritual that purified Muhammad before he ascended into heaven. Muhammad's chest was opened up and water of Zamzam was poured on his heart giving him wisdom, belief, and other necessary characteristics to help him in his ascent. This purification is also seen in the trial of the drinks. It is debated when it took place\u2014before or after the ascent\u2014but either way it plays an important role in determining Muhammad's spiritual righteousness.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\n====Ibn \u2018Abbas' Primitive Version====\nIbn \u02bfAbbas' Primitive Version narrates all that Muhammad encounters throughout his journey through heaven. This includes seeing other angels, and seas of light, darkness, and fire. With Gabriel as his companion, Muhammad meets four key angels as he travels through the heavens. These angels are the Rooster angel (whose call influences all earthly roosters), [[Ishim (angel)#In Islam|Half-Fire Half-Snow angel]] (who provides an example of God's power to bring fire and ice in harmony), the [[Azrael|Angel of Death]] (who describes the process of death and the sorting of souls), and the [[Maalik|Guardian of Hellfire]] (who shows Muhammad what hell looks like). These four angels are met in the beginning of Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative. They are mentioned in other accounts of Muhammad's ascension, but they are not talked about with as much detail as Ibn \u02bfAbbas provides. As the narrative continues, Ibn Abbas focuses mostly on the angels that Muhammad meets rather than the prophets. There are rows of angels that Muhammad encounters throughout heaven, and he even meets certain deeply devoted angels called [[cherub]]im. These angels instill fear in Muhammad, but he later sees them as God's creation, and therefore not harmful. Other important details that Ibn \u2018Abbas adds to the narrative are the Heavenly Host Debate, the Final Verses of the Cow Chapter, and the Favor of the Prophets.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\">{{cite book|last1=Colby|first1=Frederick S|title=Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey: Tracing the Development of the Ibn 'Abbas Ascension Discourse|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7518-8}}</ref> These important topics help to outline the greater detail that Ibn \u2018Abbas uses in his Primitive Version.\n\nSome debates that Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative brings about have to do with his description of Muhammad's encounter with God. Ibn \u02bfAbbas illustrates God as [[Anthropomorphization|anthropomorphed]] being who touches and speaks to Muhammad as a human would. This is seen as an abomination and thus takes away Ibn \u02bfAbbas's authenticity. In an attempt to reestablish Ibn \u2018Abbas as authentic, it seems as though a translator added the descent of Muhammad and the meeting with the prophets. The narrative only briefly states the encounters with the prophets, and does so in a way that is in chronological order rather than the normal order usually seen in ascension narratives. Ibn \u02bfAbbas may have left out the meeting of the prophets and the encounter with Moses that led to the reduction of daily prayers because those events were already written elsewhere. Whether he included that in his original narrative or if it was added by a later translator is unknown, but often a point of contention when discussing Ibn \u2018Abbas's Primitive Version.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\"/>\n\n==Modern Muslim observance==\nThe ''Lailat al-Mi\u02bfraj'' ({{lang-ar|\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|ar|Lailatu 'l-Mi\u02bfr\u0101j}}), also known as ''Shab-e-Mi'raj'' ({{lang-bn|\u09b6\u09ac\u09c7 \u09ae\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u099c|\u0160obe Meraj}}, {{lang-fa|\u0634\u0628 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|fa|\u0160ab-e Mi'r\u00e2j}}) in Iran, [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], and ''Mira\u00e7 Kandili'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is the [[Muslim holidays|Muslim holiday]] celebrating the Isra and Mi\u02bfraj. Some Muslims celebrate this event by offering optional prayers during this night, and in some Muslim countries, by illuminating cities with electric lights and candles. The celebrations around this day tend to focus on every Muslim who wants to celebrate it. Worshippers gather into mosques and perform prayer and supplication. Some people may pass their knowledge on to others by telling them the story on how Muhammad's heart was purified by the [[Gabriel|archangel Gabriel]], who filled him with knowledge and faith in preparation to enter the seven levels of heaven. After [[salah]], food and treats are served.<ref name=times/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/lailatalmiraj.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Religions \u2013 Islam: Lailat al Miraj|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0191/9101056.htm|title=WRMEA \u2013 Islam in America|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs}}</ref>\n\n[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to [[heaven]]. The exact date of the Journey is not clear, but is celebrated as though it took place before the [[Hegira]] and after Muhammad's visit to the people of [[Ta'if]]. It is considered by some to have happened just over a year before the Hijrah, on the 27th of [[Rajab]]; but this date is not always recognized. This date would correspond to the [[Julian calendar|Julian date]] of 26 February 621, or, if from the previous year, 8 March 620. In [[Twelver]] [[Iran]] for example, Rajab 27 is the day of Muhammad's first calling or ''Mab'as''. The al-Aqsa Mosque and surrounding area, marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven, is the third-holiest place on earth for Muslims.<ref name=\"BloomBlair2009\">{{cite book|author1=Jonathan M.

Furthermore, Roman general Titus and his Roman soldiers leveled the Second Temple in AD&nbsp;70, more than five centuries before this alleged night journey to Jerusalem took place. However, after the initially successful [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]], the Jewish population resettled in Jerusalem for a short period of time from 614\u2013630 and immediately started to restore the temple on the Temple Mount and build synagogues in Jerusalem.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem Today: What Future for the Peace Process?|last=Ghada|first=Karmi|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=115\u2013116}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the Byzantine Jews: A Microcosmos in the Thousand Year Empire|last=Kohen|first=Elli|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36|chapter=5}}</ref> Furthermore, after the Jewish population was expelled a second time from Jerusalem and shortly before Heraclius retook Jerusalem (630), a small Synagogue was already in place on the Temple Mount.

{"title_page": "Intellectual giftedness", "text_new": "{{redirect|Gifted}}\n\n'''Intellectual giftedness''' is an [[Intelligence|intellectual ability]] significantly higher than average. It is a characteristic of children, variously defined, that motivates differences in school programming. It is thought to persist as a trait into adult life, with various consequences studied in longitudinal studies of giftedness over the last century. There is no generally agreed definition of giftedness for either children or adults, but most school placement decisions and most longitudinal studies over the course of individual lives have followed people with [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]s in the top 2.5 percent of the population\u2014that is, IQs [[IQ classification#Giftedness|above 130]]. Definitions of giftedness also vary across cultures.\n\nThe various definitions of intellectual giftedness include either general high ability or specific abilities. For example, by some definitions an intellectually gifted person may have a striking talent for mathematics without equally strong language skills. In particular, the relationship between artistic ability or musical ability and the high academic ability usually associated with high IQ scores is still being explored, with some authors referring to all of those forms of high ability as \"giftedness\", while other authors distinguish \"giftedness\" from \"talent\". There is still much controversy and much research on the topic of how adult performance unfolds from trait differences in childhood, and what educational and other supports best help the development of adult giftedness.\n\n==Identification==\n===Overview===\nThe identification of giftedness first emerged after the development of IQ tests for school placement.<ref>{{cite book |title=IQ and Human Intelligence |last=Mackintosh |first=N.

This is critical because the social and emotional aspects of twice exceptionality are fundamentally important to the twice-exceptional individual's ability to achieve a well-adjusted life (Assouline, Nicpon, & Huber, 2006; Foley Nicpon, Doobay, & Assouline, 2010; Gardynik & McDonald, 2005; King, 2005; New, 2003). |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=McIntosh |first1=David E. |last2=Dixon |first2=Felicia A. |last3=Pierson |first3= Eric E. |title=Contemporary Intellectual Assessment: Theories, tests, and issues |edition=Third |editor1-last=Flanagan |editor1-first=Dawn P. |editor2-last=Harrison |editor2-first=Patti L. |chapter=Chapter 25: Use of Intelligence Tests in the Identification of Giftedness |location=New York (NY) |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=978-1-60918-995-2 |date=2012 |lay-url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED530599 |laydate=29 March 2014 |pages=623\u201342, 636 |quote=Although many would consider screening to be the crucial point in the identification process, predictive validity must be established between the screening procedure and the intellectual measure(s) used to ensure the accuracy and utility of the identification process.  |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the key role that gifted education programs in schools play in the identification of gifted individuals, both children and adults, it is worthwhile to examine how schools define the term \"gifted\".\n\n=== Definitions ===\nFor many years, psychometricians and psychologists, following in the footsteps of [[Lewis Terman]] in 1916, equated giftedness with high IQ.

Guilford]], and [[Louis Leon Thurstone]]) have argued that intellect cannot be expressed in such a unitary manner, and have suggested more multifaceted approaches to intelligence.\n\nResearch conducted in the 1980s and 1990s has provided data which support notions of multiple components to intelligence. This is particularly evident in the reexamination of \"giftedness\" by Sternberg and Davidson in their collection of articles ''Conceptions of Giftedness'' (1986; second edition 2005). The many different conceptions of giftedness presented, although distinct, are interrelated in several ways. Most of the investigators define giftedness in terms of multiple qualities, not all of which are intellectual. IQ scores are often viewed as inadequate measures of giftedness.<ref>{{cite book |title=Conceptions of Giftedness |editor1-last=Sternberg |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Davidson |editor2-first=Janet E. |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-54730-7 |lay-url=http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521547307 |laydate=18 July 2010 |ref=harv}} This review of contemporary research includes chapters by James Borland, Linda E.

Mayer.</ref> [[Motivation]], high [[self-concept]], and [[creativity]] are key qualities in many of these broadened conceptions of giftedness.\n\n[[Joseph Renzulli]]'s (1978) \"three ring\" definition of giftedness is one frequently mentioned conceptualization of giftedness. Renzulli's definition, which defines gifted behaviors rather than gifted individuals, is composed of three components as follows: Gifted behavior consists of behaviors that reflect an interaction among three basic clusters of human traits\u2014above average ability, high levels of task commitment, and high levels of creativity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Renzulli |first=J. |title=What Makes Giftedness?

Persons who manifest or are capable of developing an interaction among the three clusters require a wide variety of educational opportunities and services that are not ordinarily provided through regular instructional programs.\n\nIn ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K.

Most states have a definition similar to that used in the State of Texas:\n\n{{Quote|\"gifted and talented student\" means a child or youth who performs at or shows the potential for performing at a remarkably high level of accomplishment when compared to others of the same age, experience, or environment, and who\n* exhibits high performance capability in an intellectual, creative, or artistic area;\n* possesses an unusual capacity for [[leadership]]; or\n* excels in a specific academic field.\" (74th legislature of the State of Texas, Chapter 29, Subchapter D, Section 29.121)}}\n\nThe major characteristics of these definitions are (a) the diversity of areas in which performance may be exhibited (e.g., intellectual, creativity, artistic, leadership, academically), (b) the comparison with other groups (e.g., those in general education classrooms or of the same age, experience, or environment), and (c) the use of terms that imply a need for development of the gift (e.g., capability and potential).\n\nSince the late 90s, the development of the brain of people with high IQ scores has been shown to be different than the development of the brain of people with an average IQ scores.

Most educational professionals accept that no single criterion can be used in isolation to accurately identify a gifted child.\n\nOne of the criteria used in identification may be an IQ test score. Until the late 1960s, when \u201cgiftedness\u201d was defined by an IQ score, a school district simply set an arbitrary score (usually in the 130 range) and a student either did or did not \u201cmake the cut\u201d. It is no longer accepted today in academic circles; however, it's still used by many school districts because it is simple and not entirely without merit.

One frequently cited example of asynchronicity in early cognitive development is [[Albert Einstein]], who did not speak until the age of four, but whose later fluency and accomplishments belied this initial delay. Psychologist and cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]] theorized that, rather than viewing Einstein's (and other famously gifted late-talking individuals) adult accomplishments as existing distinct from, or in spite of, his early language deficits, and rather than viewing Einstein's lingual delay itself as a \"[[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]]\", it may be that Einstein's [[genius]] and his delay in speaking were developmentally intrinsic to one another.<ref>{{cite web | author = Steven Pinker | title = His Brain Measured Up | url = http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html <!-- accessdate = 12/4/06 --> | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061211085927/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html | archivedate = 2006-12-11 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been said that gifted children may advance more quickly through [[developmental stage theories|stages]] established by post-Freudian [[developmental psychology|developmentalists]] such as [[Jean Piaget]].<ref>{{cite web | author = M.

(2003).''Handbook of Gifted Education.'' Boston: Pearson education, Inc.</ref> According to DMGT theory, \"one cannot become talented without first being gifted, or almost so\".<ref name=bcd>http://www.curriculumsupport.education.nsw.gov.au/policies/gats/assets/pdf/poldmgt2000rtcl.pdf</ref> There are six components that can interact in countless and unique ways that foster the process of moving from having natural abilities (giftedness) to systematically developed skills.\n\nThese components consist of the ''gift'' (G) itself, ''chance'' (C), ''environmental catalyst'' (EC), ''intrapersonal catalyst'' (IC), ''learning/practice'' (LP) and the outcome of ''talent'' (T).<ref name=bcd /> It is important to know that (C), (IC), and (EC) can facilitate but can also hinder the learning and training of becoming talented. The learning/practice is the moderator. It is through the interactions, both environmental and intrapersonal that influence the process of learning and practice along with/without chance that natural abilities are transformed into talents.\n\n== Multiple intelligences theory ==\n{{Main|Theory of multiple intelligences}}\nMultiple intelligences has been associated with giftedness or [[overachievement]] of some developmental areas (Colangelo, 2003).<ref name=\"Colangelo, N. 2003\">{{cite book |title=Handbook of Gifted Education. |last=Colangelo |first=N. |date=2003 |edition=third|publisher=Allyn & Bacon |isbn=978-0205340637 |url=http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Resources_id_12343.aspx}}</ref> Multiple intelligences has been described as an attitude towards learning, instead of techniques or strategies (Cason, 2001).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Renzulli |first=J. |title=Evaluation of a Preschool Nutrition Education Program Based on the Theory of multiple Intelligences |journal=Journal of Nutrition Education |volume=33 |number=3 |pages=161\u2013166|date=May 2001 |pmid=11953232|doi=10.1016/S1499-4046(06)60186-3 }}</ref>\n\n[[Howard Gardner]] proposed in ''Frames of Mind'' (Gardner 1983/1994) that intellectual giftedness may be present in areas other than the typical intellectual realm. The concept of multiple intelligences (MI) makes the field aware of additional potential strengths and proposes a variety of curricular methods. Gardner argued that there are eight intelligences, or different areas in which people assimilate or learn about the world around them: interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, naturalistic, and spatial-visual.<ref name=\"Gilman\">{{cite web|last=Gilman |first=Lynn |title=The Theory of Multiple Intelligences |year=2012 |origyear=2008 |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/mitheory.shtml |publisher=Indiana University |accessdate=14 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125220607/http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/mitheory.shtml |archivedate=25 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe most common criticism of Gardner's MI theory is \"the belief by scholars that each of the seven multiple intelligences is in fact a cognitive style rather than a stand-alone construct\". Others consider the theory not to be sufficiently [[Empirical evidence|empirical]].<ref name=\"Gilman\"/> This perspective has also been criticized on the grounds that it is ''[[ad hoc]]'': that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word \"intelligence\", but rather denies the existence of [[intelligence]] as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word \"intelligence\" where other people have traditionally used words like \"ability\" and \"[[aptitude]]\".\n\nIdentification of gifted students with MI is a challenge since there is no simple test to give to determine giftedness of MI. Assessing by observation is potentially most accurate, but potentially highly subjective. MI theory can be applied to not only gifted students, but it can be a lens through which all students can be assessed. This more global perspective may lead to more child-centered instruction and meet the needs of a greater number of children (Colangelo, 2003).<ref name=\"Colangelo, N. 2003\"/>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nGenerally, gifted or advanced students learn more quickly, deeply, and broadly than their peers. They may learn to read early and progress at the same level as normal children who are significantly older. Gifted students also tend to demonstrate high reasoning ability, [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], a large [[vocabulary]], and an excellent [[memory]]. They can often master concepts with few repetitions. They may also be [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]]ic, and frequently question authority. Some have trouble relating to or communicating with their peers because of disparities in vocabulary size (especially in the early years), personality, interests, and [[motivation]]. As children, they may prefer the company of older children or adults.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title =Characteristics of Gifted/Creative Children\n  | website =\n  | date =\n  | url =http://www.nfgcc.org/character.htm\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =2007-07-03}}</ref> Teachers may notice that gifted students tend to hover around them more than the other students. This is because gifted students sometimes do not think that they can relate to the students their own age, so they try and communicate with the teacher.\n\nGiftedness is frequently not evenly distributed throughout all intellectual spheres. One gifted student may excel in solving logic problems yet be a poor speller. Another may be able to read and write at a far above-average level yet have trouble with mathematics.\n\nIt is possible that there are different types of giftedness with their own unique features, just as there are different types of developmental delay.\n\nGiftedness may become noticeable in individuals at different points of development. While early development (i.e. speaking or reading at a very young age) usually comes with giftedness, it is not a determinant factor of giftedness.\n\n== Savantism ==\n[[Savantism|Savant]]s are individuals who perform exceptionally in a single field of learning. More often savant and savantism describes people with a single field of learning well beyond what is considered normal, even among the gifted community.

Teachers expectations of their students\u2019 academic performance influences how students perceive themselves. If a teacher expects more success academically from specific students, those students are prone to displaying behavior and work ethic that will set them apart from others in a positive light. Whereas if a teacher only expects bare minimum from his or her students, those students will merely do what is expected of them (Weinstein, 2002).<ref>Weinstein, R. S. (2002). Reaching higher: The power of expectations in schooling. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press.</ref>\n\nRacial minority students who are perceived as being disadvantaged from their peers in regards to socioeconomic status tend to have less supportive relations with their teachers (Fitzpatrick, 2015).<ref>Fitzpatrick, C., C\u00f4t\u00e9-Lussier, C., Pagani, L.

Youth & Society, doi: 10.1177/0044118X13508962.</ref> Due to this lack of support, teachers do not expect these disadvantaged students to go above and beyond, therefore they are often overlooked when it's time for gifted and talented education program nominations. Research suggests that teacher expectancy bias can also be diminish by matching the racial demographics of students to that of teachers. Gershenson and colleagues (2016) found that non-Black teachers held low expectations of their black students specifically in relation to black male students and math. Whereas, Black teachers held high expectations to black male students in regards to math. This finding suggests that racial diversity in our educators is positive step toward diminishing teacher expectancy bias.<ref>Gershenson, S., Holt, S. B., & Papageorge, N. W. (2016).

The study aimed to prepare these racial minority students for college level academic work while attending high school.  With positive teacher attitudes toward students and greater teacher self-efficacy, the students who were once on track to being recommended for remedial classes where performing at advanced academic levels after 2 years of intervention. They were also more heavily involved in leadership roles at their high school.

The disabilities may include auditory processing weaknesses, sensory motor integration issues, visual perceptual difficulties, spatial disorientation, dyslexia, and attention deficits. Recognition of learning difficulties among the gifted is made extremely difficult by virtue of their ability to compensate. Among the signs that the student may be twice-exceptional are apparent inconsistencies between abilities and results, deficits in short-term memory and attention, and negative behaviors such as being sarcastic, negative, or aggressive.<ref>Shenfield, T.

It is encouraged by the fact that gifted individuals tend to be easily successful in much of what they do.\n\n''Healthy perfectionism'' refers to having high standards, a desire to achieve, conscientiousness, or high levels of responsibility. It is likely to be a virtue rather than a problem, even if gifted children may have difficulty with healthy perfectionism because they set standards that would be appropriate to their mental age (the level at which they think), but they cannot always meet them because they are bound to a younger body, or the social environment is restrictive. In such cases, outsiders may call some behavior perfectionism, while for the gifted this may be their standard. It has been said that perfectionism \"becomes desirable when it stimulates the healthy pursuit of excellence.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = W. D. | last2 = Mills | first2 = C. J. | year = 1996 | title = The Incidence of Perfectionism in Gifted Students | journal = Gifted Child Quarterly | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 194\u2013199 | doi=10.1177/001698629604000404}}</ref>\n\nSome believe that perfectionism can be unhealthy. ''Unhealthy perfectionism'' stems from equating one's worth as a human being to one's achievements, and the simultaneous belief that any work less than perfect is unacceptable and will lead to criticism. Because perfection in the majority of human activities is neither desirable, nor possible, this [[cognitive distortion]] creates self-doubt, performance anxiety and ultimately procrastination.\n\nThe unhealthy perfectionism can be triggered or further exaggerated by parents, siblings or classmates with good or ill intentions. Parents are usually proud and will extensively praise the gifted child. On the other hand, siblings, comrades and school bullies will generally become jealous of the intellectual ease of the gifted child and tease him or her about any minor imperfection in his or her work, strength, clothes, appearance, or behavior. Either approach\u2014positive reinforcement from parents, or negative reactions from siblings and comrades for minor flaws\u2014will push these kids into considering their worth to their peers as equal to their abilities and consider any imperfection as a serious defect in themselves. This unhealthy perfectionism can be further exaggerated when the child counter-attacks those who have mocked him with their own weapons, i.e. their lower abilities, thus creating disdain in himself for low or even average performance.\n\nThere are many theories that try to explain the correlation between perfectionism and giftedness. Perfectionism becomes a problem as it frustrates and inhibits achievements.\n\nD. E. Hamachek identified six specific, overlapping types of behavior associated with perfectionism. They include:<ref>Schuler, P. (2002). Perfectionism in Gifted Children and Adolescents. In M. Neihart, S. M. Reis, N. M. Robinson, & S. M. Moon (Eds.).

There is often a stark gap between the abilities of the gifted individual and their actual accomplishments. Many gifted students will perform extremely well on standardized or [[reasoning]] tests, only to fail a class exam. It is estimated that half of gifted children do not perform in school at a level that is up to their abilities. Studies of high school dropouts in the United States estimate that between 18% and 25% of the students who fail to graduate are gifted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Education of the Gifted and Talented|last=Davis|first=Gary A.|publisher=Pearson|year=2011|isbn=9780135056073|location=New Jersey|pages=287\u2013288}}</ref> This disparity can result from various factors, such as loss of interest in classes that are too easy or negative social consequences of being perceived as smart.<ref name=renzulli>Reis, S.

A gifted individual is less likely to be diagnosed with a learning disorder than a non-gifted classmate, as the gifted child can more readily compensate for their paucities. This masking effect is dealt with by understanding that a difference of one [[standard deviation]] between scores constitutes a learning disability even if all of the scores are above average. Assessments may also fail to identify some gifted students entirely because their underachieving behaviours keep them from being recognized as exceptional.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mofield|first=Emily|date=8 April 2019|title=Understanding Underachievement: Mindset, Perfectionism, and Achievement Attitudes Among Gifted Students.|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|volume=42|issue=2|pages=107\u2013134|doi=10.1177/0162353219836737}}</ref>\n\n{{citation needed span|date=July 2018|text=In addition, many gifted students may underachieve because they have grown to believe that because of their intelligence, things should always come easily to them, and thus may lag behind their non-gifted peers in the work ethic required to learn things that do not come immediately to them.}}These learners may move with relative ease through school and achieve high grades but they may never learn how to take risks, learn from failure, or develop resilience.

One apparently effective way to attempt to reverse underachievement in gifted children includes educating teachers to provide enrichment projects based on students\u2019 strengths and interests without attracting negative attention from peers. Other methods include matching the underachiever with an achieving role model, correcting skill deficiencies and ensuring that proper assessments are in place to identify all learning issues with underachieving students.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Education of the Gifted Learner|last=Davis|first=Gary A.|publisher=Pearson|year=2011|isbn=9780135056073|location=New Jersey|pages=320\u2013321}}</ref>\n\n===Depression===\nIt has been thought in the past that there is a correlation between giftedness and [[clinical depression|depression]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This is not an established research finding. As Reis and [[Joseph Renzulli|Renzulli]] mention, <blockquote>\nWith the exception of creatively gifted adolescents who are talented in writing or the visual arts, studies do not confirm that gifted individuals manifest significantly higher or lower rates or severity of depression than those for the general population.

It is a characteristic of children, variously defined, that motivates differences in school programming. It is thought to persist as a trait into adult life, with various consequences studied in longitudinal studies of giftedness over the last century. There is no generally agreed definition of giftedness for either children or adults, but most school placement decisions and most longitudinal studies over the course of individual lives have followed people with [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]s in the top two percent of the population\u2014that is, IQs [[IQ classification#Giftedness|above 130]]. Definitions of giftedness also vary across cultures.\n\nThe various definitions of intellectual giftedness include either general high ability or specific abilities. For example, by some definitions an intellectually gifted person may have a striking talent for mathematics without equally strong language skills. In particular, the relationship between artistic ability or musical ability and the high academic ability usually associated with high IQ scores is still being explored, with some authors referring to all of those forms of high ability as \"giftedness\", while other authors distinguish \"giftedness\" from \"talent\". There is still much controversy and much research on the topic of how adult performance unfolds from trait differences in childhood, and what educational and other supports best help the development of adult giftedness.\n\n==Identification==\n===Overview===\nThe identification of giftedness first emerged after the development of IQ tests for school placement.<ref>{{cite book |title=IQ and Human Intelligence |last=Mackintosh |first=N.

This is particularly evident in the reexamination of \"giftedness\" by Sternberg and Davidson in their collection of articles ''Conceptions of Giftedness'' (1986; second edition 2005). The many different conceptions of giftedness presented, although distinct, are interrelated in several ways. Most of the investigators define giftedness in terms of multiple qualities, not all of which are intellectual.

Renzulli's definition, which defines gifted behaviors rather than gifted individuals, is composed of three components as follows: Gifted behavior consists of behaviors that reflect an interaction among three basic clusters of human traits\u2014above average ability, high levels of task commitment, and high levels of creativity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Renzulli |first=J. |title=What Makes Giftedness?

Persons who manifest or are capable of developing an interaction among the three clusters require a wide variety of educational opportunities and services that are not ordinarily provided through regular instructional programs.\n\nIn ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K. Johnsen explains that gifted children all exhibit the potential for high performance in the areas included in the United States' federal definition of gifted and talented students:<ref name=Johnsen2011>{{cite book |last=Johnsen |first=Susan K. |title=Identifying Gifted Students: A Practical Guide |edition=2nd |date=May 2011 |location=Waco, Texas |publisher=Prufrock Press |isbn=978-1-59363-701-9 |url=http://www.prufrock.com/Identifying-Gifted-Students-A-Practical-Guide-2nd-ed-P899.aspx |accessdate=29 November 2014 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThere is a federal government statutory definition of gifted and talented students in the United States.\n\n{{Quote|The term \"gifted and talented\" when used in respect to students, children, or youth means students, children, or youth who give evidence of high performance capability in areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop such capabilities.\" (P.L. 103\u2013382, Title XIV, p. 388)}}\n\nThis definition has been adopted partially or completely by the majority of the individual states in the United States (which have the main responsibility for education policy as compared to the federal government). Most states have a definition similar to that used in the State of Texas:\n\n{{Quote|\"gifted and talented student\" means a child or youth who performs at or shows the potential for performing at a remarkably high level of accomplishment when compared to others of the same age, experience, or environment, and who\n* exhibits high performance capability in an intellectual, creative, or artistic area;\n* possesses an unusual capacity for [[leadership]]; or\n* excels in a specific academic field.\" (74th legislature of the State of Texas, Chapter 29, Subchapter D, Section 29.121)}}\n\nThe major characteristics of these definitions are (a) the diversity of areas in which performance may be exhibited (e.g., intellectual, creativity, artistic, leadership, academically), (b) the comparison with other groups (e.g., those in general education classrooms or of the same age, experience, or environment), and (c) the use of terms that imply a need for development of the gift (e.g., capability and potential).\n\nSince the late 90s, the development of the brain of people with high IQ scores has been shown to be different than the development of the brain of people with an average IQ scores. A longitudinal study over 6 years has shown that high-IQ children have a thinner cerebral cortex when young, which then grows quickly and becomes significantly thicker than the other children's by the time they became teenagers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shaw |first=P. |title=Intellectual ability and cortical development in children and adolescents. |journal=Nature |volume=400|issue=7084 |pages=676\u201379|date=March 2006 |ref=harv|bibcode=2006Natur.440..676S |doi=10.1038/nature04513 |pmid=16572172 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233291 }}</ref>\n\n=== Identification methods ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:small\" align=\"right\" summary=\"Sortable table showing actual I.Q. scores of twelve students on three different I.Q. tests, with students identified by pseudonyms in cited data source.\"\n|+ IQ scores can vary for the same person, so a person does not always belong to the same IQ score range each time the person is tested.

Most educational professionals accept that no single criterion can be used in isolation to accurately identify a gifted child.\n\nOne of the criteria used in identification may be an IQ test score. Until the late 1960s, when \u201cgiftedness\u201d was defined by an IQ score, a school district simply set an arbitrary score (usually in the 130 range) and a student either did or did not \u201cmake the cut\u201d. It is no longer accepted today in academic circles; however, it's still used by many school districts because it is simple and not entirely without merit.

Psychologist and cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]] theorized that, rather than viewing Einstein's (and other famously gifted late-talking individuals) adult accomplishments as existing distinct from, or in spite of, his early language deficits, and rather than viewing Einstein's lingual delay itself as a \"[[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]]\", it may be that Einstein's [[genius]] and his delay in speaking were developmentally intrinsic to one another.<ref>{{cite web | author = Steven Pinker | title = His Brain Measured Up | url = http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html <!-- accessdate = 12/4/06 --> | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061211085927/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1999_06_24_newyorktimes.html | archivedate = 2006-12-11 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been said that gifted children may advance more quickly through [[developmental stage theories|stages]] established by post-Freudian [[developmental psychology|developmentalists]] such as [[Jean Piaget]].<ref>{{cite web | author = M.

(2003).''Handbook of Gifted Education.'' Boston: Pearson education, Inc.</ref> According to DMGT theory, \"one cannot become talented without first being gifted, or almost so\".<ref name=bcd>http://www.curriculumsupport.education.nsw.gov.au/policies/gats/assets/pdf/poldmgt2000rtcl.pdf</ref> There are six components that can interact in countless and unique ways that foster the process of moving from having natural abilities (giftedness) to systematically developed skills.\n\nThese components consist of the ''gift'' (G) itself, ''chance'' (C), ''environmental catalyst'' (EC), ''intrapersonal catalyst'' (IC), ''learning/practice'' (LP) and the outcome of ''talent'' (T).<ref name=bcd /> It is important to know that (C), (IC), and (EC) can facilitate but can also hinder the learning and training of becoming talented. The learning/practice is the moderator. It is through the interactions, both environmental and intrapersonal that influence the process of learning and practice along with/without chance that natural abilities are transformed into talents.\n\n== Multiple intelligences theory ==\n{{Main|Theory of multiple intelligences}}\nMultiple intelligences has been associated with giftedness or [[overachievement]] of some developmental areas (Colangelo, 2003).<ref name=\"Colangelo, N. 2003\">{{cite book |title=Handbook of Gifted Education. |last=Colangelo |first=N. |date=2003 |edition=third|publisher=Allyn & Bacon |isbn=978-0205340637 |url=http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Resources_id_12343.aspx}}</ref> Multiple intelligences has been described as an attitude towards learning, instead of techniques or strategies (Cason, 2001).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Renzulli |first=J. |title=Evaluation of a Preschool Nutrition Education Program Based on the Theory of multiple Intelligences |journal=Journal of Nutrition Education |volume=33 |number=3 |pages=161\u2013166|date=May 2001 |pmid=11953232|doi=10.1016/S1499-4046(06)60186-3 }}</ref>\n\n[[Howard Gardner]] proposed in ''Frames of Mind'' (Gardner 1983/1994) that intellectual giftedness may be present in areas other than the typical intellectual realm. The concept of multiple intelligences (MI) makes the field aware of additional potential strengths and proposes a variety of curricular methods. Gardner argued that there are eight intelligences, or different areas in which people assimilate or learn about the world around them: interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, naturalistic, and spatial-visual.<ref name=\"Gilman\">{{cite web|last=Gilman |first=Lynn |title=The Theory of Multiple Intelligences |year=2012 |origyear=2008 |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/mitheory.shtml |publisher=Indiana University |accessdate=14 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125220607/http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/mitheory.shtml |archivedate=25 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe most common criticism of Gardner's MI theory is \"the belief by scholars that each of the seven multiple intelligences is in fact a cognitive style rather than a stand-alone construct\". Others consider the theory not to be sufficiently [[Empirical evidence|empirical]].<ref name=\"Gilman\"/> This perspective has also been criticized on the grounds that it is ''[[ad hoc]]'': that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word \"intelligence\", but rather denies the existence of [[intelligence]] as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word \"intelligence\" where other people have traditionally used words like \"ability\" and \"[[aptitude]]\".\n\nIdentification of gifted students with MI is a challenge since there is no simple test to give to determine giftedness of MI. Assessing by observation is potentially most accurate, but potentially highly subjective. MI theory can be applied to not only gifted students, but it can be a lens through which all students can be assessed. This more global perspective may lead to more child-centered instruction and meet the needs of a greater number of children (Colangelo, 2003).<ref name=\"Colangelo, N. 2003\"/>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nGenerally, gifted or advanced students learn more quickly, deeply, and broadly than their peers. They may learn to read early and progress at the same level as normal children who are significantly older. Gifted students also tend to demonstrate high reasoning ability, [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], a large [[vocabulary]], and an excellent [[memory]]. They can often master concepts with few repetitions. They may also be [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]]ic, and frequently question authority. Some have trouble relating to or communicating with their peers because of disparities in vocabulary size (especially in the early years), personality, interests, and [[motivation]]. As children, they may prefer the company of older children or adults.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title =Characteristics of Gifted/Creative Children\n  | website =\n  | date =\n  | url =http://www.nfgcc.org/character.htm\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =2007-07-03}}</ref> Teachers may notice that gifted students tend to hover around them more than the other students. This is because gifted students sometimes do not think that they can relate to the students their own age, so they try and communicate with the teacher.\n\nGiftedness is frequently not evenly distributed throughout all intellectual spheres. One gifted student may excel in solving logic problems yet be a poor speller. Another may be able to read and write at a far above-average level yet have trouble with mathematics.\n\nIt is possible that there are different types of giftedness with their own unique features, just as there are different types of developmental delay.\n\nGiftedness may become noticeable in individuals at different points of development. While early development (i.e. speaking or reading at a very young age) usually comes with giftedness, it is not a determinant factor of giftedness.\n\n== Savantism ==\n[[Savantism|Savant]]s are individuals who perform exceptionally in a single field of learning. More often savant and savantism describes people with a single field of learning well beyond what is considered normal, even among the gifted community. This is also labelled as \"idiot savant\", a term that has been mentioned as early as the eighteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weiner|first=Irving B.|title=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|last2=Craighead|first2=W.

Teachers expectations of their students\u2019 academic performance influences how students perceive themselves. If a teacher expects more success academically from specific students, those students are prone to displaying behavior and work ethic that will set them apart from others in a positive light. Whereas if a teacher only expects bare minimum from his or her students, those students will merely do what is expected of them (Weinstein, 2002).<ref>Weinstein, R. S. (2002).

Research suggests that teacher expectancy bias can also be diminish by matching the racial demographics of students to that of teachers. Gershenson and colleagues (2016) found that non-Black teachers held low expectations of their black students specifically in relation to black male students and math. Whereas, Black teachers held high expectations to black male students in regards to math. This finding suggests that racial diversity in our educators is positive step toward diminishing teacher expectancy bias.<ref>Gershenson, S., Holt, S. B., & Papageorge, N. W. (2016).

Recognition of learning difficulties among the gifted is made extremely difficult by virtue of their ability to compensate.

''Unhealthy perfectionism'' stems from equating one's worth as a human being to one's achievements, and the simultaneous belief that any work less than perfect is unacceptable and will lead to criticism. Because perfection in the majority of human activities is neither desirable, nor possible, this [[cognitive distortion]] creates self-doubt, performance anxiety and ultimately procrastination.\n\nThe unhealthy perfectionism can be triggered or further exaggerated by parents, siblings or classmates with good or ill intentions. Parents are usually proud and will extensively praise the gifted child. On the other hand, siblings, comrades and school bullies will generally become jealous of the intellectual ease of the gifted child and tease him or her about any minor imperfection in his or her work, strength, clothes, appearance, or behavior. Either approach\u2014positive reinforcement from parents, or negative reactions from siblings and comrades for minor flaws\u2014will push these kids into considering their worth to their peers as equal to their abilities and consider any imperfection as a serious defect in themselves. This unhealthy perfectionism can be further exaggerated when the child counter-attacks those who have mocked him with their own weapons, i.e. their lower abilities, thus creating disdain in himself for low or even average performance.\n\nThere are many theories that try to explain the correlation between perfectionism and giftedness. Perfectionism becomes a problem as it frustrates and inhibits achievements.\n\nD. E. Hamachek identified six specific, overlapping types of behavior associated with perfectionism. They include:<ref>Schuler, P. (2002). Perfectionism in Gifted Children and Adolescents. In M. Neihart, S. M. Reis, N. M. Robinson, & S. M. Moon (Eds.).

There is often a stark gap between the abilities of the gifted individual and their actual accomplishments. Many gifted students will perform extremely well on standardized or [[reasoning]] tests, only to fail a class exam. It is estimated that half of gifted children do not perform in school at a level that is up to their abilities. Studies of high school dropouts in the United States estimate that between 18% and 25% of the students who fail to graduate are gifted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Education of the Gifted and Talented|last=Davis|first=Gary A.|publisher=Pearson|year=2011|isbn=9780135056073|location=New Jersey|pages=287\u2013288}}</ref> This disparity can result from various factors, such as loss of interest in classes that are too easy or negative social consequences of being perceived as smart.<ref name=renzulli>Reis, S.

A gifted individual is less likely to be diagnosed with a learning disorder than a non-gifted classmate, as the gifted child can more readily compensate for their paucities. This masking effect is dealt with by understanding that a difference of one [[standard deviation]] between scores constitutes a learning disability even if all of the scores are above average. Assessments may also fail to identify some gifted students entirely because their underachieving behaviours keep them from being recognized as exceptional.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mofield|first=Emily|date=8 April 2019|title=Understanding Underachievement: Mindset, Perfectionism, and Achievement Attitudes Among Gifted Students.|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|volume=42|issue=2|pages=107\u2013134|doi=10.1177/0162353219836737}}</ref>\n\n{{citation needed span|date=July 2018|text=In addition, many gifted students may underachieve because they have grown to believe that because of their intelligence, things should always come easily to them, and thus may lag behind their non-gifted peers in the work ethic required to learn things that do not come immediately to them.}}These learners may move with relative ease through school and achieve high grades but they may never learn how to take risks, learn from failure, or develop resilience.

One apparently effective way to attempt to reverse underachievement in gifted children includes educating teachers to provide enrichment projects based on students\u2019 strengths and interests without attracting negative attention from peers. Other methods include matching the underachiever with an achieving role model, correcting skill deficiencies and ensuring that proper assessments are in place to identify all learning issues with underachieving students.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Education of the Gifted Learner|last=Davis|first=Gary A.|publisher=Pearson|year=2011|isbn=9780135056073|location=New Jersey|pages=320\u2013321}}</ref>\n\n===Depression===\nIt has been thought in the past that there is a correlation between giftedness and [[clinical depression|depression]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This is not an established research finding. As Reis and [[Joseph Renzulli|Renzulli]] mention, <blockquote>\nWith the exception of creatively gifted adolescents who are talented in writing or the visual arts, studies do not confirm that gifted individuals manifest significantly higher or lower rates or severity of depression than those for the general population. Gifted children's advanced cognitive abilities, social isolation, sensitivity, and uneven development may cause them to face some challenging social and emotional issues, but their problem-solving abilities, advanced social skills, moral reasoning, out-of-school interests, and satisfaction in achievement may help them to be more resilient.<ref name=renzulli />\n</blockquote>\n\nThere is also no research that points to suicide attempt rates being higher in gifted adolescents than other adolescents.<ref>Neihart, M.
