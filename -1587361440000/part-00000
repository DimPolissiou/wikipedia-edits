Rome then began a period characterized by internal struggles between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (aristocrats) and [[Plebs|plebeians]] (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, [[Volsci]], [[Aequi]], and [[Marsi]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=77}} After becoming master of [[Latium]], Rome led several wars (against the [[Gauls]], [[Osci]]-[[Samnites]] and the Greek colony of [[Taranto]], allied with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]]) whose result was the conquest of the [[Italian peninsula]], from the central area up to [[Magna Graecia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=79}}\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Balkans]], through the three [[Punic Wars]] (264\u2013146 BC) fought against the city of [[Carthage]] and the three [[Macedonian Wars]] (212\u2013168 BC) against [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-83}} The first [[Roman province]]s were established at this time: [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], [[Corsica et Sardinia|Sardinia and Corsica]], [[Hispania]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-85}}\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic.

Rome was confirmed as [[caput Mundi]], i.e. the capital of the world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period.

There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions \u2013 Britain, Spain, and North Africa \u2013 were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The [[Germanic tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\nEmperor [[Diocletian]] (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the [[Tetrarchy]] which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level:  whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed [[price controls]]  which did not last. He or Constantine regionalized the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie, Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in [[Nicomedia]]. In 296, he elevated [[Maximian]] to ''Augustus'' of the western half, where he ruled mostly from [[Mediolanum]] when not on the move.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}} In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in [[Trier]] and Licinius in [[Sirmium]] in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed two colleagues for themselves.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\n\n[[File:Piazza di porta san Paolo 102 2167.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Cestius|Pyramid of Caius Cestius]] and the [[Aurelian Walls]]]]\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306\u2013313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalizing the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325\u2013330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of [[Byzantium]] into his new residence, which however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; [[Constantinople]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] issued in the name of three emperors \u2013 Gratian, Valentinian II, and [[Theodosius I]] \u2013 with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] divided the empire into [[Western Roman Empire|a western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|an eastern]] part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] after the [[Siege of Milan]] in 402. During the 5th century, the emperors from the 430s mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, [[Sack of Rome (410)|was sacked in 410]] by the [[Visigoths]] led by [[Alaric I]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=115}} but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as art work in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450\u2013500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=117}} The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}} The decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443; and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatized.<ref>''Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present'', Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&nbsp;160\u2013179</ref> However, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. Population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, population dropped to 30,000, but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.<ref>''Rome, Profile of a City: 321\u20131308'', [[Richard Krautheimer]], p.&nbsp;165</ref> The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.<ref>''Rome, Urban History'', pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185</ref> The figure of 450,000\u2013500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.<ref>Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III</ref> Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Sack of Rome by Alaric - sacred vessels are brought to a church for safety (2nd of 2).jpg|thumb|right|15th-century illustration depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]] by the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]]]]\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the [[Pope]], was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] there.

Charles founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza]], the university of Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in [[Viterbo]], could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met, and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the [[conclave]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]], [[Caetani]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Conti di Segni|Conti]], nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}\n\n[[Pope Boniface VIII]], born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's [[universal domain]]; he proclaimed a crusade against the [[Colonna family]] and, in 1300, called for the first [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee of Christianity]], which brought millions of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} However, his hopes were crushed by the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who took him prisoner and killed him in [[Anagni]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377).{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, [[Cola di Rienzo]], came to power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of ''[[Tribune|Tribuno]]'', his reforms were rejected by the populace.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under [[Gregory XI]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[Western Schism]] (1377\u20131418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}\n[[File:Wolf-Dietrich-Klebeband St\u00e4dtebilder G 123 III.jpg|thumb|Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by [[Mario Cartaro]] shows the city's primary monuments.]]\n[[File:0 Castel et pont Sant'Angelo (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Castel Sant'Angelo]] or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.]]\n[[File:Fontana della Barcaccia restaurata, guardando verso Piazza Mignanelli.jpg|thumb|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1629]]\nIn 1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\nThis brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]],  to [[Pius II]], humanist and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo X]], who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]] moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the popes engaged the best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].\n[[File:Lingelbach Karneval in Rom 001a.jpg|thumb|[[Carnival]] in Rome, {{circa|1650}}]]\n\n[[File:View of the Piazza Navona, Rome LACMA 49.17.3.jpg|thumb|''A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome'', [[Hendrik Frans van Lint]], {{circa|1730}}]]\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.

The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II.\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The [[War of the League of Cognac]] caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]; in 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nBeginning with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}}\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]], [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798\u20131800), which was built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Papal States]] were restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]'s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed as a ''D\u00e9partement'']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]: first as ''D\u00e9partement du Tibre'' (1808\u20131810) and then as ''D\u00e9partement Rome'' (1810\u20131814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.\n\nIn 1849, [[Roman Republic (19th century)|a second Roman Republic]] was proclaimed during a year of [[revolutions in 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 with the temporary capital in [[Florence]]. That year Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. in 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself a [[prisoner in the Vatican]]. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223209/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |archivedate=8 March 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, not all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n[[File:Bombardamento di Roma.gif|thumb|right|Bombardment of Rome by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes, 1943]]\n\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], who led a [[March on Rome|march on the city]]. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city center in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cederna|first1=Antonio|title=Mussolini urbanista|date=1979|publisher=Laterza |location=Bari|pages=passim|language=Italian}}</ref> The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943 the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed by Anglo-American forces]], resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of whom another 1,500 died. Mussolini was arrested on July 25. On the date of the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an [[open city]]. It was liberated on June 4, 1944.\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"[[Italian economic miracle]]\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''la dolce vita'' (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''comune'' had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n=== EUR (Esposizione Universale Roma) ===\n\nThe EUR (initial designation R 42) is a residential and business area south of the city center. The region was originally selected in the 1930s as the venue of the 1942 World Fair, which [[Benito Mussolini]] planned to open to celebrate 20 years of [[fascism]]. The letters EUR means ''Esposizione Universale Roma''. The EUR was also designed to direct the expansion of the city to the southwest and the sea and to become a new urban centre in Rome. The final design was presented in 1939 but due to the [[Second World War]] the exhibition never happened and the works stopped in 1942. After the war, the unfinished facilities of the EUR were severely damaged. However, the authorities of Rome decided that the EUR could be the start of an urban business centre, and the unfinished buildings from the fascist era were completed in the 1950s and 1960s. Newer buildings were also built for the use of offices and governmental services, amid large gardens and parks. The EUR was almost fully completed for the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]].\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Mayor of Rome|City Council of Rome|Elections in Rome|Administrative subdivision of Rome}}\n\n===Local government===\nRome constitutes a ''[[comune|speciale]]'', named ''\"Roma Capitale\"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|title=Roma diventa Capitale|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205130517/http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy. It is governed by a mayor and a city council. The seat of the ''comune'' is the ''Palazzo Senatorio'' on the [[Capitoline Hill]], the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as ''\"Campidoglio\"'', the Italian name of the hill.\n\n====Administrative and historical subdivisions====\n[[File:Roma - Municipi numerata.png|thumb|The ''municipi'' of Rome]]\n[[File:Piazza della repubblica hdr.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Piazza della Repubblica, Rome]]]]\nSince 1972, the city has been divided into administrative areas, called ''municipi''  (sing.

Each ''municipio'' is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. The ''municipi'' frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city. The municipi were originally 20, then 19,<ref>In 1992 after a [[referendum]] the XIX Circoscrizione became the ''[[Comune]]'' of [[Fiumicino]]</ref> and in 2013, their number was reduced to 15.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roma, s\u00ec all'accorpamento dei municipi: il Consiglio li riduce da 19 a 15|url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml#|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Il Messaggero|date=11 March 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316064219/http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml|archivedate=16 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', all of which are located within the [[Aurelian Walls]] except [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]]. These originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The \"Rioni\" of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519060423/http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they again reached fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.\n\nA new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral, and there were no serious changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when Rome became the third capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874, a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] \u2013 in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city, the term \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').\n\n===Metropolitan and regional government===\nRome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old [[Province of Rome|province]], which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]]. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km2}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.\n\n===National government===\n[[File:Quirinale palazzo e obelico con dioscuri Roma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palazzo del Quirinale]], now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]]]\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nRome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber]] ({{lang-it|Tevere}}) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\nAlthough the city centre is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ravaglioli |first1=Armando |title=Roma anno 2750 ab Urbe condita |publisher=Tascabili Economici Newton |year=1997 |location=Rome |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-8183-670-3}}</ref> The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Satellite view of Rome 2001.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Rome]]\n[[File:Roma dall'aereo.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Rome]]\nThroughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city's  walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. The city's urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' (\"GRA\"), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}. Although when the ring was completed most parts of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], which lies along the Tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} beyond it.\n\nThe ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.\n\nAs a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, [[nature reserves]], and for agricultural use.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Rome}}\nRome has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |title=World Map of K\u00f6ppen\u2212Geiger Climate Classification |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906034159/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> with hot, dry summers and cool-mild, humid winters.\n\nIts average annual temperature is above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} at night.

A.H.M. Jones estimated the population at 650,000 in the mid-fifth century. The damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population had already started to decline from the late fourth century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire.<ref>Arnold HM Jones The Decline of the Ancient World, Lonmans, Green and Co. Ltd, London 1966</ref> According to Krautheimer it was still close to 800,000 in 400 AD; had declined to 500,000 by 452; and dwindled to perhaps 100,000 in 500 AD. After the Gothic Wars, 535\u2013552, the population may have dwindled temporarily to 30,000. During the pontificate of [[Pope Gregory I]] (590\u2013604), it may have reached 90,000, augmented by refugees.<ref>Richard Krautheimer, Rome, Profile of a City, 312-1308, 2000 p. 65 {{ISBN|0-691-04961-0}}</ref> Lancon estimates 500,000 based on the number of 'incisi' enrolled as eligible to receive bread, oil and wine rations; the number fell to 120,000 in the [[reform of 419]].<ref>Bernard Lancon, Rome in Late Antiquity, 2001 p. 14 {{ISBN|0-415-92976-8}}</ref> Neil Christie, citing free rations for the poorest, estimated 500,000 in the mid-fifth century and still a quarter of a million at the end of the century.<ref>Neil Christie, From Constantine to Charlemagne, An Archaeology of Italy 300-800 A.D. 2006 p. 61, {{ISBN|978-1-85928-421-6}}</ref> Novel 36 of Emperor [[Valentinian III]] records 3.629 million pounds of pork to be distributed to the needy at 5 lbs. per month for the five winter months, sufficient for 145,000 recipients. This has been used to suggest a population of just under 500,000. Supplies of grain remained steady until the seizure of the remaining provinces of North Africa in 439 by the [[Vandals]], and may have continued to some degree afterwards for a while. The city's population declined to less than 50,000 people in the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] from 700 AD onward. It continued to stagnate or shrink until the [[Renaissance]].<ref>P. Llewellyn, ''Rome in the Dark Ages'' (London 1993), p. 97.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 225,000. Less than half the city within the walls was built up in 1881 when the population recorded was 275,000. This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The [[Fascism|Fascist]] regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city, but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}{{clarify|why?|date=March 2014}} Population growth continued after the Second World War, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created many suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2&nbsp;million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> stretching over more than 5,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00% of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners).

Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other deities such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the Pope.\n[[File:Roma - 2016-05-23 - Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - 2957.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the four papal [[major basilica]]s and has numerous architectural styles, built between the 4th century and 1743]]\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Ges\u00f9]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].\n\nIn recent years, there has been growth in Rome's [[Muslim]] community, mainly due to immigration from North Africa and the Middle East into the city.{{clarify |date=June 2017 |reason= How many Muslim migrants came; how many are living in Rome today?}} As a result of this increase of the local practitioners of the [[Islam]]ic faith, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the [[Mosque of Rome]], which is the largest mosque in [[Western Europe]], designed by architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995. Since the end of the [[Roman Republic]], Rome is also the centre of an important [[Jewish]] community,<ref>Coarelli, p. 308.</ref> which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.\n\n===Vatican City===\n{{Main|Vatican City}}\n{{wide image|Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of St. Peter's Square|[[St. Peter's Square]] in Vatican City}}\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'' ([[Vatican Hill]]), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]], and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]].\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some parts of the border there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part a new wall was constructed.\n\nThe territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was designed by architects [[Marcello Piacentini|Piacentini]] and Spaccarelli, on the instructions of [[Benito Mussolini]] and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. According to the Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].\n\n===Pilgrimage===\n[[File:Petersdom bei Nacht Via della Conciliazione in Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|St. Peter's Basilica at night from [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome]]\nRome has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] site since the [[Middle Ages]]. People from all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major [[pilgrimage]] site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter.\n\nPilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate's stairs]]: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html|title=Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|date=2007-06-13|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2019-08-22|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople]] in the fourth century. For centuries, the ''Scala Santa'' has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honour the Passion of Jesus. Other objects of pilgrimage include several catacombs built in imperial times, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them [[San Luigi dei francesi]] and [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]]), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the [[Jesuit]] Churches of Jesus and Sant'Ignazio.\n\nTraditionally, pilgrims in Rome (as well as devout Romans) visit the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome|seven pilgrim churches]] ({{lang-it|Le sette chiese}}) in 24 hours. This custom, mandatory for each pilgrim in the Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint [[Philip Neri]]. The seven churches are the four major basilicas ([[Basilica of St Peter|St Peter in Vatican]], [[St Paul outside the Walls]], [[St John in Lateran]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]), while the other three are [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] (an [[Early Christian]] basilica), [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (a church founded by [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] (which lies on the [[Appian Way]] and is built above the [[Catacombs of San Sebastiano]]).\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in Rome|List of streets in Rome}}\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Rome|Churches of Rome}}\n[[File:ThePantheon.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], built as a temple dedicated to \"all the gods of the past, present and future\"]]\n[[File:Colosseo Romano Rome 04 2016 6289.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] is still today the largest [[amphitheater]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|title=Colosseum: The Largest Amphitheatre|work=Guinnesworldrecords.com|date=March 6, 2013|access-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027170257/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was used for [[gladiator]] shows and other public events (hunting shows, recreations of famous battles and dramas based on classical mythology).]]\n\nRome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of [[classical architecture]], developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].<ref name=\"Eyewitness\">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[neoclassical architecture]].<ref name=\"Eyewitness\"/>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\n{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}\nOne of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70\u201380 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the Roman Empire. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. A list of important monuments and sites of ancient Rome includes the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verit\u00e0]].\n\n====Medieval====\nThe medieval popular quarters of the city, situated mainly around the Capitol, were largely demolished between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still remain. Basilicas dating from the [[Early Christianity|Christian antiquity]] include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century AD mosaics. Notable later notable medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Secular buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next the Roman Forum, and the huge outdoor stairway  leading up to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]].\n\n====Renaissance and Baroque====\nRome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the Piazza del Campidoglio by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].\n\n{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with a copy of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]]}}\n\nMany of the famous city's squares \u2013 some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and picturesque \u2013 got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]] and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].\n\n====Neoclassicism====\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Altare della Patria]]]]\nIn 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]]. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or \"Altar of the Fatherland\", where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.\n\n====Fascist architecture====\n[[File:Palazzo della civilt\u00e0 del lavoro (EUR, Rome) (5904657870).jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]]]]\n{{See also|Fascist architecture}}\n\nThe Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome. Mussolini allowed the construction of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during the papal rule. The main activities during his government were: the \"isolation\" of the [[Capitoline Hill]]; Via dei Monti, later renamed Via del'Impero, and finally [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; Via del Mare, later renamed Via del [[Teatro di Marcello]]; the \"isolation\" of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore; [[Via della Conciliazione]].\n\nArchitecturally, Fascism favored the most modern movements, such as [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]]. Parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named \"Stile Novecento\", characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. One important construction in the latter style is the Foro Mussolini, now [[Foro Italico]], by [[Enrico Del Debbio]]. Next to it, the most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]]. This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento architects, the former being led by [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. The EUR was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called \"E.42\" (''\"Esposizione 42\"''). The most representative buildings of EUR are the [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]] (1938\u20131943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum, and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]], example of Rationalist style. The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during the fighting between Italian and German army after the armistice and later abandoned. The quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La D\u00e9fense]] in Paris). Also, the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]], in the gardens of the [[Villa Borghese]]]]\n{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archivedate=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |accessdate=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}. Also on the Gianicolo hill there is [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]], with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere the [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\"|Orto Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees, but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]] and [[Villa Medici]]. Noteworthy is also the Pine wood of [[Castelfusano]], near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n===Fountains and aqueducts===\n{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana di Trevi Rome 04 2016 6768.jpg|thumb|The [[Trevi Fountain]]. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].]]\nRome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.<ref>Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".<ref>''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', Helen Attlee. Francis Lincoln Limited, London 2006.</ref>\n\n===Statues===\n{{See also|Talking statues of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi Piazza Navona Rome 04 2016 6503.jpg|thumb|right|Fontana dei Fiumi by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], 1648]]\nRome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the [[talking statues of Rome]]. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n===Obelisks and columns===\n{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}\n[[File:Piazza del Popolo Obelisco Flaminio a Roma.jpg|thumb|An ancient Egyptian obelisk in [[Piazza del Popolo]]]]\n\nThe city hosts eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125357/http://initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |archivedate=6 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]]. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also [[Trajan's column|Trajan]]'s and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Antonine Column]], two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in [[Piazza Colonna]] and it was built around 180 AD by [[Commodus]] in memory of his parents.

According to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] in 1688.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |title=Sant'Angelo Bridge |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109154613/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |archivedate=9 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Catacombs===\n{{Main|Catacombs of Rome}}\n[[File:PiusXItomb2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vatican Necropolis|Vatican Caves]], the place where the popes of history are buried]]\nRome has extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute.

Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Rolland | first=Jacques | title=The food encyclopedia | publisher=Robert Rose | location=Toronto | year=2006 | isbn=0-7788-0150-0 | oclc=70176309 | page=273}}</ref> <br /> In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).<ref>{{cite book | title=Culinaria Italy | first=Claudia | last=Piras | publisher=Culinaria Konemann | year=2000 | isbn=3-8290-2901-2 | oclc=881159457 | page=291}}</ref> In parallel, Roman Jews \u2013 present in the city since the 1st century BC \u2013 developed their own cuisine, the ''cucina giudaico-romanesca''.

In the 1950s, Cinecitt\u00e0 was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today, Cinecitt\u00e0 is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walk out\" with a completed film.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}\n[[File:DM TI Claudius Tiberinus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Latin]] inscription, [[National Roman Museum]]]]\nAlthough associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome was in fact multilingual. In highest antiquity, [[Sabine]] tribes shared the area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes. The Sabine language was one of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] group of ancient Italian languages, along with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. Urganilla, or [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius' entry on Claudius. However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. Many educated Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.\n\n[[Latin]] evolved during the Middle Ages into a new language, the \"''volgare''\". The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. The ''Romanesco'' spoken during the Middle Ages was more like a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language]] in [[Campania]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] and others), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), [[Trilussa]] and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. It is worth remembering though that Romanesco was a \"''lingua vernacola''\"  (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.\n\nContemporary Romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors and actresses, such as [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Anna Magnani]]. [[Carlo Verdone]], [[Enrico Montesano]], [[Gigi Proietti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]].\n\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonization and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.<ref>Ostler, N. (2007), ''Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin''. London: HarperCollins</ref>\n\nRome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and many foreign religious students or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] and so has always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Stadio Olimpico 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]], home of [[A.S.

Lazio).\n\nEvery May, Rome hosts the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|ATP Masters Series]] tennis tournament on the clay courts of the [[Foro Italico]]. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the [[Giro d'Italia]] three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Rome is also home to other sports teams, including volleyball ([[M.

Rome's main railway station, [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]], is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day.

Several international [[Roman Colleges]] and [[Pontifical Universities in Rome|Pontifical Universities]] are located in Rome.\n\nThe Pope is the [[Bishop of Rome]] and its official seat is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]] (of which the [[President of the French Republic]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' the \"first and only [[Honorary canons|honorary canon]]\", a title held by the heads of the French state since [[King Henry IV of France]]). Another body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.\n\nRome is the seat of the so-called '''Polo Romano'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143221/http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|url-status=dead|title=parlamento.it|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> made up by three main international agencies of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], due the fact that the Italian government is the depositary of the treaties. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.\n\nRome is the seat of the [[European Olympic Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated.\n\nThe city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]] (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See

Rome then began a period characterized by internal struggles between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (aristocrats) and [[Plebs|plebeians]] (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, [[Volsci]], [[Aequi]], and [[Marsi]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=77}} After becoming master of [[Latium]], Rome led several wars (against the [[Gauls]], [[Osci]]-[[Samnites]] and the Greek colony of [[Taranto]], allied with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]]) whose result was the conquest of the [[Italian peninsula]], from the central area up to [[Magna Graecia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=79}}\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Balkans]], through the three [[Punic Wars]] (264\u2013146 BC) fought against the city of [[Carthage]] and the three [[Macedonian Wars]] (212\u2013168 BC) against [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-83}} The first [[Roman province]]s were established at this time: [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], [[Corsica et Sardinia|Sardinia and Corsica]], [[Hispania]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-85}}\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city.

Rome was confirmed as [[caput Mundi]], i.e. the capital of the world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire was ruled by emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] (who also built an eponymous amphitheatre, known as the [[Colosseum]]),{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} and [[Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] dynasties.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}} This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by [[Jesus Christ]] in [[Judea]] in the first half of the first century (under [[Tiberius]]) and popularized by his [[apostle]]s through the empire and beyond.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=107}} The Antonine age is considered the apogee of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Euphrates]] and from [[Great Britain|Britain]] to [[Egypt]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}}\n\n[[File:Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png|thumb|right|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD, approximately {{convert|6.5|e6km2|e6sqmi|1|abbr=off}}<ref>Parker, Philip, \"The Empire Stops Here\". p. 2.</ref> of land surface.]]\n[[File:Foro Romano Forum Romanum Roman Forum (8043630550).jpg|thumb|right|280px|The [[Roman Forum]] are the remains of those buildings that during most of Ancient Rome's time represented the political, legal, religious and economic center of the city and the neuralgic center of all the Roman civilization.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Roman Forum | website=Ancient History Encyclopedia | date=2012-01-18 | url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/26/the-roman-forum/ | access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>]]\n\nAfter the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into 50-year period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions \u2013 Britain, Spain, and North Africa \u2013 were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The [[Germanic tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\nEmperor [[Diocletian]] (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the [[Tetrarchy]] which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level:  whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed [[price controls]]  which did not last. He or Constantine regionalized the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie, Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in [[Nicomedia]]. In 296, he elevated [[Maximian]] to ''Augustus'' of the western half, where he ruled mostly from [[Mediolanum]] when not on the move.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}} In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in [[Trier]] and Licinius in [[Sirmium]] in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed two colleagues for themselves.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\n\n[[File:Piazza di porta san Paolo 102 2167.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Cestius|Pyramid of Caius Cestius]] and the [[Aurelian Walls]]]]\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306\u2013313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalizing the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325\u2013330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of [[Byzantium]] into his new residence, which however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; [[Constantinople]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] issued in the name of three emperors \u2013 Gratian, Valentinian II, and [[Theodosius I]] \u2013 with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] divided the empire into [[Western Roman Empire|a western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|an eastern]] part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] after the [[Siege of Milan]] in 402. During the 5th century, the emperors from the 430s mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, [[Sack of Rome (410)|was sacked in 410]] by the [[Visigoths]] led by [[Alaric I]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=115}} but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as art work in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450\u2013500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=117}} The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}} The decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443; and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatized.<ref>''Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present'', Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&nbsp;160\u2013179</ref> However, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. Population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, population dropped to 30,000, but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.<ref>''Rome, Profile of a City: 321\u20131308'', [[Richard Krautheimer]], p.&nbsp;165</ref> The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.<ref>''Rome, Urban History'', pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185</ref> The figure of 450,000\u2013500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.<ref>Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III</ref> Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Sack of Rome by Alaric - sacred vessels are brought to a church for safety (2nd of 2).jpg|thumb|right|15th-century illustration depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]] by the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]]]]\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the [[Pope]], was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] there.

The driving force behind this renewal was the monk [[Ildebrando da Soana]], who once elected pope under the name of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] became involved into the [[Investiture Controversy]] against Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} Subsequently, Rome [[Sack of Rome (1084)|was sacked and burned]] by the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]] who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}}\n\nDuring this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a ''senatore'' or ''patrizio''.

Charles founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza]], the university of Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in [[Viterbo]], could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met, and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the [[conclave]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]], [[Caetani]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Conti di Segni|Conti]], nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}\n\n[[Pope Boniface VIII]], born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's [[universal domain]]; he proclaimed a crusade against the [[Colonna family]] and, in 1300, called for the first [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee of Christianity]], which brought millions of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} However, his hopes were crushed by the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who took him prisoner and killed him in [[Anagni]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377).{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, [[Cola di Rienzo]], came to power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of ''[[Tribune|Tribuno]]'', his reforms were rejected by the populace.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under [[Gregory XI]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[Western Schism]] (1377\u20131418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}\n[[File:Wolf-Dietrich-Klebeband St\u00e4dtebilder G 123 III.jpg|thumb|Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by [[Mario Cartaro]] shows the city's primary monuments.]]\n[[File:0 Castel et pont Sant'Angelo (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Castel Sant'Angelo]] or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.]]\n[[File:Fontana della Barcaccia restaurata, guardando verso Piazza Mignanelli.jpg|thumb|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1629]]\nIn 1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\nThis brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]],  to [[Pius II]], humanist and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo X]], who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]] moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the popes engaged the best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].\n[[File:Lingelbach Karneval in Rom 001a.jpg|thumb|[[Carnival]] in Rome, {{circa|1650}}]]\n\n[[File:View of the Piazza Navona, Rome LACMA 49.17.3.jpg|thumb|''A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome'', [[Hendrik Frans van Lint]], {{circa|1730}}]]\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.

The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II.\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The [[War of the League of Cognac]] caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]; in 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nBeginning with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}}\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]], [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798\u20131800), which was built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Papal States]] were restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]'s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed as a ''D\u00e9partement'']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]: first as ''D\u00e9partement du Tibre'' (1808\u20131810) and then as ''D\u00e9partement Rome'' (1810\u20131814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.\n\nIn 1849, [[Roman Republic (19th century)|a second Roman Republic]] was proclaimed during a year of [[revolutions in 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 with the temporary capital in [[Florence]]. That year Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. in 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself a [[prisoner in the Vatican]]. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223209/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |archivedate=8 March 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, not all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n[[File:Bombardamento di Roma.gif|thumb|right|Bombardment of Rome by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes, 1943]]\n\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], who led a [[March on Rome|march on the city]]. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city center in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cederna|first1=Antonio|title=Mussolini urbanista|date=1979|publisher=Laterza |location=Bari|pages=passim|language=Italian}}</ref> The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943 the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed by Anglo-American forces]], resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of whom another 1,500 died. Mussolini was arrested on July 25. On the date of the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an [[open city]]. It was liberated on June 4, 1944.\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"[[Italian economic miracle]]\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''la dolce vita'' (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''comune'' had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n=== EUR (Esposizione Universale Roma) ===\n\nThe EUR (initial designation R 42) is a residential and business area south of the city center. The region was originally selected in the 1930s as the venue of the 1942 World Fair, which [[Benito Mussolini]] planned to open to celebrate 20 years of [[fascism]]. The letters EUR means ''Esposizione Universale Roma''. The EUR was also designed to direct the expansion of the city to the southwest and the sea and to become a new urban centre in Rome. The final design was presented in 1939 but due to the [[Second World War]] the exhibition never happened and the works stopped in 1942. After the war, the unfinished facilities of the EUR were severely damaged. However, the authorities of Rome decided that the EUR could be the start of an urban business centre, and the unfinished buildings from the fascist era were completed in the 1950s and 1960s. Newer buildings were also built for the use of offices and governmental services, amid large gardens and parks. The EUR was almost fully completed for the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]].\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Mayor of Rome|City Council of Rome|Elections in Rome|Administrative subdivision of Rome}}\n\n===Local government===\nRome constitutes a ''[[comune|speciale]]'', named ''\"Roma Capitale\"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|title=Roma diventa Capitale|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205130517/http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy.

The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874, a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] \u2013 in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city, the term \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').\n\n===Metropolitan and regional government===\nRome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old [[Province of Rome|province]], which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]]. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km2}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.\n\n===National government===\n[[File:Quirinale palazzo e obelico con dioscuri Roma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palazzo del Quirinale]], now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]]]\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nRome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber]] ({{lang-it|Tevere}}) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\nAlthough the city centre is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ravaglioli |first1=Armando |title=Roma anno 2750 ab Urbe condita |publisher=Tascabili Economici Newton |year=1997 |location=Rome |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-8183-670-3}}</ref> The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Satellite view of Rome 2001.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Rome]]\n[[File:Roma dall'aereo.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Rome]]\nThroughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city's  walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. The city's urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' (\"GRA\"), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}. Although when the ring was completed most parts of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], which lies along the Tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} beyond it.\n\nThe ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.\n\nAs a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, [[nature reserves]], and for agricultural use.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Rome}}\nRome has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |title=World Map of K\u00f6ppen\u2212Geiger Climate Classification |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906034159/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> with hot, dry summers and cool-mild, humid winters.\n\nIts average annual temperature is above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} at night.

Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other deities such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the Pope.\n[[File:Roma - 2016-05-23 - Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - 2957.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the four papal [[major basilica]]s and has numerous architectural styles, built between the 4th century and 1743]]\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Ges\u00f9]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].\n\nIn recent years, there has been growth in Rome's [[Muslim]] community, mainly due to immigration from North Africa and the Middle East into the city.{{clarify |date=June 2017 |reason= How many Muslim migrants came; how many are living in Rome today?}} As a result of this increase of the local practitioners of the [[Islam]]ic faith, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the [[Mosque of Rome]], which is the largest mosque in [[Western Europe]], designed by architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995. Since the end of the [[Roman Republic]], Rome is also the centre of an important [[Jewish]] community,<ref>Coarelli, p. 308.</ref> which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.\n\n===Vatican City===\n{{Main|Vatican City}}\n{{wide image|Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of St. Peter's Square|[[St. Peter's Square]] in Vatican City}}\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'' ([[Vatican Hill]]), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]], and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]].\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some parts of the border there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part a new wall was constructed.\n\nThe territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was designed by architects [[Marcello Piacentini|Piacentini]] and Spaccarelli, on the instructions of [[Benito Mussolini]] and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. According to the Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].\n\n===Pilgrimage===\n[[File:Petersdom bei Nacht Via della Conciliazione in Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|St. Peter's Basilica at night from [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome]]\nRome has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] site since the [[Middle Ages]]. People from all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major [[pilgrimage]] site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter.\n\nPilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate's stairs]]: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html|title=Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|date=2007-06-13|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2019-08-22|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople]] in the fourth century. For centuries, the ''Scala Santa'' has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honour the Passion of Jesus. Other objects of pilgrimage include several catacombs built in imperial times, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them [[San Luigi dei francesi]] and [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]]), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the [[Jesuit]] Churches of Jesus and Sant'Ignazio.\n\nTraditionally, pilgrims in Rome (as well as devout Romans) visit the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome|seven pilgrim churches]] ({{lang-it|Le sette chiese}}) in 24 hours. This custom, mandatory for each pilgrim in the Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint [[Philip Neri]]. The seven churches are the four major basilicas ([[Basilica of St Peter|St Peter in Vatican]], [[St Paul outside the Walls]], [[St John in Lateran]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]), while the other three are [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] (an [[Early Christian]] basilica), [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (a church founded by [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] (which lies on the [[Appian Way]] and is built above the [[Catacombs of San Sebastiano]]).\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in Rome|List of streets in Rome}}\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Rome|Churches of Rome}}\n[[File:ThePantheon.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], built as a temple dedicated to \"all the gods of the past, present and future\"]]\n[[File:Colosseo Romano Rome 04 2016 6289.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] is still today the largest [[amphitheater]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|title=Colosseum: The Largest Amphitheatre|work=Guinnesworldrecords.com|date=March 6, 2013|access-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027170257/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was used for [[gladiator]] shows and other public events (hunting shows, recreations of famous battles and dramas based on classical mythology).]]\n\nRome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[Fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of classical architecture, developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].<ref name=\"Eyewitness\">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and neoclassic architecture.<ref name=\"Eyewitness\"/>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\n{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}\nOne of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70\u201380 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the Roman Empire. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. A list of important monuments and sites of ancient Rome includes the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verit\u00e0]].\n\n====Medieval====\nThe medieval popular quarters of the city, situated mainly around the Capitol, were largely demolished between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still remain. Basilicas dating from the [[Early Christianity|Christian antiquity]] include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century AD mosaics. Notable later notable medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Secular buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next the Roman Forum, and the huge outdoor stairway  leading up to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]].\n\n====Renaissance and Baroque====\nRome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the Piazza del Campidoglio by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].\n\n{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with a copy of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]]}}\n\nMany of the famous city's squares \u2013 some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and picturesque \u2013 got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]] and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].\n\n====Neoclassicism====\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Altare della Patria]]]]\nIn 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]]. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or \"Altar of the Fatherland\", where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.\n\n====Fascist architecture====\n[[File:Palazzo della civilt\u00e0 del lavoro (EUR, Rome) (5904657870).jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]]]]\n{{See also|Fascist architecture}}\n\nThe Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome. Mussolini allowed the construction of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during the papal rule. The main activities during his government were: the \"isolation\" of the [[Capitoline Hill]]; Via dei Monti, later renamed Via del'Impero, and finally [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; Via del Mare, later renamed Via del [[Teatro di Marcello]]; the \"isolation\" of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore; [[Via della Conciliazione]].\n\nArchitecturally, Fascism favored the most modern movements, such as [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]]. Parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named \"Stile Novecento\", characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. One important construction in the latter style is the Foro Mussolini, now [[Foro Italico]], by [[Enrico Del Debbio]]. Next to it, the most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]]. This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento architects, the former being led by [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. The EUR was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called \"E.42\" (''\"Esposizione 42\"''). The most representative buildings of EUR are the [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]] (1938\u20131943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum, and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]], example of Rationalist style. The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during the fighting between Italian and German army after the armistice and later abandoned. The quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La D\u00e9fense]] in Paris). Also, the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]], in the gardens of the [[Villa Borghese]]]]\n{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archivedate=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |accessdate=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}. Also on the Gianicolo hill there is [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]], with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere the [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\"|Orto Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees, but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]] and [[Villa Medici]]. Noteworthy is also the Pine wood of [[Castelfusano]], near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n===Fountains and aqueducts===\n{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana di Trevi Rome 04 2016 6768.jpg|thumb|The [[Trevi Fountain]]. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].]]\nRome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.<ref>Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".<ref>''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', Helen Attlee.

These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n===Obelisks and columns===\n{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}\n[[File:Piazza del Popolo Obelisco Flaminio a Roma.jpg|thumb|An ancient Egyptian obelisk in [[Piazza del Popolo]]]]\n\nThe city hosts eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125357/http://initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |archivedate=6 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]]. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also [[Trajan's column|Trajan]]'s and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Antonine Column]], two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in [[Piazza Colonna]] and it was built around 180 AD by [[Commodus]] in memory of his parents.

Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] in 1688.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |title=Sant'Angelo Bridge |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109154613/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |archivedate=9 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Catacombs===\n{{Main|Catacombs of Rome}}\n[[File:PiusXItomb2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vatican Necropolis|Vatican Caves]], the place where the popes of history are buried]]\nRome has extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute. There are also specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]].

Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Rolland | first=Jacques | title=The food encyclopedia | publisher=Robert Rose | location=Toronto | year=2006 | isbn=0-7788-0150-0 | oclc=70176309 | page=273}}</ref> <br /> In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).<ref>{{cite book | title=Culinaria Italy | first=Claudia | last=Piras | publisher=Culinaria Konemann | year=2000 | isbn=3-8290-2901-2 | oclc=881159457 | page=291}}</ref> In parallel, Roman Jews \u2013 present in the city since the 1st century BC \u2013 developed their own cuisine, the ''cucina giudaico-romanesca''.

In the 1950s, Cinecitt\u00e0 was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today, Cinecitt\u00e0 is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walk out\" with a completed film.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}\n[[File:DM TI Claudius Tiberinus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Latin]] inscription, [[National Roman Museum]]]]\nAlthough associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome was in fact multilingual. In highest antiquity, [[Sabine]] tribes shared the area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes. The Sabine language was one of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] group of ancient Italian languages, along with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. Urganilla, or [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius' entry on Claudius. However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. Many educated Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.\n\n[[Latin]] evolved during the Middle Ages into a new language, the \"''volgare''\". The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. The ''Romanesco'' spoken during the Middle Ages was more like a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language]] in [[Campania]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] and others), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), [[Trilussa]] and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. It is worth remembering though that Romanesco was a \"''lingua vernacola''\"  (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.\n\nContemporary Romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors and actresses, such as [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Anna Magnani]]. [[Carlo Verdone]], [[Enrico Montesano]], [[Gigi Proietti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]].\n\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonization and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.<ref>Ostler, N. (2007), ''Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin''. London: HarperCollins</ref>\n\nRome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and many foreign religious students or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] and so has always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Stadio Olimpico 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]], home of [[A.S.

The main harbour which serves Rome is [[Port of Civitavecchia]], located about {{convert|62|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porti di Roma|url=http://www.port-of-rome.org/|accessdate=6 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307140526/http://www.port-of-rome.org/|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Central Rome Streets Blocked by Taxi Drivers |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |first=Peter |last=Kiefer |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417112759/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |archivedate=17 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic Zones (''Zona a Traffico Limitato'' (ZTL) in Italian). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in [[Trastevere]], [[Testaccio]] and [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo]] has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.\n\n[[File:Roma Metropolitana e Ferrovia 2012.png|thumb|Roma Metrorail and Underground map, 2016]]\n[[File:Inaugurazione metro B1.jpg|thumb|[[Conca d'Oro (Rome Metro)|Conca d'Oro]] metro station]]\nA 3-line metro system called the ''[[Rome Metro|Metropolitana]]'' operates in Rome.

The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed [[Esposizione Universale Roma|EUR]] (Esposizione Universale di Roma: Rome Universal Exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.\n\nThe A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999\u20132000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. This underground network is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times and during events, especially the A line) as it is relatively short.\n\nThe A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of \u20ac500&nbsp;million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of {{convert|3.9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nA third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of \u20ac3&nbsp;billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of {{convert|25.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian [[capital city]] and a sovereign possession of the [[Holy See]], which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Rome therefore hosts foreign embassies to the Italian government, to the Holy See,  to the  [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]] and to certain international organizations. Several international [[Roman Colleges]] and [[Pontifical Universities in Rome|Pontifical Universities]] are located in Rome.\n\nThe Pope is the [[Bishop of Rome]] and its official seat is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]] (of which the [[President of the French Republic]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' the \"first and only [[Honorary canons|honorary canon]]\", a title held by the heads of the French state since [[King Henry IV of France]]). Another body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.\n\nRome is the seat of the so-called '''Polo Romano'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143221/http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|url-status=dead|title=parlamento.it|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> made up by three main international agencies of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], due the fact that the Italian government is the depositary of the treaties. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.\n\nRome is the seat of the [[European Olympic Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated.\n\nThe city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]] (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See

Simmons was selected with the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] in the [[2016 NBA draft]] by the 76ers. After sitting out a year due to an injured right foot, he was named the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|NBA Rookie of the Year]] in 2018.

The Portuguese is believed to have reached as far as the [[Siak River]].<ref>Schnitger, F. M., F\u00fcrer-Haimendorf, C. & Tichelman, G. L. (1939).

The word is allegedly derived from the figure of [[Sinbad]] al-Bahar in the book of the [[Thousand and One Nights|One Thousand and One Nights]].<ref name=\"Kondisisosbud-setneg\" />\n\nAnother version is that ''riau'' is derived from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''riuh,'' which means crowded, frenzied working people''.'' This word is believed used to reflect the nature of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]] in present-day [[Bintan Island|Bintan]]. The name is likely to have become famous since Raja Kecil moved the Malay kingdom center from Johor to Ulu Riau in 1719.<ref name=\"Kondisisosbud-setneg\" /> This name was used as one of the four main sultanates that formed the kingdoms of Riau, Lingga, Johor and Pahang. However, as the consequences of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] between the [[Netherlands]] and [[United Kingdom]], the Johor-Pahang sultanates fell under British influence, while the Riau-Lingga sultanates fell under Dutch influence.<ref>Mills, L.

The Dutch, who desired to control the Johor-Riau Empire, feared losing momentum because of the absence of mere regalia. They therefore ordered Timmerman Tyssen, the Dutch Governor of Malacca, to seize Penyengat in October 1822 and remove the royal regalia from Tengku Hamidah by force. The regalia was then stored in the crown prince's fort in Tanjung Pinang. Engku Puteri was reported to have written a letter to [[Godert van der Capellen|Van Der Capellen]], the Dutch Governor in Batavia, about this issue.

Non-violence and [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]] measures were adopted by the association. The main method of the movement was to hold symbolic boycotts.

Hurgronje wrote a secret letter to the ''Raad van Indie'', advocating that the sultanate and association be crushed as resistance in the earlier [[Aceh War]] had been. Hurgronje justified this with several arguments, among which were that since 1902 the members of the Roesidijah Klub would gather around the royal court and refuse to raise the Dutch flag on government vessels.

The agreement further stipulated that the Riau-Lingga Sultanate was a mere loan from the Dutch Government.

During a visit of the Dutch Resident's visit to Penyengat, the sultan then, on his own authority and without Dutch approval, summoned the rulers of Reteh, Gaung and Mandah, making the Resident feel as if he was being intimidated by the sultanate.

A mass exodus of civilians and officials to [[Johor]] and Singapore then took place.To avoid violence and the death of civilians in Pulau Penyengat, the sultan and his officials decided not to fight the Dutch troops. The sultan and  ''Tengku Ampuan'' (the Queen) left Pulau Penyengat and sailed to Singapore in the royal vessel ''Sri Daik'', while Crown Prince Raja Ali Kelana, Khalid Hitam and the resistance movement in Bukit Bahjah followed a couple of days later. The deposed Abdul Rahman II was forced to live in exile in Singapore, where he died there in 1930 and was buried in Keramat Bukit Kasita, Kampung Bahru Road.\n\nThe Dutch officially [[Annexation|annexed]] the sultanate to avoid future claims from the monarchy. Dutch direct rule over the Riau Archipelago began in 1913, and the province was administered as part of the Residency of Riau and Dependencies ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden''). The Dutch Residency consisted of [[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Lingga Regency|Lingga]], the [[Riau]] mainland and [[Indragiri River|Indragiri]], while the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]] was administered separately as part of the Pulau-Tujuh Division ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh'').<ref name=\"hubert-herald1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hubert-herald.nl/IndoRiau.htm|title=Riau|date=11 November 2010|publisher=Hubert de Vries|location=[[Amsterdam]]|language=}}</ref>\n\n=== Japanese occupation and Independence ===\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Indonesian National Revolution}}\nWhen [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|World War II]] broke out, the Dutch initially seemed reluctant to defend their territories in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]]. This led the British to consider creating a [[buffer state]] in Riau. They discussed prospects for a restoration with Tengku Omar and Tengku Besar, descendants of the sultans, who were then based in [[Terengganu]]. However, as the war approached [[Southeast Asia]], the Dutch actively engaged in the defensive system alongside the British, and the British decided to shelve the restoration plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Indonesia/lingga.htm|title=Lingga-The Bendahara Dynasty|date=|publisher=The Royal Arc|location=|language=}}</ref>\n[[File:Kliping-Koran-Tentang-Gerakan-Sultan-Riau.jpg|thumb|An article by H. M. Hassan entitled \"The Singapore heir to the [[Riau Archipelago|Rhio Islands]]\" published in ''[[The Straits Times]]''.]]\nIn the aftermath of the war and the struggle against Dutch rule, several exile associations collectively known as the ''Gerakan Kesultanan Riau'' (Riau Sultanate Movement) emerged in Singapore, planning for a restoration. Some of the groups dated from as early as the dissolution of the sultanate, but started to gain momentum following the post-world war confusion and politics. From the ashes of political uncertainty and fragility in the East Indies following the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies#End of the occupation|World War II]], a [[royalist]] faction known as the Association of the Indigenous Riau Malays ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Persatoean Melayu Riouw Sedjati'') (PMRS)  emerged to call for the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The council was financially backed by rich Riau Malay \u00e9migr\u00e9s and Chinese merchants who hoped to obtain tin concession. Initially founded in High Street, Singapore, the association moved to Tanjung Pinang, Riau with the unprecedented approval by the Dutch administrators. Based in Tanjung Pinang, the group managed to gain the consent of the Dutch for [[self-governance]] in the region with the foundation of the Riouw Council ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Riouw Raad'', [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Dewan Riouw''). The Riouw Council was the [[devolved]] national [[unicameral]] legislature of Riau, a position equivalent to a [[Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/58742/gerakan-sultan-riau-1946-1950-habis/|title=Gerakan Sultan Riau|date=9 February 2013|publisher=Tanjung Pinang Post|location=Tanjung Pinang|language=Indonesian}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing itself in Tanjung Pinang, the group formed a new organisation known as ''Djawatan Koewasa Pengoeroes Rakjat Riow'' (The Council of Riau People Administration), with the members hailing from [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], [[Great Karimun]], [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] and [[Singkep]]. This group strongly advocated the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate after the status of Indonesia became official. The leader of the council, Raja Abdullah, claimed that Riau Malays were neglected at the expense of the non-Riau Indonesians who dominated the upper ranks of the Riau civil administration. By restoring the monarch, they believed the position of Riau Malays would be guarded. The royalist association met with resistance from the [[Republicanism|republican]] group led by Dr. Iljas Datuk Batuah that sent delegates to Singapore to counter the propaganda of sultanate supporters. Based on Indonesian archive records, Dr. Iljas gained approvals from non-Malay newcomers to Riau, including [[Minang people|Minang]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Palembang]], and [[Batak people]]. He later formed a group known as the ''Badan Kedaulatan Indonesia Riouw'' (BKRI) (Indonesian Riau Sovereign Body) on 8 October 1945. The organisation sought to absorb the Riau Archipelago into the then-[[Indonesian National Revolution|newly independent Indonesia]], as the archipelago was still retained by the Dutch. BKRI hoped that the new administration under [[Soekarno]] would give the [[pribumis]] a fair chance to run the local government.\n\nThe royalist association would not give any public support to the Indonesian movement, as is evident in its refusal to display the ''Bendera Merah-Putih'' ([[Indonesian Flag]]) during the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian Independence Day]] celebration on 17 August 1947 in Singapore. This led republicans to call the royalists 'pro-Dutch'. The royalists however, maintained that Riau was a Dutch territory and that only the Dutch could support it. The Dutch countered the claims of the BKRI by granting [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous rule]] to the Riau Council, in which links with the Dutch would be maintained while a restored sultanate would play a secondary role. The Council, created following the decree of the Governor General of the East Indies on 12 July 1947, was inaugurated on 4 August 1947, and represented a major step forward in the revival of the monarchy system. Several key members of the PMRS were elected to the Riau Council alongside their BKRI rivals, the [[Kapitan Cina|Chinese kapitans]] from Tanjung Pinang and Pulau Tujuh, local Malay leaders of Lingga and Dutch Officials in Tanjung Pinang. On 23 January 1948, the states of the Bangka Council, the Belitung Council, and the Riau Council merged to form the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f3iIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&lpg=PT85&dq=federasi+bangka+belitung+dan+riau#v=onepage&q=federasi%20bangka%20belitung%20dan%20riau&f=false|title=Antara Daerah dan Negara: Indonesia Tahun 1950-an|last=Bemmelen|first=Sita van|last2=Raben|first2=Remco|date=2011|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia|isbn=9789794617724|language=id}}</ref>\n\nThe call for revival of the sultanate continued throughout the period of autonomous rule under the Riau Council, although the influence of republicanism also continued to strengthen. The appeal of revival began to subside following the dissolution of the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation'' on 4 April 1950. After the official withdrawal by the Dutch in 1950, the Riau Archipelago became ''Keresidenan Riau'' under [[Sumatra|Central Sumatra Province]] following the absorption by the [[United States of Indonesia]]. Being one of the last territories merged into Indonesia, Riau was known as the ''daerah-daerah pulihan'' (recovered regions), and the Riau area became a province in August 1957.\n\nThe leader of Riau forces, Major Raja Muhammad Yunus, who led the bid to reestablish the sultanate apart from Indonesia fled into exile in Johor after his ill attempt.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ck13DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=Raja+Muhammad+Yunus+riau#v=onepage&q=Raja%20Muhammad%20Yunus%20riau&f=false|title=The SIJORI Cross-Border Region: Transnational Politics, Economics, and Culture|last=Hutchinson|first=Francis E.|last2=Chong|first2=Terence|date=2016-06-14|publisher=ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute|isbn=9789814695589|language=en}}</ref> The [[Geopolitical|geopolitical roots]] of the Riau Archipelago had molded her nationalist position to be sandwiched between the kindred [[Monarchism|monarchist]] Peninsular [[Ethnic Malays#Malay nationalism|Malay Nationalism]] observed across the border in [[British Malaya]] with the [[Republicanism|pro-republic]] and pan-ethnic [[Indonesian National Awakening|Indonesian Nationalism]] manifested in her own [[Dutch East Indies]] domain.\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\n{{Main|Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation}}\nAfter the war, from 1950 the Riau archipelago was a duty-free zone till the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]] in 1963.

Although the rupiah resembled the [[Indonesian rupiah]] in appearance, it had a much higher value. Malayan money was withdrawn from 1 November 1963. The Riau rupiah was exchangeable as a foreign currency with the Indonesian rupiah. Since 1 July 1964, the Riau rupiah was no longer a valid currency, being replaced by the [[Indonesian rupiah]] at a rate of 1 Riau rupiah = 14.7 Indonesian rupiah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kompasiana.com/andirwansyah/asal-usul-mata-uang-rupiah_552029f8813311bd729de195|title=Asal Usul Mata Uang Rupiah|last=Kompasiana.com|website=KOMPASIANA|language=id|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\nDue to its proximity to [[Singapore]] and [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the Riau Islands area became the focus point during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]].

The province shares maritime border with [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] to the north, the province of [[Bangka Belitung Islands]] and [[Jambi]] in the south, [[East Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and the province of [[West Kalimantan]] in the east and [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and mainland [[Riau]] in the west.\n\nThe island of [[Batam]], which lies within the central core group of islands (the Riau Archipelago), contains a majority of the province's population. Since becoming part of an economic zone with Singapore in 2006, it has experienced high population growth rates. Other highly populated islands in the Riau Archipelago include [[Bintan Island|Bintan]] and [[Great Karimun|Karimun]], while the archipelago also includes islands such as [[Bulan Island|Bulan]] and [[Kundur Island|Kundur]]. There are around 3,200 islands in the province, which has its capital at [[Tanjung Pinang]] in the south of Bintan Island. The Riau Islands province includes the [[Lingga Islands]] to the south of the main [[Riau Archipelago]], while to the northeast lies the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], between [[Borneo]] and mainland [[Malaysia]]; the Tudjuh Archipelago consists of four distinct groups \u2014 the [[Anambas Islands]], [[Natuna Islands]], [[Tambelan Archipelago|Tambelan]] islands and [[Badas Islands]] \u2014 which were attached to the new province, though not geographically part of the Riau Archipelago. The 2015 census count was 1,968,313, less than estimated but it was still the second fastest growing province in Indonesia.\n\nThe highest point in Riau Islands is Mount Daik with a height of 1,165 meters (3,822 ft), which is located on [[Lingga Regency|Lingga]] Island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/gunung-daik-masuk-anugerah-pesona-indonesia/|title=Gunung Daik Masuk Anugerah Pesona Indonesia|last=dediarman|date=2018-05-30|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> Most of the area on [[Lingga Island|Lingga]] Island is hilly.

Most of the province has wet tropical climate, there is rainy season and dry season interspersed with transition season with the lowest average temperature 20.4&nbsp;\u00b0C. In November to February monsoon winds comes from the north and between June to December the monsoon winds comes from the south. During the northern monsoon the wind velocity at sea could range from 20-30 knots, on land the wind can range from 3-15 knots. This causes potentially extreme weather in the Riau Islands with rainfall of about 150-200 millimeters and wave height between 1.2 meters up to 3 meters.\nAs in most other province of Indonesia, the Riau Islands has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'') bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.

It is depends on the different between seawater level in northern part of [[Andaman Sea]] and southern part of Malacca Strait. Since seawater level in [[Pacific Ocean]] is always higher than in [[Indian Ocean|Indian Oceans]], the seawater level in [[South China Sea]] is also higher than in Andaman Sea through out the year resulted in Malacca Strait there is a current, which flow to Northwest direction through out the year. In November to April, during the Northeast monsoon, Andaman Sea\u2019s current goes to the north. Therefore majority of water masses are transported to the north. Consequent of this, during these months, Andaman Sea\u2019s water masses will be empty, and sea water level will be low or the different from South China Sea\u2019s sea water level will be higher. This sea water level reaches to maximum in February to March, while the different of sea water level between Northern and southern parts of Strait is about 50 cm, which resulted current velocity is about 12 cm/sec to Northwest.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nConversely, during the southwest monsoon, May to October, most of the currents in western part of [[Andaman Sea]] go to east and south, therefore water masses will be gathering in Andaman Sea. This resulted in that sea water level increases in northern part of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]], and the different of sea water level to [[South China Sea]]\u2019s water level will be small, although in southern part of the Strait the sea water level is still higher. During this season, the water current in Malacca Strait flows to the north, with speed is little bit lower. Current velocity reaches to maximum in around [[July]] to [[August]], with speed about 5 cm/sec. Oceanographic pattern is likely to affect the water quality and reef corals in the study sites. Strong wind during the wet monsoon period, for example, could cause water turbulence which affecting on high sediment, especially in coastal areas, and this might be worse with the high sediment run off from surrounding rivers and/or reclamation areas, such as happened in [[Batam]].

The geographical location can be a leverage in attracting foreign and domestic investors. However, the strategic geographical location will not provide benefits if the Riau Islands do not have competitiveness.

Because the Riau Islands is a new developing province and almost half of the existing human resources come from outside the Riau Islands, this has caused housing needs in the Riau Islands to be out of proportion to their availability. This condition also seems to have caused housing costs to rise in the Riau Islands relatively faster than in other regions. The results of the National Socio-Economic Survey show that on average the expenditure per capita of the population for rental costs/housing contracts is the highest type of expenditure for non-food commodities, and the figure tends to increase every year.

When viewed from the harvested area and rice production in 2011, it experienced a very small increase as well as productivity. Rice productivity in 2010 was 3.15 tons per hectare, cassava was 10.82 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 7.72 tons per hectare. The increase in productivity of rice and cassava was only 0.01 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 0.03 tons per hectare. [[Maize|Corn]] and [[peanut]] crops are food crops in Riau Islands with low productivity during 2010-2011. Whereas for corn productivity in 2010 amounted to 2.13 tons per hectare decreased to 2.12 tons per hectare in 2011. While for peanuts the productivity remained, at 0.92 tons per hectare. Decrease in corn productivity is due to the harvested area for maize also has decreased, besides it is also the effect of pests that cause disruption of corn pests.<ref name=\":6\" /> Plantation and horticultural crops are types of plants that are quite potential to be cultivated in Riau Islands. This is based on the high price of agricultural products produced by these two types of businesses. As shown by the NTP (Farmer Exchange Rate) data, only estate and horticultural farmers have almost certainly an index value above 100. This condition is of course caused by the still higher price of goods produced by farmers compared to the price of goods needed, both for consumption and the cost of production. Production of [[Natural rubber|rubber]] plants in 2011 experienced a very high increase of 118 percent. While [[coconut]] plants experienced a very small increase of 2.4 percent.

They are the native people of the [[Riau Archipelago]]. From the ancient times, the Riau Archipelago is considered the hub of Malay cultures. In the past, several Malay kingdoms and sultanates existed in the archipelago, the most notably being the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]]. A major sub-group of the Malay inhabiting the province is the [[Orang Laut|''Orang laut'']] (sea people).  The ''Orang laut'' are Malays who are [[Nomad|nomadic]] in nature and have a rich marine culture. Presently, many ''Orang laut'' have settled in coastal areas of the province. The ''Orang laut'' are encompasses of numerous tribes and groups inhabiting the islands and estuaries in the Riau-Lingga Archipelagos, the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], the [[Batam]] Archipelago, and the coasts and offshore islands of eastern [[Sumatra]], southern [[Malay Peninsula|Malaysia Peninsula]] and [[Singapore]].<ref>[http://www.bartelby.net/67/837.html \"The Malay Peninsula and Archipelago 1511\u20131722\" ''The Encyclopedia of World History'' 2001];</ref> The geographical condition of the Riau Islands, which has almost 99% of its area as water, has made quite a number of ''Orang Laut'' groups living in this area.

It served as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the province.\n\nThe [[Karimun Regency]] has several dialects namely the Kundur dialect and the Bintan-Karimun dialect. In general, it uses the Johor-Riau dialect. The main characteristic of this dialect is the suffix \"A\" which sounds as \"E\". The word /saya/ and /apa/ (\"I\" and \"What\" respectively) will be pronounced as /saye/ and /ape/ in the Johor-Riau dialect, which is similar to the Malay used in [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The dialects used in the [[Bintan Regency]] are the Bintan-Karimun dialect, the Malang Rapat-Kelong dialect which is used in Malang Rapat village and Kelong village and the Mantang Lama dialect in Mantang Lama Village in Kijang. The word pronunciation is similar to the Malay used in Tanjung Pinang and Karimun. The Malay used in the [[Lingga Regency]] is also similar to the Malay used in the Karimun and BIitan Regency. The variety of Malay spoken in the province's northernmost regencies, [[Anambas Islands Regency|Anambas]] and [[Natuna Regency|Natuna]], is not only mutually unintelligible to the standard Indonesian language, but also mutually unintelligible to the Malay varieties spoken in Bintan and Karimun. The Anambas Malay dialect slightly resembles the [[Pontianak Malay]] dialect spoken in [[West Kalimantan]] and the Belitung Malay dialect spoken in [[Bangka Belitung Islands|Bangka-Belitung]], especially their vocabulary and phonology. For example, ''kitak'' or ''ketak'' which means you, ''wan'' which means grandma and ''suduk'' which means spoon are both used in Anambas and Pontianak. The Natuna Malay people spoke a dialect of Malay that is influenced by [[Terengganu Malay]] and [[Pahang Malay]] that are spoken in the Malaysian states of [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]] respectively, as most of the people living there trace their origins from the eastern coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]].

The Riau Islands Hokkien is related  to the Hokkien spoken in mainland Riau, such as the town of [[Bagansiapiapi]] and [[Selat Panjang]], as well as the Hokkien spoken in Central and Southern [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

It is markedly distinct from [[Penang Hokkien]] and [[Medan Hokkien]], which are based on [[Zhangzhou dialect]], another Hokkien dialect originated from the city of [[Zhangzhou]], also in Fujian. Other varieties of Chinese are also spoken in the province, such as [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Cantonese]], albeit to a lesser extent compared to Hokkien. Hokkien serves as the ''lingua franca'' of the Chinese people in the Riau Islands. Most of the Chinese varieties spoken in the region has been greatly influenced by [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], especially their vocabulary.\n\nOther ethnic groups who migrated from other parts of Indonesia brought their own language, such as the [[Javanese language]] spoken by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau language]] spoken by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and different varieties of [[Batak languages|Batak]] spoken by different sub-groups of the [[Batak]] people.\n\n[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely used as the national language. Most formal [[education]], and nearly all national [[mass media]], [[governance]], [[Public administration|administration]], [[judiciary]], and other forms of communication in the Riau Islands, are conducted in Indonesian. It is also used for inter-ethnic communication. Indonesian is spoken as the first language in major cities such as [[Batam]] and [[Tanjung Pinang]], while it is spoken as a second language elsewhere in the province. The [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese people]] in the Riau Islands uses Indonesian as their third language, with Hokkien or other [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] being used as their first language and the local Riau Malay as their second language.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{bar box|width=250px|barwidth=100px|title=Religion in the Riau Islands (2016)<ref name=\"Kemenag2016\">{{cite web| title = Riau Islands Religion Profile in 2016 | work =  [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs]] | year = 2016 |url = https://kepri.kemenag.go.id/public/files/040920170319221988430497.pdf}}</ref>|titlebar=#ddd|left1=Religion|right1=Percent|float=right|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Islam]]|Green|77.56}}\n{{bar percent|[[Christianity]]|Violet|14.67}}\n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|Yellow|7.55}}\n{{bar percent|[[Confucianism]]|Black|0.17}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|Magenta|0.05}}}}The local Malay people of the Riau region since ancient times and even until the present-day is considered as a society that is accommodating, friendly, and welcome to immigrants who come to bring new cultures and religions, both from within and outside the country. The example are immigrants from [[India]] with [[Hinduism]], from [[China]] with [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]], from [[Europe]] with [[Christianity]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], as well as other migrants from various ethnic groups in the [[Nusantara]] archipelago.  Based on the composition of the population of the Riau Islands which is full of diversity with different socio-cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, it is basically an asset for the Riau Archipelago itself. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of the province are very diverse, including [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].\n\nAs of 2016, [[Islam]] is the dominant religion in the province, forming 77.56% of the total population. [[Islam]] is generally adhered by the ethnic [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Banjar people|Banjars]], [[Bugis]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and some [[Batak]] sub-group. Islam has entered the region since at least the [[12th century]]. Contact between the indigenous population and Muslim traders from the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian peninsula]], [[Iran|Persia]] and India did occur for the first time in the northern Sumatra region because of its strategic position to traders stopover at that time. This condition strengthens the indication that the [[Islamization]] process is expected to have taken place since the contact took place so that a community was formed where the Arabs who settled in the village were married to local residents thus forming Muslim communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/164474-ID-islamisasi-di-riau-kajian-sejarah-dan-bu.pdf|title=Islamization in Riau: Historical and Cultural Study of the entry and the development of Islam in Kuntu Kampar|last=Roza|first=Ellya|last2=Yasnel|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> [[Islam]] is generally adhered by the ethnic [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Banjar people|Banjars]], [[Bugis]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and some [[Batak]] sub-group. Several Muslim organizations in Indonesia has branches in the Riau Islands, such as [[Muhammadiyah]] and the [[Nahdlatul Ulama]].\n\n[[Christianity]] forms the second-largest religion group in the province, forming around 14.67% of the total population. The two largest Christian domination in the Riau Islands are [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], forming around 12.21% and 2.46% of the total population respectively. Most of the people who adhered Protestantism are from [[Batak]] sub-groups (specifically [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]], [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]]), [[Nias people|Nias]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], and immigrants from [[North Sulawesi]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Western New Guinea|Papua]], while most of the people who adhered Catholicism are immigrants from [[East Nusa Tenggara]]. The province does not has its own Catholic [[Diocese]]. Instead, it is served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pangkal-Pinang]], which is based in [[Pangkal Pinang|Pangkal-Pinang]], [[Bangka Belitung Islands]].\n\n[[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] forms a significant minority in the province, forming around 7.55% and 0.17% respectively. They are mostly adhered by the Chinese. Lastly, [[Hinduism]] only forms around 0.05% of the total population, which is mostly adhered by [[Balinese people|Balinese]] immigrants and [[Indian Indonesians|Indonesians of Indian descent]].\n\n== Culture ==\nThe culture of the Riau Islands is strongly influenced by the culture of the [[Malay culture|Malays]] and the Chinese people. Some ethnic groups, for example Javanese, Balinese, Bugis, Batak, and European culture also influenced the culture of the province. The culture of the Riau Islands is also influenced by the [[Islamic culture|culture of Islam]]. The Malay people that inhabits Riau Islands is also overwhelmingly adhered to Islam. In addition to Islam, the culture of the Riau Islands has also been influenced by the other religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Confucianism]]. However, as the Riau Islands is considered as the home of the Malay people and part of the [[Malay world]], the culture of the Riau Islands mostly relate to the culture of the Malay people themselves.\n\nWhat is typical of the Malay people is the designation of a nickname for a specific person in a family. The first child in a Malay family is called ''long'' or ''sulung'', the second child is called ''ngah''/''ongah'', the third child is called ''cik'' and the youngest child is called ''cu/ucu''. The nickname is usually followed by a word that describes the physical characteristics of the person concerned, for example ''cik'' ''itam,'' which means a third child with a dark/black characteristic. This culture can only be found in the Riau Malay community, both in the Riau Islands as well as mainland Riau.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilmuseni.com/seni-budaya/kebudayaan-suku-melayu|title=Kebudayaan Suku Melayu yang Paling Fenomenal|last=Antono|first=Agil|date=2017-12-28|website=IlmuSeni.com|language=id|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nA typical Riau Malay ''[[Kampong|kampung]]'' (village) are led by a village chief called the ''penghulu''. Presently, the ''penghulu'' is a village administrator chosen based on government regulations. Besides the ''penghulu'' there is also a leader in the religious sector called ''[[imam]]''. This ''imam'' takes care of all matters relating to religion, such as religious studies and lessons, marriage/ divorce/reconciliation, the distribution of inheritance, collection of [[zakat]] and others. Thus the ''penghulu'' accompanied by the ''imam'' are the leader of the ''kampung''.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |last=Annisa|first=Pahlevi|title=Kebudayaan-melayu-riau |url=https://www.academia.edu/7535760 |website=Academia |language=id}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''kampung'', most of the local people knew each other, because the villagers had a strong sense of attachment to each other. Harmony is a characteristic of the community of these ''kampung''. The existence of harmony is not caused by external coercion in the form of harsh sanctions, but it does arise from a conscience that is influenced by the norms that live in the community. Starting from the movements, attitudes and traits are influenced by these factors. Avoiding things that can cause disgrace and shame is a motivating factor for continuing to act and be kind to others and such feelings are stronger than feelings of sin. All actions must be maintained so as not to cause \"discordant eyes\", \"discordant ears\", \"discordant manners\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arts and Performance===\n[[File:Joget-Dangkong.jpg|thumb|A troupe of local Riau Malay dancers performing the [[Joget|Joget Lambak]]. (taken in the late 19th century)]]\nVarious forms and types of arts found in the Riau region, namely theater, dance, music, singing, and literature. Artists in urban areas generally feel alien to traditional arts. Therefore, an appreciative link is needed by introducing all types and forms of traditional arts in urban areas. Thus, contemporary art that grows, lives, and develops in urban areas will have a solid and tidy foundation in contributing to national art.\n\nIn the late 1890s, the Rusydiah Club was founded, an association for scholars, writers, and cultural figures.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323835285|title=The Rushdiah Club: Its roles in Malay Societies, 1892-1940|last=Zakariya|first=Hafiz|last2=Oktasari|first2=Wiwin|date=2017-12-29|isbn=9789674186319}}</ref> This association was established in the Riau Islands, precisely on [[Penyengat Island]] which at that time was the center of the government of the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate|Sultanate of Riau-Lingga]]. In essence, this association is a cultural institution that includes art, performance and literature. Its activities began with the commemoration of Islamic holidays, such as [[Mawlid|Maulud Nabi]], [[Isra and Mi'raj|Isra-Mikraj]], [[History of the Quran|Nuzulul Quran]], [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid al-Fit]]<nowiki/>r, [[Eid al-Adha]], and others which later developed to the publication of books by members of the association. All activities are supported by royal facilities in the form of the Marah Ahmadi Khanah Polar library and two [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]] printing presses, namely Mathba\u2018at al Ahmadiyah and Mathba\u2018at al Riauwiyah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/makam-merah-dan-alias-wello/|title=Makam Merah dan Alias Wello|last=dediarman|date=2016-12-29|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> The Rusydiah Klub is the first association of scholars in Indonesia. This association is not mentioned in national history, because of the lack of careful collection of historical material, or maybe because there is no input from those who know much about it. Rusydiah Club left behind a valuable heritage of creativity in the form of books of literature, religion, history and linguistics.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Riau region has long been an area of trade traffic in neighboring countries, so Riau has given birth to diverse cultural figures and colors. This is a burden, as well as a historical-geographical blessing. Riau seems to be a field of association of various artistic potentials, in which there are cultural influences in neighboring countries and other Indonesian cultures. Riau Malay art is very diverse, because small groups that exist in the community are also developing.<ref name=\":2\" /> The fact shows, the arts in Riau and the arts in Malay countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]] mutually complement and influence each other. Likewise, Malay cultural regions such as [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli]], [[Sultanate of Langkat|Langkat]], [[Serdang Malays|Serdang]] and [[Asahan Sultanate|Asahan]] in [[North Sumatra]], [[Jambi]], [[West Kalimantan]], and others, were also affected by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]], [[Buginese people|Bugis]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] cultures. Cultures influence that come from outside Indonesia such as [[India]] ([[Hindus|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]]), [[Arabs|Arabic]] ([[Islam]]), [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], and [[Thai culture|Siamese]] influence. The flexibility of Malay culture is in line with the historical development and geographical location of Riau, making Riau very rich with a variety of artistic expressions. The development of Malay culture in Riau, in turn, can enrich national culture.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''[[Baju Kurung|Baju kurung]]'' is one of the traditional clothes of the Malay community in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[southern Thailand]]. ''[[Baju Kurung|Baju kurung]]'' is often associated with women. The hallmark of the clothes brackets is the loose design on the holes in the arms, abdomen, and chest. When worn, the bottom of the clothes bracket is parallel to the groin, but for rare cases there are also those that extend to knee level. Shirt brackets are not fitted with buttons, but are almost similar to t-shirts. Shirt brackets are also not collared, each end is crochet. Some parts are often decorated with gold embroidery. At first, the clothes of the brackets were usually worn for the great ceremony of Malay by women in the kingdom, used together with ''[[songket]]'' cloth to be used as a scabbard, various gold jewelry, and a small bag or fan. Since the majority of Malay communities embraced [[Islam]], many women who wear clothes in brackets match them with the [[hijab]], although there are also those who do not use them. Now the clothes of brackets are widely worn by ordinary people, used by children to read the [[Quran]], or ladies to go to the market, without including accessories that seem luxurious.\n\nHowever, the main traditional dress of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh'' and the ''Teluk Belanga.''<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.raparapa.co/pakaian-adat/|title=34 Pakaian Adat di Indonesia, Kekayaan yang Masih Dilestarikan|last=Raparapa|date=2017-01-13|website=Raparapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref> The ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh a''re specifically worn by women. It is typically worn at the time of traditional ceremonies and official events of the local community. The hallmark of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' traditional clothing is the length of the kebaya to cover the knees with the shape of the kebaya looking wide and open. ''Kebaya Labuh'' is often combined with [[batik]] cloth such as cual fabric. For the wedding, the groom wore a head covering called ''[[Tengkolok|Tanjak]]''. The spindle is a rectangular [[songket]] that is folded into a headband. A distinctive feature of the ''Teluk Belanga'' custom clothing is a plain color paired with shades of color, a sheath worn over the knee that acts as a scarf, a headband made of songket cloth called the ''tanjak''. The custom attire of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' is complemented by a headdress called a peak which is a head covering made of square ''songket'' shaped like songkok or peci.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bp-guide.id/AXOkKPew|title=9+ Ragam Baju Adat Sumatera Yang Keren dan Wajib Kamu Tahu (2018)|website=BP Guide - Temukan hadiah terbaikmu|language=id|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> Typically, the skirt is only used for formal ceremonies or events such as feasts and custom ceremonies. However, these decorations are usually only worn on formal occasions such as death or marriage. Occasionally, ''Teluk Belangga'' clothing is usually accompanied by a ''[[Songkok|peci]]''. For women, the ''Kebaya Labuh'' is usually combined with batik and also with a scarf.\n[[File:Raiyani Muharramah-Silat pengantin.jpg|thumb|Malay men performing the ''Silat Pengantin'' traditional dance in a wedding ceremony at [[Lingga Regency|Lingga Islands]]]]\nThe ''[[Mak yong]]'' is one of the traditional dances that can be found in the Riau Islands. ''Mak Yong'' is a traditional theatrical art of the Malay community which is still sustainable today. Although it is not often performed, every service is always welcomed by enthusiastic residents, especially those who love Malay culture and native art. ''Mak Yong'' performances are usually performed by groups of dancers and musicians, who combine various religious elements, theatrical, dance, music, vocals and texts. The main characters are male and female, both are performed by female dancers. The ''Mak yong'' performance is accompanied by musical instruments such as fiddle and drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kepri-travel.kepriprov.go.id/item/makyong/|title=MAKYONG {{!}} Wonderful Kepri - Official Site|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> In the Riau Islands region, the ''Mak Yong'' oral tradition has been exhibited since several centuries ago and has spread to [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], [[Johor]], [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]]. In the Riau Islands, this oral tradition developed rapidly during the sultanate era. ''Mak yong'' theater performing arts is played with dances, songs and jokes that are intertwined in a story line, the players are 20 people, women wearing glittering costumes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/ditwdb/makyong-kepulauan-riau-seni-pertujukkan/|title=Makyong Kepulauan Riau, Seni Pertujukkan|last=ditwdb|date=2019-04-30|website=Direktorat Warisan dan Diplomasi Budaya|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n''[[Zapin]]'' is a Malay traditional dance that can be found in both the Riau Islands and mainland. This dance is one of several types of Malay dance that still exists today. According to history, in the beginning this dance was a dance of entertainment in the palace after being brought from [[Hadhramaut|Hadramaut]] in [[Yemen]] by Arab traders in the early [[16th century|16th century.]] At that time the country of [[Johor]] became a substitute for the role of [[Malacca]] as an international port in the 16th century. This can be seen from the development of ''Zapin'' dance creations that are identical with Malay culture and in terms of rhyming. Artists and culture are able to make traditional art, not stopping but full of dynamics that are always acceptable in every circumstance. This traditional dance is both educational and entertaining, and is used as an Islamic [[Dawah|da'wah]] medium through ''Zapin'' songs that are sung. The accompanying music consists of fiddles, tambourines, drums and small drum percussion instruments called [[Mirwas|marwas]] or maracas. The ''Zapin'' dance focuses more on teamwork rather than individual efforts. Before the 1960s, ''Zapin'' was only performed by male dancers but now it is usually danced by female dancers or both male and female.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/tari-zapin/|title=Tari Zapin|last=dediarman|date=2014-06-08|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Malemang'' dance is a traditional Riau dance by the people of [[Bintan Island|Bintan]]. It originated back in the [[12th century]] in Tanjungpisau. Originally, it was only performed at the Royal Palace of the Kingdom of Bentan in Bukit Batu, Bintan. As the kingdom collapsed, this dance became a folk entertainment show. At present, ''Malemang'' Dance is displayed in various events, including festivals. In the show, the dancers demonstrate their ability to take something (handkerchief, change, etc.). They do this by flexing (standing up, bending backwards). From this skill then this dance is called ''malemang'' or ''melemang''. In Tanjungpisau, this dance is better known as the ''Melemang Bintan Penaga'' Dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogkulo.com/daftar-10-tarian-daerah-riau-kepri/|title=Daftar 10 Nama Tarian Daerah Riau & Kepulauan Riau untuk Anda Ketahui|last=Kulo|first=oleh Blog|date=2019-05-25|website=Blog Kulo|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:TMII Riau Pavilion Malay House 02.jpg|thumb|A typical Malay traditional house in the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]], Jakarta]]\nIn [[Malay culture]], the art of development also has characteristics that are reflected in the symbols of traditional houses that are full of meaning. At present, Malay traditional houses can still be found in several regions in the [[Riau Archipelago]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and other [[Malay world|Malay-populated countries]]. In traditional Malay society, a house is an intact building that can be used as a family residence, meeting place and shelter for anyone in need. Therefore, traditional Malay houses are generally large, usually with six poles, six porch poles and twelve poles or porch houses. Of the several forms of the house, all are almost identical, both stairs, doors, walls and room layout are identical. In addition to being large, the Malay house is also always in the form of a stage or a house with a hole, facing towards the sunrise. In general, the types of Malay houses include dwellings, halls, houses of worship and storage houses. The naming is adjusted to the function of each building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2013/12/rumah-adat-riau-dan-kepulauan-riau/|title=Rumah Adat Riau dan Kepulauan Riau|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\nRiau Malay traditional house buildings are generally given a variety of decorations, starting from the door, window, ventilation to the top of the roof of the building, the decoration is adjusted to the meaning of each carving.  Additionally, these houses are also given a pattern. The pattern of a [[Riau Malays|Riau Malay]] house is largely derived from nature, consisting of flora, fauna, and space objects. These things are designed in certain forms, either in their original form such as backdrops, forest flowers, or in abstracted or modified forms so that they no longer appear in their original form, but simply use their name.\n\nThe ''Limas Potong'' house is one of the traditional houses of the Malays inhabiting the [[Riau Archipelago]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://situsbudaya.id/rumah-limas-potong-batam/|title=Rumah Limas Potong Batam|date=2017-11-30|website=Informasi Situs Budaya Indonesia|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> ''Limas Potong'' is a stilt house, like a traditional house in [[Sumatra]] in general. Height of about 1.5 meters from the ground surface. The walls of the house are made of brown planks, while the roof is red zinc. The doors, windows and pillars on the front of the house are painted in white oil. ''Limas Potong'' has five main parts, namely terrace, front room, center, back (bed), and kitchen. The front of the house is used to display historical photographs of this traditional house, the living room contains a typical Malay bridal diorama, and the back is a room that contains a mosquito net that integrates with the kitchen.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOne of the most famous traditional house of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''Belah Bubung'' traditional house. This house is also known as the ''Rabung'' house or the ''Bumbung Melayu'' house. The name ''Belah Bubung'' was given by the Malays because the shape of the roof was split. The size of the house built is determined by the ability of its owner, the richer a person is, the bigger the house and the more variety of decoration. However, wealth is not an absolute determinant. The most important consideration in making a home is harmony with the owner. To determine whether or not a house is compatible, the owner calculates the size of the house by cubits, from one to five. The veins are: snake swimming, pursuing ripples, ripples climbing beetles shelter, debt out of debt changed debt, and five debt has not been affected. The best measure is if it is right on the count of ripples to climb the shade beetle.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Traditional weapon===\n''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a traditional weapon originating from the Riau Islands. ''[[Badik]]'' itself is a term for traditional weapons which is known among the Bugis community and some regions in [[Sumatra]]. Meanwhile, Tumbuk Lada is a traditional weapon of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]]. No wonder the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' has similarities with weapons from other Malay-populated region. The Riau Islands are inhabited by various races and ethnicity. However, the majority of indigenous people are Malay people. Therefore, the culture of the Riau region has a lot in common with other indigenous Malay regions.  ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a type of stabbing weapon measuring 27 to 29 cm and its width is around 3.5 to 4 cm. This weapon is not only used by the people of [[Jambi]], and also has similarities with the [[Buginese people|Buginese]] ''Badik'', it only differs in the shape and motive of the holster. Not only domestically, Malaysia also has the same traditional weapons, both in name and form. This is inseparable from the background of Malay communities spread throughout [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]] and along the Malay peninsula. Similar to the ''[[Kris|keris]]'', ''badik'' is also one of the identities that characterizes the Malay people. Until now the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is still used by the people of the Riau islands to do production work such as farming or hunting. Some local customs also still maintain the ''badik'' as a complement to men's custom clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2014/09/senjata-tradisional-kepulauan-riau/|title=Senjata Tradisional Kepulauan Riau|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Jenawi'' is a type of sword that became the most popular traditional weapon in the Riau area. This sword was often used by Malay warlords in the face of his enemies. The sword has a length of about 1 meter so it is often used for close combat. ''Jenawi'' sword is similar to a typical Japanese [[katana]]. Historians and cultural experts argue that this weapon originated from ancient Japan which experienced acculturation with Malay culture. Regardless of this opinion, the sword of genius remains a Malay people's identity on the national scene.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Malay cuisine}}\n[[File:Nasi Lemak Sambal Cumi in Indonesia 2.jpg|thumb|[[Nasi lemak|Nasi Lemak]] Sambal Cumi, a variety of Nasi Lemak that can be found in the Riau Islands ]]\nCuisine in the Riau Islands are mostly similar to the one in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], owing to its similar culture. There are also some dishes that is influenced by other parts of Indonesia, such as Java. Due to its cultural diversity, the people of the Riau Islands has developed a unique dishes that cannot be found in other parts of Indonesia. The Riau Islands cuisine is strongly influenced by the culture of the Malay, [[Culture of India|Indian]] and [[Chinese culture|Chinese]]. Some foods are also influenced by the culture of the [[Javanese culture|Javanese]], [[Balinese cuisine|Balinese]], [[Buginese people|Bugis]], other ethnic groups in [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]], as well as European cultures, especially the British and Dutch. \n\nOne of the most popular dish in the Riau Islands is its variety of the [[Nasi lemak]], with some notable differences compared to the variety found in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore.

This word is believed used to reflect the nature of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]] in present-day [[Bintan Island|Bintan]].

The Dutch, who desired to control the Johor-Riau Empire, feared losing momentum because of the absence of mere regalia. They therefore ordered Timmerman Tyssen, the Dutch Governor of Malacca, to seize Penyengat in October 1822 and remove the royal regalia from Tengku Hamidah by force. The regalia was then stored in the crown prince's fort in Tanjung Pinang. Engku Puteri was reported to have written a letter to [[Godert van der Capellen|Van Der Capellen]], the Dutch Governor in Batavia, about this issue.

Non-violence and [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]] measures were adopted by the association. The main method of the movement was to hold symbolic boycotts.

Hurgronje wrote a secret letter to the ''Raad van Indie'', advocating that the sultanate and association be crushed as resistance in the earlier [[Aceh War]] had been. Hurgronje justified this with several arguments, among which were that since 1902 the members of the Roesidijah Klub would gather around the royal court and refuse to raise the Dutch flag on government vessels.

The agreement further stipulated that the Riau-Lingga Sultanate was a mere loan from the Dutch Government.

During a visit of the Dutch Resident's visit to Penyengat, the sultan then, on his own authority and without Dutch approval, summoned the rulers of Reteh, Gaung and Mandah, making the Resident feel as if he was being intimidated by the sultanate.

A mass exodus of civilians and officials to [[Johor]] and Singapore then took place.To avoid violence and the death of civilians in Pulau Penyengat, the sultan and his officials decided not to fight the Dutch troops. The sultan and  ''Tengku Ampuan'' (the Queen) left Pulau Penyengat and sailed to Singapore in the royal vessel ''Sri Daik'', while Crown Prince Raja Ali Kelana, Khalid Hitam and the resistance movement in Bukit Bahjah followed a couple of days later. The deposed Abdul Rahman II was forced to live in exile in Singapore, where he died there in 1930 and was buried in Keramat Bukit Kasita, Kampung Bahru Road.\n\nThe Dutch officially [[Annexation|annexed]] the sultanate to avoid future claims from the monarchy. Dutch direct rule over the Riau Archipelago began in 1913, and the province was administered as part of the Residency of Riau and Dependencies ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden''). The Dutch Residency consisted of [[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Lingga Regency|Lingga]], the [[Riau]] mainland and [[Indragiri River|Indragiri]], while the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]] was administered separately as part of the Pulau-Tujuh Division ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh'').<ref name=\"hubert-herald1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hubert-herald.nl/IndoRiau.htm|title=Riau|date=11 November 2010|publisher=Hubert de Vries|location=[[Amsterdam]]|language=}}</ref>\n\n=== Japanese occupation and Independence ===\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Indonesian National Revolution}}\nWhen [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|World War II]] broke out, the Dutch initially seemed reluctant to defend their territories in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]]. This led the British to consider creating a [[buffer state]] in Riau. They discussed prospects for a restoration with Tengku Omar and Tengku Besar, descendants of the sultans, who were then based in [[Terengganu]]. However, as the war approached [[Southeast Asia]], the Dutch actively engaged in the defensive system alongside the British, and the British decided to shelve the restoration plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Indonesia/lingga.htm|title=Lingga-The Bendahara Dynasty|date=|publisher=The Royal Arc|location=|language=}}</ref>\n[[File:Kliping-Koran-Tentang-Gerakan-Sultan-Riau.jpg|thumb|An article by H. M. Hassan entitled \"The Singapore heir to the [[Riau Archipelago|Rhio Islands]]\" published in ''[[The Straits Times]]''.]]\nIn the aftermath of the war and the struggle against Dutch rule, several exile associations collectively known as the ''Gerakan Kesultanan Riau'' (Riau Sultanate Movement) emerged in Singapore, planning for a restoration. Some of the groups dated from as early as the dissolution of the sultanate, but started to gain momentum following the post-world war confusion and politics. From the ashes of political uncertainty and fragility in the East Indies following the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies#End of the occupation|World War II]], a [[royalist]] faction known as the Association of the Indigenous Riau Malays ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Persatoean Melayu Riouw Sedjati'') (PMRS)  emerged to call for the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The council was financially backed by rich Riau Malay \u00e9migr\u00e9s and Chinese merchants who hoped to obtain tin concession. Initially founded in High Street, Singapore, the association moved to Tanjung Pinang, Riau with the unprecedented approval by the Dutch administrators. Based in Tanjung Pinang, the group managed to gain the consent of the Dutch for [[self-governance]] in the region with the foundation of the Riouw Council ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Riouw Raad'', [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Dewan Riouw''). The Riouw Council was the [[devolved]] national [[unicameral]] legislature of Riau, a position equivalent to a [[Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/58742/gerakan-sultan-riau-1946-1950-habis/|title=Gerakan Sultan Riau|date=9 February 2013|publisher=Tanjung Pinang Post|location=Tanjung Pinang|language=Indonesian}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing itself in Tanjung Pinang, the group formed a new organisation known as ''Djawatan Koewasa Pengoeroes Rakjat Riow'' (The Council of Riau People Administration), with the members hailing from [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], [[Great Karimun]], [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] and [[Singkep]]. This group strongly advocated the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate after the status of Indonesia became official. The leader of the council, Raja Abdullah, claimed that Riau Malays were neglected at the expense of the non-Riau Indonesians who dominated the upper ranks of the Riau civil administration. By restoring the monarch, they believed the position of Riau Malays would be guarded. The royalist association met with resistance from the [[Republicanism|republican]] group led by Dr. Iljas Datuk Batuah that sent delegates to Singapore to counter the propaganda of sultanate supporters. Based on Indonesian archive records, Dr. Iljas gained approvals from non-Malay newcomers to Riau, including [[Minang people|Minang]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Palembang]], and [[Batak people]]. He later formed a group known as the ''Badan Kedaulatan Indonesia Riouw'' (BKRI) (Indonesian Riau Sovereign Body) on 8 October 1945. The organisation sought to absorb the Riau Archipelago into the then-[[Indonesian National Revolution|newly independent Indonesia]], as the archipelago was still retained by the Dutch. BKRI hoped that the new administration under [[Soekarno]] would give the [[pribumis]] a fair chance to run the local government.\n\nThe royalist association would not give any public support to the Indonesian movement, as is evident in its refusal to display the ''Bendera Merah-Putih'' ([[Indonesian Flag]]) during the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian Independence Day]] celebration on 17 August 1947 in Singapore. This led republicans to call the royalists 'pro-Dutch'. The royalists however, maintained that Riau was a Dutch territory and that only the Dutch could support it. The Dutch countered the claims of the BKRI by granting [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous rule]] to the Riau Council, in which links with the Dutch would be maintained while a restored sultanate would play a secondary role. The Council, created following the decree of the Governor General of the East Indies on 12 July 1947, was inaugurated on 4 August 1947, and represented a major step forward in the revival of the monarchy system. Several key members of the PMRS were elected to the Riau Council alongside their BKRI rivals, the [[Kapitan Cina|Chinese kapitans]] from Tanjung Pinang and Pulau Tujuh, local Malay leaders of Lingga and Dutch Officials in Tanjung Pinang. On 23 January 1948, the states of the Bangka Council, the Belitung Council, and the Riau Council merged to form the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f3iIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&lpg=PT85&dq=federasi+bangka+belitung+dan+riau#v=onepage&q=federasi%20bangka%20belitung%20dan%20riau&f=false|title=Antara Daerah dan Negara: Indonesia Tahun 1950-an|last=Bemmelen|first=Sita van|last2=Raben|first2=Remco|date=2011|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia|isbn=9789794617724|language=id}}</ref>\n\nThe call for revival of the sultanate continued throughout the period of autonomous rule under the Riau Council, although the influence of republicanism also continued to strengthen. The appeal of revival began to subside following the dissolution of the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation'' on 4 April 1950. After the official withdrawal by the Dutch in 1950, the Riau Archipelago became ''Keresidenan Riau'' under [[Sumatra|Central Sumatra Province]] following the absorption by the [[United States of Indonesia]]. Being one of the last territories merged into Indonesia, Riau was known as the ''daerah-daerah pulihan'' (recovered regions), and the Riau area became a province in August 1957.\n\nThe leader of Riau forces, Major Raja Muhammad Yunus, who led the bid to reestablish the sultanate apart from Indonesia fled into exile in Johor after his ill attempt.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ck13DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=Raja+Muhammad+Yunus+riau#v=onepage&q=Raja%20Muhammad%20Yunus%20riau&f=false|title=The SIJORI Cross-Border Region: Transnational Politics, Economics, and Culture|last=Hutchinson|first=Francis E.|last2=Chong|first2=Terence|date=2016-06-14|publisher=ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute|isbn=9789814695589|language=en}}</ref> The [[Geopolitical|geopolitical roots]] of the Riau Archipelago had molded her nationalist position to be sandwiched between the kindred [[Monarchism|monarchist]] Peninsular [[Ethnic Malays#Malay nationalism|Malay Nationalism]] observed across the border in [[British Malaya]] with the [[Republicanism|pro-republic]] and pan-ethnic [[Indonesian National Awakening|Indonesian Nationalism]] manifested in her own [[Dutch East Indies]] domain.\n\n=== Contemporary era ===\n{{Main|Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation}}\nAfter the war, from 1950 the Riau archipelago was a duty-free zone till the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]] in 1963.

Although the rupiah resembled the [[Indonesian rupiah]] in appearance, it had a much higher value. Malayan money was withdrawn from 1 November 1963. The Riau rupiah was exchangeable as a foreign currency with the Indonesian rupiah. Since 1 July 1964, the Riau rupiah was no longer a valid currency, being replaced by the [[Indonesian rupiah]] at a rate of 1 Riau rupiah = 14.7 Indonesian rupiah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kompasiana.com/andirwansyah/asal-usul-mata-uang-rupiah_552029f8813311bd729de195|title=Asal Usul Mata Uang Rupiah|last=Kompasiana.com|website=KOMPASIANA|language=id|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\nDue to its proximity to [[Singapore]] and [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the Riau Islands area became the focus point during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]].

The province shares maritime border with [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] to the north, the province of [[Bangka Belitung Islands]] and [[Jambi]] in the south, [[East Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and the province of [[West Kalimantan]] in the east and [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and mainland [[Riau]] in the west.\n\nThe island of [[Batam]], which lies within the central core group of islands (the Riau Archipelago), contains a majority of the province's population. Since becoming part of an economic zone with Singapore in 2006, it has experienced high population growth rates. Other highly populated islands in the Riau Archipelago include [[Bintan Island|Bintan]] and [[Great Karimun|Karimun]], while the archipelago also includes islands such as [[Bulan Island|Bulan]] and [[Kundur Island|Kundur]]. There are around 3,200 islands in the province, which has its capital at [[Tanjung Pinang]] in the south of Bintan Island. The Riau Islands province includes the [[Lingga Islands]] to the south of the main [[Riau Archipelago]], while to the northeast lies the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], between [[Borneo]] and mainland [[Malaysia]]; the Tudjuh Archipelago consists of four distinct groups \u2014 the [[Anambas Islands]], [[Natuna Islands]], [[Tambelan Archipelago|Tambelan]] islands and [[Badas Islands]] \u2014 which were attached to the new province, though not geographically part of the Riau Archipelago. The 2015 census count was 1,968,313, less than estimated but it was still the second fastest growing province in Indonesia.\n\nThe highest point in Riau Islands is Mount Daik with a height of 1,165 meters (3,822 ft), which is located on [[Lingga Regency|Lingga]] Island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/gunung-daik-masuk-anugerah-pesona-indonesia/|title=Gunung Daik Masuk Anugerah Pesona Indonesia|last=dediarman|date=2018-05-30|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> Most of the area on [[Lingga Island|Lingga]] Island is hilly.

Most of the province has wet tropical climate, there is rainy season and dry season interspersed with transition season with the lowest average temperature 20.4&nbsp;\u00b0C. In November to February monsoon winds comes from the north and between June to December the monsoon winds comes from the south. During the northern monsoon the wind velocity at sea could range from 20-30 knots, on land the wind can range from 3-15 knots. This causes potentially extreme weather in the Riau Islands with rainfall of about 150-200 millimeters and wave height between 1.2 meters up to 3 meters.\nAs in most other province of Indonesia, the Riau Islands has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Af'') bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.

It is depends on the different between seawater level in northern part of [[Andaman Sea]] and southern part of Malacca Strait. Since seawater level in [[Pacific Ocean]] is always higher than in [[Indian Ocean|Indian Oceans]], the seawater level in [[South China Sea]] is also higher than in Andaman Sea through out the year resulted in Malacca Strait there is a current, which flow to Northwest direction through out the year. In November to April, during the Northeast monsoon, Andaman Sea\u2019s current goes to the north. Therefore majority of water masses are transported to the north. Consequent of this, during these months, Andaman Sea\u2019s water masses will be empty, and sea water level will be low or the different from South China Sea\u2019s sea water level will be higher. This sea water level reaches to maximum in February to March, while the different of sea water level between Northern and southern parts of Strait is about 50 cm, which resulted current velocity is about 12 cm/sec to Northwest.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nConversely, during the southwest monsoon, May to October, most of the currents in western part of [[Andaman Sea]] go to east and south, therefore water masses will be gathering in Andaman Sea. This resulted in that sea water level increases in northern part of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]], and the different of sea water level to [[South China Sea]]\u2019s water level will be small, although in southern part of the Strait the sea water level is still higher. During this season, the water current in Malacca Strait flows to the north, with speed is little bit lower. Current velocity reaches to maximum in around [[July]] to [[August]], with speed about 5 cm/sec. Oceanographic pattern is likely to affect the water quality and reef corals in the study sites. Strong wind during the wet monsoon period, for example, could cause water turbulence which affecting on high sediment, especially in coastal areas, and this might be worse with the high sediment run off from surrounding rivers and/or reclamation areas, such as happened in [[Batam]].

The geographical location can be a leverage in attracting foreign and domestic investors. However, the strategic geographical location will not provide benefits if the Riau Islands do not have competitiveness.

Because the Riau Islands is a new developing province and almost half of the existing human resources come from outside the Riau Islands, this has caused housing needs in the Riau Islands to be out of proportion to their availability. This condition also seems to have caused housing costs to rise in the Riau Islands relatively faster than in other regions. The results of the National Socio-Economic Survey show that on average the expenditure per capita of the population for rental costs/housing contracts is the highest type of expenditure for non-food commodities, and the figure tends to increase every year.

When viewed from the harvested area and rice production in 2011, it experienced a very small increase as well as productivity. Rice productivity in 2010 was 3.15 tons per hectare, cassava was 10.82 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 7.72 tons per hectare. The increase in productivity of rice and cassava was only 0.01 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 0.03 tons per hectare. [[Maize|Corn]] and [[peanut]] crops are food crops in Riau Islands with low productivity during 2010-2011. Whereas for corn productivity in 2010 amounted to 2.13 tons per hectare decreased to 2.12 tons per hectare in 2011. While for peanuts the productivity remained, at 0.92 tons per hectare. Decrease in corn productivity is due to the harvested area for maize also has decreased, besides it is also the effect of pests that cause disruption of corn pests.<ref name=\":6\" /> Plantation and horticultural crops are types of plants that are quite potential to be cultivated in Riau Islands. This is based on the high price of agricultural products produced by these two types of businesses. As shown by the NTP (Farmer Exchange Rate) data, only estate and horticultural farmers have almost certainly an index value above 100. This condition is of course caused by the still higher price of goods produced by farmers compared to the price of goods needed, both for consumption and the cost of production. Production of [[Natural rubber|rubber]] plants in 2011 experienced a very high increase of 118 percent. While [[coconut]] plants experienced a very small increase of 2.4 percent.

They are the native people of the [[Riau Archipelago]]. From the ancient times, the Riau Archipelago is considered the hub of Malay cultures. In the past, several Malay kingdoms and sultanates existed in the archipelago, the most notably being the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]]. A major sub-group of the Malay inhabiting the province is the [[Orang Laut|''Orang laut'']] (sea people).  The ''Orang laut'' are Malays who are [[Nomad|nomadic]] in nature and have a rich marine culture. Presently, many ''Orang laut'' have settled in coastal areas of the province. The ''Orang laut'' are encompasses of numerous tribes and groups inhabiting the islands and estuaries in the Riau-Lingga Archipelagos, the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], the [[Batam]] Archipelago, and the coasts and offshore islands of eastern [[Sumatra]], southern [[Malay Peninsula|Malaysia Peninsula]] and [[Singapore]].<ref>[http://www.bartelby.net/67/837.html \"The Malay Peninsula and Archipelago 1511\u20131722\" ''The Encyclopedia of World History'' 2001];</ref> The geographical condition of the Riau Islands, which has almost 99% of its area as water, has made quite a number of ''Orang Laut'' groups living in this area.

It served as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the province.\n\nThe [[Karimun Regency]] has several dialects namely the Kundur dialect and the Bintan-Karimun dialect. In general, it uses the Johor-Riau dialect. The main characteristic of this dialect is the suffix \"A\" which sounds as \"E\". The word /saya/ and /apa/ (\"I\" and \"What\" respectively) will be pronounced as /saye/ and /ape/ in the Johor-Riau dialect, which is similar to the Malay used in [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The dialects used in the [[Bintan Regency]] are the Bintan-Karimun dialect, the Malang Rapat-Kelong dialect which is used in Malang Rapat village and Kelong village and the Mantang Lama dialect in Mantang Lama Village in Kijang. The word pronunciation is similar to the Malay used in Tanjung Pinang and Karimun. The Malay used in the [[Lingga Regency]] is also similar to the Malay used in the Karimun and BIitan Regency. The variety of Malay spoken in the province's northernmost regencies, [[Anambas Islands Regency|Anambas]] and [[Natuna Regency|Natuna]], is not only mutually unintelligible to the standard Indonesian language, but also mutually unintelligible to the Malay varieties spoken in Bintan and Karimun. The Anambas Malay dialect slightly resembles the [[Pontianak Malay]] dialect spoken in [[West Kalimantan]] and the Belitung Malay dialect spoken in [[Bangka Belitung Islands|Bangka-Belitung]], especially their vocabulary and phonology. For example, ''kitak'' or ''ketak'' which means you, ''wan'' which means grandma and ''suduk'' which means spoon are both used in Anambas and Pontianak. The Natuna Malay people spoke a dialect of Malay that is influenced by [[Terengganu Malay]] and [[Pahang Malay]] that are spoken in the Malaysian states of [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]] respectively, as most of the people living there trace their origins from the eastern coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]].

The Riau Islands Hokkien is related  to the Hokkien spoken in mainland Riau, such as the town of [[Bagansiapiapi]] and [[Selat Panjang]], as well as the Hokkien spoken in Central and Southern [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

It is markedly distinct from [[Penang Hokkien]] and [[Medan Hokkien]], which are based on [[Zhangzhou dialect]], another Hokkien dialect originated from the city of [[Zhangzhou]], also in Fujian. Other varieties of Chinese are also spoken in the province, such as [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Cantonese]], albeit to a lesser extent compared to Hokkien. Hokkien serves as the ''lingua franca'' of the Chinese people in the Riau Islands. Most of the Chinese varieties spoken in the region has been greatly influenced by [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], especially their vocabulary.\n\nOther ethnic groups who migrated from other parts of Indonesia brought their own language, such as the [[Javanese language]] spoken by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau language]] spoken by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and different varieties of [[Batak languages|Batak]] spoken by different sub-groups of the [[Batak]] people.\n\n[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely used as the national language. Most formal [[education]], and nearly all national [[mass media]], [[governance]], [[Public administration|administration]], [[judiciary]], and other forms of communication in the Riau Islands, are conducted in Indonesian. It is also used for inter-ethnic communication. Indonesian is spoken as the first language in major cities such as [[Batam]] and [[Tanjung Pinang]], while it is spoken as a second language elsewhere in the province. The [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese people]] in the Riau Islands uses Indonesian as their third language, with Hokkien or other [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] being used as their first language and the local Riau Malay as their second language.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{bar box|width=250px|barwidth=100px|title=Religion in the Riau Islands (2016)<ref name=\"Kemenag2016\">{{cite web| title = Riau Islands Religion Profile in 2016 | work =  [[Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs]] | year = 2016 |url = https://kepri.kemenag.go.id/public/files/040920170319221988430497.pdf}}</ref>|titlebar=#ddd|left1=Religion|right1=Percent|float=right|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Islam]]|Green|77.56}}\n{{bar percent|[[Christianity]]|Violet|14.67}}\n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|Yellow|7.55}}\n{{bar percent|[[Confucianism]]|Black|0.17}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|Magenta|0.05}}}}The local Malay people of the Riau region since ancient times and even until the present-day is considered as a society that is accommodating, friendly, and welcome to immigrants who come to bring new cultures and religions, both from within and outside the country. The example are immigrants from [[India]] with [[Hinduism]], from [[China]] with [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]], from [[Europe]] with [[Christianity]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], as well as other migrants from various ethnic groups in the [[Nusantara]] archipelago.  Based on the composition of the population of the Riau Islands which is full of diversity with different socio-cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, it is basically an asset for the Riau Archipelago itself. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of the province are very diverse, including [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].\n\nAs of 2016, [[Islam]] is the dominant religion in the province, forming 77.56% of the total population. [[Islam]] is generally adhered by the ethnic [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Banjar people|Banjars]], [[Bugis]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and some [[Batak]] sub-group. Islam has entered the region since at least the [[12th century]]. Contact between the indigenous population and Muslim traders from the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian peninsula]], [[Iran|Persia]] and India did occur for the first time in the northern Sumatra region because of its strategic position to traders stopover at that time. This condition strengthens the indication that the [[Islamization]] process is expected to have taken place since the contact took place so that a community was formed where the Arabs who settled in the village were married to local residents thus forming Muslim communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/164474-ID-islamisasi-di-riau-kajian-sejarah-dan-bu.pdf|title=Islamization in Riau: Historical and Cultural Study of the entry and the development of Islam in Kuntu Kampar|last=Roza|first=Ellya|last2=Yasnel|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> [[Islam]] is generally adhered by the ethnic [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Banjar people|Banjars]], [[Bugis]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and some [[Batak]] sub-group. Several Muslim organizations in Indonesia has branches in the Riau Islands, such as [[Muhammadiyah]] and the [[Nahdlatul Ulama]].\n\n[[Christianity]] forms the second-largest religion group in the province, forming around 14.67% of the total population. The two largest Christian domination in the Riau Islands are [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], forming around 12.21% and 2.46% of the total population respectively. Most of the people who adhered Protestantism are from [[Batak]] sub-groups (specifically [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]], [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]]), [[Nias people|Nias]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], and immigrants from [[North Sulawesi]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Western New Guinea|Papua]], while most of the people who adhered Catholicism are immigrants from [[East Nusa Tenggara]]. The province does not has its own Catholic [[Diocese]]. Instead, it is served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pangkal-Pinang]], which is based in [[Pangkal Pinang|Pangkal-Pinang]], [[Bangka Belitung Islands]].\n\n[[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] forms a significant minority in the province, forming around 7.55% and 0.17% respectively. They are mostly adhered by the Chinese. Lastly, [[Hinduism]] only forms around 0.05% of the total population, which is mostly adhered by [[Balinese people|Balinese]] immigrants and [[Indian Indonesians|Indonesians of Indian descent]].\n\n== Culture ==\nThe culture of the Riau Islands is strongly influenced by the culture of the [[Malay culture|Malays]] and the Chinese people. Some ethnic groups, for example Javanese, Balinese, Bugis, Batak, and European culture also influenced the culture of the province. The culture of the Riau Islands is also influenced by the [[Islamic culture|culture of Islam]]. The Malay people that inhabits Riau Islands is also overwhelmingly adhered to Islam. In addition to Islam, the culture of the Riau Islands has also been influenced by the other religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Confucianism]]. However, as the Riau Islands is considered as the home of the Malay people and part of the [[Malay world]], the culture of the Riau Islands mostly relate to the culture of the Malay people themselves.\n\nWhat is typical of the Malay people is the designation of a nickname for a specific person in a family. The first child in a Malay family is called ''long'' or ''sulung'', the second child is called ''ngah''/''ongah'', the third child is called ''cik'' and the youngest child is called ''cu/ucu''. The nickname is usually followed by a word that describes the physical characteristics of the person concerned, for example ''cik'' ''itam,'' which means a third child with a dark/black characteristic. This culture can only be found in the Riau Malay community, both in the Riau Islands as well as mainland Riau.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilmuseni.com/seni-budaya/kebudayaan-suku-melayu|title=Kebudayaan Suku Melayu yang Paling Fenomenal|last=Antono|first=Agil|date=2017-12-28|website=IlmuSeni.com|language=id|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nA typical Riau Malay ''[[Kampong|kampung]]'' (village) are led by a village chief called the ''penghulu''. Presently, the ''penghulu'' is a village administrator chosen based on government regulations. Besides the ''penghulu'' there is also a leader in the religious sector called ''[[imam]]''. This ''imam'' takes care of all matters relating to religion, such as religious studies and lessons, marriage/ divorce/reconciliation, the distribution of inheritance, collection of [[zakat]] and others. Thus the ''penghulu'' accompanied by the ''imam'' are the leader of the ''kampung''.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |last=Annisa|first=Pahlevi|title=Kebudayaan-melayu-riau |url=https://www.academia.edu/7535760 |website=Academia |language=id}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''kampung'', most of the local people knew each other, because the villagers had a strong sense of attachment to each other. Harmony is a characteristic of the community of these ''kampung''. The existence of harmony is not caused by external coercion in the form of harsh sanctions, but it does arise from a conscience that is influenced by the norms that live in the community. Starting from the movements, attitudes and traits are influenced by these factors. Avoiding things that can cause disgrace and shame is a motivating factor for continuing to act and be kind to others and such feelings are stronger than feelings of sin. All actions must be maintained so as not to cause \"discordant eyes\", \"discordant ears\", \"discordant manners\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arts and Performance===\n[[File:Joget-Dangkong.jpg|thumb|A troupe of local Riau Malay dancers performing the [[Joget|Joget Lambak]]. (taken in the late 19th century)]]\nVarious forms and types of arts found in the Riau region, namely theater, dance, music, singing, and literature. Artists in urban areas generally feel alien to traditional arts. Therefore, an appreciative link is needed by introducing all types and forms of traditional arts in urban areas. Thus, contemporary art that grows, lives, and develops in urban areas will have a solid and tidy foundation in contributing to national art.\n\nIn the late 1890s, the Rusydiah Club was founded, an association for scholars, writers, and cultural figures.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323835285|title=The Rushdiah Club: Its roles in Malay Societies, 1892-1940|last=Zakariya|first=Hafiz|last2=Oktasari|first2=Wiwin|date=2017-12-29|isbn=9789674186319}}</ref> This association was established in the Riau Islands, precisely on [[Penyengat Island]] which at that time was the center of the government of the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate|Sultanate of Riau-Lingga]]. In essence, this association is a cultural institution that includes art, performance and literature. Its activities began with the commemoration of Islamic holidays, such as [[Mawlid|Maulud Nabi]], [[Isra and Mi'raj|Isra-Mikraj]], [[History of the Quran|Nuzulul Quran]], [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid al-Fit]]<nowiki/>r, [[Eid al-Adha]], and others which later developed to the publication of books by members of the association. All activities are supported by royal facilities in the form of the Marah Ahmadi Khanah Polar library and two [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]] printing presses, namely Mathba\u2018at al Ahmadiyah and Mathba\u2018at al Riauwiyah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/makam-merah-dan-alias-wello/|title=Makam Merah dan Alias Wello|last=dediarman|date=2016-12-29|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> The Rusydiah Klub is the first association of scholars in Indonesia. This association is not mentioned in national history, because of the lack of careful collection of historical material, or maybe because there is no input from those who know much about it. Rusydiah Club left behind a valuable heritage of creativity in the form of books of literature, religion, history and linguistics.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Riau region has long been an area of trade traffic in neighboring countries, so Riau has given birth to diverse cultural figures and colors. This is a burden, as well as a historical-geographical blessing. Riau seems to be a field of association of various artistic potentials, in which there are cultural influences in neighboring countries and other Indonesian cultures. Riau Malay art is very diverse, because small groups that exist in the community are also developing.<ref name=\":2\" /> The fact shows, the arts in Riau and the arts in Malay countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]] mutually complement and influence each other. Likewise, Malay cultural regions such as [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli]], [[Sultanate of Langkat|Langkat]], [[Serdang Malays|Serdang]] and [[Asahan Sultanate|Asahan]] in [[North Sumatra]], [[Jambi]], [[West Kalimantan]], and others, were also affected by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]], [[Buginese people|Bugis]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] cultures. Cultures influence that come from outside Indonesia such as [[India]] ([[Hindus|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]]), [[Arabs|Arabic]] ([[Islam]]), [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], and [[Thai culture|Siamese]] influence. The flexibility of Malay culture is in line with the historical development and geographical location of Riau, making Riau very rich with a variety of artistic expressions. The development of Malay culture in Riau, in turn, can enrich national culture.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''[[Baju Kurung|Baju kurung]]'' is one of the traditional clothes of the Malay community in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[southern Thailand]]. ''[[Baju Kurung|Baju kurung]]'' is often associated with women. The hallmark of the clothes brackets is the loose design on the holes in the arms, abdomen, and chest. When worn, the bottom of the clothes bracket is parallel to the groin, but for rare cases there are also those that extend to knee level. Shirt brackets are not fitted with buttons, but are almost similar to t-shirts. Shirt brackets are also not collared, each end is crochet. Some parts are often decorated with gold embroidery. At first, the clothes of the brackets were usually worn for the great ceremony of Malay by women in the kingdom, used together with ''[[songket]]'' cloth to be used as a scabbard, various gold jewelry, and a small bag or fan. Since the majority of Malay communities embraced [[Islam]], many women who wear clothes in brackets match them with the [[hijab]], although there are also those who do not use them. Now the clothes of brackets are widely worn by ordinary people, used by children to read the [[Quran]], or ladies to go to the market, without including accessories that seem luxurious.\n\nHowever, the main traditional dress of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh'' and the ''Teluk Belanga.''<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.raparapa.co/pakaian-adat/|title=34 Pakaian Adat di Indonesia, Kekayaan yang Masih Dilestarikan|last=Raparapa|date=2017-01-13|website=Raparapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref> The ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh a''re specifically worn by women. It is typically worn at the time of traditional ceremonies and official events of the local community. The hallmark of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' traditional clothing is the length of the kebaya to cover the knees with the shape of the kebaya looking wide and open. ''Kebaya Labuh'' is often combined with [[batik]] cloth such as cual fabric. For the wedding, the groom wore a head covering called ''[[Tengkolok|Tanjak]]''. The spindle is a rectangular [[songket]] that is folded into a headband. A distinctive feature of the ''Teluk Belanga'' custom clothing is a plain color paired with shades of color, a sheath worn over the knee that acts as a scarf, a headband made of songket cloth called the ''tanjak''. The custom attire of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' is complemented by a headdress called a peak which is a head covering made of square ''songket'' shaped like songkok or peci.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bp-guide.id/AXOkKPew|title=9+ Ragam Baju Adat Sumatera Yang Keren dan Wajib Kamu Tahu (2018)|website=BP Guide - Temukan hadiah terbaikmu|language=id|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> Typically, the skirt is only used for formal ceremonies or events such as feasts and custom ceremonies. However, these decorations are usually only worn on formal occasions such as death or marriage. Occasionally, ''Teluk Belangga'' clothing is usually accompanied by a ''[[Songkok|peci]]''. For women, the ''Kebaya Labuh'' is usually combined with batik and also with a scarf.\n[[File:Raiyani Muharramah-Silat pengantin.jpg|thumb|Malay men performing the ''Silat Pengantin'' traditional dance in a wedding ceremony at [[Lingga Regency|Lingga Islands]]]]\nThe ''[[Mak yong]]'' is one of the traditional dances that can be found in the Riau Islands. ''Mak Yong'' is a traditional theatrical art of the Malay community which is still sustainable today. Although it is not often performed, every service is always welcomed by enthusiastic residents, especially those who love Malay culture and native art. ''Mak Yong'' performances are usually performed by groups of dancers and musicians, who combine various religious elements, theatrical, dance, music, vocals and texts. The main characters are male and female, both are performed by female dancers. The ''Mak yong'' performance is accompanied by musical instruments such as fiddle and drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kepri-travel.kepriprov.go.id/item/makyong/|title=MAKYONG {{!}} Wonderful Kepri - Official Site|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> In the Riau Islands region, the ''Mak Yong'' oral tradition has been exhibited since several centuries ago and has spread to [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], [[Johor]], [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]]. In the Riau Islands, this oral tradition developed rapidly during the sultanate era. ''Mak yong'' theater performing arts is played with dances, songs and jokes that are intertwined in a story line, the players are 20 people, women wearing glittering costumes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/ditwdb/makyong-kepulauan-riau-seni-pertujukkan/|title=Makyong Kepulauan Riau, Seni Pertujukkan|last=ditwdb|date=2019-04-30|website=Direktorat Warisan dan Diplomasi Budaya|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n''[[Zapin]]'' is a Malay traditional dance that can be found in both the Riau Islands and mainland. This dance is one of several types of Malay dance that still exists today. According to history, in the beginning this dance was a dance of entertainment in the palace after being brought from [[Hadhramaut|Hadramaut]] in [[Yemen]] by Arab traders in the early [[16th century|16th century.]] At that time the country of [[Johor]] became a substitute for the role of [[Malacca]] as an international port in the 16th century. This can be seen from the development of ''Zapin'' dance creations that are identical with Malay culture and in terms of rhyming. Artists and culture are able to make traditional art, not stopping but full of dynamics that are always acceptable in every circumstance. This traditional dance is both educational and entertaining, and is used as an Islamic [[Dawah|da'wah]] medium through ''Zapin'' songs that are sung. The accompanying music consists of fiddles, tambourines, drums and small drum percussion instruments called [[Mirwas|marwas]] or maracas. The ''Zapin'' dance focuses more on teamwork rather than individual efforts. Before the 1960s, ''Zapin'' was only performed by male dancers but now it is usually danced by female dancers or both male and female.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/tari-zapin/|title=Tari Zapin|last=dediarman|date=2014-06-08|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Malemang'' dance is a traditional Riau dance by the people of [[Bintan Island|Bintan]]. It originated back in the [[12th century]] in Tanjungpisau. Originally, it was only performed at the Royal Palace of the Kingdom of Bentan in Bukit Batu, Bintan. As the kingdom collapsed, this dance became a folk entertainment show. At present, ''Malemang'' Dance is displayed in various events, including festivals. In the show, the dancers demonstrate their ability to take something (handkerchief, change, etc.). They do this by flexing (standing up, bending backwards). From this skill then this dance is called ''malemang'' or ''melemang''. In Tanjungpisau, this dance is better known as the ''Melemang Bintan Penaga'' Dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogkulo.com/daftar-10-tarian-daerah-riau-kepri/|title=Daftar 10 Nama Tarian Daerah Riau & Kepulauan Riau untuk Anda Ketahui|last=Kulo|first=oleh Blog|date=2019-05-25|website=Blog Kulo|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:TMII Riau Pavilion Malay House 02.jpg|thumb|A typical Malay traditional house in the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]], Jakarta]]\nIn [[Malay culture]], the art of development also has characteristics that are reflected in the symbols of traditional houses that are full of meaning. At present, Malay traditional houses can still be found in several regions in the [[Riau Archipelago]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and other [[Malay world|Malay-populated countries]]. In traditional Malay society, a house is an intact building that can be used as a family residence, meeting place and shelter for anyone in need. Therefore, traditional Malay houses are generally large, usually with six poles, six porch poles and twelve poles or porch houses. Of the several forms of the house, all are almost identical, both stairs, doors, walls and room layout are identical. In addition to being large, the Malay house is also always in the form of a stage or a house with a hole, facing towards the sunrise. In general, the types of Malay houses include dwellings, halls, houses of worship and storage houses. The naming is adjusted to the function of each building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2013/12/rumah-adat-riau-dan-kepulauan-riau/|title=Rumah Adat Riau dan Kepulauan Riau|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\nRiau Malay traditional house buildings are generally given a variety of decorations, starting from the door, window, ventilation to the top of the roof of the building, the decoration is adjusted to the meaning of each carving.  Additionally, these houses are also given a pattern. The pattern of a [[Riau Malays|Riau Malay]] house is largely derived from nature, consisting of flora, fauna, and space objects. These things are designed in certain forms, either in their original form such as backdrops, forest flowers, or in abstracted or modified forms so that they no longer appear in their original form, but simply use their name.\n\nThe ''Limas Potong'' house is one of the traditional houses of the Malays inhabiting the [[Riau Archipelago]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://situsbudaya.id/rumah-limas-potong-batam/|title=Rumah Limas Potong Batam|date=2017-11-30|website=Informasi Situs Budaya Indonesia|language=id-ID|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> ''Limas Potong'' is a stilt house, like a traditional house in [[Sumatra]] in general. Height of about 1.5 meters from the ground surface. The walls of the house are made of brown planks, while the roof is red zinc. The doors, windows and pillars on the front of the house are painted in white oil. ''Limas Potong'' has five main parts, namely terrace, front room, center, back (bed), and kitchen. The front of the house is used to display historical photographs of this traditional house, the living room contains a typical Malay bridal diorama, and the back is a room that contains a mosquito net that integrates with the kitchen.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOne of the most famous traditional house of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''Belah Bubung'' traditional house. This house is also known as the ''Rabung'' house or the ''Bumbung Melayu'' house. The name ''Belah Bubung'' was given by the Malays because the shape of the roof was split. The size of the house built is determined by the ability of its owner, the richer a person is, the bigger the house and the more variety of decoration. However, wealth is not an absolute determinant. The most important consideration in making a home is harmony with the owner. To determine whether or not a house is compatible, the owner calculates the size of the house by cubits, from one to five. The veins are: snake swimming, pursuing ripples, ripples climbing beetles shelter, debt out of debt changed debt, and five debt has not been affected. The best measure is if it is right on the count of ripples to climb the shade beetle.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Traditional weapon===\n''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a traditional weapon originating from the Riau Islands. ''[[Badik]]'' itself is a term for traditional weapons which is known among the Bugis community and some regions in [[Sumatra]]. Meanwhile, Tumbuk Lada is a traditional weapon of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]]. No wonder the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' has similarities with weapons from other Malay-populated region. The Riau Islands are inhabited by various races and ethnicity. However, the majority of indigenous people are Malay people. Therefore, the culture of the Riau region has a lot in common with other indigenous Malay regions.  ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a type of stabbing weapon measuring 27 to 29 cm and its width is around 3.5 to 4 cm. This weapon is not only used by the people of [[Jambi]], and also has similarities with the [[Buginese people|Buginese]] ''Badik'', it only differs in the shape and motive of the holster. Not only domestically, Malaysia also has the same traditional weapons, both in name and form. This is inseparable from the background of Malay communities spread throughout [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]] and along the Malay peninsula. Similar to the ''[[Kris|keris]]'', ''badik'' is also one of the identities that characterizes the Malay people. Until now the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is still used by the people of the Riau islands to do production work such as farming or hunting. Some local customs also still maintain the ''badik'' as a complement to men's custom clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2014/09/senjata-tradisional-kepulauan-riau/|title=Senjata Tradisional Kepulauan Riau|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Jenawi'' is a type of sword that became the most popular traditional weapon in the Riau area. This sword was often used by Malay warlords in the face of his enemies. The sword has a length of about 1 meter so it is often used for close combat. ''Jenawi'' sword is similar to a typical Japanese [[katana]]. Historians and cultural experts argue that this weapon originated from ancient Japan which experienced acculturation with Malay culture. Regardless of this opinion, the sword of genius remains a Malay people's identity on the national scene.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Malay cuisine}}\n[[File:Nasi Lemak Sambal Cumi in Indonesia 2.jpg|thumb|[[Nasi lemak|Nasi Lemak]] Sambal Cumi, a variety of Nasi Lemak that can be found in the Riau Islands ]]\nCuisine in the Riau Islands are mostly similar to the one in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], owing to its similar culture. There are also some dishes that is influenced by other parts of Indonesia, such as Java. Due to its cultural diversity, the people of the Riau Islands has developed a unique dishes that cannot be found in other parts of Indonesia. The Riau Islands cuisine is strongly influenced by the culture of the Malay, [[Culture of India|Indian]] and [[Chinese culture|Chinese]]. Some foods are also influenced by the culture of the [[Javanese culture|Javanese]], [[Balinese cuisine|Balinese]], [[Buginese people|Bugis]], other ethnic groups in [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]], as well as European cultures, especially the British and Dutch. \n\nOne of the most popular dish in the Riau Islands is its variety of the [[Nasi lemak]], with some notable differences compared to the variety found in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore.

The name of lakse is taken from Sanskrit which has a lot meaning. It shows that lute noodle is made with various spices. Lakse in the Riau Islands presented in several kinds, one of which is a typical Anambas lakse which is included in the category of lakse curry with a fatty and spicy sauce and rich in spices. One of the most typical mackerel soups of Batam, popularly known as the Batam Fish Soup ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Sup Ikan Batam'').

His novel use of tax records enabled him to gather data on the very top economic elite, who had previously been understudied, and to ascertain their rate of accumulation of wealth and how this compared to the rest of society and economy. His most recent book, ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', relies on economic data going back 250 years to show that an ever-rising concentration of wealth is not self-correcting. To address this problem, he proposes redistribution through a progressive global tax on wealth.<ref name=\"nybooks1\"/><ref>An In-depth review by Robert Boyer, leader of the French R\u00e9gulation school [http://regulation.revues.org/10618 in R\u00e9gulation Review]</ref>\n\n=== Study of long-term economic inequalities ===\n[[File:Thomas Piketty- Extreme inequality is useless for growth.webm|thumb|Thomas Piketty: Extreme inequality is useless for growth]]\nA research project on high incomes in France led to the book ''Les hauts revenus en France au XXe si\u00e8cle'' (''High incomes in France in the 20th Century'', Grasset, 2001), which was based on a survey of statistical series covering the whole of the 20th century, built from data from the fiscal services (particularly income tax declarations). He extended this analysis in his immensely popular book ''Le Capital au XXIe si\u00e8cle'' (''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'').\nA study by [[Emmanuel Saez]] and Piketty showed that the top 10 percent of earners took more than half of the country's total income in 2012, the highest level recorded since the government began collecting the relevant data a century ago.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-richer-through-the-recovery/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Annie | last=Lowrey | title=The Rich Get Richer Through the Recovery | date=10 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/27/the-presidents-inequality-absurdities/ | work=New York Post | first=Michael | last=Tanner | title=The president's 'inequality' absurdities | date=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2012.pdf|title=Striking it Richer : The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (Updated with 2012 preliminary estimates)|author=Emmanuel Saez|date=September 3, 2013|website=Eml.berkeley.edu|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Survey on the evolution of inequalities in France ===\nPiketty's work shows that differences in earnings dropped sharply during the 20th century in France, mostly after World War II. He argues that this was due to a decrease in estate inequalities, while wage inequalities remained stable. The shrinking inequality during this period, Piketty says, resulted from a highly progressive income tax after the war, which upset the dynamics of estate accumulation by reducing the surplus money available for saving by the wealthiest.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe normative conclusion Piketty draws is that a tax cut and thus a decrease in the financial contribution to society of the wealthy that has been happening in France since the late 1990s will assist in the rebuilding of the earlier large fortunes of the [[Rentier state|rentier]] class. This trend will lead to the rise of what he calls patrimonial capitalism, in which a few families control most of the wealth.<ref name=Cassidy/>\n\nThrough a statistical survey, Piketty also showed that the [[Laffer curve|Laffer effect]], which claims that high marginal tax rates on top incomes are an incentive for the rich to work less, was probably negligible in the case of France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/public/Piketty1998d.pdf|title=Les Hauts revenus face aux modifications des taux marginaux sup\u00e9rieurs de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu en France, 1970\u20131996|publisher=\u00c9conomie et pr\u00e9vision, n\u00b0 138\u2013139|date=1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Comparative work ===\nPiketty has done comparative work on inequality in other developed countries.

Banerjee, R. Benabou et D. Mookerhee (eds.), ''Understanding poverty'', Oxford university press, 2005.</ref> According to Kuznets, the long-term evolution of earnings inequalities was shaped as a curve ([[Simon_Kuznets#Kuznets_curve|Kuznets curve]]). Growth started at the beginning of the industrial revolution, and slackened off later due to the reallocation of the labor force from low productivity sectors like agriculture to higher productivity sectors like industry.\n\nAccording to Piketty, the tendency observed by Kuznets in the early 1950s is not necessarily a product of deep economic forces (e.g. sectoral spillover or the effects of technological progress). Instead, estate values, rather than wage inequalities, decreased, and they did so for reasons that were not specifically economic (for example, the creation of income tax). Consequently, the decrease would not necessarily continue, and in fact, inequalities have grown sharply in the United States over the last thirty years, returning to their 1930s level.\n\n=== Other work ===\nBesides these surveys, which make up the core of his work, Piketty has published in other areas, often with a connection to economic inequalities. His work on schools, for example, postulates that disparities among different schools, especially class sizes, are a cause for the persistence of inequalities in wages and the economy.<ref>T.

To address this problem, he proposes redistribution through a progressive global tax on wealth.<ref name=\"nybooks1\"/><ref>An In-depth review by Robert Boyer, leader of the French R\u00e9gulation school [http://regulation.revues.org/10618 in R\u00e9gulation Review]</ref>\n\n=== Study of long-term economic inequalities ===\n[[File:Thomas Piketty- Extreme inequality is useless for growth.webm|thumb|Thomas Piketty: Extreme inequality is useless for growth]]\nA research project on high incomes in France led to the book ''Les hauts revenus en France au XXe si\u00e8cle'' (''High incomes in France in the 20th Century'', Grasset, 2001), which was based on a survey of statistical series covering the whole of the 20th century, built from data from the fiscal services (particularly income tax declarations). He extended this analysis in his immensely popular book ''Le Capital au XXIe si\u00e8cle'' (''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'').\nA study by [[Emmanuel Saez]] and Piketty showed that the top 10 percent of earners took more than half of the country's total income in 2012, the highest level recorded since the government began collecting the relevant data a century ago.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-richer-through-the-recovery/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Annie | last=Lowrey | title=The Rich Get Richer Through the Recovery | date=10 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/27/the-presidents-inequality-absurdities/ | work=New York Post | first=Michael | last=Tanner | title=The president's 'inequality' absurdities | date=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2012.pdf|title=Striking it Richer : The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (Updated with 2012 preliminary estimates)|author=Emmanuel Saez|date=September 3, 2013|website=Eml.berkeley.edu|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Survey on the evolution of inequalities in France ===\nPiketty's work shows that differences in earnings dropped sharply during the 20th century in France, mostly after World War II. He argues that this was due to a decrease in estate inequalities, while wage inequalities remained stable. The shrinking inequality during this period, Piketty says, resulted from a highly progressive income tax after the war, which upset the dynamics of estate accumulation by reducing the surplus money available for saving by the wealthiest.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe normative conclusion Piketty draws is that a tax cut and thus a decrease in the financial contribution to society of the wealthy that has been happening in France since the late 1990s will assist in the rebuilding of the earlier large fortunes of the [[Rentier state|rentier]] class. This trend will lead to the rise of what he calls patrimonial capitalism, in which a few families control most of the wealth.<ref name=Cassidy/>\n\nThrough a statistical survey, Piketty also showed that the [[Laffer curve|Laffer effect]], which claims that high marginal tax rates on top incomes are an incentive for the rich to work less, was probably negligible in the case of France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/public/Piketty1998d.pdf|title=Les Hauts revenus face aux modifications des taux marginaux sup\u00e9rieurs de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu en France, 1970\u20131996|publisher=\u00c9conomie et pr\u00e9vision, n\u00b0 138\u2013139|date=1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Comparative work ===\nPiketty has done comparative work on inequality in other developed countries.

Banerjee, R. Benabou et D. Mookerhee (eds.), ''Understanding poverty'', Oxford university press, 2005.</ref> According to Kuznets, the long-term evolution of earnings inequalities was shaped as a curve ([[Simon_Kuznets#Kuznets_curve|Kuznets curve]]). Growth started at the beginning of the industrial revolution, and slackened off later due to the reallocation of the labor force from low productivity sectors like agriculture to higher productivity sectors like industry.\n\nAccording to Piketty, the tendency observed by Kuznets in the early 1950s is not necessarily a product of deep economic forces (e.g. sectoral spillover or the effects of technological progress). Instead, estate values, rather than wage inequalities, decreased, and they did so for reasons that were not specifically economic (for example, the creation of income tax). Consequently, the decrease would not necessarily continue, and in fact, inequalities have grown sharply in the United States over the last thirty years, returning to their 1930s level.\n\n=== Other work ===\nBesides these surveys, which make up the core of his work, Piketty has published in other areas, often with a connection to economic inequalities. His work on schools, for example, postulates that disparities among different schools, especially class sizes, are a cause for the persistence of inequalities in wages and the economy.<ref>T.
