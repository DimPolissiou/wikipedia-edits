The story begins when one such device is discovered on Earth. The 1994 film and subsequent television series depict how the device is kept under the control of the United States government, who use it to conduct interplanetary missions by dialing the thousands of stargates located in the galaxy, which are the legacy of an ancient civilization. The expeditions originally had the goal of acquiring extremely rare resources, new technology and detecting threats; but often face scientific and humanitarian issues and the dilemmas of interacting with different societies. Finally they resulted in a unified ''United Nation''-coalition to better support the constant need to continue the program to defend Earth from invading aliens.\n\nCombined with the notion that the Stargate is a secret, ''Stargate'' productions are notable for presenting no contradiction with reality, being set in the [[present day]] on an otherwise normal Earth, and being dominated by human interaction in the galaxy. In the story of the 1994 film, this is explained as being the result of forced deportations by aliens, with the suggestion that most ancient [[mythology|mythologies]] are the result of aliens posing as gods in the distant past (as in unproven [[ancient astronauts]]).\n\nThe longest-running series, ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' sets the context having the ''[[Milky Way]]'' galaxy as a [[failed state]] in which Goa'uld System Lords war against each other, due to the death of Ra in the film undermining the existing social structure of the System Lords due to Ra's status as the Supreme System Lord. Goa'uld used superior technology to pose as gods to the human populations who had been deported from Earth to everywhere in the galaxy (with evidence suggesting that most Goa'uld believe their propaganda); these people are kept in poverty, ignorance and slavery. The US Stargate Command represents simultaneously a higher level of civilization and a lower level of technology during conflicts. Only a small portion of stargate dial numbers do not lead to planets dominated by the Goa'uld.\n\n==Franchise releases==\nDue to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various ''Stargate'' productions are not entirely consistent with each other; and while no set of works forms an official [[canon (fiction)|canon]],<ref name=\"gateworldbradwright\">{{Cite interview|subject=Brad Wright |interviewer= Darren Sumner |work=GateWorld |title=Brad Wright Interview |location=Chicago | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}</ref> the largest [[fanbase|following]] exists for the three live-action series.<ref name=\"gateworldomnipedia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/faq.shtml#5 |website=GateWorld |title=GateWorld Omnipedia |accessdate=May 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61Fh0Qz5N?url=http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/faq.shtml#5 |archivedate=August 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Through the work of various authors and developers, at least six separate story cycles can be discerned, some of which are continuations of the other ones (either endorsed or unendorsed by their predecessor).\n\n===Media releases===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Release date\n! colspan=\"3\" | Box office revenue\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Director\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| United States\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| International\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Total\n|-\n| ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''<ref name=\"estimated3\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1994/0SGTE.php\n|title=Stargate (1994)\n|website=The Numbers\n|accessdate=May 5, 2009\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309062441/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1994/0SGTE.php\n|archive-date=March 9, 2009\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| October 28, 1994\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $71,565,669\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $125,000,000\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $196,565,669\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Roland Emmerich]]\n|-\n| ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''<ref name=thenumberstaot>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/0SGAT.php\n| title = Stargate - The Ark of Truth\n| accessdate = May 5, 2008\n| website = The Numbers\n| publisher = Nash Information Services\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509164842/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/0SGAT.php\n| archive-date = May 9, 2008\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| March 11, 2008\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $11,728,654<ref name=thenumbers>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/0SGAT.php Stargate - The Ark of Truth - Box Office Data, Movie News, Cast Information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108034913/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/0SGAT.php |date=January 8, 2014 }}.

The film lays the foundation for all the Stargate productions that come after it, by explaining the notion, function, and history of the Stargate.\n\nThe film begins with the unearthing of the Stargate in [[Giza]] in 1928. In a [[present day]], ''i.e.'', 1994, military base in Creek Mountain, Colorado, discredited [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] ([[James Spader]]) enables use of the Stargate when he recognizes that symbols on the [[cover stone]]s of the Stargate are [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] used in a three dimensional coordinate system. A team led by Colonel [[Jack O'Neill|Jack O'Neil]] ([[Kurt Russell]]) is ordered to step through the Stargate and identify potential military threats on the other side. Jackson accompanies them to operate the other Stargate with his knowledge of the coordinate system. The team discovers a [[slave]] civilization serving an alien who is [[Ra (Stargate)|posing as the Egyptian god Ra]] ([[Jaye Davidson]]). Ra and his minions have taken human form, dominating the slaves with brute force. With the help of the locals, O'Neil's team is eventually able to instigate a [[slave rebellion]], overwhelming Ra's forces. Ra escapes in his mothership, but O'Neil is able to [[Teleportation|teleport]] a nuclear warhead on-board Ra's ship in orbit and detonate it. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with a young local woman named [[Sha'uri]].\n\n=== Other releases and possible future development {{anchor|Future productions}} ===\nAfter Bill McCay had written a [[Stargate film novels|series of five novels]] continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite the success of the ''Stargate'' television series, [[Dean Devlin]] stated in 2006 that \"he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original.\"<ref name=\"newstargatefilmfromorg\"/> According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise.<ref name=\"newstargatefilmfromorg\"/> The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together.<ref name=\"comingsoon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 |title=Devlin Announces Plans For Stargate Sequels |website=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=April 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616234819/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 |archive-date=June 16, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'' producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that \"Devlin can wish to do a sequel to ''Stargate'' all he wants.

He was in talks with MGM to produce four films and he wanted two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy. In an interview with [[Sci Fi Wire]], Devlin said that should the sequels be made, he hoped to enlist [[Kurt Russell]] and [[James Spader]] in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader expressed interest, Devlin revealed. \"They've always said they wanted to do it. The irony is actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [and] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We were just going to kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely.\" These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' if they are ever produced.<ref name=\"newstargatefilmfromorg\"/>\n\nDean Devlin spoke out again on July 4, 2011 stating that he hadn't given up on the idea of sequels to his 1994 feature film. He talked about the idea again in a new interview with Collider. Devlin actually wrote it as a trilogy of movies, but was never able to do parts two and three.  His hope was, as the series started to wind down, that perhaps it would be time to actually get to do parts two and three.\n\nDevlin has said \"I think it'll change a little bit from our original idea since so many years have passed.\" \"We wanted to explore the idea of how the Stargates were built originally, and where else in the universe they exist, and why they exist \u2014 and where else they exist on Earth. We had really planned out, as a trilogy of films, to allow this mythology to grow bigger and bigger.\"<ref name=\"gateworldinterview2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/07/devlin-still-talking-stargate-movie-sequels/ |title=Interview: Darren |website=GateWorld |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |date=July 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707100037/http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/07/devlin-still-talking-stargate-movie-sequels/ |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was announced that [[MGM]] and [[Warner Bros.]] are partnering with both Emmerich and Devlin for a reboot of Stargate as a trilogy with Emmerich directing and Devlin producing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/mgm-warner-bros-team-with-roland-emmerich-dean-devlin-on-stargate-reboot-1201196082/|title=MGM, Warner Bros.

The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of ''SG-1'''s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the ''SG-1'' setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discovers Atlantis rests at the bottom of an ocean, protected by shields keeping the City habitable. As the Atlantis Expedition Team explores the myriad corridors and equipment, they quickly drain the already nearly depleted power source (known as a ZPM) allowing the shields to hold and Atlantis to remain watertight. Through an emergency default program, Atlantis detects this sudden power drop and activates a failsafe, causing the City to surface and appear as an island in the middle of an ocean.\n\nUsing small ships discovered in the City, Team Members fly and discover the mainland, where they explore, meet the Indigenous Population, and learn that the Pegasus Galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as the \"[[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]].\" Although first encountered whilst in a long-term hibernation state, the Expedition unintentionally and prematurely wakes the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]], alerting them to the reemergence of Atlantis, a new race of humans, and a potential new feeding ground: The Milky Way Galaxy.

A new feature film was originally intended to transition the two series after the sixth season of ''SG-1''.  Later, ''SG-1'' was renewed for a seventh season, and the feature film was then planned to transition that season.  Finally, when ''SG-1'' was renewed for an eighth season, the intended film instead became the two-part [[season finale]] episode \"[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]\", and the setting of ''Stargate Atlantis'' was moved to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Sharon Gosling | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | date = 2005 | publisher = Titan Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84576-116-5 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/stargateatlantis00shar/page/10 10\u201314] | chapter = Watergate | chapter-url-access = registration | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/stargateatlantis00shar | url = https://archive.org/details/stargateatlantis00shar/page/10 }}</ref> This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same [[fictional universe]], and later the two shows even become interconnected.

The story begins when one such device is discovered on Earth. The 1994 film and subsequent television series depict how the device is kept under the control of the United States government, who use it to conduct interplanetary missions by dialing the thousands of stargates located in the galaxy, which are the legacy of an ancient civilization. The expeditions originally had the goal of acquiring extremely rare resources, new technology and detecting threats; but often face scientific and humanitarian issues and the dilemmas of interacting with different societies. Finally they resulted in a unified ''United Nation''-coalition to better support the constant need to continue the program to defend Earth from invading aliens.\n\nCombined with the notion that the Stargate is a secret, ''Stargate'' productions are notable for presenting no contradiction with reality, being set in the [[present day]] on an otherwise normal Earth, and being dominated by human interaction in the galaxy. In the story of the 1994 film, this is explained as being the result of forced deportations by aliens, with the suggestion that most ancient [[mythology|mythologies]] are the result of aliens posing as gods in the distant past (as in unproven [[ancient astronauts]]).\n\nThe longest-running series, ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' sets the context having the ''[[Milky Way]]'' galaxy as a [[failed state]] in which Goa'uld System Lords war against each other, due to the death of Ra in the film undermining the existing social structure of the System Lords due to Ra's status as the Supreme System Lord. Goa'uld used superior technology to pose as gods to the human populations who had been deported from Earth to everywhere in the galaxy (with evidence suggesting that most Goa'uld believe their propaganda); these people are kept in poverty, ignorance and slavery. The US Stargate Command represents simultaneously a higher level of civilization and a lower level of technology during conflicts.

The film lays the foundation for all the Stargate productions that come after it, by explaining the notion, function, and history of the Stargate.\n\nThe film begins with the unearthing of the Stargate in [[Giza]] in 1928. In a [[present day]], ''i.e.'', 1994, military base in Creek Mountain, Colorado, discredited [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] ([[James Spader]]) enables use of the Stargate when he recognizes that symbols on the [[cover stone]]s of the Stargate are [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] used in a three dimensional coordinate system. A team led by Colonel [[Jack O'Neill|Jack O'Neil]] ([[Kurt Russell]]) is ordered to step through the Stargate and identify potential military threats on the other side. Jackson accompanies them to operate the other Stargate with his knowledge of the coordinate system. The team discovers a [[slave]] civilization serving an alien who is [[Ra (Stargate)|posing as the Egyptian god Ra]] ([[Jaye Davidson]]). Ra and his minions have taken human form, dominating the slaves with brute force. With the help of the locals, O'Neil's team is eventually able to instigate a [[slave rebellion]], overwhelming Ra's forces. Ra escapes in his mothership, but O'Neil is able to [[Teleportation|teleport]] a nuclear warhead on-board Ra's ship in orbit and detonate it. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with a young local woman named [[Sha'uri]].\n\n=== Other releases and possible future development {{anchor|Future productions}} ===\nAfter Bill McCay had written a [[Stargate film novels|series of five novels]] continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite the success of the ''Stargate'' television series, [[Dean Devlin]] stated in 2006 that \"he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original.\"<ref name=\"newstargatefilmfromorg\"/> According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise.<ref name=\"newstargatefilmfromorg\"/> The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together.<ref name=\"comingsoon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 |title=Devlin Announces Plans For Stargate Sequels |website=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=April 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616234819/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 |archive-date=June 16, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'' producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that \"Devlin can wish to do a sequel to ''Stargate'' all he wants.

He was in talks with MGM to produce four films and he wanted two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy. In an interview with [[Sci Fi Wire]], Devlin said that should the sequels be made, he hoped to enlist [[Kurt Russell]] and [[James Spader]] in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader expressed interest, Devlin revealed. \"They've always said they wanted to do it. The irony is actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [and] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We were just going to kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely.\" These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' if they are ever produced.<ref name=\"newstargatefilmfromorg\"/>\n\nDean Devlin spoke out again on July 4, 2011 stating that he hadn't given up on the idea of sequels to his 1994 feature film. He talked about the idea again in a new interview with Collider. Devlin actually wrote it as a trilogy of movies, but was never able to do parts two and three.  His hope was, as the series started to wind down, that perhaps it would be time to actually get to do parts two and three.\n\nDevlin has said \"I think it'll change a little bit from our original idea since so many years have passed.\" \"We wanted to explore the idea of how the Stargates were built originally, and where else in the universe they exist, and why they exist \u2014 and where else they exist on Earth. We had really planned out, as a trilogy of films, to allow this mythology to grow bigger and bigger.\"<ref name=\"gateworldinterview2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/07/devlin-still-talking-stargate-movie-sequels/ |title=Interview: Darren |website=GateWorld |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |date=July 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707100037/http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/07/devlin-still-talking-stargate-movie-sequels/ |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was announced that [[MGM]] and [[Warner Bros.]] are partnering with both Emmerich and Devlin for a reboot of Stargate as a trilogy with Emmerich directing and Devlin producing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/mgm-warner-bros-team-with-roland-emmerich-dean-devlin-on-stargate-reboot-1201196082/|title=MGM, Warner Bros.

The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of ''SG-1'''s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the ''SG-1'' setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discovers Atlantis rests at the bottom of an ocean, protected by shields keeping the City habitable. As the Atlantis Expedition Team explores the myriad corridors and equipment, they quickly drain the already nearly depleted power source (known as a ZPM) allowing the shields to hold and Atlantis to remain watertight. Through an emergency default program, Atlantis detects this sudden power drop and activates a failsafe, causing the City to surface and appear as an island in the middle of an ocean.\n\nUsing small ships discovered in the City, Team Members fly and discover the mainland, where they explore, meet the Indigenous Population, and learn that the Pegasus Galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as the \"[[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]].\" Although first encountered whilst in a long-term hibernation state, the Expedition unintentionally and prematurely wakes the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]], alerting them to the reemergence of Atlantis, a new race of humans, and a potential new feeding ground: The Milky Way Galaxy. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Team must defend and protect the City, the Locals, and the entire Expedition.  \n\n''Stargate Atlantis'' was a spin-off television series from ''Stargate SG-1''.  A new feature film was originally intended to transition the two series after the sixth season of ''SG-1''.  Later, ''SG-1'' was renewed for a seventh season, and the feature film was then planned to transition that season.  Finally, when ''SG-1'' was renewed for an eighth season, the intended film instead became the two-part [[season finale]] episode \"[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]\", and the setting of ''Stargate Atlantis'' was moved to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Sharon Gosling | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | date = 2005 | publisher = Titan Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84576-116-5 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/stargateatlantis00shar/page/10 10\u201314] | chapter = Watergate | chapter-url-access = registration | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/stargateatlantis00shar | url = https://archive.org/details/stargateatlantis00shar/page/10 }}</ref> This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same [[fictional universe]], and later the two shows even become interconnected.

Hewlett and Higginson's characters had previously appeared in ''SG-1'' (though Higginson inherited the role from actress [[Jessica Steen]]). In ''Atlantis''' second season, [[Paul McGillion]] and [[Jason Momoa]] (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season 4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and [[Jewel Staite]] in a recurring role. Tapping left the show for season five to concentrate on ''[[Sanctuary (web series)|Sanctuary]]'', and was replaced by [[Robert Picardo]], who reprised his role as [[Richard Woolsey]] from both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.

He was confronted with either maintaining the caliphal structures under British rule or modernise administrative structures of the traditional institutions to provide them with power of utility. It is argued that the introduction of reforms of the institutions saved them from withering away. Traditional authority has continued to play a central role in Northern society since the time of Ahmadu Bello, despite continuing reforms.\n\nThe creation of the civil service during the period of Ahmadu Bello is one of his major achievements. He regarded the northern civil service as a meritocracy, which should be above petty political quarrels, and certainly above corruption. The civil service had a rigorous code of ethics, and came to serve as a counterbalance to both politicians and traditional leaders. The trans-ethnic nature of the civil service provided the backbone for Northern Regionalism and for northern development efforts, which were based on the principle of equal distribution of opportunities. The technical and administrative skills of the civil service were essential to a large-scale political community, and the willingness to take assignments outside of the capital city was part of the ethos. The civil service provided a smooth transition from colonial rule to Independence, and an equally smooth transition from Northern Regionalism to the creation of states and the consolidation of Nigerian federalism. Perhaps the key to the effective functioning of the civil service was its apparent balance in terms of sub-regional zones, its transcendence of sub-regional interests, and its ability to incorporate intergenerational cohorts into a cohesive whole. His insistence that the next generation of traditional leaders be western educated set the stage for the transition to their subsequent roles.\n\nThe first generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born in the decade from about 1910\u20131920 -  [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa|Tafawa Balewa]], [[Alhaji Yahaya Madawaki|Yahya Madawaki]], [[Isa Kaita]], [[Abubakar Imam]]) tended to be cohorts from Katsina College, and had good personal relationships with their colleagues (including Ahmadu Bello) who had gone into political life.\u00a0\n\nThe second generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born from 1920\u20131930, and reaching senior status in the service during the transition to independence such as \u2013 [[Mohammed Bello (jurist)|Mohammed Bello]], [[Muhammadu Dikko Yusufu]], [[Hassan Katsina]]) were also part of the [[Barewa College|Katsina-Kaduna-Zaria]] educational connection, and had close working relations with their \u201cseniors,\u201d in the civil service and in the political realm.\u00a0\n\nThe third generation of northern civil servants (i.e. those born in the 1930s and entering the senior service after independence) tended to have overseas educational experience, and there was often a sharp difference in perspective from those in the first and second generations. This generation of Northerners went on to form the core of the Kaduna Mafia.\n\n===Origins===\nThe origins of the Kaduna mafia revolves around the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|fall of the First Republic]]. The assassination of Ahmadu Bello and other northern leaders prodded a group of young northerners to rally around and oppose the military government of General [[Aguiyi Ironsi]]. This group, a diverse mixture of aristocrats and civil servants who were predominantly [[Muslim]] and based in Kaduna. It is important to note that a dichotomy exists between the traditional ruling establishment and the mafia, despite an interconnection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/from-kaduna-mafia-to-caliphate.html|title=From Kaduna Mafia to Caliphate|last=Jega|first=Mahmud|date=2016-10-22|website=Daily Trust|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nThis group was educated mostly in the United Kingdom, and had connections with the [[Ahmadu Bello University]] in [[Zaria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamji.com/haruna/haruna304.htm|title=Ibrahim Tahir: An Appreciation by Mamman Daura|last=Daura|first=Mamman|date=|website=Gamji|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> They were known for their intelligence, commitment to the traditional values and socio-political interests of Northern Nigeria and their internal camaraderie.

For example, the CKP, who are \"Chandraseniya\" or \"Chandraseni\" are of distinct origin and status from the [[Chitraguptavanshi_Kayastha|Chitraguptavanshi Kayasthas]]s of north-India and Bengal. Another difference given by Hayden J. Bellenoit who only discusses the north-Indian group in depth is that the north-Indian (Chitragupta) group usually held only lower level administrative and scribal(writer) posts unlike the Prabhus(CKP) and other groups who were more prominent. In addition, the north-Indian Kayasthas did not hold any military posts unlike the CKPs in the medieval era.

Except these three castes, education for all other castes and communities was very limited and consisted of listening to stories from religious texts like the [[Puranas]] or to [[Kirtans]] and thus the common masses remained illiterate and backward. Hence Shivaji Maharaj was compelled to use people from these three educated communities - Marathi Brahmins, CKPs and Saraswat Brahmins - for civilian posts as they required education and intellectual maturity. However, in this time period, these three as well as other communities, depending on caste, also contributed their share to Shivaji Maharaj's \"Swaraj\"(self-rule) by being cavalry soldiers, commanders, mountaineers, seafarers etc.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kantak |first=M.

It is a fact that Shivaji Maharaj's civil services were dominated by the Brahmins, the Prabhus and the Saraswats. However, the blame on it does not fall on Shivaji Maharaj but on the social framework within which he was workings. As has been pointed out earlier in this article , in 17th century Maharashtra, due to social and religious restrictions, education was the privilege of the higher classes only. Consequently, the common masses remained illiterate and backward. For civil posts, intellectual maturity, some standard of education as well as knowledge of reading, writing and account keeping ,etc. were essential. Shivaji Maharaj found these requisites readily in the Brahmins, the Saraswats and the Kayasthas which were the only educated classes then. Shivaji Maharaj had no alternative but to recruit them in his services for maintaining a high standard of efficiency.}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period,  some prominent CKPs like Pilaji Prabhu Deshpande (the son of Baji Prabhu Deshpande) and Shamji Kulkarni (the son of Raoji Narao Kulkarni) were converted to Islam.

The analysis of gramanyas against the CKP was done in depth by historians from the [[University of Toronto]]. Modern scholars quote statements that show that they were due to political malice \u2013 especially given that the Gramanya was started by a certain Yamaji Pant who had sent an assassin to murder a rival CKP. This was noted by Gangadharshastri Dikshit who gave his verdict in favor of the CKPs. Abashastri Takle had used the scriptures to establish their \"Vedokta\". Similarly, the famous jurist [[Ramshastri Prabhune]] also supported the CKPs Vedokta. Modern scholars conclude that the fact that the CKPs held high ranking positions in administration and the military and as statesmen was a \"double edged sword\". Historians, while analyzing the gramanyas state \"As statesmen, they were engulfed in the court intrigues and factions, and, as a result, were prone to persecution by opposing factions. On the other hand, their influence in the court meant that they could wield enough political clout to effect settlements in favor of their caste.\". The gramanyas during the Peshwa eras finally culminated in the favor of the CKPs as the Vedokta had support from the [[Shastras]] and this was affirmed by two letters from Brahmins from Varanasi as well as one from Pune Brahmins ratified by Bajirao II himself. The late Indian professor of sociology, [[Govind Sadashiv Ghurye]] commented on the strictness of the caste system during the Peshwa rule in Maharashtra by noting that even advanced caste such as the Prabhus had to establish rights to carry on with the vedic rituals.<ref name=\"MiltonWagle\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Caste and Race in India|pages=[https://archive.org/details/casteraceinindia0000ghur/page/5 5], 14|author=Govind Sadashiv Ghurye|publisher=Popular Prakashan |year=1969|quote=(page 5) Thus the Brahmin government of Poona, while passing some legislation prohibiting the manufacture and sale of liquors, excluded the bhandaris kolis and similar other castes from the operation thereof but strictly forbade the sale of drinks to Brahmins, Shenvis, Prabhus and Government officers (page 14).

As the [Chandraseniya Kayastha] prabhus's Gurubaba stated in the Pandit assembly, that the gramanya initiated by Yamaji was due to political malice(\"rajyakarani dvesha\"). It did not therefore, come to fruition. That there was an active enmity between Govindrao, a leading member of the prabhu caste and Yamaji, is clear from a document in which it is stated that Yamaji Pant actually sent an assassin to murder Govindrao. The Prabhus eminence as soldier-statesmen and high ranking administrative officers from Bajiravs time to end of Peshwai was both an asset and a liability. As statesmen, they were engulfed in the court intrigues and factions, and, as a result, were prone to persecution by opposing factions. On the other hand, their influence in the court meant that they could wield enough political clout to effect settlements in favor of their caste.(page 328)It is significant that the two Prabhu Sardars, Nilkanthrav Page and Ravji Apaji were the key members of the faction which helped Bajirav to acquire the Peshwaship.}}</ref>{{efn|quote on page 147: That the \"pure Kshatriya\"(''shuddha kshatria'') status of the CKP was fully backed up by the actual shastras, was the unofficial verdict of Gangadharshastri Dikshit who was appointed arbiter to resolve the dispute.

They may be considered part of the broader \"non-uniform functional group\" called [[Kayastha]] which modern scholars opine is not a \"caste\" but a group composed of distinct castes of different varna origins (based on the region of origin), each of different social and ritual status. For example, the CKP, who are \"Chandraseniya\" or \"Chandraseni\" are of distinct origin and status from the [[Chitraguptavanshi_Kayastha|Chitraguptavanshi Kayasthas]]s of north-India and Bengal. Another difference given by Hayden J. Bellenoit who only discusses the north-Indian group in depth is that the north-Indian (Chitragupta) group usually held only lower level administrative and scribal(writer) posts unlike the Prabhus(CKP) and other groups who were more prominent. In addition, the north-Indian Kayasthas did not hold any military posts unlike the CKPs in the medieval era.

Except these three castes, education for all other castes and communities was very limited and consisted of listening to stories from religious texts like the [[Puranas]] or to [[Kirtans]] and thus the common masses remained illiterate and backward. Hence Shivaji Maharaj was compelled to use people from these three educated communities - Marathi Brahmins, CKPs and Saraswat Brahmins - for civilian posts as they required education and intellectual maturity. However, in this time period, these three as well as other communities, depending on caste, also contributed their share to Shivaji Maharaj's \"Swaraj\"(self-rule) by being cavalry soldiers, commanders, mountaineers, seafarers etc.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kantak |first=M.

It is a fact that Shivaji Maharaj's civil services were dominated by the Brahmins, the Prabhus and the Saraswats. However, the blame on it does not fall on Shivaji Maharaj but on the social framework within which he was workings. As has been pointed out earlier in this article , in 17th century Maharashtra, due to social and religious restrictions, education was the privilege of the higher classes only. Consequently, the common masses remained illiterate and backward. For civil posts, intellectual maturity, some standard of education as well as knowledge of reading, writing and account keeping ,etc. were essential. Shivaji Maharaj found these requisites readily in the Brahmins, the Saraswats and the Kayasthas which were the only educated classes then. Shivaji Maharaj had no alternative but to recruit them in his services for maintaining a high standard of efficiency.}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period,  some prominent CKPs like Pilaji Prabhu Deshpande (the son of Baji Prabhu Deshpande) and Shamji Kulkarni (the son of Raoji Narao Kulkarni) were converted to Islam.

The analysis of gramanyas against the CKP was done in depth by historians from the [[University of Toronto]]. Modern scholars quote statements that show that they were due to political malice \u2013 especially given that the Gramanya was started by a certain Yamaji Pant who had sent an assassin to murder a rival CKP. This was noted by Gangadharshastri Dikshit who gave his verdict in favor of the CKPs. Abashastri Takle had used the scriptures to establish their \"Vedokta\". Similarly, the famous jurist [[Ramshastri Prabhune]] also supported the CKPs Vedokta. Modern scholars conclude that the fact that the CKPs held high ranking positions in administration and the military and as statesmen was a \"double edged sword\". Historians, while analyzing the gramanyas state \"As statesmen, they were engulfed in the court intrigues and factions, and, as a result, were prone to persecution by opposing factions. On the other hand, their influence in the court meant that they could wield enough political clout to effect settlements in favor of their caste.\". The gramanyas during the Peshwa eras finally culminated in the favor of the CKPs as the Vedokta had support from the [[Shastras]] and this was affirmed by two letters from Brahmins from Varanasi as well as one from Pune Brahmins ratified by Bajirao II himself. The late Indian professor of sociology, [[Govind Sadashiv Ghurye]] commented on the strictness of the caste system during the Peshwa rule in Maharashtra by noting that even advanced caste such as the Prabhus had to establish rights to carry on with the vedic rituals.<ref name=\"MiltonWagle\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Caste and Race in India|pages=[https://archive.org/details/casteraceinindia0000ghur/page/5 5], 14|author=Govind Sadashiv Ghurye|publisher=Popular Prakashan |year=1969|quote=(page 5) Thus the Brahmin government of Poona, while passing some legislation prohibiting the manufacture and sale of liquors, excluded the bhandaris kolis and similar other castes from the operation thereof but strictly forbade the sale of drinks to Brahmins, Shenvis, Prabhus and Government officers (page 14).

Their preceptor Gurubaba (Abashastri Takle), indeed, quoting from the scriptures convincingly argued the Prabhus claims to Vedokta before the Pandit assembly by proving their Kshatriya genealogy (page 325). As the [Chandraseniya Kayastha] prabhus's Gurubaba stated in the Pandit assembly, that the gramanya initiated by Yamaji was due to political malice(\"rajyakarani dvesha\"). It did not therefore, come to fruition. That there was an active enmity between Govindrao, a leading member of the prabhu caste and Yamaji, is clear from a document in which it is stated that Yamaji Pant actually sent an assassin to murder Govindrao. The Prabhus eminence as soldier-statesmen and high ranking administrative officers from Bajiravs time to end of Peshwai was both an asset and a liability. As statesmen, they were engulfed in the court intrigues and factions, and, as a result, were prone to persecution by opposing factions. On the other hand, their influence in the court meant that they could wield enough political clout to effect settlements in favor of their caste.(page 328)It is significant that the two Prabhu Sardars, Nilkanthrav Page and Ravji Apaji were the key members of the faction which helped Bajirav to acquire the Peshwaship.}}</ref>{{efn|quote on page 147: That the \"pure Kshatriya\"(''shuddha kshatria'') status of the CKP was fully backed up by the actual shastras, was the unofficial verdict of Gangadharshastri Dikshit who was appointed arbiter to resolve the dispute.

Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the [[Communal Award]]  proposal of the [[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. After the pact, the [[Communal Award]] was modified to include the terms as per the pacts.

Raja Rampal Singh of Kalakankar (Pratapgadh District) impressed by the speech and the personality of Malaviyaji, during the 2nd Congress Session in Calcutta held in 1886. requested Malaviya to take up this position.<ref name=\"maha\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mahamana.org/biography-.html|title=Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya \u2013 Biography|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Madan Mohan Malaviya\">{{cite web|url=http://topyaps.com/madan-mohan-malaviya|title=20 Things We Must Know About Madan Mohan Malaviya|work=TopYaps|date=2 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThen in 1889, he became the Editor of the \"Indian Opinion\". After the incorporation of \"Indian Opinion\" with the \"Advocate\" of Lucknow, Malaviya started his own Hindi weekly \"Abhyudaya\"(1907\u20131909 under his editorship).<ref name=\"indiapost\"/>\n\nAlso, his poems (sawaiyas) were published (sometime in 1883\u201384) under the pseudonym of \u2018Makrand\u2019 in \u2018Harischandra Chandrika\u2019 magazine (brought out by the famous Bharatendu), articles on religious and contemporary subjects published in \u2018Hindi Pradeepa\u2019.<ref name=\"maha\"/>\n\nWhen the English Government tried to bring in the Press Act and Newspaper Act in 1908, Malaviyaji started a campaign against the Act and called an All India Conference in Allahabad. He then realized the need of an English Newspaper to make the campaign effective throughout the country. As a result, with the help of Motilal Nehru he started an English daily the \"Leader\" in 1909, where he was Editor 1909\u20131911 and President 1911\u20131919.<ref name=\"maha\"/>\n\nIn 1910, Malaviyaji started the Hindi paper `Maryada'.<ref name=\"maha\"/>\n\nIn 1924, Malaviya along with the help of national leaders [[Lala Lajpat Rai]]  and [[M.

Malaviya was the Chairman of [[Hindustan Times]] from 1924 to 1946. His efforts resulted in the launch of its Hindi edition 'Hindustan' in 1936.  The paper is now owned by the [[Birla family]].\n\nIn 1933, Malaviya started ''Sanatana Dharma'' from BHU, a magazine dedicated to religious, dharmic interests.<ref name=\"maha\"/>\n\n==Legal career==\nIn 1891, Malaviya completed his LL.B. from Allahabad University and started practice in Allahabad District Court and then from 1893 practised at the High Court. He soon earned huge respect as one of the most brilliant lawyers of the Allahabad High Court. He gave up his legal practice when he was at his pinnacle in 1911 on his 50th birthday so that he could serve the nation thereafter.\n\nAbout his legal career, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru mentions of him \u2013 ''...a brilliant Civil Lawyer'' and Sir Mirza Ismail said \u2013 ''I have heard a great lawyer say that if Mr.Malaviya had so willed it, he would have been an ornament to the legal profession''.<ref name=bhu>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/mahamana.htm|title=PANDIT MADAN MOHAN MALAVIYA.

The sessions court had sent to gallows 170 persons for the attack. However, Malaviya defended them in the Allahabad High Court and was able to get 155 persons saved from the gallows. The remaining 15 also were recommended for clemency by the High Court, whereafter their sentences were also commuted from death to life-imprisonment.  During these arguments, the then Chief Justice Honble Sir Grimwood Mears bowed thrice to Malaviya as a Mark of great appreciation for the sheer brilliance of his arguments.{{citation needed|reason=Inconsistent with Chauri Chaura case as detailed in wikipedia itself|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Banaras Hindu University==\nIn April 1911, [[Annie Besant]] met Malaviya and they decided to work for a common Hindu University in Varanasi. Besant and fellow trustees of the [[Central Hindu College]], which she had founded in 1898, also agreed to Government of India's precondition that the college should become a part of the new University. Thus [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU) was established in 1916, through a Parliamentary legislation, the 'B.H.U.

Harrison College's Principal provided a monthly scholarship to Malaviya, whose family had been facing financial hardships, and he was able to complete his B.A. at the [[University of Calcutta]].\n\nAlthough he wanted to pursue an M.A. in Sanskrit, his family conditions did not allow it and his father wanted him to take his family profession of Bhagavat recital, thus in July 1884 Madan Mohan Malaviya started his career as an assistant master at the Govt High School in Allahabad.<ref name=\"indiapost\"/>\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Mahatma Gandhi with Madan Mohan Malaviya.jpeg|thumb|Malaviya with Gandhi.]]\n\nIn December 1886, Malaviya attended the 2nd [[Indian National Congress]] session in [[Calcutta]] under chairmanship of [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], where he spoke on the issue of representation in Councils.

He gave up his legal practice when he was at his pinnacle in 1911 on his 50th birthday so that he could serve the nation thereafter.\n\nAbout his legal career, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru mentions of him \u2013 ''...a brilliant Civil Lawyer'' and Sir Mirza Ismail said \u2013 ''I have heard a great lawyer say that if Mr.Malaviya had so willed it, he would have been an ornament to the legal profession''.<ref name=bhu>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/mahamana.htm|title=PANDIT MADAN MOHAN MALAVIYA.

The sessions court had sent to gallows 170 persons for the attack. However, Malaviya defended them in the Allahabad High Court and was able to get 155 persons saved from the gallows. The remaining 15 also were recommended for clemency by the High Court, whereafter their sentences were also commuted from death to life-imprisonment.
