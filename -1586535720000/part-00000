Since 1992 the lineup has consisted of [[Ira Kaplan]] (guitars, piano, vocals), [[Georgia Hubley]] (drums, piano, vocals), and [[James McNew]] (bass, vocals). In 2015, original guitarist [[Dave Schramm (musician)|Dave Schramm]] rejoined the band and appears on their fourteenth album, [[Stuff Like That There (Yo La Tengo album)|''Stuff Like That There'']].\n\nDespite achieving limited mainstream success, Yo La Tengo has been called \"the quintessential critics' band\" and maintains a strong cult following.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\nThough it mostly plays original material, Yo La Tengo is renowned for its wide repertoire of [[Cover versions|cover songs]] both in live performance and on record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/albums/yo-la-tengo-7bd6ae90.html|title=Yo La Tengo Album Statistics |website=Setlist.fm|accessdate=December 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early history, 1984\u201385===\n[[Ira Kaplan]] and [[Georgia Hubley]] formed the band as a couple in 1984. They chose the name \"Yo La Tengo\" (Spanish for \"I have it\" (referring to a female-[[grammatical gender|gender]] object or person). The name came from a baseball anecdote that occurred during the 1962 season, when [[New York Mets]] [[center fielder]] [[Richie Ashburn]] and [[Venezuelan]] [[shortstop]] [[Elio Chac\u00f3n]] found themselves colliding in the outfield. When Ashburn went for a catch, he would scream, \"I got it! I got it!\" only to run into Chac\u00f3n, who spoke only Spanish. Ashburn learned to yell, \"\u00a1Yo la tengo! \u00a1Yo la tengo!\" instead. In a later game, Ashburn happily saw Chac\u00f3n backing off. He relaxed, positioned himself to catch the ball, and was instead run over by left fielder [[Frank Thomas (NL baseball player)|Frank Thomas]], who understood no Spanish and had missed a team meeting that proposed using the words \"\u00a1Yo la tengo!\" as a way to avoid outfield collisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yolatengo.com/kaplanskorner.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090711024319/http://www.yolatengo.com/kaplanskorner.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 11, 2009 |title=Kaplan's Korner, Episode 1 |publisher=Yolatengo.com |accessdate=February 17, 2012 }}</ref> After getting up, Thomas asked Ashburn, \"What the hell is a Yellow Tango?\".<ref>''Richie Ashburn Remembered'' by Fran Zimniuch, Sports Publishing LLC, 2005; pp. 41\u201342.</ref>\n\nKaplan and Hubley placed an advertisement to recruit other musicians who shared their love for bands such as [[the Soft Boys]], [[Mission of Burma]], and [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]]'s [[Love (band)|Love]].<ref name=AllMusic /> The group's debut recording was a [[7\"]] single entitled \"The River of Water\" backed with a cover of Lee's \"A House Is Not a Motel\", released in late 1985 with [[Dave Schramm (musician)|Dave Schramm]] on lead guitar and [[Dave Rick]] on bass. After recording \"Private Doberman\" for inclusion on a Coyote Records compilation entitled ''Luxury Condos Coming to Your Neighborhood Soon'', Rick left the band and was replaced by Mike Lewis, the founding bass player of Boston garage-punk bands [[DMZ (band)|DMZ]] and [[Lyres (band)|Lyres]], who was also a member of Brooklyn [[garage rock]] band [[the A-Bones]] throughout his tenure in YLT.\n\n===Early releases, 1986\u201389===\nIn 1986, Yo La Tengo released their first LP, ''[[Ride the Tiger (album)|Ride the Tiger]]'' on Coyote Records. Produced by former [[Mission of Burma]] bassist [[Clint Conley]] who also took over bass duties on three songs, the album \"marked Yo La Tengo as a band with real potential\" according to reviewer Mark Deming.<ref>{{Allmusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r22470 |label=''Ride the Tiger'' Yo La Tengo > Review |first=Mark |last=Deming |accessdate={{date|2009-08-11}} }}</ref> Kaplan was credited as \"naive guitar\" on the sleeve, and in the liner notes for the 1993 reissue of the album on [[City Slang Records]], went so far as to say \"Dave's guitar playing is inarguably the best thing about the record.\"\n\nSchramm and Lewis left the band after the album's release, with Kaplan subsequently taking on the role of lead guitar and Stephan Wichnewski joining to play bass. The group's next album ''[[New Wave Hot Dogs]]'' (1987) sold poorly, but in the words of Mark Deming, \"was a quantum leap over the sound of their debut.\"<ref name=AllMusic />\n\nThe release of ''[[President Yo La Tengo]]'' in 1989 did much to establish the band's reputation among rock critics including [[Robert Christgau]] who praised the \"mysterioso guitar hook\" in the first song titled \"Barnaby, Hardly Working\".<ref name=\"robertchristgau.com\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Robert Christgau]] |first=Robert |last=Christgau |title=Yo La Tengo > Consumer Guide Reviews |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Yo+La+Tengo |accessdate={{date|2009-08-11}} }}</ref> Produced by Gene Holder of [[The dB's]], the album was the band's last release on Coyote. Despite the positive reception of the album, sales were still poor and Wichnewski left the band not long after. Hubley and Kaplan carried on as a duo and began playing two-electric-guitar shows. Kaplan, though typically a pragmatist, started carrying a bug trapped in amber in his pocket for luck.\n\n===Bar/None and Alias Records, 1990\u201392===\nYo La Tengo reunited with Dave Schramm in 1990 to record ''[[Fakebook (album)|Fakebook]]'', an album of mostly [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] tunes, including [[cover version|covers]] of [[Cat Stevens]], [[Gene Clark]], [[The Kinks]], [[Daniel Johnston]], among others, with five original songs by the band themselves, including an acoustic version of ''Barnaby Hardly Working''. Again produced by Gene Holder, the album's [[Folk music|folk]] sound was a change of pace for the band. Years later, Kaplan recalled that the album was \"just me and Georgia looking for an excuse to record with Dave Schramm and Al Greller\" who played guitar and [[double bass]] on the album, respectively.<ref name=\"drownedinsound.com\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Drowned in Sound]] |date=June 12, 2009 |first=Andrzej |last=Lukowski |title=Popular Condo Meltdown: catching up with Yo La Tengo |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137093-popular-condo-meltdown--catching-up-with-yo-la-tengo |accessdate={{date|2009-08-11}} }}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, with Dave Schramm in tow, Yo La Tengo collaborated with [[Daniel Johnston]] on the song \"Speeding Motorcycle\" which was released as a single. The band also released a 7\" single on [[Bar/None Records]] with the song \"Walking Away from You\" backed with a cover of [[Beat Happening]]'s \"Cast a Shadow.\" Gene Holder produced the single and played the bass. The ''That Is Yo La Tengo'' EP released later that year included some tracks that would end up on the group's next LP.\n\nAfter the release of ''That Is Yo La Tengo'', [[James McNew]] (who also records under the solo moniker [[Dump (band)|Dump]]) began playing bass with the band, forming the trio that continues to make up the band today. According to McNew,{{cquote|I originally signed on as a fill-in for a short US tour, and a 4-week summer tour of Europe with Eleventh Dream Day.

Three of the album's eleven songs (\"Swing for Life\", \"Out the Window\" and \"Five-Cornered Drone\") were carried over from the ''That Is Yo La Tengo'' EP and feature Holder on bass. The ''Upside-Down'' EP was released on CD in support of the album, rounding out the band's releases on Alias.\n\n===Early Matador period, 1993\u20132000===\nIn 1993, Yo La Tengo began their partnership with [[Matador Records]], releasing a 7\" and CD5 of the song \"Shaker\" which the band recorded with John Siket in New Jersey. The following LP, 1993's ''[[Painful (album)|Painful]]'', was also the beginning of the band's fruitful creative partnership with producer Roger Moutenot, who has produced all of their subsequent albums up until 2013's ''[[Fade (Yo La Tengo album)|Fade]]'', which was produced by [[John McEntire]]. ''Painful'' is the first Yo La Tengo album to feature James McNew on every song. Ira Kaplan explains:{{cquote|I think this group really started when we made the record ''Painful''. . . . ''Painful'' was the first record that we made as the three of us, and I think it sounds different from the things that came before it. Even though I can see connections with the earlier records and things we've done since, it really seems like mostly we've built on that record. Anything from before then is really, really different to me. Since ''Painful'', I think we've gotten more confident and more willing to trust ourselves and trust each other, and probably better at dealing with things that go wrong.<ref>{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Noel |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/ira-kaplan,32860/ |title=Ira Kaplan &#124; Music &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

For the first time, all songs were credited to the band as a whole rather than individual members; this became the norm for all future releases.\n\nThe band's 1997 LP ''[[I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One]]'' synthesized the group's eclectic combination of folk, [[punk rock]], [[shoegazing]], long instrumental noise-jams, and [[electronic music]] into a sprawling, multi-faceted style.

When Ashburn went for a catch, he would scream, \"I got it! I got it!\" only to run into Chac\u00f3n, who spoke only Spanish. Ashburn learned to yell, \"\u00a1Yo la tengo! \u00a1Yo la tengo!\" instead. In a later game, Ashburn happily saw Chac\u00f3n backing off. He relaxed, positioned himself to catch the ball, and was instead run over by left fielder [[Frank Thomas (NL baseball player)|Frank Thomas]], who understood no Spanish and had missed a team meeting that proposed using the words \"\u00a1Yo la tengo!\" as a way to avoid outfield collisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yolatengo.com/kaplanskorner.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090711024319/http://www.yolatengo.com/kaplanskorner.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 11, 2009 |title=Kaplan's Korner, Episode 1 |publisher=Yolatengo.com |accessdate=February 17, 2012 }}</ref> After getting up, Thomas asked Ashburn, \"What the hell is a Yellow Tango?\".<ref>''Richie Ashburn Remembered'' by Fran Zimniuch, Sports Publishing LLC, 2005; pp. 41\u201342.</ref>\n\nKaplan and Hubley placed an advertisement to recruit other musicians who shared their love for bands such as [[the Soft Boys]], [[Mission of Burma]], and [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]]'s [[Love (band)|Love]].<ref name=AllMusic /> The group's debut recording was a [[7\"]] single entitled \"The River of Water\" backed with a cover of Lee's \"A House Is Not a Motel\", released in late 1985 with [[Dave Schramm (musician)|Dave Schramm]] on lead guitar and [[Dave Rick]] on bass.

Years later, Kaplan recalled that the album was \"just me and Georgia looking for an excuse to record with Dave Schramm and Al Greller\" who played guitar and [[double bass]] on the album, respectively.<ref name=\"drownedinsound.com\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Drowned in Sound]] |date=June 12, 2009 |first=Andrzej |last=Lukowski |title=Popular Condo Meltdown: catching up with Yo La Tengo |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137093-popular-condo-meltdown--catching-up-with-yo-la-tengo |accessdate={{date|2009-08-11}} }}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, with Dave Schramm in tow, Yo La Tengo collaborated with [[Daniel Johnston]] on the song \"Speeding Motorcycle\" which was released as a single. The band also released a 7\" single on [[Bar/None Records]] with the song \"Walking Away from You\" backed with a cover of [[Beat Happening]]'s \"Cast a Shadow.\" Gene Holder produced the single and played the bass. The ''That Is Yo La Tengo'' EP released later that year included some tracks that would end up on the group's next LP.\n\nAfter the release of ''That Is Yo La Tengo'', [[James McNew]] (who also records under the solo moniker [[Dump (band)|Dump]]) began playing bass with the band, forming the trio that continues to make up the band today. According to McNew,{{cquote|I originally signed on as a fill-in for a short US tour, and a 4-week summer tour of Europe with Eleventh Dream Day.

The ''Upside-Down'' EP was released on CD in support of the album, rounding out the band's releases on Alias.\n\n===Early Matador period, 1993\u20132000===\nIn 1993, Yo La Tengo began their partnership with [[Matador Records]], releasing a 7\" and CD5 of the song \"Shaker\" which the band recorded with John Siket in New Jersey. The following LP, 1993's ''[[Painful (album)|Painful]]'', was also the beginning of the band's fruitful creative partnership with producer Roger Moutenot, who has produced all of their subsequent albums up until 2013's ''[[Fade (Yo La Tengo album)|Fade]]'', which was produced by [[John McEntire]]. ''Painful'' is the first Yo La Tengo album to feature James McNew on every song. Ira Kaplan explains:{{cquote|I think this group really started when we made the record ''Painful''. . . . ''Painful'' was the first record that we made as the three of us, and I think it sounds different from the things that came before it. Even though I can see connections with the earlier records and things we've done since, it really seems like mostly we've built on that record. Anything from before then is really, really different to me. Since ''Painful'', I think we've gotten more confident and more willing to trust ourselves and trust each other, and probably better at dealing with things that go wrong.<ref>{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Noel |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/ira-kaplan,32860/ |title=Ira Kaplan &#124; Music &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

In 1998, they collaborated with [[Jad Fair]] and released the album ''[[Strange but True (album)|Strange but True]]'' to mixed reviews.

The program debuted at the [[San Francisco Film Festival]] and has been performed live approximately twelve times. The band also released an EP with covers of [[Sun Ra]]'s \"Nuclear War\" in late 2002.\n\nThe band's tenth LP, ''[[Summer Sun]]'', was released in 2003.

Following this successful start, however, the team's performance went downhill and they only won another 2 matches that season, which were against Kings XI Punjab and [[Deccan Chargers]], both away.

The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj.

It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]]. They also signed Indian players including [[Raiphi Gomez]], [[Ali Murtaza]], [[Ashok Dinda]], [[Anustup Majumdar]] and [[Mahesh Rawat]]. Due to Yuvraj's unavailability for the entire season, Ganguly was made the captain of the franchise.<ref name=\"dada\">{{cite web|title=Sourav Ganguly's days as Pune captain over, to serve as mentor only|date=13 April 2013|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-10/news/31655144_1_sourav-ganguly-pune-warriors-bat-or-ball|publisher=TOI}}</ref> He was also made part of the coaching staff as a mentor.<ref name=\"mentor\">[http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/48689/ Ganguly, Donald part of Pune coaching staff]</ref> Former South African fast bowler [[Allan Donald]] and former Indian batsman [[Praveen Amre]] were also roped in as bowling and batting coaches respectively, replacing Marsh who had resigned to become the Sri Lankan coach.<ref name=\"mentor\"/>\n\nThe team started off their IPL 2012 campaign with wins against Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab away and at home respectively. But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.\n\n===2013 season===\n{{Main|2013 Indian Premier League}}\nFor the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain.

The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL.

Srinivasan]] towards Sahara and the Pune franchise was the main reason for the withdrawal of Sahara from IPL and Indian cricket and also added that Sahara would never be associated with Indian cricket as long as Srinivasan is at the helm of BCCI affairs.<ref>[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/sack-n-srinivasan-or-wont-sponsor-team-india-subrata-roy/1120155 Sack N Srinivasan or won't sponsor Team India: Subrata Roy]</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2013, the BCCI officially terminated its agreement with the team, bringing an end to the team's IPL sojourn.<ref name=\"goodbye pwi\"/>\n\n==Home ground==\n\n[[File:DY Patil Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[DY Patil Stadium]], the initial \"home\" ground of Pune Warriors India]]\n[[File:Sahara Stadium Pune 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]] at Gahunje, the home ground of Pune Warriors India from 2012\u20132013]]\nIn their inaugural season in 2011, the team played their home matches at the [[DY Patil Stadium]] at [[Navi Mumbai]], as their designated home venue, the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]], was still under construction. Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar.

The video of the song showed a warrior riding on a horse and inspiring the Pune residents to come to the stadium where they witnessed the team cricketers. Then the team cricketers as well as the residents performed the Sahara salute (putting the right hand over the heart and saying \"Jai Sahara\").\n\n===Indian cheerleaders===\nPune Warriors India was the only IPL franchise which used Indian [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]] unlike the other franchises which use foreign cheerleaders.

The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj. Yuvraj was set to miss the whole [[2012 Indian Premier League|2012 season]] as he was undergoing treatment for [[germ cell tumor|germ cell cancer]].<ref name=\"withdraw\"/> On 6 February 2012, [[Subrata Roy]], the chairman of Sahara India Pariwar, said that Sourav Ganguly will take a call on reconciliation.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/sourav-ganguly-to-take-call-on-reconciliation-subroto-roy/|title=Sourav Ganguly to take call on reconciliation: Subroto Roy}}</ref> A week later, the BCCI announced that they have allowed Yuvraj Singh's replacement for Pune Warriors India for the 2012 season, though a deadlock still persisted between the two parties on long-term sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/bcci-sahara-feud-unresolved-board-refuses-to-make-any-exceptions/articleshow/11872185.cms |title=BCCI-Sahara feud unresolved, Board refuses to make any exceptions \u2013 Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 February 2012, the BCCI and Sahara ended their differences and announced that Pune Warriors India will play in IPL 5.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pune Warriors India to play in IPL 5|date=4 February 2012|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/pune-warriors-india-to-play-in-ipl-5/}}</ref> The BCCI agreed to give Sahara a total purse of $3.4 million, $1.6 million from the money that they had for the auction and $1.8 million as compensation due to the absence of Yuvraj. It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]].

Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs.

Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL.

Srinivasan]] towards Sahara and the Pune franchise was the main reason for the withdrawal of Sahara from IPL and Indian cricket and also added that Sahara would never be associated with Indian cricket as long as Srinivasan is at the helm of BCCI affairs.<ref>[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/sack-n-srinivasan-or-wont-sponsor-team-india-subrata-roy/1120155 Sack N Srinivasan or won't sponsor Team India: Subrata Roy]</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2013, the BCCI officially terminated its agreement with the team, bringing an end to the team's IPL sojourn.<ref name=\"goodbye pwi\"/>\n\n==Home ground==\n\n[[File:DY Patil Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[DY Patil Stadium]], the initial \"home\" ground of Pune Warriors India]]\n[[File:Sahara Stadium Pune 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]] at Gahunje, the home ground of Pune Warriors India from 2012\u20132013]]\nIn their inaugural season in 2011, the team played their home matches at the [[DY Patil Stadium]] at [[Navi Mumbai]], as their designated home venue, the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]], was still under construction. Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar.

The video of the song showed a warrior riding on a horse and inspiring the Pune residents to come to the stadium where they witnessed the team cricketers. Then the team cricketers as well as the residents performed the Sahara salute (putting the right hand over the heart and saying \"Jai Sahara\").\n\n===Indian cheerleaders===\nPune Warriors India was the only IPL franchise which used Indian [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]] unlike the other franchises which use foreign cheerleaders.

The 24 participating teams are divided into two groups for the regular season, in which they only play the first round. In the second round, each group is split into four groups by geographical areas (North and South) with the teams retaining the points of the first phase: the winners of each group pass to the final knockout phase (from the quarterfinals to the final).

{"title_page": "Latitude", "text_new": "{{About|the geographical reference system}}\n{{short description|geographic coordinate specifying north\u2013south position}}\n{{more sources|date=Februar2020\n[[File:Division of the Earth into Gauss-Krueger zones - Globe.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] on the Earth as a [[sphere]] or an [[ellipsoid]]. The lines from pole to pole are lines of constant [[longitude]], or '''meridians'''. The circles parallel to the [[equator]] are lines of constant latitude, or '''parallels'''. The graticule shows the latitude and longitude of points on the surface. In this example meridians are spaced at 6\u00b0 intervals and parallels at 4\u00b0 intervals.]]\n\nIn [[geography]], '''latitude''' is a [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinate]] that specifies the [[north]]\u2013[[south]] position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0\u00b0 at the [[Equator]] to 90\u00b0 (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or ''parallels'', run east\u2013west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with [[longitude]] to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. On its own, the term latitude should be taken to be the ''geodetic latitude'' as defined below. Briefly, geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular (or ''[[Normal (geometry) |  normal]]'') to the ellipsoidal surface from that point, and the equatorial plane. Also defined are six ''auxiliary latitudes'' which are used in special applications.\n\n==Preliminaries==\nTwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the [[geoid]], a surface which approximates the [[Sea level|mean sea level]] over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a [[sphere]], but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the ''actual'' surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of [[Altitude|height]] constitute a [[geographic coordinate system]] as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.{{efn|The current full documentation of ISO 19111 may be purchased from http://www.iso.org but drafts of the final standard are freely available at many web sites, one such is available at the following\n[https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/pub/Xmml/CoordinateReferenceSystems/19111_FDIS20021107.pdf CSIRO]}}\n\nSince there are many different [[reference ellipsoid]]s, the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique: this is stressed in the ISO standard which states that \"without the full specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates (that is latitude and longitude) are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst\". This is of great importance in accurate applications, such as a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), but in common usage, where high accuracy is not required, the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated.\n\nIn English texts the latitude angle, defined below, is usually denoted by the Greek lower-case letter [[phi (letter)|phi]] ({{mvar|\u03c6}} or {{mvar|\u03d5}}). It is measured in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], [[arcminute|minutes and seconds]] or [[decimal degrees]], north or south of the equator.\n<!--The latitude of a point on the reference surface is defined as the angle between the [[Surface normal|normal]] to the reference surface (at the point in question) and the equatorial plane. A corollary of this definition is that the latitude angle of a point on the reference surface is not unique: it depends on the precise choice of the reference surface. -->\n\nThe precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the Earth, either to set up [[theodolite]]s or to determine GPS satellite orbits. The study of the [[figure of the Earth]] together with its gravitational field is the science of [[geodesy]].\n<!-- here except in relation to the definition of the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].-->\n\nThis article relates to coordinate systems for the Earth: it may be extended to cover the Moon, planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature.\n\n==Latitude on the sphere==\n[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on a sphere.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A perspective view of the Earth showing how latitude (<math>\\phi</math>) and longitude (<math>\\lambda</math>) are defined on a spherical model. The graticule spacing is 10 degrees.]]\n\n===The graticule on the sphere===\nThe graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude, which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the Earth. The primary reference points are the [[Geographical pole|poles]] where the axis of rotation of the Earth intersects the reference surface. Planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]]; and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through Greenwich (the [[Prime Meridian]]) defines the longitude: meridians are lines of constant longitude. The plane through the centre of the Earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the [[Equator]]. Planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude; these are the parallels. The Equator has a latitude of 0\u00b0, the [[North Pole]] has a latitude of 90\u00b0 North (written 90\u00b0&nbsp;N or +90\u00b0), and the [[South Pole]] has a latitude of 90\u00b0 South (written 90\u00b0&nbsp;S or \u221290\u00b0). The latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point: the normal to the surface of the sphere is  along the radius vector.\n\nThe latitude, as defined in this way for the sphere, is often termed the spherical latitude, to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article.\n\n===Named latitudes on the Earth===\n[[File:December solstice geometry.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The orientation of the Earth at the December solstice.]]\nBesides the equator, four other parallels are of significance:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| [[Arctic Circle]] || 66\u00b0 34\u2032 (66.57\u00b0) N\n|-\n| [[Tropic of Cancer]] ||23\u00b0 26\u2032 (23.43\u00b0) N\n|-\n| [[Tropic of Capricorn]] || 23\u00b0 26\u2032 (23.43\u00b0) S\n|-\n| [[Antarctic Circle]] || 66\u00b0 34\u2032 (66.57\u00b0) S\n|}\nThe plane of the Earth's orbit about the Sun is called the [[ecliptic]], and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the Earth is the equatorial plane. The angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt, the obliquity, or the inclination of the ecliptic, and it is conventionally denoted by {{mvar|i}}. The latitude of the tropical circles is equal to {{mvar|i}} and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement (90\u00b0 - ''i''). The axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]. The time variation is discussed more fully in the article on [[axial tilt]].{{efn|The value of this angle today is {{circle of latitude|tropical|convert}}. This figure is provided by [[Template:Circle of latitude]].}}\n\nThe figure shows the geometry of a [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the Earth and the Sun at the December [[solstice]] when the Sun is overhead at some point of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. The south polar latitudes below the [[Antarctic Circle]] are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. Only at latitudes in between the two [[tropics]] is it possible for the Sun to be directly overhead (at the [[zenith]]).\n\nOn [[map projections]] there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear. The examples below show the named parallels (as red lines) on the commonly used [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. On the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical, whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical: both are complicated curves.\n{| style=\"text-align:left\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-valign=top\n! width=\"1%\" |\n! width=\"36%\"|Normal Mercator\n! width=\"3%\"|\n! width=\"36%\" |Transverse Mercator\n! width=\"1%\" |\n|-valign=top\n|\n| align=\"center\" width=\"200px\" | [[File:MercNormSph enhanced.png|center|200px]]\n|\n\\\n| align=\"center\" width=\"200px\" | [[File:MercTranSph enhanced.png|center|200px]]\n|}\n\n===Meridian distance on the sphere===\nOn the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude ({{mvar|\u03c6}}) is\ntherefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned. If the [[Meridian arc|meridian distance]] is denoted by {{math|''m''(''\u03c6'')}} then\n:<math> m(\\phi)=\\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}R\\phi_\\mathrm{degrees} = R\\phi_\\mathrm{radians}</math>\nwhere {{mvar|R}} denotes the [[Earth radius#Mean radii|mean radius]] of the Earth. {{mvar|R}} is equal to {{convert|6371|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=in}}. No higher accuracy is appropriate for {{mvar|R}} since higher-precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model. With this value for {{mvar|R}} the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is {{convert|111.2|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (60.0 nautical miles). The length of 1 minute of latitude is {{convert|1.853|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (1.00 nautical miles), while the length of 1 second of latitude is {{convert|30.8|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=in}} (see [[nautical mile]]).\n\n==Latitude on the ellipsoid==\n\n===Ellipsoids===\n\n{{main article|Ellipsoid}}\nIn 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] ellipsoid.<ref name=newton>{{cite book|first=Isaac |last=Newton|title=Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|chapter=Book III Proposition XIX Problem III|page= [https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/407 407] |translator-first=Andrew |translator-last=Motte |url=https://archive.org/details/100878576}}</ref> (This article uses the term ''ellipsoid'' in preference to the older term ''spheroid''.) Newton's result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th century. (See [[Meridian arc]].) An oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis (minor axis). \"Oblate ellipsoid of revolution\" is abbreviated to 'ellipsoid' in the remainder of this article. (Ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxial.)\n\nMany different [[Figure of the Earth|reference ellipsoids]] have been used in the history of [[geodesy]]. In pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the [[geoid]] over the limited area of a survey but, with the advent of [[GPS]], it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids (such as [[WGS84]]) with centre at the centre of mass of the Earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the Earth. These geocentric ellipsoids are usually within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the geoid. Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out [[Datum (geodesy)|datum transformations]] which link WGS84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid.\n\n===The geometry of the ellipsoid===\n[[File:Ellipsoid parametric euler mono.svg|thumb|right|200px |A sphere of radius ''a'' compressed along the ''z'' axis to form an oblate ellipsoid of revolution.]]\n\nThe shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the [[ellipse]] which is rotated about its minor (shorter) axis. Two parameters are required. One is invariably the equatorial radius, which is the [[ellipse|semi-major axis]], {{mvar|a}}. The other parameter is usually (1)&nbsp;the polar radius or [[ellipse|semi-minor axis]], {{mvar|b}}; or (2)&nbsp;the (first) [[flattening]], {{mvar|f}}; or (3)&nbsp;the [[ellipse|eccentricity]], {{mvar|e}}. These parameters are not independent: they are related by\n\n:<math>f=\\frac{a-b}{a}, \\qquad e^2=2f-f^2,\\qquad b=a(1-f)=a\\sqrt{1-e^2}\\,.</math>\nMany other parameters (see [[ellipse]], [[ellipsoid]]) appear in the study of geodesy, geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}}. Both {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}} are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations; they are of the order {{sfrac|1|300}} and 0.08 respectively. Values for a number of ellipsoids are given in [[Figure of the Earth]]. Reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the ''inverse'' flattening, {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}}. For example, the defining values for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid, used by all GPS devices, are<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350_2.htmlNIMA |publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication |title=TR8350.2 |page=3\u20131 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* {{mvar|a}} (equatorial radius): {{val|6378137.0|u=m}} exactly\n* {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}} (inverse flattening): {{val|298.257223563}} exactly\nfrom which are derived\n* {{mvar|b}} (polar radius): {{val|6356752.3142|u=m}}\n* {{math|''e''<sup>2</sup>}} (eccentricity squared): {{val|0.00669437999014}}\nThe difference between the semi-major and semi-minor axes is about {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=in}} and as fraction of the semi-major axis it equals the flattening; on a computer monitor the ellipsoid could be sized as 300 by 299 pixels. This would barely be distinguishable from a 300-by-300-pixel sphere, so illustrations usually exaggerate the flattening.\n\n===Geodetic and geocentric latitudes===\n[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on an ellipsoid.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The definition of geodetic latitude ({{mvar|\u03c6}}) and longitude ({{mvar|\u03bb}}) on an ellipsoid. The normal to the surface does not pass through the centre, except at the equator and at the poles.]]\nThe graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere. The normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre, except for points on the equator or at the poles, but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing:\n\n*{{anchor|Geodetic}}'''Geodetic latitude:''' the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The standard notation in English publications is {{mvar|\u03c6}}. This is the definition assumed when the word latitude is used without qualification. The definition must be accompanied with a specification of the ellipsoid.\n*{{anchor|Geocentric}}'''Geocentric latitude:''' the angle between the radius (from centre to the point on the surface) and the equatorial plane. (Figure [[#Geocentric latitude|below]]). There is no standard notation: examples from various texts include {{mvar|\u03b8}}, {{mvar|\u03c8}}, {{mvar|q}}, {{mvar|\u03c6\u2032}}, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>c</sub>}}, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>g</sub>}}. This article uses {{mvar|\u03b8}}.\n*'''Spherical latitude:''' the angle between the normal to a spherical reference surface and the equatorial plane.\n*'''Geographic latitude''' must be used with care. Some authors use it as a synonym for geodetic latitude whilst others use it as an alternative to the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].\n*'''Latitude''' (unqualified) should normally refer to the geodetic latitude.\n\nThe importance of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated by a simple example. On the reference ellipsoid for WGS84, the centre of the [[Eiffel Tower]] has a geodetic latitude of 48\u00b0&nbsp;51\u2032&nbsp;29\u2033&nbsp;N, or 48.8583\u00b0&nbsp;N and longitude of 2\u00b0&nbsp;17\u2032&nbsp;40\u2033&nbsp;E or 2.2944\u00b0E. The same coordinates on the datum [[ED50]] define a point on the ground which is {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=off}} distant from the tower.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower; the reference ellipsoid is rarely specified.\n\n===Length of a degree of latitude===\n{{main article|Meridian arc}}\nIn [[Meridian arc]] and standard texts<ref name=torge>{{cite book|last=Torge |first=W. |date=2001 |title=Geodesy |edition=3rd |publisher=De Gruyter |isbn=3-11-017072-8}}</ref><ref name=osborne/><ref name=rapp/> it is shown that the distance along a meridian from latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} to the equator is given by ({{mvar|\u03c6}} in radians)\n\n:<math>m(\\phi) = \\int_0^\\phi M(\\phi')\\, d\\phi' = a\\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\int_0^\\phi \\left(1 - e^2 \\sin^2\\phi'\\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\, d\\phi'</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''M''(''\u03c6'')}} is the meridional [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]].\n\nThe distance from the equator to the pole is\n\n:<math>m_\\mathrm{p} = m\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\,</math>\n\nFor [[WGS84]] this distance is {{val|10001.965729|u=km}}.\n\nThe evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection.

An ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the nautical mile with latitude. This was resolved by defining the nautical mile to be exactly 1,852 metres.  However for all practical purposes distances are measured from the latitude scale of charts.  As the [[Royal Yachting Association]] says in its manual for [[Day Skipper|day skipper]]s: \"1 (minute) of Latitude = 1 sea mile\", followed by \"For most practical purposes distance is measured from the latitude scale, assuming that one minute of latitude equals one nautical mile\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hopkinson|first=Sara|title=RYA day skipper handbook - sail|year=2012|isbn=9781-9051-04949|publisher=The Royal Yachting Association|place=Hamble|p=76}}</ref>\n\n==Auxiliary latitudes==\n\nThere are six '''auxiliary latitudes''' that have applications to special problems in geodesy, geophysics and the theory of map projections:\n* Geocentric latitude\n* Parametric (or reduced) latitude\n* Rectifying latitude\n* Authalic latitude\n* Conformal latitude\n* Isometric latitude\nThe definitions given in this section all relate to locations on the reference ellipsoid but the first two auxiliary latitudes, like the geodetic latitude, can be extended to define a three-dimensional [[geographic coordinate system]] as discussed [[#Latitude and coordinate systems|below]]. The remaining latitudes are not used in this way; they are used ''only'' as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid. Their numerical values are not of interest. For example, no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude, the semi-major axis, {{mvar|a}}, and the eccentricity, {{mvar|e}}.

An example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the [[equidistant conic projection]].

(See also [[Mercator projection#Alternative expressions|Mercator projection]].)\n\nThe conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of ''arbitrary'' radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of ''small'' elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the [[Transverse Mercator projection]] on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).\n\n===Isometric latitude===\nThe '''isometric latitude''', {{mvar|\u03c8}}, is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. The name \"isometric\" arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of {{mvar|\u03c8}} and longitude {{mvar|\u03bb}} give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively. The [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] defined by the lines of constant {{mvar|\u03c8}} and constant {{mvar|\u03bb}}, divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares (of varying size). The isometric latitude is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude, tending to infinity at the poles. The conventional notation is given in Snyder (page 15):<ref name=snyder/>\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\psi(\\phi) &= \\ln\\left[\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right)\\right] +\n                  \\frac{e}{2}\\ln\\left[\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right] \\\\\n             &= \\sinh^{-1}(\\tan\\phi) -e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi) \\\\\n             &= \\operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\\phi)-e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor the ''normal'' Mercator projection (on the ellipsoid) this function defines the spacing of the parallels: if the length of the equator on the projection is {{mvar|E}} (units of length or pixels) then the distance, {{mvar|y}}, of a parallel of latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} from the equator is\n:<math>y(\\phi) = \\frac{E}{2\\pi}\\psi(\\phi)\\,.</math>\n\nThe isometric latitude {{mvar|\u03c8}} is closely related to the conformal latitude {{mvar|\u03c7}}:\n:<math>\\psi(\\phi) = \\operatorname{gd}^{-1} \\chi(\\phi)\\,.</math>\n\n===Inverse formulae and series===\nThe formulae in the previous sections give the auxiliary latitude in terms of the geodetic latitude. The expressions for the geocentric and parametric latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases: the rectifying, authalic, conformal, and isometric latitudes. There are two methods of proceeding. The first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude. The methods available are [[fixed-point iteration]] and [[Newton's method|Newton\u2013Raphson]] root finding. The other, more useful, approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of [[Lagrange reversion]]. Such series are presented by Adams who uses Taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity.<ref name=adams1921/> Osborne<ref name=osborne/> derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package Maxima<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maxima.sourceforge.net/ |title=Maxima computer algebra system |website=[[Sourceforge]]}}</ref> and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening. The series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step.\n\n===Numerical comparison of auxiliary latitudes===\n[[File:Auxiliary Latitudes Difference.svg|inline|right]]\nThe plot to the right shows the difference between the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes other than the isometric latitude (which diverges to infinity at the poles) for the case of the WGS84 ellipsoid.

To define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions. Three latitudes are used in this way: the geodetic, geocentric and parametric latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates, spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively.\n\n===Geodetic coordinates===\n[[File:Geodetic coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''\u0278'',''\u03bb'',''h'')}}]]\nAt an arbitrary point {{math|P}} consider the line {{math|PN}} which is normal to the reference ellipsoid. The geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''\u0278'',''\u03bb'',''h'')}} are the latitude and longitude of the point {{math|N}} on the ellipsoid and the distance {{math|PN}}. This height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location. The direction of {{math|PN}} will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line. The relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the Earth.\n\n===Spherical polar coordinates===\n\n[[File:Geocentric coords 02.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geocentric coordinate related to spherical polar coordinates {{math|P(''r'',''\u03b8''\u2032,''\u03bb'')}}]]\nThe geocentric latitude {{mvar|\u03b8}} is the complement of the polar angle {{mvar|\u03b8\u2032}} in conventional [[spherical polar coordinates]] in which the coordinates of a point are {{math|P(''r'',''\u03b8''\u2032,''\u03bb'')}} where {{mvar|r}} is the distance of {{math|P}} from the centre {{math|O}}, {{mvar|\u03b8\u2032}} is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and {{mvar|\u03bb}} is longitude. Since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points {{math|P'}} on the normal, which all have the same geodetic latitude, will have differing geocentric latitudes. Spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity field.\n\n===Ellipsoidal coordinates===\n[[File:Ellipsoidal coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ellipsoidal coordinates {{math|P(''u'',''\u03b2'',''\u03bb'')}}]]\nThe parametric latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system. For a point {{math|P}} not on the reference ellipsoid (semi-axes {{math|OA}} and {{math|OB}}) construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal (same foci {{math|F}}, {{math|F\u2032}}) with the reference ellipsoid: the necessary condition is that the product {{mvar|ae}} of semi-major axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids. Let {{mvar|u}} be the semi-minor axis ({{math|OD}}) of the auxiliary ellipsoid. Further let {{mvar|\u03b2}} be the parametric latitude of {{math|P}} on the auxiliary ellipsoid. The set {{math|(''u'',''\u03b2'',''\u03bb'')}} define the ellipsoid coordinates.<ref name=torge/>{{rp|\u00a74.2.2}} These coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a rotating ellipsoidal body.\n\n===Coordinate conversions===\nThe relations between the above coordinate systems, and also Cartesian coordinates are not presented here. The transformation between geodetic and Cartesian coordinates may be found in [[Geographic coordinate conversion]]. The relation of Cartesian and spherical polars is given in [[Spherical coordinate system]]. The relation of Cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in Torge.<ref name=torge/>\n\n==Astronomical latitude==\n'''Astronomical latitude''' ({{math|\u03a6}}) is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true vertical at a point on the surface. The true vertical, the direction of a [[plumb line]], is also the direction of the gravity acceleration, the resultant of the [[gravitational acceleration]] (mass-based) and the [[centrifugal acceleration]] at that latitude.<ref name=torge/> Astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the [[zenith]] and stars whose [[declination]] is accurately known.\n\nIn general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid. The angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy.<ref name=torge/><ref name=wellenhofmoritz>{{cite book|last1=Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1=B. |last2=Moritz |first2=H. |date=2006 |title=Physical Geodesy |edition=2nd |isbn=3-211-33544-7}}</ref> The reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is, because the geoid is an idealized, theoretical shape \"at mean sea level\". Points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly. Also, the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces, which the theoretical geoid averages out.\n\nAstronomical latitude is not to be confused with [[declination]], the coordinate [[astronomer]]s use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[celestial equator]] (see [[equatorial coordinates]]), nor with [[ecliptic latitude]], the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[ecliptic]] (see [[ecliptic coordinates]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Altitude]] ([[sea level|mean sea level]])\n*[[Bowditch's American Practical Navigator]]\n*[[Cardinal direction]]\n*[[Circle of latitude]]\n*[[Declination]] on [[celestial sphere]]\n*[[Degree Confluence Project]]\n*[[Geodesy]]\n*[[Geodetic datum]]\n*[[Geographic coordinate system]]\n*[[Geographical distance]]\n*[[Geotagging]]\n*[[Great-circle distance]]\n*[[History of latitude measurements]]\n*[[Horse latitudes]]\n*[[List of countries by latitude]]\n*[[Longitude]]\n*[[Natural Area Code]]\n*[[Navigation]]\n*[[Orders of magnitude (length)]]\n*[[World Geodetic System]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Noteslist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks}}\n*[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/ GEONets Names Server], access to the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]'s (NGA) database of foreign geographic feature names.\n*[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~cvm/latlon_find_location.html Resources for determining your latitude and longitude]\n*[http://geography.about.com/library/howto/htdegrees.htm Convert decimal degrees into degrees, minutes, seconds] - Info about decimal to [[sexagesimal]] conversion\n*[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html Convert decimal degrees into degrees, minutes, seconds]\n*[http://www.marinewaypoints.com/learn/greatcircle.shtml Distance calculation based on latitude and longitude] - JavaScript version\n*[https://www.academia.edu/12297694/16th_Century_Latitude_Survey 16th Century Latitude Survey]\n*[http://www.longcamp.com/nav.html Determination of Latitude by Francis Drake on the Coast of California in 1579]\n\n\n{{geographical coordinates|state=collapsed}}\n{{Map projection}}\n\n[[Category:Lines of latitude| ]]\n[[Category:Geodesy]]\n[[Category:Navigation]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the geographical reference system}}\n{{short description|geographic coordinate specifying north\u2013south position}}\n{{more sources|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Division of the Earth into Gauss-Krueger zones - Globe.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] on the Earth as a [[sphere]] or an [[ellipsoid]].

The graticule shows the latitude and longitude of points on the surface. In this example meridians are spaced at 6\u00b0 intervals and parallels at 4\u00b0 intervals.]]\n\nIn [[geography]], '''latitude''' is a [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinate]] that specifies the [[north]]\u2013[[south]] position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0\u00b0 at the [[Equator]] to 90\u00b0 (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or ''parallels'', run east\u2013west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with [[longitude]] to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. On its own, the term latitude should be taken to be the ''geodetic latitude'' as defined below. Briefly, geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular (or ''[[Normal (geometry) |  normal]]'') to the ellipsoidal surface from that point, and the equatorial plane. Also defined are six ''auxiliary latitudes'' which are used in special applications.\n\n==Preliminaries==\nTwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the [[geoid]], a surface which approximates the [[Sea level|mean sea level]] over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a [[sphere]], but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the ''actual'' surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of [[Altitude|height]] constitute a [[geographic coordinate system]] as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.{{efn|The current full documentation of ISO 19111 may be purchased from http://www.iso.org but drafts of the final standard are freely available at many web sites, one such is available at the following\n[https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/pub/Xmml/CoordinateReferenceSystems/19111_FDIS20021107.pdf CSIRO]}}\n\nSince there are many different [[reference ellipsoid]]s, the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique: this is stressed in the ISO standard which states that \"without the full specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates (that is latitude and longitude) are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst\". This is of great importance in accurate applications, such as a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), but in common usage, where high accuracy is not required, the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated.\n\nIn English texts the latitude angle, defined below, is usually denoted by the Greek lower-case letter [[phi (letter)|phi]] ({{mvar|\u03c6}} or {{mvar|\u03d5}}). It is measured in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], [[arcminute|minutes and seconds]] or [[decimal degrees]], north or south of the equator.\n<!--The latitude of a point on the reference surface is defined as the angle between the [[Surface normal|normal]] to the reference surface (at the point in question) and the equatorial plane. A corollary of this definition is that the latitude angle of a point on the reference surface is not unique: it depends on the precise choice of the reference surface. -->\n\nThe precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the Earth, either to set up [[theodolite]]s or to determine GPS satellite orbits. The study of the [[figure of the Earth]] together with its gravitational field is the science of [[geodesy]].\n<!-- here except in relation to the definition of the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].-->\n\nThis article relates to coordinate systems for the Earth: it may be extended to cover the Moon, planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature.\n\n==Latitude on the sphere==\n[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on a sphere.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A perspective view of the Earth showing how latitude (<math>\\phi</math>) and longitude (<math>\\lambda</math>) are defined on a spherical model. The graticule spacing is 10 degrees.]]\n\n===The graticule on the sphere===\nThe graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude, which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the Earth. The primary reference points are the [[Geographical pole|poles]] where the axis of rotation of the Earth intersects the reference surface. Planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]]; and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through Greenwich (the [[Prime Meridian]]) defines the longitude: meridians are lines of constant longitude. The plane through the centre of the Earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the [[Equator]]. Planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude; these are the parallels. The Equator has a latitude of 0\u00b0, the [[North Pole]] has a latitude of 90\u00b0 North (written 90\u00b0&nbsp;N or +90\u00b0), and the [[South Pole]] has a latitude of 90\u00b0 South (written 90\u00b0&nbsp;S or \u221290\u00b0). The latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point: the normal to the surface of the sphere is  along the radius vector.\n\nThe latitude, as defined in this way for the sphere, is often termed the spherical latitude, to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article.\n\n===Named latitudes on the Earth===\n[[File:December solstice geometry.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The orientation of the Earth at the December solstice.]]\nBesides the equator, four other parallels are of significance:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| [[Arctic Circle]] || 66\u00b0 34\u2032 (66.57\u00b0) N\n|-\n| [[Tropic of Cancer]] ||23\u00b0 26\u2032 (23.43\u00b0) N\n|-\n| [[Tropic of Capricorn]] || 23\u00b0 26\u2032 (23.43\u00b0) S\n|-\n| [[Antarctic Circle]] || 66\u00b0 34\u2032 (66.57\u00b0) S\n|}\nThe plane of the Earth's orbit about the Sun is called the [[ecliptic]], and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the Earth is the equatorial plane. The angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt, the obliquity, or the inclination of the ecliptic, and it is conventionally denoted by {{mvar|i}}. The latitude of the tropical circles is equal to {{mvar|i}} and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement (90\u00b0 - ''i''). The axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]. The time variation is discussed more fully in the article on [[axial tilt]].{{efn|The value of this angle today is {{circle of latitude|tropical|convert}}. This figure is provided by [[Template:Circle of latitude]].}}\n\nThe figure shows the geometry of a [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the Earth and the Sun at the December [[solstice]] when the Sun is overhead at some point of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. The south polar latitudes below the [[Antarctic Circle]] are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. Only at latitudes in between the two [[tropics]] is it possible for the Sun to be directly overhead (at the [[zenith]]).\n\nOn [[map projections]] there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear. The examples below show the named parallels (as red lines) on the commonly used [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. On the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical, whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical: both are complicated curves.\n{| style=\"text-align:left\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-valign=top\n! width=\"1%\" |\n! width=\"36%\"|Normal Mercator\n! width=\"3%\"|\n! width=\"36%\" |Transverse Mercator\n! width=\"1%\" |\n|-valign=top\n|\n| align=\"center\" width=\"200px\" | [[File:MercNormSph enhanced.png|center|200px]]\n|\n\\\n| align=\"center\" width=\"200px\" | [[File:MercTranSph enhanced.png|center|200px]]\n|}\n\n===Meridian distance on the sphere===\nOn the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude ({{mvar|\u03c6}}) is\ntherefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned. If the [[Meridian arc|meridian distance]] is denoted by {{math|''m''(''\u03c6'')}} then\n:<math> m(\\phi)=\\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}R\\phi_\\mathrm{degrees} = R\\phi_\\mathrm{radians}</math>\nwhere {{mvar|R}} denotes the [[Earth radius#Mean radii|mean radius]] of the Earth. {{mvar|R}} is equal to {{convert|6371|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=in}}. No higher accuracy is appropriate for {{mvar|R}} since higher-precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model. With this value for {{mvar|R}} the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is {{convert|111.2|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (60.0 nautical miles). The length of 1 minute of latitude is {{convert|1.853|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (1.00 nautical miles), while the length of 1 second of latitude is {{convert|30.8|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=in}} (see [[nautical mile]]).\n\n==Latitude on the ellipsoid==\n\n===Ellipsoids===\n\n{{main article|Ellipsoid}}\nIn 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] ellipsoid.<ref name=newton>{{cite book|first=Isaac |last=Newton|title=Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|chapter=Book III Proposition XIX Problem III|page= [https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/407 407] |translator-first=Andrew |translator-last=Motte |url=https://archive.org/details/100878576}}</ref> (This article uses the term ''ellipsoid'' in preference to the older term ''spheroid''.) Newton's result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th century. (See [[Meridian arc]].) An oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis (minor axis). \"Oblate ellipsoid of revolution\" is abbreviated to 'ellipsoid' in the remainder of this article. (Ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxial.)\n\nMany different [[Figure of the Earth|reference ellipsoids]] have been used in the history of [[geodesy]]. In pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the [[geoid]] over the limited area of a survey but, with the advent of [[GPS]], it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids (such as [[WGS84]]) with centre at the centre of mass of the Earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the Earth. These geocentric ellipsoids are usually within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the geoid. Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out [[Datum (geodesy)|datum transformations]] which link WGS84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid.\n\n===The geometry of the ellipsoid===\n[[File:Ellipsoid parametric euler mono.svg|thumb|right|200px |A sphere of radius ''a'' compressed along the ''z'' axis to form an oblate ellipsoid of revolution.]]\n\nThe shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the [[ellipse]] which is rotated about its minor (shorter) axis. Two parameters are required. One is invariably the equatorial radius, which is the [[ellipse|semi-major axis]], {{mvar|a}}. The other parameter is usually (1)&nbsp;the polar radius or [[ellipse|semi-minor axis]], {{mvar|b}}; or (2)&nbsp;the (first) [[flattening]], {{mvar|f}}; or (3)&nbsp;the [[ellipse|eccentricity]], {{mvar|e}}. These parameters are not independent: they are related by\n\n:<math>f=\\frac{a-b}{a}, \\qquad e^2=2f-f^2,\\qquad b=a(1-f)=a\\sqrt{1-e^2}\\,.</math>\nMany other parameters (see [[ellipse]], [[ellipsoid]]) appear in the study of geodesy, geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}}. Both {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}} are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations; they are of the order {{sfrac|1|300}} and 0.08 respectively. Values for a number of ellipsoids are given in [[Figure of the Earth]]. Reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the ''inverse'' flattening, {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}}. For example, the defining values for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid, used by all GPS devices, are<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350_2.htmlNIMA |publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication |title=TR8350.2 |page=3\u20131 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* {{mvar|a}} (equatorial radius): {{val|6378137.0|u=m}} exactly\n* {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}} (inverse flattening): {{val|298.257223563}} exactly\nfrom which are derived\n* {{mvar|b}} (polar radius): {{val|6356752.3142|u=m}}\n* {{math|''e''<sup>2</sup>}} (eccentricity squared): {{val|0.00669437999014}}\nThe difference between the semi-major and semi-minor axes is about {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=in}} and as fraction of the semi-major axis it equals the flattening; on a computer monitor the ellipsoid could be sized as 300 by 299 pixels. This would barely be distinguishable from a 300-by-300-pixel sphere, so illustrations usually exaggerate the flattening.\n\n===Geodetic and geocentric latitudes===\n[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on an ellipsoid.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The definition of geodetic latitude ({{mvar|\u03c6}}) and longitude ({{mvar|\u03bb}}) on an ellipsoid. The normal to the surface does not pass through the centre, except at the equator and at the poles.]]\nThe graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere. The normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre, except for points on the equator or at the poles, but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing:\n\n*{{anchor|Geodetic}}'''Geodetic latitude:''' the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The standard notation in English publications is {{mvar|\u03c6}}. This is the definition assumed when the word latitude is used without qualification. The definition must be accompanied with a specification of the ellipsoid.\n*{{anchor|Geocentric}}'''Geocentric latitude:''' the angle between the radius (from centre to the point on the surface) and the equatorial plane. (Figure [[#Geocentric latitude|below]]). There is no standard notation: examples from various texts include {{mvar|\u03b8}}, {{mvar|\u03c8}}, {{mvar|q}}, {{mvar|\u03c6\u2032}}, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>c</sub>}}, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>g</sub>}}. This article uses {{mvar|\u03b8}}.\n*'''Spherical latitude:''' the angle between the normal to a spherical reference surface and the equatorial plane.\n*'''Geographic latitude''' must be used with care. Some authors use it as a synonym for geodetic latitude whilst others use it as an alternative to the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].\n*'''Latitude''' (unqualified) should normally refer to the geodetic latitude.\n\nThe importance of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated by a simple example. On the reference ellipsoid for WGS84, the centre of the [[Eiffel Tower]] has a geodetic latitude of 48\u00b0&nbsp;51\u2032&nbsp;29\u2033&nbsp;N, or 48.8583\u00b0&nbsp;N and longitude of 2\u00b0&nbsp;17\u2032&nbsp;40\u2033&nbsp;E or 2.2944\u00b0E. The same coordinates on the datum [[ED50]] define a point on the ground which is {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=off}} distant from the tower.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower; the reference ellipsoid is rarely specified.\n\n===Length of a degree of latitude===\n{{main article|Meridian arc}}\nIn [[Meridian arc]] and standard texts<ref name=torge>{{cite book|last=Torge |first=W. |date=2001 |title=Geodesy |edition=3rd |publisher=De Gruyter |isbn=3-11-017072-8}}</ref><ref name=osborne/><ref name=rapp/> it is shown that the distance along a meridian from latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} to the equator is given by ({{mvar|\u03c6}} in radians)\n\n:<math>m(\\phi) = \\int_0^\\phi M(\\phi')\\, d\\phi' = a\\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\int_0^\\phi \\left(1 - e^2 \\sin^2\\phi'\\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\, d\\phi'</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''M''(''\u03c6'')}} is the meridional [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]].\n\nThe distance from the equator to the pole is\n\n:<math>m_\\mathrm{p} = m\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\,</math>\n\nFor [[WGS84]] this distance is {{val|10001.965729|u=km}}.\n\nThe evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection.

An ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the nautical mile with latitude. This was resolved by defining the nautical mile to be exactly 1,852 metres.

The remaining latitudes are not used in this way; they are used ''only'' as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid. Their numerical values are not of interest. For example, no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude, the semi-major axis, {{mvar|a}}, and the eccentricity, {{mvar|e}}.

The sphere may then be projected to the plane with an [[equirectangular projection]] to give a double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane such that all meridians have true length and uniform meridian scale. An example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the [[equidistant conic projection]]. (Snyder, Section 16).<ref name=snyder/> The rectifying latitude is also of great importance in the construction of the [[Transverse Mercator projection]].\n\n===Authalic latitude===\n{{see also|Authalic radius}}\nThe '''authalic''' (Greek for [[wiktionary:authalic|same area]]) latitude, {{mvar|\u03be}}, gives an area-preserving transformation to a sphere.\n:<math>\\xi(\\phi) = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{q(\\phi)}{q_\\mathrm{p}}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  q(\\phi) &= \\frac{\\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\sin\\phi}{1 - e^2 \\sin^2 \\phi} -\n               \\frac{1 - e^2}{2e}\\ln \\left(\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right) \\\\[2pt]\n          &= \\frac{\\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\sin\\phi}{1 - e^2 \\sin^2 \\phi} + \\frac{1 - e^2}{e}\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  q_\\mathrm{p} = q\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n    &= 1 - \\frac{1 - e^2}{2e} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}\\right) \\\\\n    &= 1 + \\frac{1 - e^2}{e}\\tanh^{-1}e\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand the radius of the sphere is taken as\n:<math>R_q = a\\sqrt{\\frac{q_\\mathrm{p}}{2}}\\,.</math>\n\nAn example of the use of the authalic latitude is the [[Albers projection|Albers equal-area conic projection]].<ref name=snyder/>{{rp|\u00a714}}\n\n===Conformal latitude===\nThe '''conformal latitude''', {{mvar|\u03c7}}, gives an angle-preserving ([[Conformal map|conformal]]) transformation to the sphere.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\chi(\\phi) &= 2\\tan^{-1}\\left[\n    \\left(\\frac{1 +  \\sin\\phi}{1 -  \\sin\\phi}\\right)\n    \\left(\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right)^e\\right\n  ]^\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\[2pt]\n             &= 2\\tan^{-1}\\left[\n                  \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n                  \\left(\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right)^\\frac{e}{2}\n                \\right] - \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\[2pt]\n             &= \\tan^{-1}\\left[\\sinh\\left(\\sinh^{-1}(\\tan\\phi) - e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi)\\right)\\right] \\\\\n             &= \\operatorname{gd}\\left[\\operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\\phi) - e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi)\\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|gd(''x'')}} is the [[Gudermannian function]]. (See also [[Mercator projection#Alternative expressions|Mercator projection]].)\n\nThe conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of ''arbitrary'' radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of ''small'' elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the [[Transverse Mercator projection]] on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).\n\n===Isometric latitude===\nThe '''isometric latitude''', {{mvar|\u03c8}}, is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. The name \"isometric\" arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of {{mvar|\u03c8}} and longitude {{mvar|\u03bb}} give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively. The [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] defined by the lines of constant {{mvar|\u03c8}} and constant {{mvar|\u03bb}}, divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares (of varying size). The isometric latitude is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude, tending to infinity at the poles. The conventional notation is given in Snyder (page 15):<ref name=snyder/>\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\psi(\\phi) &= \\ln\\left[\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right)\\right] +\n                  \\frac{e}{2}\\ln\\left[\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right] \\\\\n             &= \\sinh^{-1}(\\tan\\phi) -e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi) \\\\\n             &= \\operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\\phi)-e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor the ''normal'' Mercator projection (on the ellipsoid) this function defines the spacing of the parallels: if the length of the equator on the projection is {{mvar|E}} (units of length or pixels) then the distance, {{mvar|y}}, of a parallel of latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} from the equator is\n:<math>y(\\phi) = \\frac{E}{2\\pi}\\psi(\\phi)\\,.</math>\n\nThe isometric latitude {{mvar|\u03c8}} is closely related to the conformal latitude {{mvar|\u03c7}}:\n:<math>\\psi(\\phi) = \\operatorname{gd}^{-1} \\chi(\\phi)\\,.</math>\n\n===Inverse formulae and series===\nThe formulae in the previous sections give the auxiliary latitude in terms of the geodetic latitude. The expressions for the geocentric and parametric latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases: the rectifying, authalic, conformal, and isometric latitudes. There are two methods of proceeding. The first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude. The methods available are [[fixed-point iteration]] and [[Newton's method|Newton\u2013Raphson]] root finding. The other, more useful, approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of [[Lagrange reversion]]. Such series are presented by Adams who uses Taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity.<ref name=adams1921/> Osborne<ref name=osborne/> derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package Maxima<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maxima.sourceforge.net/ |title=Maxima computer algebra system |website=[[Sourceforge]]}}</ref> and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening. The series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step.\n\n===Numerical comparison of auxiliary latitudes===\n[[File:Auxiliary Latitudes Difference.svg|inline|right]]\nThe plot to the right shows the difference between the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes other than the isometric latitude (which diverges to infinity at the poles) for the case of the WGS84 ellipsoid. The differences shown on the plot are in arc minutes. \nIn the Northern hemisphere (positive latitudes), ''\u03b8'' \u2264 ''\u03c7'' \u2264 ''\u03bc'' \u2264 ''\u03be'' \u2264 ''\u03b2'' \u2264 ''\u03c6''; in the Southern hemisphere (negative latitudes), the inequalities are reversed, with equality at the equator and the poles. Although the graph appears symmetric about 45\u00b0, the minima of the curves actually lie between 45\u00b0 2\u2032 and 45\u00b0 6\u2032. Some representative data points are given in the table below.

Three latitudes are used in this way: the geodetic, geocentric and parametric latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates, spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively.\n\n===Geodetic coordinates===\n[[File:Geodetic coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''\u0278'',''\u03bb'',''h'')}}]]\nAt an arbitrary point {{math|P}} consider the line {{math|PN}} which is normal to the reference ellipsoid. The geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''\u0278'',''\u03bb'',''h'')}} are the latitude and longitude of the point {{math|N}} on the ellipsoid and the distance {{math|PN}}. This height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location. The direction of {{math|PN}} will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line. The relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the Earth.\n\n===Spherical polar coordinates===\n\n[[File:Geocentric coords 02.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geocentric coordinate related to spherical polar coordinates {{math|P(''r'',''\u03b8''\u2032,''\u03bb'')}}]]\nThe geocentric latitude {{mvar|\u03b8}} is the complement of the polar angle {{mvar|\u03b8\u2032}} in conventional [[spherical polar coordinates]] in which the coordinates of a point are {{math|P(''r'',''\u03b8''\u2032,''\u03bb'')}} where {{mvar|r}} is the distance of {{math|P}} from the centre {{math|O}}, {{mvar|\u03b8\u2032}} is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and {{mvar|\u03bb}} is longitude. Since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points {{math|P'}} on the normal, which all have the same geodetic latitude, will have differing geocentric latitudes. Spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity field.\n\n===Ellipsoidal coordinates===\n[[File:Ellipsoidal coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ellipsoidal coordinates {{math|P(''u'',''\u03b2'',''\u03bb'')}}]]\nThe parametric latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system. For a point {{math|P}} not on the reference ellipsoid (semi-axes {{math|OA}} and {{math|OB}}) construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal (same foci {{math|F}}, {{math|F\u2032}}) with the reference ellipsoid: the necessary condition is that the product {{mvar|ae}} of semi-major axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids. Let {{mvar|u}} be the semi-minor axis ({{math|OD}}) of the auxiliary ellipsoid. Further let {{mvar|\u03b2}} be the parametric latitude of {{math|P}} on the auxiliary ellipsoid. The set {{math|(''u'',''\u03b2'',''\u03bb'')}} define the ellipsoid coordinates.<ref name=torge/>{{rp|\u00a74.2.2}} These coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a rotating ellipsoidal body.\n\n===Coordinate conversions===\nThe relations between the above coordinate systems, and also Cartesian coordinates are not presented here. The transformation between geodetic and Cartesian coordinates may be found in [[Geographic coordinate conversion]]. The relation of Cartesian and spherical polars is given in [[Spherical coordinate system]]. The relation of Cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in Torge.<ref name=torge/>\n\n==Astronomical latitude==\n'''Astronomical latitude''' ({{math|\u03a6}}) is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true vertical at a point on the surface. The true vertical, the direction of a [[plumb line]], is also the direction of the gravity acceleration, the resultant of the [[gravitational acceleration]] (mass-based) and the [[centrifugal acceleration]] at that latitude.<ref name=torge/> Astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the [[zenith]] and stars whose [[declination]] is accurately known.\n\nIn general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid. The angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy.<ref name=torge/><ref name=wellenhofmoritz>{{cite book|last1=Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1=B. |last2=Moritz |first2=H. |date=2006 |title=Physical Geodesy |edition=2nd |isbn=3-211-33544-7}}</ref> The reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is, because the geoid is an idealized, theoretical shape \"at mean sea level\". Points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly. Also, the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces, which the theoretical geoid averages out.\n\nAstronomical latitude is not to be confused with [[declination]], the coordinate [[astronomer]]s use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[celestial equator]] (see [[equatorial coordinates]]), nor with [[ecliptic latitude]], the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[ecliptic]] (see [[ecliptic coordinates]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Altitude]] ([[sea level|mean sea level]])\n*[[Bowditch's American Practical Navigator]]\n*[[Cardinal direction]]\n*[[Circle of latitude]]\n*[[Declination]] on [[celestial sphere]]\n*[[Degree Confluence Project]]\n*[[Geodesy]]\n*[[Geodetic datum]]\n*[[Geographic coordinate system]]\n*[[Geographical distance]]\n*[[Geotagging]]\n*[[Great-circle distance]]\n*[[History of latitude measurements]]\n*[[Horse latitudes]]\n*[[List of countries by latitude]]\n*[[Longitude]]\n*[[Natural Area Code]]\n*[[Navigation]]\n*[[Orders of magnitude (length)]]\n*[[World Geodetic System]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Noteslist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks}}\n*[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/ GEONets Names Server], access to the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]'s (NGA) database of foreign geographic feature names.\n*[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~cvm/latlon_find_location.html Resources for determining your latitude and longitude]\n*[http://geography.about.com/library/howto/htdegrees.htm Convert decimal degrees into degrees, minutes, seconds] - Info about decimal to [[sexagesimal]] conversion\n*[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html Convert decimal degrees into degrees, minutes, seconds]\n*[http://www.marinewaypoints.com/learn/greatcircle.shtml Distance calculation based on latitude and longitude] - JavaScript version\n*[https://www.academia.edu/12297694/16th_Century_Latitude_Survey 16th Century Latitude Survey]\n*[http://www.longcamp.com/nav.html Determination of Latitude by Francis Drake on the Coast of California in 1579]\n\n\n{{geographical coordinates|state=collapsed}}\n{{Map projection}}\n\n[[Category:Lines of latitude| ]]\n[[Category:Geodesy]]\n[[Category:Navigation]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7d:3bf:800:ece6:6f3a:6cfc:1862", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude"}

Opened in 1963, the Hall of Fame enshrines exceptional figures in the sport of professional football, including players, coaches, franchise owners, and front-office personnel, almost all of whom made their primary contributions to the game in the [[National Football League]] (NFL); the Hall inducts between four and eight new enshrinees each year. The Hall of Fame's Mission is to \"Honor the Heroes of the Game, Preserve its History, Promote its Values & Celebrate Excellence EVERYWHERE.\"\n\n{{As of|2020}}, there are a total of 346 members of the Hall of Fame,<ref name=\"Year of Enshrinement\">{{cite web|title=Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinees |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/years.aspx#Top|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref> 189 of whom are living. Members are referred to as \"Gold Jackets\" due to the distinctive gold jackets they receive during the induction ceremony. Between four and eight new inductees are normally enshrined every year. In 2020, an additional 15 members, known as the \"Centennial Slate\", were inducted into the Hall of Fame to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the NFL.<ref name=\"Centennial Slate\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Football Hall of Fame.JPG|thumb|left|Old entrance to The Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio]]\nThe city of [[Canton, Ohio]] successfully lobbied the NFL to have the Hall of Fame built and has cited three reasons. First, the NFL was founded in Canton on September 17, 1920<ref name=\"TheStreet\">{{cite web |last1=Fiorillo |first1=Steve |title=History of the NFL: From the 1890s to the Present |url=https://www.thestreet.com/lifestyle/sports/nfl-history-14761022 |website=TheStreet |publisher=TheStreet, Inc. |accessdate=21 January 2019 |ref=TheStreet}}</ref> (at that time it was known as the [[American Professional Football Association]]). Second, the now-defunct [[Canton Bulldogs]] were a successful pro football team and the NFL's first two-time NFL champion (in 1922 and 1923). Third, the Canton community held a fundraising effort that garnered nearly $400,000 ({{Inflation|US-GDP|400000|1962|r=-3|fmt=eq|sign=$}}) to get the Hall of Fame built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.profootballhof.com/visit/hall-of-fame-history/|title=History of the Pro Football Hall of Fame - Visit &#124; Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site|website=www.profootballhof.com}}</ref> Groundbreaking for the building was held on August 11, 1962.

This first expansion cost [[US$|$]]620,000, and was completed in May 1971. The size was increased to {{convert|34000|sqft|m2|-2}} by adding another room. The pro shop opened with this expansion. This was also an important milestone for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as yearly attendance passed the 200,000 mark for the first time. This was at least in some part due to the increase in popularity of professional football caused by the advent of the [[American Football League]] and its success in the final two [[Professional American football championship games|AFL-NFL World Championship]] games.<ref name=\"PFHOF: Then and Now\"/>\n\n[[File:PFootballHall of fame original dome entrance.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Inside the original structure in 2008.]]\nIn November 1977, work began on another expansion project, costing US$1,200,000. It was completed in November 1978, enlarging the gift shop and research library, while doubling the size of the theater. The total size of the hall was now {{convert|50500|sqft|m2|-1}}, more than 2.5 times the original size.<ref name=\"PFHOF: Then and Now\"/>\n\nThe building remained largely unchanged until July 1993. The Hall then announced yet another expansion, costing US$9,200,000, and adding a fifth room. This expansion was completed in October 1995. The building's size was increased to {{convert|82307|sqft|m2|0}}. The most notable addition was the ''GameDay Stadium'', which shows an [[NFL Films]] production on a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|42|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Cinemascope]] screen.<ref name=\"PFHOF: Then and Now\"/>\n\nIn 2013, the Hall of Fame completed its largest expansion and renovation to date.

Though several Hall of Famers have had AFL, [[Canadian Football League]], [[World Football League]], [[United States Football League]], [[Arena Football League]] and/or [[Indoor Football League]] experience, and there is a division of the Hall devoted to alternative leagues such as these, to this point no players have made the Hall without having made significant contributions to either the NFL, AFL or [[All-America Football Conference]].

In addition to the bust that goes on permanent display at the Hall of Fame, inductees receive a distinctive Gold Jacket and previous inductees nearly always wear theirs when participating at the new inductee ceremonies.\n\nPrevious induction ceremonies were held during the next day (Sunday from 1999\u20132005, Saturday in 2006), situated on the steps of the Hall of Fame building. Starting in 2002, the ceremony was moved to Fawcett Stadium (now [[Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium]]), where it was held from 1963 to 1965.

This has included a 2009 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article which criticized the Hall for not including [[Punter (American football)|punter]] [[Ray Guy]] on its ballot, also noting that the Hall did not have an inductee at the time representing the position.<ref name=\"Joyner\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/sports/football/25score.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |first=K C |last=Joyner |title=A Case for Ray Guy Belonging in Pro Football Hall of Fame |date=January 25, 2009}}</ref> (At least two inductees, [[Sammy Baugh]] and [[Yale Lary]], punted in addition to playing other positions.)

Only one official, 1966 inductee [[Shorty Ray|Hugh \"Shorty\" Ray]], has been enshrined. The [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]], [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] and [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] have each inducted game officials as members. In part to rectify the lack of officials and other off-field contributors, the Hall of Fame added a \u201cContributors\u201d committee beginning with the class of 2015, which will nominate officials, general managers, owners and other positions that have historically been overlooked by the committee at large.<ref>King, Peter (October 21, 2014).

First, the NFL was founded in Canton on September 17, 1920<ref name=\"TheStreet\">{{cite web |last1=Fiorillo |first1=Steve |title=History of the NFL: From the 1890s to the Present |url=https://www.thestreet.com/lifestyle/sports/nfl-history-14761022 |website=TheStreet |publisher=TheStreet, Inc. |accessdate=21 January 2019 |ref=TheStreet}}</ref> (at that time it was known as the [[American Professional Football Association]]). Second, the now-defunct [[Canton Bulldogs]] were a successful pro football team and the NFL's first two-time NFL champion (in 1922 and 1923). Third, the Canton community held a fundraising effort that garnered nearly $400,000 ({{Inflation|US-GDP|400000|1962|r=-3|fmt=eq|sign=$}}) to get the Hall of Fame built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.profootballhof.com/visit/hall-of-fame-history/|title=History of the Pro Football Hall of Fame - Visit &#124; Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site|website=www.profootballhof.com}}</ref> Groundbreaking for the building was held on August 11, 1962.

This first expansion cost [[US$|$]]620,000, and was completed in May 1971. The size was increased to {{convert|34000|sqft|m2|-2}} by adding another room. The pro shop opened with this expansion. This was also an important milestone for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as yearly attendance passed the 200,000 mark for the first time. This was at least in some part due to the increase in popularity of professional football caused by the advent of the [[American Football League]] and its success in the final two [[Professional American football championship games|AFL-NFL World Championship]] games.<ref name=\"PFHOF: Then and Now\"/>\n\n[[File:PFootballHall of fame original dome entrance.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Inside the original structure in 2008.]]\nIn November 1977, work began on another expansion project, costing US$1,200,000. It was completed in November 1978, enlarging the gift shop and research library, while doubling the size of the theater. The total size of the hall was now {{convert|50500|sqft|m2|-1}}, more than 2.5 times the original size.<ref name=\"PFHOF: Then and Now\"/>\n\nThe building remained largely unchanged until July 1993. The Hall then announced yet another expansion, costing US$9,200,000, and adding a fifth room. This expansion was completed in October 1995. The building's size was increased to {{convert|82307|sqft|m2|0}}.

The Selection Committee is then polled three times by mail (once in March, once in September, and once in October) to eventually narrow the list to 25 semifinalists. In November, the committee then selects 15 finalists by mail balloting. A Seniors and Contributors Committee, subcommittees of the overall Selection Committee, nominate Seniors (those players who completed their careers more than 25 years ago) and Contributors (individuals who made contributions to the game in areas other than playing or coaching).  The Seniors Committee and Contributors Committee add two or one finalist(s) on alternating years which makes a final ballot of 18 finalists under consideration by the full committee each year.<ref name=\"Selection Process FAQ\"/> Committee members are instructed to only consider a candidate's professional football contributions and to disregard all other factors.<ref name=ojhof>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20126215/for-oj-simpson-welcome-mat-pro-football-hall-fame-canton-out|title=Canton welcome mat still out for O.J.

Rather, all of an enshrinee's affiliations are listed equally.<ref name=\"Selection Process FAQ\"/> While the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] plaques generally depict each of their inductees wearing a particular club's cap (with a few exceptions, such as [[Catfish Hunter]] and [[Greg Maddux]]), the bust sculptures of each Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee make no reference to any specific team. In addition to the bust that goes on permanent display at the Hall of Fame, inductees receive a distinctive Gold Jacket and previous inductees nearly always wear theirs when participating at the new inductee ceremonies.\n\nPrevious induction ceremonies were held during the next day (Sunday from 1999\u20132005, Saturday in 2006), situated on the steps of the Hall of Fame building. Starting in 2002, the ceremony was moved to Fawcett Stadium (now [[Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium]]), where it was held from 1963 to 1965. Since 2007, the enshrinement ceremony has been held on the Saturday night, since 2017 two days after the Hall of Fame Game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Class of 2007 Presenters|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/story.aspx?story_id=2454|accessdate=February 6, 2012|newspaper=Pro Football Hall of Fame|date=July 2, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205224656/http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/story.aspx?story_id=2454|archivedate=February 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Hall of Fame Game==\n\n{{main|Pro Football Hall of Fame Game}}\nThe Hall of Fame Game, the annual NFL preseason opener, is played in Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium at [[Johnson Controls Hall of Fame Village]] in [[Canton, Ohio]]. In 2017, the Hall of Fame Game was held for the first time on Thursday night. The preseason classic kicks off Enshrinement Week Powered by [[Johnson Controls]] and officially kicks off the [[NFL preseason]].\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe small number of candidates elected each year has helped foster what some perceive as an inequality of representation at certain positions or in certain categories of player, with defensive players in general and [[defensive back]]s and outside [[linebacker]]s in particular, [[special teams]] players, [[wide receiver]]s, deserving players who primarily played on bad teams, and those from the \"seniors\" category, being slighted. This has included a 2009 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article which criticized the Hall for not including [[Punter (American football)|punter]] [[Ray Guy]] on its ballot, also noting that the Hall did not have an inductee at the time representing the position.<ref name=\"Joyner\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/sports/football/25score.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |first=K C |last=Joyner |title=A Case for Ray Guy Belonging in Pro Football Hall of Fame |date=January 25, 2009}}</ref> (At least two inductees, [[Sammy Baugh]] and [[Yale Lary]], punted in addition to playing other positions.) Guy was eventually inducted as part of the 2014 class for the Hall of Fame. There has also been criticism that certain players get overlooked because their team underproduced during their careers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/how-to-fix-footballs-hall-of-fame-voting-system/ |work=The New York Times |first=Andy |last=Barall |title=How to Fix Football's Hall of Fame Voting System |date=February 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame is unique among North American major league sports halls of fame in that [[Official (American football)|officials]] have generally been excluded from the Hall. Only one official, 1966 inductee [[Shorty Ray|Hugh \"Shorty\" Ray]], has been enshrined. The [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]], [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] and [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] have each inducted game officials as members. In part to rectify the lack of officials and other off-field contributors, the Hall of Fame added a \u201cContributors\u201d committee beginning with the class of 2015, which will nominate officials, general managers, owners and other positions that have historically been overlooked by the committee at large.<ref>King, Peter (October 21, 2014).
