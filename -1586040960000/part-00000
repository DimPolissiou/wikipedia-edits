The series follows the adventures of an [[List of Earthworm Jim characters#Earthworm Jim|earthworm named Jim]] who is turned into a superhero by a robotic super suit.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=117 }}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nMost episodes involve the series' numerous villains attempting to reclaim the super suit, rule/destroy/freeze/knock over the universe, or otherwise causing mayhem throughout the galaxy. Other problems facing Jim include returning his neighbor's eggbeater and finding a new power source after his suit is depowered. Also, the show breaks the [[fourth wall]] with characters often talking to the audience and the narrator.\n\nEpisodes begin with a [[cold opening]] of Earthworm Jim and Peter Puppy in some peril that has nothing to do with the main plot or the previous episodes, with little explanation of how they got into the mess. In between parts (generally before or after the commercial break), there is a short side-story, generally featuring one of the villains doing a more natural part of life, usually without any involvement from Jim. These can range anywhere from Psy-Crow going through a career change, Evil the Cat disguising himself as a movie star in order to make his evil plans known to the world, or Professor Monkey-For-A-Head attending group therapy and always ending with the line: \"and now, back to Earthworm Jim.\" The end of every episode involves Jim or any other character being crushed by a cow, a play on the first game of the series (in the first stage, the player launches a cow into the sky, only to have it crush the Princess upon the game's ending).\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Earthworm Jim characters}}\n\nMost of the main characters from the show originated from characters introduced in the ''[[Earthworm Jim (video game)|Earthworm Jim]]'' (1994) and ''[[Earthworm Jim 2]]'' (1995) video games. [[Peter Puppy]] becomes Jim's sidekick and friend and [[Princess What's-Her-Name]] his love interest. Many villains from the game, including [[Evil the Cat]] and his assistant [[Henchrat]], [[Psy-Crow]], [[Bob the Killer Goldfish]], [[Queen Slug-for-a-Butt]] and [[Professor Monkey-For-A-Head]] also appear in the show.\n\nAdditionally, some original characters were also created for the show, and were then in turn integrated into video games released after the TV series. For example, [[Evil Jim]], an evil duplicate of Earthworm Jim created for the show, went on to be the main antagonist for the game ''[[Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy]]''.\n\n==Voice cast==\nThe voice director for the series was [[Ginny McSwain]].\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] \u2013 Earthworm Jim, Evil Jim, The Hamsternator, Turns-His-Eyelids-Inside-Out Boy, Jim's Four Brains, The [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], Jaepius: God of Puns\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] \u2013 Peter Puppy, The Narrator, Evil Peter, Puice Dynamo, The President of the United States, The Great Worm Spirit\n* [[Charlie Adler]] \u2013 Professor Monkey-For-A-Head, The Doorman of The Gods, Superhero #1\n* [[Jim Cummings]] \u2013 Psy-Crow, Bob The Killer Goldfish, Johnny Dactyl, Walter, Zantor: Master of The Flying Toup\u00e9e, The Sword of Righteousness, Phlegmaphus: God of Nasal Discharge, Lower Back-Pain Man, The Giant Fur-Bearin' Trout, [[Santa Claus]]\n* [[Edward Hibbert]] \u2013 Evil The Cat\n* [[John Kassir]] \u2013 Snott, Henchrat\n* [[Andrea Martin]] \u2013 Queen Slug-For-A-Butt, The Torch Singer\n* [[Kath Soucie]] \u2013 Princess What's-Her-Name, Evil Princess, Johnny Dactyl's Mom, Perpsichore: Goddess of Disco, Cody\n\n===Additional===\n* [[Gregg Berger]] \u2013 Superhero #2\n* [[S.

The series follows the adventures of an [[List of Earthworm Jim characters#Earthworm Jim|earthworm named Jim]] who is turned into a superhero by a robotic super suit.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=117 }}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nMost episodes involve the series' numerous villains attempting to reclaim the super suit, rule/destroy/freeze/knock over the universe, or otherwise causing mayhem throughout the galaxy. Other problems facing Jim include returning his neighbor's eggbeater and finding a new power source after his suit is depowered. Also, the show breaks the [[fourth wall]] with characters often talking to the audience and the narrator.\n\nEpisodes begin with a [[cold opening]] of Earthworm Jim and Peter Puppy in some peril that has nothing to do with the main plot or the previous episodes, with little explanation of how they got into the mess. In between parts (generally before or after the commercial break), there is a short side-story, generally featuring one of the villains doing a more natural part of life, usually without any involvement from Jim. These can range anywhere from Psy-Crow going through a career change, Evil the Cat disguising himself as a movie star in order to make his evil plans known to the world, or Professor Monkey-For-A-Head attending group therapy and always ending with the line: \"and now, back to Earthworm Jim.\" The end of every episode involves Jim or any other character being crushed by a cow, a play on the first game of the series (in the first stage, the player launches a cow into the sky, only to have it crush the Princess upon the game's ending).\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Earthworm Jim characters}}\n\nMost of the main characters from the show originated from characters introduced in the ''[[Earthworm Jim (video game)|Earthworm Jim]]'' (1994) and ''[[Earthworm Jim 2]]'' (1995) video games. [[Peter Puppy]] becomes Jim's sidekick and friend and [[Princess What's-Her-Name]] his love interest. Many villains from the game, including [[Evil the Cat]] and his assistant [[Henchrat]], [[Psy-Crow]], [[Bob the Killer Goldfish]], [[Queen Slug-for-a-Butt]] and [[Professor Monkey-For-A-Head]] also appear in the show.\n\nAdditionally, some original characters were also created for the show, and were then in turn integrated into video games released after the TV series. For example, [[Evil Jim]], an evil duplicate of Earthworm Jim created for the show, went on to be the main antagonist for the game ''[[Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy]]''.\n\n==Voice cast==\nThe voice director for the series was [[Ginny McSwain]].\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] \u2013 Earthworm Jim, Evil Jim, The Hamsternator, Turns-His-Eyelids-Inside-Out Boy, Jim's Four Brains, The [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], Jaepius: God of Puns\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] \u2013 Peter Puppy, The Narrator, Evil Peter, Puice Dynamo, The President of the United States, The Great Worm Spirit\n* [[Charlie Adler]] \u2013 Professor Monkey-For-A-Head, The Doorman of The Gods, Superhero #1\n* [[Jim Cummings]] \u2013 Psy-Crow, Bob The Killer Goldfish, Johnny Dactyl, Walter, Zantor: Master of The Flying Toup\u00e9e, The Sword of Righteousness, Phlegmaphus: God of Nasal Discharge, Lower Back-Pain Man, The Giant Fur-Bearin' Trout, [[Santa Claus]]\n* [[Edward Hibbert]] \u2013 Evil The Cat\n* [[John Kassir]] \u2013 Snott, Henchrat\n* [[Andrea Martin]] \u2013 Queen Slug-For-A-Butt, The Torch Singer\n* [[Kath Soucie]] \u2013 Princess What's-Her-Name, Evil Princess, Johnny Dactyl's Mom, Perpsichore: Goddess of Disco, Cody\n\n===Additional===\n* [[Gregg Berger]] \u2013 Superhero #2\n* [[S.

This was due in part to the popularity of sporting activities like [[rugby football]] among younger men.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nFrom the turn of the century until the 1920s, a longer variant of the undercut was popular among young working class men, especially members of street gangs. In interwar [[Glasgow]], [[Ned (Scottish)|Neds]], the precursors to the [[Teddy Boy]]s, favoured a haircut that was long on top and cropped at the back and sides. Despite the fire risk, lots of [[paraffin wax]] was used to keep the hair in place.<ref>Christie, Stuart (2002). My Granny Made Me an Anarchist.

This was due in part to the popularity of sporting activities like [[rugby football]] among younger men.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nFrom the turn of the century until the 1920s, a longer variant of the undercut was popular among young working class men, especially members of street gangs. In interwar [[Glasgow]], [[Ned (Scottish)|Neds]], the precursors to the [[Teddy Boy]]s, favoured a haircut that was long on top and cropped at the back and sides. Despite the fire risk, lots of [[paraffin wax]] was used to keep the hair in place.<ref>Christie, Stuart (2002). My Granny Made Me an Anarchist.
