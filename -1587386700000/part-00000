For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as \"[[ice giant]]s\" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus' [[Atmosphere#Others|atmosphere]] is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], but it contains more \"[[volatiles|ices]]\" such as water, [[ammonia]], and [[methane]], along with traces of other [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name=\"Lunine 1993\" /> It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of {{convert|49|K|C F|0}}, and has a complex, layered [[cloud]] structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.<ref name=\"Lunine 1993\" /> The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.<ref name=\"Podolak Weizman et al. 1995\" />\n\nLike the other [[giant planet]]s, Uranus has a [[Rings of Uranus|ring system]], a [[magnetosphere]], and numerous [[natural satellite|moons]].

[[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometry]] over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two [[spectral band]]s, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes.<ref name=\"Lockwood & Jerzykiewicz 2006\" /> A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in [[microwave]] measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Klein & Hofstadter 2006\" /> [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.<ref name=\"Young et al. 2001\" /> The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry.<ref name=\"Karkoschka ('Uranus') 2001\" />\n\nThere are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.<ref name=\"Hammel2007\" /> During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.<ref name=\"Lockwood & Jerzykiewicz 2006\" /> This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.<ref name=\"Hammel2007\" /> Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the [[meridional]] [[albedo]] patterns.<ref name=\"Hammel2007\" /> In the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),<ref name=\"Rages Hammel et al. 2004\" /> whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity,<ref name=\"planetary\" /> such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.<ref name=\"Hammel de Pater et al. Uranus in 2004, 2005\" /> This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.<ref name=\"Sromovsky Fry et al. 2009\" />\n\nThe mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.<ref name=\"Hammel2007\" /> Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus' hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.<ref name=\"Rages Hammel et al. 2004\" /> The bright collar at \u221245\u00b0 latitude is also connected with methane clouds.<ref name=\"Rages Hammel et al. 2004\" /> Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.<ref name=\"Rages Hammel et al. 2004\" /> The variation of the microwave [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]], because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.<ref name=\"Hofstadter & Butler 2003\" /> Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.<ref name=\"planetary\" /><ref name=\"Hofstadter & Butler 2003\" />\n\n== Formation ==\n{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}\n{{For|details of the evolution of Uranus' orbit|Nice model}}\n\nMany argue that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants extend to their formation.<ref name=\"Thommes1999\" /><ref name=\"Brunini1999\" /> The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a giant rotating ball of gas and dust known as the [[presolar nebula]]. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.<ref name=\"Thommes1999\" /><ref name=\"Brunini1999\" /> The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially. The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.<ref name=\"Thommes1999\" /><ref name=\"Brunini1999\" /><ref name=\"Sheppard Jewitt Kleyna 2006\" /> Recent simulations of [[planetary migration]] have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the [[Nice model]]).<ref name=\"Thommes1999\" />\n\n== Moons ==\n{{main|Moons of Uranus}}\n{{see also|Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites}}\n[[File:Uranian moon montage.jpg|thumb|left|Major moons of Uranus in order of increasing distance (left to right), at their proper relative sizes and [[albedo]]s (collage of Voyager&nbsp;2 photographs)]]\n[[File:ESO - Uranus (by).jpg|thumb|right|The Uranus System ([[Very Large Telescope#Instruments|NACO]]/[[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] image)]]\n\nUranus has 27 known [[natural satellites]].<ref name=\"Sheppard Jewitt Kleyna 2006\" /> The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of [[Shakespeare]] and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref name=\"Faure2007\" /><ref name=\"Nineplanets\" /> The five main satellites are [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]].<ref name=\"Faure2007\" /> The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] (largest moon of [[Neptune]]) alone.<ref name=\"Jacobson Campbell et al. 1992\" /> The largest of Uranus' satellites, Titania, has a radius of only {{convert|788.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or less than half that of the [[Moon]], but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the [[List of natural satellites by diameter|eighth-largest moon]] in the Solar System.

All except two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow \u2013 they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.<ref name=\"summary\" /><ref name=\"Esposito2002\" />\n\nWilliam Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.<ref>{{cite news |title=Uranus rings 'were seen in 1700s' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6569849.stm |date=19 April 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Did William Herschel Discover The Rings of Uranus in the 18th Century? |work=Physorg.com |url=http://www.physorg.com/news95949762.html |date=2007 |accessdate=20 June 2007}}</ref> The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by [[James L. Elliot]], Edward W. Dunham, and [[Jessica Mink]] using the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]]. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the [[occultation]] of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its [[atmosphere]]. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.<ref name=\"Elliot1977\" /> Later they detected four additional rings.<ref name=\"Elliot1977\" /> The rings were directly imaged when Voyager&nbsp;2 passed Uranus in 1986.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> Voyager&nbsp;2 also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\nIn December 2005, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the \"outer\" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, [[Mab (moon)|Mab]], shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA's Hubble Discovers New Rings and Moons Around Uranus |work=Hubblesite |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2005/33/ |date=2005 |accessdate=9 June 2007}}</ref> In April 2006, images of the new rings from the [[Keck Observatory]] yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.<ref name=\"dePater2006\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Blue ring discovered around Uranus |publisher=UC Berkeley News |last=Sanders |first=Robert |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/04/06_bluering.shtml |date=6 April 2006 |accessdate=3 October 2006}}</ref>\nOne hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.<ref name=\"dePater2006\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Blue ring of Uranus linked to sparkling ice |author=Battersby, Stephen |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8960-blue-ring-of-uranus-linked-to-sparkling-ice.html |date=April 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2007}}</ref> In contrast, Uranus' inner rings appear grey.<ref name=\"dePater2006\" />\n\n<gallery caption=\"Uranus' rings\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Uranus rings discovery.gif|Animation about the discovering occultation in 1977.

For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as \"[[ice giant]]s\" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus' [[Atmosphere#Others|atmosphere]] is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], but it contains more \"[[volatiles|ices]]\" such as water, [[ammonia]], and [[methane]], along with traces of other [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name=\"Lunine 1993\" /> It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of {{convert|49|K|C F|0}}, and has a complex, layered [[cloud]] structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.<ref name=\"Lunine 1993\" /> The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.<ref name=\"Podolak Weizman et al. 1995\" />\n\nLike the other [[giant planet]]s, Uranus has a [[Rings of Uranus|ring system]], a [[magnetosphere]], and numerous [[natural satellite|moons]].

[[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometry]] over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two [[spectral band]]s, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes.<ref name=\"Lockwood & Jerzykiewicz 2006\" /> A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in [[microwave]] measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Klein & Hofstadter 2006\" /> [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.<ref name=\"Young et al. 2001\" /> The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry.<ref name=\"Karkoschka ('Uranus') 2001\" />\n\nThere are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.<ref name=\"Hammel2007\" /> During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.<ref name=\"Lockwood & Jerzykiewicz 2006\" /> This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.<ref name=\"Hammel2007\" /> Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the [[meridional]] [[albedo]] patterns.<ref name=\"Hammel2007\" /> In the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),<ref name=\"Rages Hammel et al. 2004\" /> whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity,<ref name=\"planetary\" /> such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.<ref name=\"Hammel de Pater et al. Uranus in 2004, 2005\" /> This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.<ref name=\"Sromovsky Fry et al. 2009\" />\n\nThe mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.<ref name=\"Hammel2007\" /> Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus' hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.<ref name=\"Rages Hammel et al. 2004\" /> The bright collar at \u221245\u00b0 latitude is also connected with methane clouds.<ref name=\"Rages Hammel et al. 2004\" /> Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.<ref name=\"Rages Hammel et al. 2004\" /> The variation of the microwave [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]], because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.<ref name=\"Hofstadter & Butler 2003\" /> Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.<ref name=\"planetary\" /><ref name=\"Hofstadter & Butler 2003\" />\n\n== Formation ==\n{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}\n{{For|details of the evolution of Uranus' orbit|Nice model}}\n\nMany argue that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants extend to their formation.<ref name=\"Thommes1999\" /><ref name=\"Brunini1999\" /> The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a giant rotating ball of gas and dust known as the [[presolar nebula]]. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.<ref name=\"Thommes1999\" /><ref name=\"Brunini1999\" /> The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially. The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.<ref name=\"Thommes1999\" /><ref name=\"Brunini1999\" /><ref name=\"Sheppard Jewitt Kleyna 2006\" /> Recent simulations of [[planetary migration]] have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the [[Nice model]]).<ref name=\"Thommes1999\" />\n\n== Moons ==\n{{main|Moons of Uranus}}\n{{see also|Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites}}\n[[File:Uranian moon montage.jpg|thumb|left|Major moons of Uranus in order of increasing distance (left to right), at their proper relative sizes and [[albedo]]s (collage of Voyager&nbsp;2 photographs)]]\n[[File:ESO - Uranus (by).jpg|thumb|right|The Uranus System ([[Very Large Telescope#Instruments|NACO]]/[[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] image)]]\n\nUranus has 27 known [[natural satellites]].<ref name=\"Sheppard Jewitt Kleyna 2006\" /> The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of [[Shakespeare]] and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref name=\"Faure2007\" /><ref name=\"Nineplanets\" /> The five main satellites are [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]].<ref name=\"Faure2007\" /> The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] (largest moon of [[Neptune]]) alone.<ref name=\"Jacobson Campbell et al. 1992\" /> The largest of Uranus' satellites, Titania, has a radius of only {{convert|788.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or less than half that of the [[Moon]], but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the [[List of natural satellites by diameter|eighth-largest moon]] in the Solar System.

All except two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow \u2013 they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.<ref name=\"summary\" /><ref name=\"Esposito2002\" />\n\nWilliam Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.<ref>{{cite news |title=Uranus rings 'were seen in 1700s' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6569849.stm |date=19 April 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Did William Herschel Discover The Rings of Uranus in the 18th Century? |work=Physorg.com |url=http://www.physorg.com/news95949762.html |date=2007 |accessdate=20 June 2007}}</ref> The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by [[James L. Elliot]], Edward W. Dunham, and [[Jessica Mink]] using the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]]. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the [[occultation]] of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its [[atmosphere]]. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.<ref name=\"Elliot1977\" /> Later they detected four additional rings.<ref name=\"Elliot1977\" /> The rings were directly imaged when Voyager&nbsp;2 passed Uranus in 1986.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" /> Voyager&nbsp;2 also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.<ref name=\"Smith Soderblom et al. 1986\" />\n\nIn December 2005, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the \"outer\" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, [[Mab (moon)|Mab]], shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA's Hubble Discovers New Rings and Moons Around Uranus |work=Hubblesite |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2005/33/ |date=2005 |accessdate=9 June 2007}}</ref> In April 2006, images of the new rings from the [[Keck Observatory]] yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.<ref name=\"dePater2006\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Blue ring discovered around Uranus |publisher=UC Berkeley News |last=Sanders |first=Robert |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/04/06_bluering.shtml |date=6 April 2006 |accessdate=3 October 2006}}</ref>\nOne hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.<ref name=\"dePater2006\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Blue ring of Uranus linked to sparkling ice |author=Battersby, Stephen |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8960-blue-ring-of-uranus-linked-to-sparkling-ice.html |date=April 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2007}}</ref> In contrast, Uranus' inner rings appear grey.<ref name=\"dePater2006\" />\n\n<gallery caption=\"Uranus' rings\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Uranus rings discovery.gif|Animation about the discovering occultation in 1977.

{"title_page": "Taxation in Afghanistan", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=November 2009}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\nThis article refers to '''Taxation in Afghanistan'''.\n\nIn the early 1980s, direct taxes accounted for about 15% of government revenues. The share provided by indirect taxes declined from 42% to 30%, as revenues from [[natural gas]] and state enterprises played an increasing role in government finance. [[Tax collection]], never an effective source of revenue in rural areas, was essentially disabled by the disruption caused by fighting and mass flight. Under the [[Taliban]], arbitrary taxes, including those on humanitarian goods, were imposed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Afghanistan-TAXATION.html|title=Afghanistan- Taxation|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Nations Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the government introduced an income (or wage) tax. Employers with two or more employees were required to pay 10% on annual income over about $3,500 and 20% on income over about $27,000.\n\n== Corporate taxes ==\nNo matter what kind of legal form the company has, all of them are required to pay a corporate tax of 20 percent.
