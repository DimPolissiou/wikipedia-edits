The testimony examined the federal government's management of water and natural resources of the Sac and Fox Nation, the extensive surface damages and permanent contamination of the tribal drinking water destroyed by waterflooding techniques and the injection well process used by the oil companies. Testimony from the group also revealed the lack of federal oversight and trust management responsibilities including fraudulent real estate appraisals as evidenced by Mr. Welsh's testimony. This historic testimony by the tribe's representatives, and their internal investigations, revealed the extensive mismanagement of the BIA and the lack of trust responsibilities that led to significant trust management changes and historic legal settlements for the Sac and Fox Nation and its tribal members.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Notable members==\n[[File:Thorpe.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Jim Thorpe]], Sac and Fox Nation Olympic athlete]]\n\n*[[Saginaw Grant]] (born 1936), actor known for his roles in ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]''.<ref>Breslauer, Jan (February 20, 1996).
