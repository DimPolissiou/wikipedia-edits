The group has been noted for its interpretations of [[blues]] material and for its efforts to promote interest in this type of music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]] and [[Bob Hite]], who took the name from [[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]]'s 1928 \"Canned Heat Blues\", a song about an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking [[Sterno]], generically called \"canned heat\", from the original 1914 product name Sterno Canned Heat,<ref>[http://www.sternopro.com/news/2014/sternoproducts] {{Dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref> After appearances at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey]] and [[Woodstock]] festivals at the end of the 1960s, the band acquired worldwide fame with a lineup consisting of Hite (vocals), Wilson (guitar, [[harmonica]] and vocals), [[Henry Vestine]] and later [[Harvey Mandel]] (lead guitar), [[Larry Taylor]] (bass), and Adolfo de la Parra (drums).\n\nThe music and attitude of Canned Heat attracted a large following and established the band as one of the popular acts of the [[hippie]] era. Canned Heat appeared at most major musical events at the end of the 1960s, performing blues standards along with their own material and occasionally indulging in lengthy 'psychedelic' solos. Two of their songs&nbsp;\u2014 \"[[Going Up the Country]]\" and \"[[On the Road Again (Canned Heat song)|On the Road Again]]\"&nbsp;\u2014 became international hits. \"Going Up the Country\" was a remake of the [[Henry Thomas (blues musician)|Henry Thomas]] song \"Bull Doze Blues\", recorded in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1927. \"On the Road Again\" was a remake of the 1953 [[Floyd Jones]] song of the same name, which is reportedly based on the Tommy Johnson song \"Big Road Blues\", recorded in 1928.\n\nSince the early 1970s, numerous personnel changes have occurred. For much of the 1990s and 2000s and following Larry Taylor's death in 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8527836/larry-taylor-canned-heat-bassist-dies-77-obituary|title=Canned Heat Bassist Larry Taylor Dies at 77|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> de la Parra has been the only member from the band's 1960s lineup. He wrote a book about the band's career, titled ''Living the Blues''.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.''(2000).</ref> Mandel, [[Walter Trout]] and [[Junior Watson]] are among the guitarists who gained fame for playing in later editions of the band.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins and early lineups ===\nCanned Heat was started within the community of blues collectors. Bob Hite had been trading blues records since his early teens and his house in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]] was a meeting place for people interested in music. In 1965 some blues devotees there decided to form a [[jug band]] and started rehearsals. The initial configuration comprised Hite as vocalist, Alan Wilson on bottleneck guitar, Mike Perlowin on lead guitar, Stu Brotman on bass and Keith Sawyer on drums. Perlowin and Sawyer dropped out within a few days, so guitarist [[Kenny Edwards]] (a friend of Wilson's) stepped in to replace Perlowin, and Ron Holmes agreed to sit in on drums until they could find a permanent drummer.\n\nAnother of Hite's friends, [[Henry Vestine]] (who had been expelled from [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] for smoking pot,<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 66. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>) asked if he could join the band and was accepted while keeping Edwards on temporarily. Soon Edwards departed (he went on to form the [[Stone Poneys]] with [[Bobby Kimmel]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]]) and at the same time [[Frank Cook (musician)|Frank Cook]] came in to replace Holmes as their permanent drummer. Cook already had substantial professional experience, having performed with such jazz luminaries as bassist [[Charlie Haden]], trumpeter [[Chet Baker]], and pianist [[Elmo Hope]] and had also collaborated with black soul/pop artists such as [[Shirley Ellis]] and [[Dobie Gray]].\n\nProducer [[Johnny Otis]] recorded the band's first (unreleased) album in 1966 with the ensemble of Hite, Wilson, Cook, Vestine, and Brotman; but the record was not actually released until 1970 when it appeared as ''[[Vintage (Canned Heat album)|Vintage Heat]]'', released by [[Janus Records]]. Otis ran the board for a dozen tracks, including two versions of \"[[Rollin' and Tumblin']]\" (with and without harmonica), \"Spoonful\" by [[Willie Dixon]], and \"Louise\" by [[John Lee Hooker]] all from his studio off of Vine Street in Los Angeles. Over a summer hiatus in 1966 Stuart Brotman effectively left Canned Heat after he had signed a contract for a long engagement in Fresno with an Armenian belly-dance revue. Canned Heat had contacted Brotman, touting a recording contract which had to be signed the next day, but Brotman was unable to make the signing on short notice. Brotman would go on to join the world-music band [[Kaleidoscope (American band)|Kaleidoscope]] with [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], replacing Chris Darrow. Replacing Brotman in Canned Heat was [[Mark Andes]], who lasted only a couple of months before he returned to his former colleagues in the Red Roosters, who adopted the new name Spirits Rebellious, later shortened to [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]].\n\nAfter joining up with managers [[Skip Taylor]] and John Hartmann, Canned Heat finally found a permanent bassist in Larry Taylor, who joined in March 1967. He was a former member of The Moondogs and the brother of Ventures' drummer, Mel Taylor, and already had experience backing [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Chuck Berry]] in concert, and recording studio sessions for [[The Monkees]].<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 112. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nIn this format (Hite, Wilson, Vestine, Taylor, Cook) the band started recording in April 1967 for [[Liberty Records]] with [[Calvin Carter]], who had been the head of A&R for [[Vee-Jay Records]] and had recorded such bluesmen as [[Jimmy Reed]], [[John Lee Hooker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wycEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=canned+heat&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDEQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwjumYyl7MnHAhUCvXIKHQXhBss#v=onepage&q=canned%20heat&f=false |title=Billboard |page=12 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date=1967-07-08 |access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref> They recorded \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\", backed with \"Bullfrog Blues\", and this became Canned Heat's first single. The first official album, ''[[Canned Heat (album)|Canned Heat]]'', was released three months later in July 1967. All tracks were re-workings of older blues songs. The Los Angeles Free Press reported: \"This group has it! They should do very well, both live and with their recordings.\" ''[[Canned Heat (album)|Canned Heat]]'' fared reasonably well commercially, reaching #76 on the Billboard chart.\n\n=== Rise to fame and formation of the classic lineup ===\nThe first big live appearance of Canned Heat was at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] on June 17, 1967. A picture of the band taken at the performance was featured on the cover of ''[[Down Beat]]'' where an article complimented their playing: \"Technically, Vestine and Wilson are quite possibly the best two-guitar team in the world and Wilson has certainly become our finest white blues harmonica man. Together with powerhouse vocalist Bob Hite, they performed the country and Chicago blues idiom of the 1950s so skillfully and naturally that the question of which race the music belongs to becomes totally irrelevant.\"<ref>Down Beat, August 10th, 1967.</ref> [[D.A. Pennebaker]]'s [[Monterey Pop|documentary]] captured their rendition of \"[[Rollin and Tumblin]]\" and two other songs from the set, \"Bullfrog Blues\" and \"[[Dust My Broom]]\", found a place later in a boxed CD set in 1992. Canned Heat is also included on an album called ''Early LA''.\n\nCanned Heat also began to garner their notoriety as \"the bad boys of rock\" for being jailed in Denver, Colorado after a police informant provided enough evidence for their arrest for drugs (an incident recalled in their song \"My Crime\"). Band manager Skip Taylor was forced to obtain the $10,000 bail by selling off Canned Heat's publishing rights to Liberty Records president Al Bennett.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 68-71. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Canned Heat 1970.JPG|thumb|1970 photo of the classic Canned Heat lineup.]]\nAfter the Denver incident, Frank Cook was replaced with de la Parra, who had been playing the drums in [[Bluesberry Jam]] (the band which evolved into ''[[Pacific Gas & Electric (band)|Pacific Gas & Electric]]''). As an official member of Canned Heat, de la Parra played his first gig on December 1, 1967, sharing top billing with [[the Doors]] at the Long Beach Auditorium.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 76. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> This began what de la Parra refers to as the classic and perhaps best known Canned Heat lineup, which recorded some of the band's most famous and well-regarded songs. During this \"classic\" period, Skip Taylor and John Hartmann introduced the use of band member nicknames:\n* Bob \"The Bear\" Hite\n* Alan \"Blind Owl\" Wilson\n* Henry \"Sunflower\" Vestine (and later Harvey \"The Snake\" Mandel)\n* Larry \"The Mole\" Taylor\n* Adolfo \"Fito\" de la Parra\n\nTheir second released album, ''[[Boogie with Canned Heat]]'', included \"[[On the Road Again (Canned Heat song)|On the Road Again]]\", an updated version of a 1950s composition by [[Floyd Jones]]. \"On the Road Again\" became the band's break-out song and was a worldwide success, becoming a number one hit in most markets and finally put a blues song on the top charts.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 90. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> The album also included a twelve-minute version of \"Fried Hockey Boogie\", (credited to Larry Taylor, but rather obviously derived from [[John Lee Hooker]]'s \"Boogie Chillen\" riff) allowed each member to stretch out on his instrument while establishing them with hippie ballroom audiences across America as the \"kings of the boogie\". Hite's \"Amphetamine Annie\" (a \"speed kills\" tune inspired by the drug abuse of an acquaintance and reminiscent of Albert King's \"The Hunter\"), became one of their most enduring songs and one of the first \"anti-drug\" songs of the decade. Although not featured on the album's artwork, this was the first Canned Heat Album to have featured drummer de la Parra.\n\nWith this success Taylor, Hartmann and new associate Gary Essert leased a Hollywood club they named the Kaleidoscope on Sunset Boulevard east of Vine in which Canned Heat essentially became the house band; hosting others such as [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Sly and the Family Stone]].<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 93. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Also in 1968, after playing before 80,000 at the first annual Newport Pop Festival in September, Canned Heat left for their first European tour. It entailed a month of concert performances and media engagements that included television appearances on the British show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. They also appeared on the German program ''[[Beat Club]]'', where they lip-synched \"On the Road Again\" as it rose to number one in both countries and in practically all of Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QexOuH8GS-Y&ob=av2e |title=Canned Heat&nbsp;\u2014 On the Road Again |publisher= [[YouTube]] |date= |access-date= May 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Going Up the Country\" and Woodstock ===\nIn October the band released their third album, ''[[Living the Blues]]'', which included \"[[Going Up the Country]]\", their best-known song. Wilson's incarnation of [[Henry Thomas (blues musician)|Henry Thomas]]' \"Bull-Doze Blues\" was almost a note-for-note copy of the original, including Thomas' instrumental break on the \"quills\" (pan-pipes) which [[Jim Horn]] duplicated on flute. Wilson rewrote the lyrics with a simple message that caught the \"back-to-nature\" attitude of the late 1960s. The song went to #1 in 25 countries around the world (#11 on the U.S. national chart) and would go on to become the unofficial theme song of the [[Woodstock Festival]] as captured in [[Michael Wadleigh]]'s [[Woodstock (film)|1970 documentary]]. The album also included a 19-minute experimental track \"Parthenogenesis\", which was a nine-part sound collage of blues, ragas, jaw-harp sounds, guitar distortion and other electronic effects; all pulled together under the direction of manager/producer, Skip Taylor. Longer still is \"Refried Boogie\", clocking in at over 40 minutes, recorded live at the Kaleidoscope.\n\nAlso recorded live at the Kaleidoscope around this time was the album which would find later 1971 release with the deceptive title, ''[[Live At Topanga Corral]]'' (later renamed ''Live at the Kaleidoscope''), under [[Wand Records]] because Liberty Records did not want to release a live album at the time and manager Skip Taylor did not want a lawsuit.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 354. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> The band would end 1968 in a big way at a New Year's show at the [[Shrine Auditorium]], in Los Angeles, with Bob Hite riding a painted purple dayglo elephant to the stage.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 96-98. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nIn July 1969, just prior to Woodstock, ''[[Hallelujah (album)|Hallelujah]]'', their fourth album was released. The ''[[Melody Maker]]'' wrote: \"While less ambitious than some of their work, this is nonetheless an excellent blues-based album and they remain the most convincing of the white electric blues groups.\" The album contained mainly original compositions with lyrics relating to the band such as Wilson's \"Time Was\" and a few re-worked covers like \"Sic 'em Pigs\" ([[Bukka White]]'s \"Sic 'em Dogs\") and the original \"Canned Heat\" by Tommy Johnson.\n\nWithin days of the album's release, Vestine left the group after an on-stage blow up at the [[Fillmore West]] between himself and Larry Taylor. The next night after [[Mike Bloomfield]] and Mandel jammed with Canned Heat, both were offered Vestine's spot in the band's line-up and Mandel accepted.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 6-7. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> The new lineup played two dates at the Fillmore before appearing at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] in mid-August.\n\nArriving via helicopter at Woodstock, Canned Heat played their most famous set on the second day of the festival at sunset. The set included \"Going Up the Country\" which became the title track in the [[Woodstock (film)|documentary]], even though the band's performance was not shown. The song was included in the first (triple) [[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More|Woodstock album]]; while the second album, ''[[Woodstock 2]]'', contained \"Woodstock Boogie\". The expanded ''25th Anniversary Collection'' added \"Leaving This Town\" to the band's collection of Woodstock performances and \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" was included on the director's cut of the documentary film; leaving only \"Let's Work Together\" to be released.<ref>Canned Heat would go on to play (see below) at the 10th Anniversary Concert for Woodstock and their performance has been issued on disc under different titles; one of them being ''Woodstock Festival 10th Anniversary Concert 1979'' (see discography, 1995).</ref>\n\n[[File:Future Blues - Canned Heat.jpg|thumb|right|Future Blues album cover]]\nBefore their European tour in early 1970, the band recorded ''[[Future Blues (Canned Heat album)|Future Blues]]'', an album containing five original compositions and three covers. \"[[Let's Work Together]]\", a [[Wilbert Harrison]] song, was the single chosen for release in Europe to coincide with the tour. At the band's insistence the U.S. release was delayed in order to offer the author's version a chance in the market first.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 128. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Canned Heat had a big hit with \"Let's Work Together\" and was the band's only top ten hit to feature the vocals of Bob \"The Bear\" Hite. The album featured piano by [[Dr. John]] and an atypical jump blues style also. Some controversy was sparked by the [[moon landing]]/[[Iwo Jima]] album cover and the upside down American flag. The upside-down flag was Wilson's idea and was a response to his love of nature, growing environmentalism and concern that humankind would soon be polluting the moon as well as the Earth (as reflected in his song \"Poor Moon\").<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 156-157. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nMaterial from their 1970 European tour provided the tracks for, ''[[Canned Heat '70 Concert Live in Europe]]'', later retitled ''Live in Europe''. It was a live album that combined tracks from different shows throughout the tour, but was put together in such a way as to resemble one continuous concert for the listener. Although the album garnered some critical acclaim and did well in the UK (peaking at #15), it had only limited commercial success in the U.S.; Returning from Europe in May 1970, an exhausted Larry Taylor left the band to join [[John Mayall]] (who had moved to Laurel Canyon, California) and was followed by Mandel.\n\n=== ''Hooker 'n Heat'' and the death of Wilson ===\nWith Taylor and Mandel gone, Vestine returned on guitar, accompanied by bassist Antonio de la Barreda who had played with de la Parra for five years in Mexico City and was previously a member of the groups Jerome and Sam & the Goodtimers.\n\nThis lineup went into the studio to record with [[John Lee Hooker]] the tracks that would yield the double album, ''[[Hooker 'n Heat]]''. The band had originally met Hooker at the airport in Portland, Oregon, and discovered they were fans of each other's work. Hooker and Canned Heat became good friends and Hooker had stated that Wilson was \"the greatest harmonica player ever\".<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.

The rest of the album featured Hooker with some backing by the group (sans Bob Hite, who co-produced the album along with Skip Taylor). The album was finished after Wilson's passing and became the first album in Hooker's career to make the charts, topping out at #73 in February 1971. Hooker 'n Heat would unite again in 1978 and record a live album at the Fox Venice Theatre in Los Angeles, released in 1981 as, ''Hooker 'n Heat, Live at the Fox Venice Theatre'', under [[Rhino Records]]. Also in 1989, Canned Heat (and many others) guested on John Lee Hooker's album ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]''.\n\nShortly after the original ''Hooker 'n Heat'' sessions, Wilson, who had always suffered from depression, was said by some to have attempted suicide by driving his van off the road near Hite's home in Topanga Canyon. Unlike other members of the band, Wilson did not have much success with women and was deeply upset and frustrated by this. His depression also worsened over time.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 140-163. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> On September 3, 1970, just before leaving for a festival in Berlin, the band learned of Wilson's death by barbiturate overdose; his body was found on a hillside behind Hite's home. De la Parra and other members of the band believed that his death was a suicide. Wilson [[27 Club|died at the age of 27]], just weeks before [[Jimi Hendrix]], and then [[Janis Joplin]], died at the same age.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 166-168. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== ''Historical Figures'', ''New Age'' and ''Human Condition'' line-ups ===\nJoel Scott Hill, who had played with the Strangers and the Joel Scott Hill Trio, was recruited to fill the void left by Wilson's death. The band still had a touring contract for September, as well as upcoming studio dates. That fall they toured Australia and Europe; including a show played in Baarn, Netherlands, for the VPRO television program ''Piknik'' and the following summer they appeared at the [[Turku]] Festival in Finland. These performances were recorded, but the recordings were not released until much later, with the albums ''Live at Turku Rock Festival'' in 1995 and ''Under the Dutch Skies 1970&ndash;74'' in 2007 (which encompassed three separate tours). At the end of 1971 a new studio album, ''[[Historical Figures and Ancient Heads]]'', was released. The album included Hite's vocal duet with [[Little Richard]] on \"Rockin' with the King\", written by Skip Taylor and featuring the guitar playing of both Vestine and Joel Scott Hill.\n\nThis lineup of Hite, Vestine, Scott Hill, de la Barreda and de la Parra did not last, as the band was in disarray; Scott Hill and de la Barreda's attitudes were not fitting in with the rest of the band, and drummer de la Parra decided to call it quits. He was talked out of it by Hite, and it was Scott Hill and de la Barreda who left the band instead.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 207-208. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nNew additions to the group were James Shane on rhythm guitar and vocals, Ed Beyer on keyboards, and Richard Hite (Bob Hite's brother) on bass. This lineup recorded what was the band's last album for Liberty/[[United Artists Records]], ''[[The New Age (album)|The New Age]]'', released in 1973. This album featured the popular biker-themed anthem \"The Harley-Davidson Blues\", written by James Shane. The era of the late 1960s was changing, but nonetheless the band embarked on another European tour, during which they recorded a session with [[Memphis Slim]] in Paris, France for the album ''Memphis Heat''. They also recorded with [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]], while still in Paris, for the album ''Gates on the Heat'' (both were released by Blue Star Records).<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 355-356. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Footage from this era can be seen on the DVD ''Canned Heat Live at Montreux'', released in 2004.\n\nMet with hard times, de la Parra writes that the band resorted to importing drugs from Mexico to make ends meet between shows.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 214. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Over $30,000 in debt, manager Skip Taylor advised the band to sign away their future royalties to their previous Liberty/United Artists material and jump to [[Atlantic Records]]. After a bad introduction to Atlantic Records, which included a brawl between Hite and Vestine over a vending machine, the band released the album ''[[One More River To Cross (album)|One More River to Cross]]'' in 1973. Produced by [[Roger Hawkins (drummer)|Roger Hawkins]] and [[Barry Beckett]], this album had a different sound and featured the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section|Muscle Shoals Horns]].<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 229. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nOn a subsequent promotional tour of Europe, this new \"horn band\" sound included the talents of [[Clifford Solomon]] and Jock Ellis. Absent from Canned Heat at this time, after growing ever more distant, was longtime manager Skip Taylor, who had left after the band joined Atlantic.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 236-237. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Atlantic producer [[Tom Dowd]] tried to get one more album out of Canned Heat, despite their drug use and heavy drinking; they ultimately recorded an album's worth of material at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami, Florida during 1974 (featuring some collaboration with former member Mandel), but Atlantic ended its relationship with Canned Heat before it could be released. The masters for the bulk of the material, which had been kept at Skip Taylor's house, were destroyed in a fire, and what material was rescued by de la Parra was finally restored and issued decades later, in 1997, titled ''The Ties That Bind''.<ref name=\"autogenerated356\">Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.

Bob Hite, in a foul rage, went off on the crowd, to the disapproval of Vestine, James Shane and Ed Beyer, who quit the band as a result.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 240. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nTaking the place of those who departed were pianist [[Gene Taylor (pianist)|Gene Taylor]] and guitarist Chris Morgan, who both joined in late 1974. Taylor departed in 1976 in response to an argument during a tour of Germany, and after a brief fill-in by [[Stan Webb]] (of [[Chicken Shack]]), Mark Skyer came in as the new guitar player. In the meantime the band had worked out a deal with [[Takoma Records]], and this \"Human Condition/Takoma\" lineup recorded the 1977 album ''Human Condition''. Despite the appearance of the [[Chambers Brothers]] on the album, it was met with very little success, largely because of the growing popularity of disco music in the late 70s.<ref name=\"autogenerated356\" /> Before long, more arguments ensued, and Mark Skyer, Chris Morgan and Richard Hite all quit the band in 1977. The Bear promptly hired a new bass player, Richard Exley, after befriending him on tour and watching his performance with the band Montana. Becoming fast friends with Hite, Exley toured the remainder of the year with the band and collaborated with Hite on many of the arrangements during their 1976 Texas Bicentennial Comeback Tour. Exley then quit the band after an argument over Hite's excessive drinking and drug use on stage. Frustrated and fed up, Exley joined the Texas Heartbreakers at the end of that year but returned periodically to fill in as a favor to Hite while the band struggled to find permanent members amidst heavy drinking and drug use. Exley remarked about his time with the band, \"No one ever remembers the bass player&nbsp;...\". This effectively reduced the band's members to just Hite and de la Parra.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 247. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== Burger Brothers revival and the death of Bob Hite ===\nThe popularity of the blues genre rose in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the release of the musical-comedy film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), starring [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]]. During this time, de la Parra had bought into the partnership of an East Hollywood recording studio at which he was again working with former bandmate Larry \"The Mole\" Taylor. Taylor had been associating with virtuoso guitar player [[Hollywood Fats|Mike \"Hollywood Fats\" Mann]] and virtuoso piano player [[Ronnie Barron]] and before long Taylor, Barron and Hollywood Fats were in the band. This version referred to by Hite and Mann as the \"Burger Brothers\" lineup, was soon joined by blind piano player Jay Spell, as Ronnie Barron walked out on the band after a blow-up between himself and Taylor.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 248-250. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nThe Burger Brothers played the tenth anniversary of Woodstock at [[Parr Meadows]] in 1979. A recording of the performance eventually surfaced through [[King Biscuit Flower Hour]]'s Barry Ehrmann as, ''Canned Heat In Concert'', in 1995 (de la Parra considers this to be Canned Heat's best recorded live album).<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 357. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Another recording made around this time was for [[Cream Records]], who desired a more R&B-style sound than what Canned Heat was currently offering. This upset Hollywood Fats and Mike Halby was brought in to finish the project; which would not find commercial release until 1981 when former band member Tony de la Barreda put it out under [[RCA]] as a tribute album called, ''In Memory Of Bob \"The Bear\" Hite 1943-1981\u2014\"Don't Forget To Boogie\"''. After a falling out with de la Parra and Hite, Taylor and Mann were increasingly unhappy with the musical direction of the band and eventually left to focus more attention on their [[Hollywood Fats Band]]. Nevertheless, Jay Spell was still on board and brought in bass player Jon Lamb; Mike Halby was now a full-time member and long-time guitarist Vestine once again made his return to the band, with The Bear and de la Parra as its leaders.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 252-258. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nNo longer managed by Howard Wolf, Eddie Haddad set the band up touring military bases across the U.S., Europe and Japan non-stop. Returning with little pay after the difficult tour, Jay Spell quit the band. Jon Lamb stayed on for one more tour in the south and just before Christmas 1980 (and lacking the outlaw roots of the others), he too quit the band; but by then even The Bear was starting to lose it. He had attempted to give it another try by hiring a large enthusiastic biker with the moniker \"The Push\" as their manager; hoping that the band's popularity with the biker community would give them renewed energy.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living The Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 260-268. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> With new bass player Ernie Rodriguez joining the ranks, Canned Heat recorded the 1981 album, ''Kings of the Boogie'', the last album to feature Hite on a few of the tracks.\n\nOn April 5, 1981, having collapsed from a heroin overdose during a show at the [[Palomino Club (North Hollywood)|Palomino]] in Los Angeles, Bob Hite was later found dead in de la Parra's Mar Vista home at the age of 38.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 278-279. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== Later history and the death of Vestine ===\nThe death of frontman Bob \"The Bear\" Hite was a devastating blow that most thought would end the career of Canned Heat; however de la Parra kept the band alive and would lead it back into prosperity over the next few decades. An Australian tour had been set up before The Bear's death and harmonica player Rick Kellogg had joined to finish off the ''Kings of the Boogie'' album. This incarnation of Canned Heat without Bob Hite was nicknamed the \"Mouth Band\" by Vestine and was a huge hit in Australia, especially with the biker crowd.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 282. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Under the management of \"The Push\", the band toured the States playing biker bars and began work on a video known as ''\"The Boogie Assault\"'', starring Canned Heat and various members of the San Francisco chapter of the [[Hells Angels]].\n\nAs production for \"The Push's\" video dragged on, a drunken Vestine got into a brawl with Ernie Rodriguez and was once again out of the band; this time replaced by guitarist Walter Trout.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 291. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> After a tour with John Mayall, as the production for ''\"The Boogie Assault\"'' continued, de la Parra was forced to fire \"The Push\" as the band's manager; but did eventually finish the video and a live Album of the same name recorded in Australia in 1982 (also re-released as ''Live In Australia'' and ''Live In Oz''). This version of Canned Heat would also soon dissolve with a dispute between Mike Halby and de la Parra after the recording of the ''Heat Brothers '84'' EP.\n\nDuring the 1980s the interest in the type of music played by Canned Heat was revived and, despite the past tragedies and permanent instability, the band appeared to be revitalized. In 1985, Trout had left to join John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, so Vestine was once again back in the band and he brought with him new musical talent from Oregon in James Thornbury (slide guitar and lead vocals) and Skip Jones (Bass). They were dubbed the \"Nuts and Berries\" band by de la Parra, due to their love of organic food. It was not long before former members Larry Taylor (replacing Jones) and Ronnie Barron returned to round out the group. Versions of this lineup would record the live album, ''Boogie Up The Country'', in Kassel, Germany, in 1987 and also appear on the ''Blues Festival Live in Bonn '87 Vol 2'' compilation. Barron, just as before did not last long in this lineup, nor did Vestine, who was once again ousted from the band due to pressure from Larry Taylor. Replacing Vestine on lead guitar was [[Junior Watson]]; his style emulated Hollywood Fats (who died in late 1986) and was perfectly suited for the band as witnessed by the well-regarded album, ''[[Reheated]]''. Unfortunately, the album was released only in Germany in 1988 due to disagreements with the Chameleon Music Group Record label.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 316-320. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> In 1990, the \"Would-Be\" lineup of James T, Taylor, Watson and de la Parra also recorded a sequel live album in Australia entitled ''Burnin' Live''.\n\nThe lineup dissolved in the early 1990s as Junior Watson went his own way and Mandel came back into the fold, bringing along Ron Shumake on bass to take some of the load off of Larry Taylor. Mandel, however, left the band after a few tours, so female singer and guitarist Becky Barksdale was brought in for a tour of France, Germany and Hawaii; but lasted no longer. [[Smokey Hormel]] was also considered, but only played one gig before friction between de la Parra and Larry Taylor caused Taylor to bitterly go his separate way with Hormel in tow.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 325-327. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nThe revolving door that was Canned Heat continued as Vestine and Watson made their returns to the lineup as the \"Heavy Artillery\" band. Several former members including Mandel, Barron and Taylor joined up in de la Parra's effort for the album, ''Internal Combustion'', which was released in 1994, but saw only limited release due to the returning manager Skip Taylor's falling out with Red River Records. In 1995, James Thornbury left the band with no hard feelings after ten years of service to live the married life in New South Wales, Australia and new front-man [[Robert Lucas (musician)|Robert Lucas]] came in to take his place. Mandel returned and Shumake left the band in 1996, and after the position of bassist was taken temporarily by Mark \"Pocket\" Goldberg,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://markpocketgoldberg.com/?section=bio |title=Mark \"Pocket\" Goldberg |publisher=Mark \"Pocket\" Goldberg |access-date=2012-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509160457/http://markpocketgoldberg.com/?section=bio |archive-date=2015-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Greg Kage took the reins as the bass player, and after a reconciliation with Larry Taylor the band released, ''Canned Heat Blues Band'', in 1996. On October 20, 1997, a tired and cancer stricken Vestine died in Paris, France following the final gig of a European tour.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.

Notable names include:\n\n* [[John Lee Hooker]]&nbsp;\u2014 In May 1970, Canned Heat backed John Lee Hooker on the album ''Hooker 'n Heat'' released in early 1971. In 1978 a joint performance was recorded live and released as ''Hooker 'n Heat, live at the Fox Venice Theatre'' (1981). In 1989 Canned Heat (and many others) guested on John Lee Hooker's album ''The Healer''.\n* [[Sunnyland Slim]]&nbsp;\u2014 In the spring of 1968, Wilson, Bob Hite, and de la Parra took a cab whose driver turned out to be Sunnyland Slim. Wilson and Hite convinced him to go in the studio again and cut an album for a sublabel of Liberty Records. The album, '' Slim's Got His Thing Goin' On'' featured tracks with Slim fronting Canned Heat and Hite acted as co-producer. Slim thanked them by playing the piano on \"Turpentine Moan\" for the album ''[[Boogie with Canned Heat]]''.\n* [[Memphis Slim]]&nbsp;\u2014 In Paris, on September 18, 1970, Canned Heat went into the studio at the request of French music producer Phillipe Rault to record with Memphis Slim. Three years later and after an overdubbing session with the Memphis Horns of [[Stax Records]] fame, ''Memphis Heat'' was finally released on the French label, Barclay (and was re-released in 2006 on Sunnyside Recordings).\n* [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]]&nbsp;\u2014 In 1973, Canned Heat went again to France to record for Rault, this time with Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown. The sessions did not work out as planned, but the album was released as ''Gate's on the Heat'' and another track appeared in 1975 on his album ''Down South in the Bayou Country''. Later they joined him for a set at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. A DVD of the performance was released.\n* [[Javier Batiz]]&nbsp;\u2014 During the summer of 1969, de La Parra arranged in Los Angeles a recording session for Mexican R&B star Javier Batiz, with whom he had played before moving north and joining Canned Heat. His bandmate Larry Taylor took part in the project and also three musicians who in later years would perform with the band, two as members&nbsp;\u2014 Tony de la Barreda (bass), [[Ernest Lane (musician)|Ernest Lane]] (piano) and Clifford Solomon (saxophone). The recording was released some 30 years later as ''The USA Sessions''.\n* [[Albert Collins]]&nbsp;\u2014 In early 1969, Canned Heat met Collins after a gig and advised him to move to Los Angeles in order to boost his career; there they found him an agent and introduced him to executives for United Artists (UA). In appreciation, Collins' first record title for UA became ''Love Can Be Found Anywhere'', taken from the lyrics of \"Fried Hockey Boogie\".\n* [[Henry Vestine]]&nbsp;\u2014 A recording project from 1981 has been released more than twenty years later under Vestine's name as ''I Used To Be Mad (but Now I am Half Crazy)''.

The group has been noted for its interpretations of [[blues]] material and for its efforts to promote interest in this type of music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]] and [[Bob Hite]], who took the name from [[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]]'s 1928 \"Canned Heat Blues\", a song about an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking [[Sterno]], generically called \"canned heat\", from the original 1914 product name Sterno Canned Heat,<ref>[http://www.sternopro.com/news/2014/sternoproducts] {{Dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref> After appearances at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey]] and [[Woodstock]] festivals at the end of the 1960s, the band acquired worldwide fame with a lineup consisting of Hite (vocals), Wilson (guitar, [[harmonica]] and vocals), [[Henry Vestine]] and later [[Harvey Mandel]] (lead guitar), [[Larry Taylor]] (bass), and Adolfo de la Parra (drums).\n\nThe music and attitude of Canned Heat attracted a large following and established the band as one of the popular acts of the [[hippie]] era. Canned Heat appeared at most major musical events at the end of the 1960s, performing blues standards along with their own material and occasionally indulging in lengthy 'psychedelic' solos. Two of their songs&nbsp;\u2014 \"[[Going Up the Country]]\" and \"[[On the Road Again (Canned Heat song)|On the Road Again]]\"&nbsp;\u2014 became international hits. \"Going Up the Country\" was a remake of the [[Henry Thomas (blues musician)|Henry Thomas]] song \"Bull Doze Blues\", recorded in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1927. \"On the Road Again\" was a remake of the 1953 [[Floyd Jones]] song of the same name, which is reportedly based on the Tommy Johnson song \"Big Road Blues\", recorded in 1928.\n\nSince the early 1970s, numerous personnel changes have occurred. For much of the 1990s and 2000s and following Larry Taylor's death in 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8527836/larry-taylor-canned-heat-bassist-dies-77-obituary|title=Canned Heat Bassist Larry Taylor Dies at 77|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> de la Parra has been the only member from the band's 1960s lineup. He wrote a book about the band's career, titled ''Living the Blues''.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.''(2000).</ref> Mandel, [[Walter Trout]] and [[Junior Watson]] are among the guitarists who gained fame for playing in later editions of the band.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins and early lineups ===\nCanned Heat was started within the community of blues collectors. Bob Hite had been trading blues records since his early teens and his house in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]] was a meeting place for people interested in music. In 1965 some blues devotees there decided to form a [[jug band]] and started rehearsals. The initial configuration comprised Hite as vocalist, Alan Wilson on bottleneck guitar, Mike Perlowin on lead guitar, Stu Brotman on bass and Keith Sawyer on drums. Perlowin and Sawyer dropped out within a few days, so guitarist [[Kenny Edwards]] (a friend of Wilson's) stepped in to replace Perlowin, and Ron Holmes agreed to sit in on drums until they could find a permanent drummer.\n\nAnother of Hite's friends, [[Henry Vestine]] (who had been expelled from [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] for smoking pot,<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 66. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>) asked if he could join the band and was accepted while keeping Edwards on temporarily. Soon Edwards departed (he went on to form the [[Stone Poneys]] with [[Bobby Kimmel]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]]) and at the same time [[Frank Cook (musician)|Frank Cook]] came in to replace Holmes as their permanent drummer. Cook already had substantial professional experience, having performed with such jazz luminaries as bassist [[Charlie Haden]], trumpeter [[Chet Baker]], and pianist [[Elmo Hope]] and had also collaborated with black soul/pop artists such as [[Shirley Ellis]] and [[Dobie Gray]].\n\nProducer [[Johnny Otis]] recorded the band's first (unreleased) album in 1966 with the ensemble of Hite, Wilson, Cook, Vestine, and Brotman; but the record was not actually released until 1970 when it appeared as ''[[Vintage (Canned Heat album)|Vintage Heat]]'', released by [[Janus Records]]. Otis ran the board for a dozen tracks, including two versions of \"[[Rollin' and Tumblin']]\" (with and without harmonica), \"Spoonful\" by [[Willie Dixon]], and \"Louise\" by [[John Lee Hooker]] all from his studio off of Vine Street in Los Angeles. Over a summer hiatus in 1966 Stuart Brotman effectively left Canned Heat after he had signed a contract for a long engagement in Fresno with an Armenian belly-dance revue. Canned Heat had contacted Brotman, touting a recording contract which had to be signed the next day, but Brotman was unable to make the signing on short notice. Brotman would go on to join the world-music band [[Kaleidoscope (American band)|Kaleidoscope]] with [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], replacing Chris Darrow. Replacing Brotman in Canned Heat was [[Mark Andes]], who lasted only a couple of months before he returned to his former colleagues in the Red Roosters, who adopted the new name Spirits Rebellious, later shortened to [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]].\n\nAfter joining up with managers [[Skip Taylor]] and John Hartmann, Canned Heat finally found a permanent bassist in Larry Taylor, who joined in March 1967. He was a former member of The Moondogs and the brother of Ventures' drummer, Mel Taylor, and already had experience backing [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Chuck Berry]] in concert, and recording studio sessions for [[The Monkees]].<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 112. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nIn this format (Hite, Wilson, Vestine, Taylor, Cook) the band started recording in April 1967 for [[Liberty Records]] with [[Calvin Carter]], who had been the head of A&R for [[Vee-Jay Records]] and had recorded such bluesmen as [[Jimmy Reed]], [[John Lee Hooker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wycEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=canned+heat&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDEQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwjumYyl7MnHAhUCvXIKHQXhBss#v=onepage&q=canned%20heat&f=false |title=Billboard |page=12 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date=1967-07-08 |access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref> They recorded \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\", backed with \"Bullfrog Blues\", and this became Canned Heat's first single. The first official album, ''[[Canned Heat (album)|Canned Heat]]'', was released three months later in July 1967. All tracks were re-workings of older blues songs. The Los Angeles Free Press reported: \"This group has it! They should do very well, both live and with their recordings.\" ''[[Canned Heat (album)|Canned Heat]]'' fared reasonably well commercially, reaching #76 on the Billboard chart.\n\n=== Rise to fame and formation of the classic lineup ===\nThe first big live appearance of Canned Heat was at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] on June 17, 1967. A picture of the band taken at the performance was featured on the cover of ''[[Down Beat]]'' where an article complimented their playing: \"Technically, Vestine and Wilson are quite possibly the best two-guitar team in the world and Wilson has certainly become our finest white blues harmonica man. Together with powerhouse vocalist Bob Hite, they performed the country and Chicago blues idiom of the 1950s so skillfully and naturally that the question of which race the music belongs to becomes totally irrelevant.\"<ref>Down Beat, August 10th, 1967.</ref> [[D.A. Pennebaker]]'s [[Monterey Pop|documentary]] captured their rendition of \"[[Rollin and Tumblin]]\" and two other songs from the set, \"Bullfrog Blues\" and \"[[Dust My Broom]]\", found a place later in a boxed CD set in 1992. Canned Heat is also included on an album called ''Early LA''.\n\nCanned Heat also began to garner their notoriety as \"the bad boys of rock\" for being jailed in Denver, Colorado after a police informant provided enough evidence for their arrest for drugs (an incident recalled in their song \"My Crime\"). Band manager Skip Taylor was forced to obtain the $10,000 bail by selling off Canned Heat's publishing rights to Liberty Records president Al Bennett.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 68-71. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Canned Heat 1970.JPG|thumb|1970 photo of the classic Canned Heat lineup.]]\nAfter the Denver incident, Frank Cook was replaced with de la Parra, who had been playing the drums in [[Bluesberry Jam]] (the band which evolved into ''[[Pacific Gas & Electric (band)|Pacific Gas & Electric]]''). As an official member of Canned Heat, de la Parra played his first gig on December 1, 1967, sharing top billing with [[the Doors]] at the Long Beach Auditorium.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 76. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> This began what de la Parra refers to as the classic and perhaps best known Canned Heat lineup, which recorded some of the band's most famous and well-regarded songs. During this \"classic\" period, Skip Taylor and John Hartmann introduced the use of band member nicknames:\n* Bob \"The Bear\" Hite\n* Alan \"Blind Owl\" Wilson\n* Henry \"Sunflower\" Vestine (and later Harvey \"The Snake\" Mandel)\n* Larry \"The Mole\" Taylor\n* Adolfo \"Fito\" de la Parra\n\nTheir second released album, ''[[Boogie with Canned Heat]]'', included \"[[On the Road Again (Canned Heat song)|On the Road Again]]\", an updated version of a 1950s composition by [[Floyd Jones]]. \"On the Road Again\" became the band's break-out song and was a worldwide success, becoming a number one hit in most markets and finally put a blues song on the top charts.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 90. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> The album also included a twelve-minute version of \"Fried Hockey Boogie\", (credited to Larry Taylor, but rather obviously derived from [[John Lee Hooker]]'s \"Boogie Chillen\" riff) allowed each member to stretch out on his instrument while establishing them with hippie ballroom audiences across America as the \"kings of the boogie\". Hite's \"Amphetamine Annie\" (a \"speed kills\" tune inspired by the drug abuse of an acquaintance and reminiscent of Albert King's \"The Hunter\"), became one of their most enduring songs and one of the first \"anti-drug\" songs of the decade. Although not featured on the album's artwork, this was the first Canned Heat Album to have featured drummer de la Parra.\n\nWith this success Taylor, Hartmann and new associate Gary Essert leased a Hollywood club they named the Kaleidoscope on Sunset Boulevard east of Vine in which Canned Heat essentially became the house band; hosting others such as [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Sly and the Family Stone]].<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 93. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Also in 1968, after playing before 80,000 at the first annual Newport Pop Festival in September, Canned Heat left for their first European tour. It entailed a month of concert performances and media engagements that included television appearances on the British show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. They also appeared on the German program ''[[Beat Club]]'', where they lip-synched \"On the Road Again\" as it rose to number one in both countries and in practically all of Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QexOuH8GS-Y&ob=av2e |title=Canned Heat&nbsp;\u2014 On the Road Again |publisher= [[YouTube]] |date= |access-date= May 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Going Up the Country\" and Woodstock ===\nIn October the band released their third album, ''[[Living the Blues]]'', which included \"[[Going Up the Country]]\", their best-known song. Wilson's incarnation of [[Henry Thomas (blues musician)|Henry Thomas]]' \"Bull-Doze Blues\" was almost a note-for-note copy of the original, including Thomas' instrumental break on the \"quills\" (pan-pipes) which [[Jim Horn]] duplicated on flute. Wilson rewrote the lyrics with a simple message that caught the \"back-to-nature\" attitude of the late 1960s. The song went to #1 in 25 countries around the world (#11 on the U.S. national chart) and would go on to become the unofficial theme song of the [[Woodstock Festival]] as captured in [[Michael Wadleigh]]'s [[Woodstock (film)|1970 documentary]]. The album also included a 19-minute experimental track \"Parthenogenesis\", which was a nine-part sound collage of blues, ragas, jaw-harp sounds, guitar distortion and other electronic effects; all pulled together under the direction of manager/producer, Skip Taylor. Longer still is \"Refried Boogie\", clocking in at over 40 minutes, recorded live at the Kaleidoscope.\n\nAlso recorded live at the Kaleidoscope around this time was the album which would find later 1971 release with the deceptive title, ''[[Live At Topanga Corral]]'' (later renamed ''Live at the Kaleidoscope''), under [[Wand Records]] because Liberty Records did not want to release a live album at the time and manager Skip Taylor did not want a lawsuit.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 354. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> The band would end 1968 in a big way at a New Year's show at the [[Shrine Auditorium]], in Los Angeles, with Bob Hite riding a painted purple dayglo elephant to the stage.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 96-98. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nIn July 1969, just prior to Woodstock, ''[[Hallelujah (album)|Hallelujah]]'', their fourth album was released. The ''[[Melody Maker]]'' wrote: \"While less ambitious than some of their work, this is nonetheless an excellent blues-based album and they remain the most convincing of the white electric blues groups.\" The album contained mainly original compositions with lyrics relating to the band such as Wilson's \"Time Was\" and a few re-worked covers like \"Sic 'em Pigs\" ([[Bukka White]]'s \"Sic 'em Dogs\") and the original \"Canned Heat\" by Tommy Johnson.\n\nWithin days of the album's release, Vestine left the group after an on-stage blow up at the [[Fillmore West]] between himself and Larry Taylor. The next night after [[Mike Bloomfield]] and Mandel jammed with Canned Heat, both were offered Vestine's spot in the band's line-up and Mandel accepted.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 6-7. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> The new lineup played two dates at the Fillmore before appearing at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] in mid-August.\n\nArriving via helicopter at Woodstock, Canned Heat played their most famous set on the second day of the festival at sunset. The set included \"Going Up the Country\" which became the title track in the [[Woodstock (film)|documentary]], even though the band's performance was not shown. The song was included in the first (triple) [[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More|Woodstock album]]; while the second album, ''[[Woodstock 2]]'', contained \"Woodstock Boogie\". The expanded ''25th Anniversary Collection'' added \"Leaving This Town\" to the band's collection of Woodstock performances and \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" was included on the director's cut of the documentary film; leaving only \"Let's Work Together\" to be released.<ref>Canned Heat would go on to play (see below) at the 10th Anniversary Concert for Woodstock and their performance has been issued on disc under different titles; one of them being ''Woodstock Festival 10th Anniversary Concert 1979'' (see discography, 1995).</ref>\n\n[[File:Future Blues - Canned Heat.jpg|thumb|right|Future Blues album cover]]\nBefore their European tour in early 1970, the band recorded ''[[Future Blues (Canned Heat album)|Future Blues]]'', an album containing five original compositions and three covers. \"[[Let's Work Together]]\", a [[Wilbert Harrison]] song, was the single chosen for release in Europe to coincide with the tour. At the band's insistence the U.S. release was delayed in order to offer the author's version a chance in the market first.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 128. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Canned Heat had a big hit with \"Let's Work Together\" and was the band's only top ten hit to feature the vocals of Bob \"The Bear\" Hite. The album featured piano by [[Dr. John]] and an atypical jump blues style also. Some controversy was sparked by the [[moon landing]]/[[Iwo Jima]] album cover and the upside down American flag. The upside-down flag was Wilson's idea and was a response to his love of nature, growing environmentalism and concern that humankind would soon be polluting the moon as well as the Earth (as reflected in his song \"Poor Moon\").<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 156-157. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nMaterial from their 1970 European tour provided the tracks for, ''[[Canned Heat '70 Concert Live in Europe]]'', later retitled ''Live in Europe''. It was a live album that combined tracks from different shows throughout the tour, but was put together in such a way as to resemble one continuous concert for the listener. Although the album garnered some critical acclaim and did well in the UK (peaking at #15), it had only limited commercial success in the U.S.; Returning from Europe in May 1970, an exhausted Larry Taylor left the band to join [[John Mayall]] (who had moved to Laurel Canyon, California) and was followed by Mandel.\n\n=== ''Hooker 'n Heat'' and the death of Wilson ===\nWith Taylor and Mandel gone, Vestine returned on guitar, accompanied by bassist Antonio de la Barreda who had played with de la Parra for five years in Mexico City and was previously a member of the groups Jerome and Sam & the Goodtimers.\n\nThis lineup went into the studio to record with [[John Lee Hooker]] the tracks that would yield the double album, ''[[Hooker 'n Heat]]''. The band had originally met Hooker at the airport in Portland, Oregon, and discovered they were fans of each other's work. Hooker and Canned Heat became good friends and Hooker had stated that Wilson was \"the greatest harmonica player ever\".<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 173. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> The planned format for the sessions called for Hooker to perform a few songs by himself, followed by some duets with Wilson playing piano or guitar. The rest of the album featured Hooker with some backing by the group (sans Bob Hite, who co-produced the album along with Skip Taylor). The album was finished after Wilson's passing and became the first album in Hooker's career to make the charts, topping out at #73 in February 1971. Hooker 'n Heat would unite again in 1978 and record a live album at the Fox Venice Theatre in Los Angeles, released in 1981 as, ''Hooker 'n Heat, Live at the Fox Venice Theatre'', under [[Rhino Records]]. Also in 1989, Canned Heat (and many others) guested on John Lee Hooker's album ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]''.\n\nShortly after the original ''Hooker 'n Heat'' sessions, Wilson, who had always suffered from depression, was said by some to have attempted suicide by driving his van off the road near Hite's home in Topanga Canyon. Unlike other members of the band, Wilson did not have much success with women and was deeply upset and frustrated by this. His depression also worsened over time.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 140-163. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> On September 3, 1970, just before leaving for a festival in Berlin, the band learned of Wilson's death by barbiturate overdose; his body was found on a hillside behind Hite's home. De la Parra and other members of the band believed that his death was a suicide. Wilson [[27 Club|died at the age of 27]], just weeks before [[Jimi Hendrix]], and then [[Janis Joplin]], died at the same age.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 166-168. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== ''Historical Figures'', ''New Age'' and ''Human Condition'' line-ups ===\nJoel Scott Hill, who had played with the Strangers and the Joel Scott Hill Trio, was recruited to fill the void left by Wilson's death. The band still had a touring contract for September, as well as upcoming studio dates. That fall they toured Australia and Europe; including a show played in Baarn, Netherlands, for the VPRO television program ''Piknik'' and the following summer they appeared at the [[Turku]] Festival in Finland. These performances were recorded, but the recordings were not released until much later, with the albums ''Live at Turku Rock Festival'' in 1995 and ''Under the Dutch Skies 1970&ndash;74'' in 2007 (which encompassed three separate tours). At the end of 1971 a new studio album, ''[[Historical Figures and Ancient Heads]]'', was released. The album included Hite's vocal duet with [[Little Richard]] on \"Rockin' with the King\", written by Skip Taylor and featuring the guitar playing of both Vestine and Joel Scott Hill.\n\nThis lineup of Hite, Vestine, Scott Hill, de la Barreda and de la Parra did not last, as the band was in disarray; Scott Hill and de la Barreda's attitudes were not fitting in with the rest of the band, and drummer de la Parra decided to call it quits. He was talked out of it by Hite, and it was Scott Hill and de la Barreda who left the band instead.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.

This lineup recorded what was the band's last album for Liberty/[[United Artists Records]], ''[[The New Age (album)|The New Age]]'', released in 1973. This album featured the popular biker-themed anthem \"The Harley-Davidson Blues\", written by James Shane. The era of the late 1960s was changing, but nonetheless the band embarked on another European tour, during which they recorded a session with [[Memphis Slim]] in Paris, France for the album ''Memphis Heat''. They also recorded with [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]], while still in Paris, for the album ''Gates on the Heat'' (both were released by Blue Star Records).<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.

After a bad introduction to Atlantic Records, which included a brawl between Hite and Vestine over a vending machine, the band released the album ''[[One More River To Cross (album)|One More River to Cross]]'' in 1973. Produced by [[Roger Hawkins (drummer)|Roger Hawkins]] and [[Barry Beckett]], this album had a different sound and featured the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section|Muscle Shoals Horns]].<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.

Absent from Canned Heat at this time, after growing ever more distant, was longtime manager Skip Taylor, who had left after the band joined Atlantic.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.

The masters for the bulk of the material, which had been kept at Skip Taylor's house, were destroyed in a fire, and what material was rescued by de la Parra was finally restored and issued decades later, in 1997, titled ''The Ties That Bind''.<ref name=\"autogenerated356\">Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.

Bob Hite, in a foul rage, went off on the crowd, to the disapproval of Vestine, James Shane and Ed Beyer, who quit the band as a result.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues.

Taylor departed in 1976 in response to an argument during a tour of Germany, and after a brief fill-in by [[Stan Webb]] (of [[Chicken Shack]]), Mark Skyer came in as the new guitar player. In the meantime the band had worked out a deal with [[Takoma Records]], and this \"Human Condition/Takoma\" lineup recorded the 1977 album ''Human Condition''. Despite the appearance of the [[Chambers Brothers]] on the album, it was met with very little success, largely because of the growing popularity of disco music in the late 70s.<ref name=\"autogenerated356\" /> Before long, more arguments ensued, and Mark Skyer, Chris Morgan and Richard Hite all quit the band in 1977. The Bear promptly hired a new bass player, Richard Exley, after befriending him on tour and watching his performance with the band Montana. Becoming fast friends with Hite, Exley toured the remainder of the year with the band and collaborated with Hite on many of the arrangements during their 1976 Texas Bicentennial Comeback Tour. Exley then quit the band after an argument over Hite's excessive drinking and drug use on stage. Frustrated and fed up, Exley joined the Texas Heartbreakers at the end of that year but returned periodically to fill in as a favor to Hite while the band struggled to find permanent members amidst heavy drinking and drug use. Exley remarked about his time with the band, \"No one ever remembers the bass player&nbsp;...\". This effectively reduced the band's members to just Hite and de la Parra.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 247. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== Burger Brothers revival and the death of Bob Hite ===\nThe popularity of the blues genre rose in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the release of the musical-comedy film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), starring [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]]. During this time, de la Parra had bought into the partnership of an East Hollywood recording studio at which he was again working with former bandmate Larry \"The Mole\" Taylor. Taylor had been associating with virtuoso guitar player [[Hollywood Fats|Mike \"Hollywood Fats\" Mann]] and virtuoso piano player [[Ronnie Barron]] and before long Taylor, Barron and Hollywood Fats were in the band. This version referred to by Hite and Mann as the \"Burger Brothers\" lineup, was soon joined by blind piano player Jay Spell, as Ronnie Barron walked out on the band after a blow-up between himself and Taylor.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 248-250. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nThe Burger Brothers played the tenth anniversary of Woodstock at [[Parr Meadows]] in 1979. A recording of the performance eventually surfaced through [[King Biscuit Flower Hour]]'s Barry Ehrmann as, ''Canned Heat In Concert'', in 1995 (de la Parra considers this to be Canned Heat's best recorded live album).<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 357. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Another recording made around this time was for [[Cream Records]], who desired a more R&B-style sound than what Canned Heat was currently offering. This upset Hollywood Fats and Mike Halby was brought in to finish the project; which would not find commercial release until 1981 when former band member Tony de la Barreda put it out under [[RCA]] as a tribute album called, ''In Memory Of Bob \"The Bear\" Hite 1943-1981\u2014\"Don't Forget To Boogie\"''. After a falling out with de la Parra and Hite, Taylor and Mann were increasingly unhappy with the musical direction of the band and eventually left to focus more attention on their [[Hollywood Fats Band]]. Nevertheless, Jay Spell was still on board and brought in bass player Jon Lamb; Mike Halby was now a full-time member and long-time guitarist Vestine once again made his return to the band, with The Bear and de la Parra as its leaders.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 252-258. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nNo longer managed by Howard Wolf, Eddie Haddad set the band up touring military bases across the U.S., Europe and Japan non-stop. Returning with little pay after the difficult tour, Jay Spell quit the band. Jon Lamb stayed on for one more tour in the south and just before Christmas 1980 (and lacking the outlaw roots of the others), he too quit the band; but by then even The Bear was starting to lose it. He had attempted to give it another try by hiring a large enthusiastic biker with the moniker \"The Push\" as their manager; hoping that the band's popularity with the biker community would give them renewed energy.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living The Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 260-268. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> With new bass player Ernie Rodriguez joining the ranks, Canned Heat recorded the 1981 album, ''Kings of the Boogie'', the last album to feature Hite on a few of the tracks.\n\nOn April 5, 1981, having collapsed from a heroin overdose during a show at the [[Palomino Club (North Hollywood)|Palomino]] in Los Angeles, Bob Hite was later found dead in de la Parra's Mar Vista home at the age of 38.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 278-279. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== Later history and the death of Vestine ===\nThe death of frontman Bob \"The Bear\" Hite was a devastating blow that most thought would end the career of Canned Heat; however de la Parra kept the band alive and would lead it back into prosperity over the next few decades. An Australian tour had been set up before The Bear's death and harmonica player Rick Kellogg had joined to finish off the ''Kings of the Boogie'' album. This incarnation of Canned Heat without Bob Hite was nicknamed the \"Mouth Band\" by Vestine and was a huge hit in Australia, especially with the biker crowd.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 282. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> Under the management of \"The Push\", the band toured the States playing biker bars and began work on a video known as ''\"The Boogie Assault\"'', starring Canned Heat and various members of the San Francisco chapter of the [[Hells Angels]].\n\nAs production for \"The Push's\" video dragged on, a drunken Vestine got into a brawl with Ernie Rodriguez and was once again out of the band; this time replaced by guitarist Walter Trout.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, p. 291. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> After a tour with John Mayall, as the production for ''\"The Boogie Assault\"'' continued, de la Parra was forced to fire \"The Push\" as the band's manager; but did eventually finish the video and a live Album of the same name recorded in Australia in 1982 (also re-released as ''Live In Australia'' and ''Live In Oz''). This version of Canned Heat would also soon dissolve with a dispute between Mike Halby and de la Parra after the recording of the ''Heat Brothers '84'' EP.\n\nDuring the 1980s the interest in the type of music played by Canned Heat was revived and, despite the past tragedies and permanent instability, the band appeared to be revitalized. In 1985, Trout had left to join John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, so Vestine was once again back in the band and he brought with him new musical talent from Oregon in James Thornbury (slide guitar and lead vocals) and Skip Jones (Bass). They were dubbed the \"Nuts and Berries\" band by de la Parra, due to their love of organic food. It was not long before former members Larry Taylor (replacing Jones) and Ronnie Barron returned to round out the group. Versions of this lineup would record the live album, ''Boogie Up The Country'', in Kassel, Germany, in 1987 and also appear on the ''Blues Festival Live in Bonn '87 Vol 2'' compilation. Barron, just as before did not last long in this lineup, nor did Vestine, who was once again ousted from the band due to pressure from Larry Taylor. Replacing Vestine on lead guitar was [[Junior Watson]]; his style emulated Hollywood Fats (who died in late 1986) and was perfectly suited for the band as witnessed by the well-regarded album, ''[[Reheated]]''. Unfortunately, the album was released only in Germany in 1988 due to disagreements with the Chameleon Music Group Record label.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 316-320. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref> In 1990, the \"Would-Be\" lineup of James T, Taylor, Watson and de la Parra also recorded a sequel live album in Australia entitled ''Burnin' Live''.\n\nThe lineup dissolved in the early 1990s as Junior Watson went his own way and Mandel came back into the fold, bringing along Ron Shumake on bass to take some of the load off of Larry Taylor. Mandel, however, left the band after a few tours, so female singer and guitarist Becky Barksdale was brought in for a tour of France, Germany and Hawaii; but lasted no longer. [[Smokey Hormel]] was also considered, but only played one gig before friction between de la Parra and Larry Taylor caused Taylor to bitterly go his separate way with Hormel in tow.<ref>Fito De La Parra, ''Living the Blues. Canned Heat's Story of Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival'', 2000, pp. 325-327. {{ISBN|0-9676449-0-9}}.</ref>\n\nThe revolving door that was Canned Heat continued as Vestine and Watson made their returns to the lineup as the \"Heavy Artillery\" band. Several former members including Mandel, Barron and Taylor joined up in de la Parra's effort for the album, ''Internal Combustion'', which was released in 1994, but saw only limited release due to the returning manager Skip Taylor's falling out with Red River Records. In 1995, James Thornbury left the band with no hard feelings after ten years of service to live the married life in New South Wales, Australia and new front-man [[Robert Lucas (musician)|Robert Lucas]] came in to take his place. Mandel returned and Shumake left the band in 1996, and after the position of bassist was taken temporarily by Mark \"Pocket\" Goldberg,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://markpocketgoldberg.com/?section=bio |title=Mark \"Pocket\" Goldberg |publisher=Mark \"Pocket\" Goldberg |access-date=2012-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509160457/http://markpocketgoldberg.com/?section=bio |archive-date=2015-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Greg Kage took the reins as the bass player, and after a reconciliation with Larry Taylor the band released, ''Canned Heat Blues Band'', in 1996.

Notable names include:\n\n* [[John Lee Hooker]]&nbsp;\u2014 In May 1970, Canned Heat backed John Lee Hooker on the album ''Hooker 'n Heat'' released in early 1971. In 1978 a joint performance was recorded live and released as ''Hooker 'n Heat, live at the Fox Venice Theatre'' (1981). In 1989 Canned Heat (and many others) guested on John Lee Hooker's album ''The Healer''.\n* [[Sunnyland Slim]]&nbsp;\u2014 In the spring of 1968, Wilson, Bob Hite, and de la Parra took a cab whose driver turned out to be Sunnyland Slim. Wilson and Hite convinced him to go in the studio again and cut an album for a sublabel of Liberty Records. The album, '' Slim's Got His Thing Goin' On'' featured tracks with Slim fronting Canned Heat and Hite acted as co-producer. Slim thanked them by playing the piano on \"Turpentine Moan\" for the album ''[[Boogie with Canned Heat]]''.\n* [[Memphis Slim]]&nbsp;\u2014 In Paris, on September 18, 1970, Canned Heat went into the studio at the request of French music producer Phillipe Rault to record with Memphis Slim. Three years later and after an overdubbing session with the Memphis Horns of [[Stax Records]] fame, ''Memphis Heat'' was finally released on the French label, Barclay (and was re-released in 2006 on Sunnyside Recordings).\n* [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]]&nbsp;\u2014 In 1973, Canned Heat went again to France to record for Rault, this time with Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown. The sessions did not work out as planned, but the album was released as ''Gate's on the Heat'' and another track appeared in 1975 on his album ''Down South in the Bayou Country''. Later they joined him for a set at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. A DVD of the performance was released.\n* [[Javier Batiz]]&nbsp;\u2014 During the summer of 1969, de La Parra arranged in Los Angeles a recording session for Mexican R&B star Javier Batiz, with whom he had played before moving north and joining Canned Heat. His bandmate Larry Taylor took part in the project and also three musicians who in later years would perform with the band, two as members&nbsp;\u2014 Tony de la Barreda (bass), [[Ernest Lane (musician)|Ernest Lane]] (piano) and Clifford Solomon (saxophone). The recording was released some 30 years later as ''The USA Sessions''.\n* [[Albert Collins]]&nbsp;\u2014 In early 1969, Canned Heat met Collins after a gig and advised him to move to Los Angeles in order to boost his career; there they found him an agent and introduced him to executives for United Artists (UA). In appreciation, Collins' first record title for UA became ''Love Can Be Found Anywhere'', taken from the lyrics of \"Fried Hockey Boogie\".\n* [[Henry Vestine]]&nbsp;\u2014 A recording project from 1981 has been released more than twenty years later under Vestine's name as ''I Used To Be Mad (but Now I am Half Crazy)''. The musicians on the album are the Canned Heat members at that time: Vestine (guitar), Mike Halby (vocals, guitar), Ernie Rodrigues (vocals, bass), Ricky Kellogg (vocals, harmonica) and de La Parra (drums).\n* [[De la Parra and Walter de Paduwa]], a.k.a.

The company was founded in 1912 and enjoyed several decades of prominence in the industry before the 1980s.  After ceasing operation in the early 1980s, Slingerland was acquired by [[Gibson]], who briefly revived it and owned it until November of 2019, before selling Slingerland to [[DW Drums]], who have announced the intention of re-launching the [[brand]].<ref name=tm/>  Slingerland is strongly associated with [[jazz]] drummers, such as [[Gene Krupa]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gkrp.net/setup.html |title=\"Gene Krupa - Drum Kit Set-Up\" |access-date=2014-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420003625/http://www.gkrp.net/setup.html |archive-date=2014-04-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> or [[Buddy Rich]], who played signature instruments made by the company.  Although primarily known for its drums, in the 1930s Slingerland also produced [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] guitars, [[mandolin]]s, [[banjo]]s and [[ukulele]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThe \"Slingerland Banjo Company\" was founded by Henry Heanon (H.H.) Slingerland (1875\u20131946) in 1912. Slingerland had won a correspondence school of music in a card game aboard one of the gaming boats that once cruised Lake Michigan. He then opened a music school in Chicago, and soon turned to manufacturing [[musical instrument]]s as well. As its name indicated, the company started out producing [[banjo]]s while importing [[ukulele]]s from Germany, but set up its own production because it could not meet demand. Soon, they produced their own [[musical instrument]]s<ref name=history/> and eventually, also [[guitar]]s (including [[electric guitar]]s from 1936 or earlier). Production of [[snare drum]]s was started in 1926 in answer to the entry of the [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig & Ludwig]] drum company into the banjo [[market (economics)|market]].\n\n[[File:LouieBellson 1980.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Louie Bellson]] playing his Slingerland kit in 1980]]\nA resourceful and energetic businessman, H.H. established an extensive dealer network throughout the U.S., the then-territory of [[Hawaii]] (in the early 1930s) and [[China]]. After H.H.'s death from a stroke, the company was run by his wife, Nona, and one of their children, Henry Jr. The company's manufacturing plant was later moved from [[Chicago]] proper to [[Niles, Illinois|Niles]], a suburb in [[Cook County, Illinois]].<ref name=history>[http://www.coopersvintagedrums.com/newslinghistory.htm Slingerland History on Cooper Vintage Drums]</ref>\n\nAlthough the Slingerland company was best known as a [[drum kit]] manufacturer, it also made [[guitars]] in the 1930s.<ref>[http://www.slingerlandguitar.com/ \"The Slingerland stringed instruments\" on Slingerland Guitars.com]</ref> The Songster [[electric guitar]], featured in a 1939 company catalog, pre-dates [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul's]] \"log\" guitar and is probably the earliest Spanish-style solid-body electric guitar model. The guitar's pickup includes individual string magnets as well as a large horseshoe magnet. Slingerland ceased making electric instruments in 1940 in order to exclusively focus on producing percussion instruments.\n\nThe company remained in the Slingerland family until 1970, but continued to be a prominent drum manufacturer throughout the 1970s.  After introducing the Magnum series in the late 1970s, Slingerland lost its footing, and the company folded.  Slingerland changed ownership multiple times until it was acquired from [[Gretsch]] (part of the [[Gibson]] Guitar Corporation by then) in 1994. Gibson revived the brand, but had limited success, because of its stipulation that in order to become a Slingerland dealer, music stores also had to carry Gibson guitars. This was not feasible because small independently owned music stores could not afford to carry both lines.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 1998, Slingerland released a model based on its [[Gene Krupa]] signature drum kit.<ref>[http://www.drummerman.net/gkkit.html \"The Legends Series Gene Krupa Signature Drum Kit\" on DrummerMan.net]</ref>\n\nIn 2018, much if not all of the remaining warehouse stock of Slingerland drums, including bare shells, hardware and complete drum sets, were sold to a private individual who proceeded to liquidate the remaining stock via ebay. This included drums produced in Nashville and in Taiwan.\n\nOn November 25, 2019 it was announced that DW Drums had taken over ownership of the Slingerland brand from Gibson.\n\n==Products==\n\n===Radio King===\n[[File:Slingerland drum kit (front).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Slingerland drum kit]]\nSlingerland's most famous product line is the Radio King series of drums. These drums were introduced in 1936-37, and remained Slingerland's flagship snare drums and drum sets until 1957, when the Radio King model briefly disappeared from the product line. Between 1960 and 1962, Radio Kings were reintroduced. Older Radio Kings are obsessively collected by vintage drum enthusiasts. [[Gene Krupa]] and [[Buddy Rich]] were both Radio King endorsers.\n\nThe original Radio King snare drum is distinguished by its construction: rather than several plies of [[mahogany]], like most snare drums of the era, a Radio King drum was created from a single piece of steam-bent [[maple]] with solid maple reinforcement rings to assist in keeping the drum round under the pressure of the metal hardware attached to it. Single-ply wood drums are known for their resonance and bright tone.<ref>[http://www.vintagedrumguide.com/radio_king_history.html Radio King drums] on Vintage Drums website</ref>\n\nRadio King bass drums and tom-toms were made from mahogany, with maple reinforcement hoops. These drums are known for their \"thuddy\" sound; very warm, with quick decay.\n\nThe popularity of the old Slingerland Radio King snare drum is evidenced by a myriad of professional drummers who still used the [[snare drum|snare]] in 2017, despite endorsing other brands.\n\n===Rolling Bomber===\nA departure from the standard Slingerland product line occurred during [[World War II]], when wood was used to manufacture drum parts that had traditionally been made of [[brass]], [[Chrome plating|chrome]], [[nickel]], and [[steel]]. This was due to high demand for metals needed for the [[war effort]]. These drums were named the \"Rolling Bomber\" series, and are highly collectible.\n\n===Rock and Roll===\nThe [[Rock and Roll]] era of the 1960s and 1970s was a good time for many American drum companies, including Slingerland. Slingerland's main competitor, [[Ludwig Drums|Ludwig]], had the advantage of being endorsed by [[Ringo Starr]], but Slingerland, too, produced drums in that era and had robust sales. Beside long time endorser [[Buddy Rich]], Slingerland in the 1970s garnered drummers [[Danny Seraphine]] with [[Chicago]] and [[Nigel Olsson]], the drummer for [[Elton John]]. Short lived in the 1970s was Slingerland's version of Ludwig [[Vistalite Drums|Vistalite]] drums. They stopped production quickly after their introduction due to a patent infringement suit and a cease and desist warrant from Ludwig regarding Slingerland's foray into acrylic drums.  These drums today remain collectible.\n\n===Marching drums===\nSlingerland marching drums were produced as early as the 1920s. By the 1970s, the Slingerland line of marching equipment had become very popular in marching bands, colleges, and drum corps. During the late 1970s, Slingerland introduced its TDR marching snare drum, with a novel strainer and synthetic-gut snare that produced a distinctive sound. Another late-70s innovation was the Slingerland cutaway multi-tenors that were carried in trio, quad, or quint arrangements. The cutaway design was first used in 1977 by the [[Santa Clara Vanguard]] under drum captain [[Fred Sanford (musician)|Fred Sanford]] and the Oakland Crusaders under Tom Float. Famous drum corps such as the [[27th Lancers]] of [[Revere, Massachusetts]] under Charlie Poole, the Bridgemen of Bayonne N.J. under Dennis Delucia, the Chicago Cavaliers under Gus Barbaro and Brian Callahan, the Pittsburgh Royal Crusaders and the General Butler Vagabonds all used Slingerland equipment in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the early 1980s, Slingerland was gaining significant market share, but the company was sold, and corporate finances fell apart. By the late 1980s, Slingerland had fallen behind technologically, and [[Ludwig-Musser]], and especially [[Pearl drums]], began to pick up its market share.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nFor most of the company's pre-1970s history, Slingerland's manufacturing processes were not standardized in the way that modern large-scale manufacturing companies' are. Exceptions to nearly every strict product [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] existed. This is due in large part to the fact that parts would often be left over from year to year and would be used by workers even though some of those parts had been officially discontinued from the line.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Jean-Paul Gaster]] of the rock band [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]] uses Slingerland drums, and is described as one of the last drummers to play rock using \"vintage weapons,\" besides [[Neil Hennessy]] of [[the Lawrence Arms]].<ref>[http://www.lawrencearms.org/index/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=110:drummerbitch-neil-hennessy-interview&catid=1:latest&Itemid=2 \"DrummerBitch - Neil Hennessy Interview\" on LawrenceArms.org], 22 Feb 2008</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Slingerland Drum Company}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101003014109/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Divisions/Slingerland/ Slingerland products on Gibson website] (archive)\n* [http://www.slingerlandguitar.com/ Slingerland Guitar website]\n\n{{Gibson Guitar Corporation}}\n{{Percussion instruments brands}}\n\n[[Category:Percussion instrument manufacturing companies]]\n[[Category:Guitar manufacturing companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Michigan]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1913]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1913]]\n[[Category:1913 establishments in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Gibson Guitar Corporation]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Slingerland|people with the name|Slingerland (surname)}}\n{{Infobox company\n|name    = Slingerland Drum Company\n|former_name = Slingerland Banjo Company\n|logo    = Slingerland drums logo.png\n|logo_size = 250px\n|slogan  = \n|vector_logo     =\n|type    = [[Privately held company]] (1913\u2013late 1970s) <br>[[Brand]] (late 1970s\u2013present)\n|foundation      = {{start date and age|1913}} in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], [[United States of America|USA]]\n|founder\t = Henry Heanon Slingerland\n|location_city = [[Conway, Arkansas]]\n|location_country = [[United States]]\n|key_people      = \n|area_served     = Worldwide\n|industry        = [[Musical instruments]]\n|products        = [[Drum kit]]s, [[electric guitar|electric]] & [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] guitars, [[mandolin]]s, [[banjos]], [[ukulele]]s\n|revenue         =\n|operating_income=\n|owner = [[Drum Workshop]] <ref name=tm>[https://www.facebook.com/dwdrums/posts/2814471981918301?__xts__[0]=68.ARC5OJhlQCCPk5vvFuo7O7HsAw5SOVLNNESjNDlBXC8YYF0Ry5Is7VIfxGz7n2XIha7N4fO56DhvVIXSZzVinhlzEZVkfruGyXBGUDAqziwuGdA4xbEv-2yTeynFHKXgwoS7Yn9ARtDxQGyq12WOFxNrcRJY4Y_UhesH7XfoCbwaIpbf4n1HTI5LmX6hV_8BL7R5ijT9BeSCsKz5YddU-QKd-kX8WdjalwUx9RlWOpxRIBWF-ttxliYmoQXk7_Xik_XfmYyFChnxZqDnLotD_jWokiuTEahF3nEAtZHiGjkzsO-vMCIITTKUr3R5qUA_GQSFdf43BbelaCtGN95tFz5hnWa_91uaCoQNoT5CiVveQN5xm4TO&__tn__=-R ]</ref>\n|parent          = \n|subsid          = \n|homepage        =  \n|footnotes       = \n}}\n\n'''Slingerland''' is a [[United States|US]] manufacturer of [[drum kits|drums]].

This is due in large part to the fact that parts would often be left over from year to year and would be used by workers even though some of those parts had been officially discontinued from the line.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Jean-Paul Gaster]] of the rock band [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]] uses Slingerland drums, and is described as one of the last drummers to play rock using \"vintage weapons,\" besides [[Neil Hennessy]] of [[the Lawrence Arms]].<ref>[http://www.lawrencearms.org/index/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=110:drummerbitch-neil-hennessy-interview&catid=1:latest&Itemid=2 \"DrummerBitch - Neil Hennessy Interview\" on LawrenceArms.org], 22 Feb 2008</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Slingerland Drum Company}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101003014109/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Divisions/Slingerland/ Slingerland products on Gibson website] (archive)\n* [http://www.slingerlandguitar.com/ Slingerland Guitar website]\n\n{{Gibson Guitar Corporation}}\n{{Percussion instruments brands}}\n\n[[Category:Percussion instrument manufacturing companies]]\n[[Category:Guitar manufacturing companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Michigan]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1913]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1913]]\n[[Category:1913 establishments in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Gibson Guitar Corporation]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingerland_Drum_Company"}

While Kya waits in vain for her mother's return, she witnesses her older siblings, Missy, Murph, Mandy, and eventually Jodie, all leave as well, due to their Pa's drinking and physical abuse.\n\nAfter she is left alone with Pa, he temporarily stops drinking and teaches her to fish and gives her his knapsack to hold her collections of shells and feathers. Unable to read or write, Kya relies on painting with her Ma's old watercolors the birds or shores where she found the items.\n\nOne day Kya finds a letter in the mailbox.  She recognizes it as having been sent from Ma, and she leaves it on the table for Pa to find.  When Pa reads the letter, he becomes infuriated and burns the letter as well as most of Ma's wardrobe and canvases. He returns to drinking and takes long, frequent trips away to gamble. Eventually, he does not return at all, and Kya assumes he is dead, making him the last of the family to leave her alone in the marsh. Without money and family, she learns self-reliance, including gardening and trading fresh mussels and smoked-fish for money and gas from Jumpin', a black man who owns a gasoline station for boats. Jumpin' and his wife Mabel become lifelong good friends to Kya, and Mabel is enlisted to collect donated clothing to fit her.\n\nAs Kya grows up, she faces prejudice from the townspeople of Barkley Cove, NC, who nickname her \"The Marsh Girl\". She is laughed at by the schoolchildren the only day she goes to school and is called \"nasty\" and \"filthy\" by the pastor's wife. However, she becomes friendly with Tate Walker, an old friend of Jodie's who sometimes fishes in the marsh. When Kya gets lost one day, Tate leads her home in his boat. Years later, he leaves her feathers from rare birds, then teaches her how to read and write. The two form a romantic, yet platonic, relationship until Tate leaves for college at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. He realizes that Kya cannot live in his more civilized world because of how wild and independent she is, and leaves her without saying goodbye.\n\n===Part II \u2013 The Swamp===\n\nYears later, in 1965, when Kya is now 19, Chase Andrews, Barkley Cove's star quarterback and playboy, invites her to a picnic, during which he tries to have sex with her. He later apologizes, but the two form a romantic relationship. He shows her an abandoned fire tower, and she gives him a necklace of a shell he found during their picnic, strung on rawhide. Despite her suspicions, she believes Chase's promises of marriage and consummates their relationship in a cheap motel room in [[Asheville, NC]]. After shopping for groceries one day, she reads in the newspaper of Chase's engagement to another woman, and realizes that his promises of marriage were a ruse for sex. She ends their relationship after he attempts to rape her.\n\nTate, having graduated from college, visits Kya and is impressed by her expanded collection of seashells. He urges her to publish a reference book on seashells, and she does so in 1968 at age 22 under her full name. The book on shells is followed by one on seabirds. With the royalties that have been coming in, Kya hires a \"fix-it man\", who installs running water, a water heater, tub, sink, flush toilet and kitchen cabinets. She orders furniture and bedding from [[Sears Roebuck]]. The same year, Jodie, now in the Army, also returns in Kya's life, expressing regret that he left her alone and breaking the news that their mother had suffered from mental illness and of her death from [[leukemia]] two years prior. Kya forgives her mother for leaving, but still cannot understand why she never returned.\n\nKya is offered a chance to meet her publisher in [[Greenville, North Carolina]]. While she is away, Chase is found dead beneath the fire tower on the morning of October 30, 1969. The sheriff, Ed Jackson, believes it to be a murder on the basis of there being no tracks or fingerprints, including Chase's, around the tower. Ed speaks with a couple of sources and receives conflicting statements. He learns that the shell necklace that Kya gave to Chase was missing when his body was found, even though he wore it the night before. Kya was seen leaving Barkley Cove before the murder, then returning the day after, and was also observed speeding her boat toward the tower the night Chase died. There also were red wool fibers on Chase's jacket that belonged to a hat of Kya's. Convinced that she is the culprit responsible for Chase's murder, Ed traps Kya near Jumpin's wharf and jails her without bail for two months.\n\nAt Kya's trial in 1970, contradictory testimony is given. Kya's lawyer, Tom Milton, debunks the prosecutor's arguments on the basis that there was no concrete evidence to convict Kya. The jury finds her not guilty. Kya returns home and reconciles with Tate. They live together until Kya, at age 64, dies peacefully in her boat. Tate finds a hidden box of her old things and realizes that Kya wrote poems as Amanda Hamilton, the poet frequently quoted throughout the book. Tate also finds, underneath the poems, the shell necklace Chase wore until he died.\n\n== Ethology ==\n[[Ethology]], the study of animal behavior, is a topic that is covered in the book. Kya reads about ethology, including an article entitled [[sneaky fucker strategy|\"Sneaky Fuckers\"]], and uses her knowledge to navigate the tricks and dating rituals of the local boys. Kya compares herself to a female [[firefly]], who uses her coded flashing light [[signalling theory|signal]] to lure a male of another species to his death, or to a female [[mantis]] who lures a male mate and starts eating the mate's head and thorax while his abdomen is still copulating with her. \"Female insects, Kya thought, know how to deal with their lovers.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lawson |first1=Mark |title=Fiction {{!}} A US bestseller, this debut about a nature-loving girl growing up alone in southern swampland has wide appeal |accessdate=13 January 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 January 2019 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/12/where-the-crawdads-sing-delia-owens-review}}</ref><ref name=\"Owens 2018\">{{cite book | last=Owens | first=Delia | authorlink=Delia Owens | title=Where the Crawdads Sing | publisher=Corsair | year=2018 | isbn=978-0-7352-1909-0 | pages=183, 274}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/books/review/where-the-crawdads-sing-delia-owens.html|title=From a Marsh to a Mountain, Crime Fiction Heads Outdoors|last=Stasio|first=Marilyn|date=2018-08-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}\n\n[[Category:Novels set in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:2018 American novels]]\n[[Category:2018 debut novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2018 fiction novel by Delia Owens}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name = Where the Crawdads Sing\n| author = [[Delia Owens]]\n|image= File:Where The Crawdads Sing Book Cover.jpg\n| language = American English\n| genre = Literary fiction\n| pub_date = 14 August 2018<ref name=\":0\" />\n| publisher = G.P.

As in the previous game, the game uses the Resource Integration Gear (RIG) suit, an in-world heads-up display ([[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]) system that uses holograms projected from Isaac's suit and weapons to show information such as messages and ammunition count. In vacuum areas, a timer appears on Isaac's right shoulder, counting how much oxygen his suit has before he [[Asphyxia|suffocates]]. The RIG also uses gauges on Isaac's back to display his health and stasis module levels. If Isaac's health or air reaches zero, or if the player fails to survive a quick-time event, Isaac will die, forcing the player to restart from the last checkpoint.<ref name=steam_manual>{{cite web|title=Dead Space 2 Manual|url=http://cdn3.steampowered.com/Manuals/47780/948093_MAA.pdf?t=1344959503|work=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|accessdate=2 March 2013|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522160511/http://cdn3.steampowered.com/Manuals/47780/948093_MAA.pdf?t=1344959503|archivedate=May 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the game, Isaac acquires the stasis module, which slows down enemies and otherwise-impassable moving obstacles (e.g. active heavy machinery) to allow Isaac to pass through safely; and the kinesis module, which allows Isaac to carry and fire objects [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. The player can upgrade their weapons and armor at work benches, using power nodes. There are also [[Automated retail|automated store]]s, where the player can buy and sell various items, and gain new weapons and suits through acquiring schematics found throughout the Sprawl.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\nThroughout the game, the player will come across different puzzles that impede progress. In some cases, Isaac must [[hacker (computer security)|hack]] consoles to activate machines and open doors; in others, Isaac must repair or reposition mechanisms to proceed. The player regularly encounters [[Weightlessness|zero-G]] environments, where Isaac is capable of maneuvering in all directions with [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] attached to his suit. Both normal and zero-G environments may be in areas within the vacuum of outer space; in these situations, Isaac must refill his limited oxygen supply via oxygen dispensers.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\nMuch like in the first game, Isaac must fight the Necromorphs, organisms that mutate and take control of human corpses. To take down Necromorphs, the player must use \"strategic [[dismemberment]]\": in other words, slicing off limbs or sections of the Necromorphs' bodies.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Dead Space 2|developer=[[Visceral Games]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=25 January 2011|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|version=1.02-1.1|level=Chapter 2|quote='''Sorenson (audio log)''': Listen up, this is Sorenson from CEC.

Item drops and credits are more rare, enemies are more challenging, and checkpoints are absent.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Multiplayer===\nMultiplayer in ''Dead Space 2'', also known as Outbreak mode, pits two four-player teams of human Sprawl Security forces and the Necromorphs against each other in different locations and scenarios. The Humans complete various mission objectives before time runs out, such as activating escape pods and destroying machines; whilst the Necromorphs simply prevent the Humans from completing said objectives. There are two rounds per match, with each team switching sides at the end of the round.<ref name=steam_manual /> Human player characters start with two weapons in their arsenal, starting with the standard Pulse Rifle and Plasma Cutter, before unlocking new weapons to use. For Humans, new weapons and improvements are unlocked through level progression, along with different suits similar to the ones in single player for the humans. Necromorph players, on the other hand, unlock boosts to their current abilities, health, and damage. Necromorph players can choose the Necromorph they will spawn as: a Lurker, a Puker, a Spitter, or a member of the Pack. In order to use stronger Necromorphs, like the Puker and Spitter, the player must wait for a number of seconds on the respawn screen before that type is usable. Whilst Sprawl Security players spawn in their main spawn areas, Necromorph players spawn through vents and floor panels all over the map, and can choose their spawn point on the spawn screen.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\n==Plot==\n===Background===\nDuring the 23rd century, Earth's population found themselves suffering resource and energy crises, causing world government EarthGov to begin research on solutions. The former was resolved with \"planet-cracker\" spaceships, created to smash and harvest other planets for resources, and the latter with an investigation of a black alien monolith discovered in the [[Chicxulub crater]], which emits a sourceless [[electromagnetic field]]. Dubbed \"The Marker\", the monolith begins causing violent [[psychoses]] in people near to it, prompting lead researcher Michael Altman to try and leak its existence; assassinating Altman too late, EarthGov inadvertently turns him into a [[martyr]], leading to the formation of the Church of Unitology, a cult that uses the marker as a [[Idolatry|religious idol]].\n\nDuring the events of the first game, set in 2508, CEC Engineer Isaac Clarke was a member of the ''USG Kellion'', a ship that responded to a distress call from planet-cracker ''USG Ishimura''; Isaac himself joined as the crew-member who sent the distress signal was his girlfriend, Nicole Brennan. Crashing into the ship due to a malfunction, the ''Ishimura'' was found to be overrun with hostile monsters (dubbed \"necromorphs\"), created from the reanimated, mutated corpses of the crew. Isaac soon learns that the ''Ishimura'' uncovered a man-made Red Marker on Aegis VII, its disturbance causing homicidal insanity and the spread of the necromorph infestation. Trying to return the Red Marker to Aegis VII, Isaac is betrayed by ''Kellion'' crew member Kendra Daniels, who intends to steal the marker.\n\nWith the help of Nicole, Isaac returned the marker to the planet, subduing the necromorph Hive-Mind but triggering an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that indirectly disabled the [[artificial gravity (fiction)|gravity tethers]] holding the planet together. Isacc then learns from Daniels that Nicole has long since committed suicide; Isaac's interactions with Nicole were [[hallucination]]s caused by the Red Marker. Daniels, removing the marker to try and steal it, reawakens the Hive-Mind in the process, which crushes her to death. Isaac kills the Hive-Mind and narrowly escapes the planetary collapse on a ship, only to be attacked by a hallucination of Nicole.\n\n===Synopsis===\nThree years after the Aegis VII event, Isaac Clarke awakens on the Sprawl, a civilian space-station built onto the remnants of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Isaac wakes amidst a necromorph outbreak, with no memory of the past few years and suffering severe hallucinations. Narrowly escaping as people are murdered and commit suicide, Isaac is contacted by Daina Le Guin, who explains that Isaac's encounter with a Marker has encoded its information into his brain; Sprawl Director Hans Tiedemann has gradually extracted the data to [[reverse-engineer]] a new Marker, drugging Isaac to erase his memory and protect him from [[insanity]] and suicide.\n\nIsaac fights his way through the city to reach Daina, who promises rescue and a cure for his worsening insanity; Isaac finds himself being deterred by violent hallucinations of Nicole Brennan, his deceased girlfriend who insists on becoming \"whole\" with him. Isaac reaches Daina, who has Isaac restrained and reveals she is a Unitologist; Daina explains she's planning to create more Markers to spread \"Convergence\", an event foretold in Unitology. However, an EarthGov gunship strikes their spaceship, killing Daina and her associates and allowing Isaac to escape. Isaac is forced to continue fighting against his violent hallucinations of Nicole.\n\nIsaac is contacted by fellow patient Nolan Stross, who reveals the Marker is located in the Government Sector and claims they can destroy it; left with no choice, Isaac reluctantly teams-up with Stross. Isaac also encounters Ellie Langford, a CEC pilot who lost her crew during the outbreak, and they team up once she agrees to not kill Stross. As they progress, Tidemann shuts off the Sprawl's life-support, forcing Isaac to reactivate it with a [[Solar power|solar]] [[Beam-powered propulsion|array beam]]; Tidemann then takes control of the array to sever the transport tramline to the government sector. Cut off, Isaac is forced to detour through the ''Ishimura'', which is docked at the Sprawl for decontamination and repair after the events of the first game. Stross' dementia soon worsens to the point he attacks Ellie, removing her eye with a screwdriver; pursuing Stross, Isaac is soon forced to kill him in self-defense. With his hallucinations reaching their limit, Isaac admits his guilt over failing to save Nicole, pacifying Nicole.\n\nReaching the Government Sector, Isaac and Ellie repurpose an enormous mining drill to bore an entrance. Tricking Ellie into boarding a ship, Isaac remotely forces it to depart so she can escape. Isaac then releases the Necromorphs onto Tiedemann's forces as a distraction, causing the Government Sector to be overrun; the necromorphs soon reach the Marker, triggering Convergence. With Nicole's help, Isaac guides a needle into his eye, allowing him to recall Marker data and understand how to destroy it. Reaching the Marker, Isaac kills Tiedemann, only to be attacked by Nicole, who invades his mind; \"Nicole\" explains that she simply the Marker's means to manipulate him, and to become \"whole\" is for the Marker absorb the body and mind of its creator. Infuriated and betrayed, Isaac destroys Nicole and the Marker codes in his mind.\n\nAs Titan Station begins to collapse, Ellie returns with the gunship to rescue Isaac, who both safely escape just as the station explodes. In a [[post-credits scene]], an audio transmission is heard between two people: an unknown man and his ranking superior, known only as \"the Overseer\". The subordinate relays that Titan Station, which he calls \"Marker Site 12,\" and its Marker have been destroyed. The Overseer replies that the other sites will have to pick up the pieces.<ref name=\"epilogue\"/>\n\n===''Severed''===\n{{See also|Dead Space: Extraction}}\n\nRunning concurrently with the early parts of '''Dead Space 2''', Severed follows Gabe and Lexine Weller, the former now working for Sprawl Security. Patrolling the Titan Mines as the necromorph outbreak occurs, Gabe is soon one of the few surviving Security members, and contacts Lexine to warn her of the outbreak. Racing to Lexine, Gabe receives a transmission from Director Tiedemann ordering all surviving security teams to scrub the facility and eliminate all key subjects.\n\nExiting Titan Mines, Gabe is fired upon by a gunship containing his superior officer, Victor Bartlett. Using explosives to deter the gunship, Gabe demands a answers from Bartlett, who reveals that subjects in the \"Oracle program\" are included in key targets; due to her pregnancy, Lexine is on the list of targets, so Bartlett attacked him preemptively. Gabe flies to the hospital in a gunship to try and reach Lexine first, before witnessing Victor being disabled by two Unitologists interested in studying Lexine.\n\nGabe chases after the Unitologists to a docked ship, where Lexine escapes into the ship as her kidnappers transform into Necromorphs. Dispatching the threats, Gabe attempts to open the airlock as Lexine prepares the ship. Attempting to hack the airlock, Gabe is ambushed by Victor, who is holding a live grenade; Victor is killed outright, and Gabe is severely injured. Gabe shoots the airlock fuses to open the bay doors, and says goodbye as he succumbs to his wounds. An epilogue reveals Gabe's body has been taken for study, while Lexine's whereabouts are unknown.\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|Dead Space 2 Original Videogame Score}}\n\nThe game's creative director, Wright Bagwell, said that ''Dead Space'' was very similar to ''[[Resident Evil]]''. \"There's an interesting story from ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'' and ''Dead Space 2'', which is that when we started building ''Dead Space'', we basically started with a mechanic set that was really similar to ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''.

''[[Game Informer]]'''s Andrew Reiner gave ''Dead Space'' 2 a 9/10, calling it a \"monster of a sequel\". He praised its horror aspect by claiming: \"[b]attling a seven-foot beast that vomits acidic bile and tries to impale Isaac with razor-sharp appendages is one thing, but watching a mother cradle a necromorph baby will haunt my nightmares until I die.\" ''Official Xbox Magazine UK'' gave the game 9 out of 10.<ref name=\"metacritic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/dead-space-2|title=Dead Space 2 Metacritic}}</ref> ''GameTrailers'' gave the game 9.0 out of 10, praising the game's dark and dreary atmosphere and its intense and unrelenting gameplay, while pointing out the multiplayer component's shortcomings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/gamereview.php?id=12830|title=GameTrailers.com \"Dead Space 2 Review\"}}</ref>\n\n[[GameSpot]]'s editor Carolyn Petit, who gave the game a score of 8.5 for the Xbox 360 and a 9.0 for the PlayStation 3, said: \"''Dead Space 2'' doesn't bring with it the same sense of experiencing something utterly new and innovative that its predecessor did. But it's nonetheless a terrific game, with a campaign that simultaneously leaves you satisfied and eager for more, and intense multiplayer that gives you a great reason to keep coming back to this terrifying universe. Unless you're just plain chicken, this is a sci-fi horror adventure you definitely want to suit up for.\"\n\n[[IGN]]'s editor Greg Miller gave the game a 9.0, saying that the survival-horror genre got a new gold standard and that: \"''Dead Space 2'' is more than just an action game and it's more than a survival horror game&nbsp;\u2013 it's a game that tells a really personal story about a guy who has been seriously scarred by the events around him. That premise alone makes it interesting, but Visceral Games melds it with rewarding combat, shocking enemies, and huge [[Setpiece|set pieces]] before tossing it into a world that's truly creepy and scary.\" He also said that he did not find the multiplayer very interesting.<ref>http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/01/21/dead-space-2-review?page=2</ref>\n\nThierry Nguyen from [[1UP.com]] compared ''Dead Space 2'' and its predecessor to \"Ridley Scott's ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and James Cameron's ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''\". In his review, he says, \"The first installments in both series focus on civilians panicking their way through a dark spaceship while avoiding an extraterrestrial lurking horror; both follow-ups retain their predecessor's basic aesthetic while deliberately shifting from creeping tension into outright sci-fi action. Aliens introduced space marines, the power loader exosuit, and the Alien Queen; Dead Space 2 gives us scenes of Isaac flying around in zero-g, mowing down Necromorphs with an assault rifle while wearing 'space marine' armor, and confidently throwing explosives with his telekinetic powers.\"<ref name=\"1UP.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3183117|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717054720/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3183117|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-17|title=1UP.com Dead Space 2 Review}}</ref>\n\n[[Fangoria]]'s Doug Norris gave the game 4/4 skulls, praising both the gore and psychological horror.

He also thought that the multiplayer was \"rather unsatisfying and delivers nothing of the pacing and tension that the main game brings.\"\n\nHardcore Gamer's Adam Beck gave ''Dead Space 2'' a 4.5/5, praising the cinematic single-player campaign but criticizing its horror aspect by claiming \"there are just too many expected encounters when you enter a room and it never allows you to let your guard down\".

As in the previous game, the game uses the Resource Integration Gear (RIG) suit, an in-world heads-up display ([[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]) system that uses holograms projected from Isaac's suit and weapons to show information such as messages and ammunition count. In vacuum areas, a timer appears on Isaac's right shoulder, counting how much oxygen his suit has before he [[Asphyxia|suffocates]]. The RIG also uses gauges on Isaac's back to display his health and stasis module levels. If Isaac's health or air reaches zero, or if the player fails to survive a quick-time event, Isaac will die, forcing the player to restart from the last checkpoint.<ref name=steam_manual>{{cite web|title=Dead Space 2 Manual|url=http://cdn3.steampowered.com/Manuals/47780/948093_MAA.pdf?t=1344959503|work=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|accessdate=2 March 2013|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522160511/http://cdn3.steampowered.com/Manuals/47780/948093_MAA.pdf?t=1344959503|archivedate=May 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the game, Isaac acquires the stasis module, which slows down enemies and otherwise-impassable moving obstacles (e.g. active heavy machinery) to allow Isaac to pass through safely; and the kinesis module, which allows Isaac to carry and fire objects [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. The player can upgrade their weapons and armor at work benches, using power nodes. There are also [[Automated retail|automated store]]s, where the player can buy and sell various items, and gain new weapons and suits through acquiring schematics found throughout the Sprawl.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\nThroughout the game, the player will come across different puzzles that impede progress. In some cases, Isaac must [[hacker (computer security)|hack]] consoles to activate machines and open doors; in others, Isaac must repair or reposition mechanisms to proceed. The player regularly encounters [[Weightlessness|zero-G]] environments, where Isaac is capable of maneuvering in all directions with [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] attached to his suit.

The Humans complete various mission objectives before time runs out, such as activating escape pods and destroying machines; whilst the Necromorphs simply prevent the Humans from completing said objectives. There are two rounds per match, with each team switching sides at the end of the round.<ref name=steam_manual /> Human player characters start with two weapons in their arsenal, starting with the standard Pulse Rifle and Plasma Cutter, before unlocking new weapons to use. For Humans, new weapons and improvements are unlocked through level progression, along with different suits similar to the ones in single player for the humans. Necromorph players, on the other hand, unlock boosts to their current abilities, health, and damage. Necromorph players can choose the Necromorph they will spawn as: a Lurker, a Puker, a Spitter, or a member of the Pack. In order to use stronger Necromorphs, like the Puker and Spitter, the player must wait for a number of seconds on the respawn screen before that type is usable. Whilst Sprawl Security players spawn in their main spawn areas, Necromorph players spawn through vents and floor panels all over the map, and can choose their spawn point on the spawn screen.<ref name=steam_manual />\n\n==Plot==\n===Background===\nDuring the 23rd century, Earth's population found themselves suffering resource and energy crises, causing world government EarthGov to begin research on solutions. The former was resolved with \"planet-cracker\" spaceships, created to smash and harvest other planets for resources, and the latter with an investigation of a black alien monolith discovered in the [[Chicxulub crater]], which emits a sourceless [[electromagnetic field]]. Dubbed \"The Marker\", the monolith begins causing violent [[psychoses]] in people near to it, prompting lead researcher Michael Altman to try and leak its existence; assassinating Altman too late, EarthGov inadvertently turns him into a [[martyr]], leading to the formation of the Church of Unitology, a cult that uses the marker as a [[Idolatry|religious idol]].\n\nDuring the events of the first game, set in 2508, CEC Engineer Isaac Clarke was a member of the ''USG Kellion'', a ship that responded to a distress call from planet-cracker ''USG Ishimura''; Isaac himself joined as the crew-member who sent the distress signal was his girlfriend, Nicole Brennan. Crashing into the ship due to a malfunction, the ''Ishimura'' was found to be overrun with hostile monsters (dubbed \"necromorphs\"), created from the reanimated, mutated corpses of the crew. Isaac soon learns that the ''Ishimura'' uncovered a man-made Red Marker on Aegis VII, its disturbance causing homicidal insanity and the spread of the necromorph infestation. Trying to return the Red Marker to Aegis VII, Isaac is betrayed by ''Kellion'' crew member Kendra Daniels, who intends to steal the marker.\n\nWith the help of Nicole, Isaac returned the marker to the planet, subduing the necromorph Hive-Mind but triggering an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that indirectly disabled the [[artificial gravity (fiction)|gravity tethers]] holding the planet together. Isacc then learns from Daniels that Nicole has long since committed suicide; Isaac's interactions with Nicole were [[hallucination]]s caused by the Red Marker. Daniels, removing the marker to try and steal it, reawakens the Hive-Mind in the process, which crushes her to death. Isaac kills the Hive-Mind and narrowly escapes the planetary collapse on a ship, only to be be attacked by a hallucination of Nicole.\n\n===Synopsis===\nThree years after the Aegis VII event, Isaac Clarke awakens on the Sprawl, a civilian space-station built onto the remnants of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Isaac wakes amidst a necromorph outbreak, with no memory of the past few years and suffering severe hallucinations. Narrowly escaping as people are murdered and commit suicide, Isaac is contacted by Daina Le Guin, who explains that Isaac's encounter with a Marker has encoded its information into his brain; Sprawl Director Hans Tiedemann has gradually extracted the data to [[reverse-engineer]] a new Marker, drugging Isaac to erase his memory and protect him from [[insanity]] and suicide.\n\nIsaac fights his way through the city to reach Daina, who promises rescue and a cure for his worsening insanity; Isaac finds himself being deterred by violent hallucinations of Nicole Brennan, his deceased girlfriend who insists on becoming \"whole\" with him. Isaac reaches Daina, who has Isaac restrained and reveals she is a Unitologist; Daina explains she's planning to create more Markers to spread \"Convergence\", an event foretold in Unitology. However, an EarthGov gunship strikes their spaceship, killing Daina and her associates and allowing Isaac to escape. Isaac is forced to continue fighting against his violent hallucinations of Nicole.\n\nIsaac is contacted by fellow patient Nolan Stross, who reveals the Marker is located in the Government Sector and claims they can destroy it; left with no choice, Isaac reluctantly teams-up with Stross. Isaac also encounters Ellie Langford, a CEC pilot who lost her crew during the outbreak, and they team up once she agrees to not kill Stross. As they progress, Tidemann shuts off the Sprawl's life-support, forcing Isaac to reactivate it with a [[Solar power|solar]] [[Beam-powered propulsion|array beam]]; Tidemann then takes control of the array to sever the transport tramline to the government sector. Cut off, Isaac is forced to detour through the ''Ishimura'', which is docked at the Sprawl for decontamination and repair after the events of the first game. Stross' dementia soon worsens to the point he attacks Ellie, removing her eye with a screwdriver; pursuing Stross, Isaac is soon forced to kill him in self-defense. With his hallucinations reaching their limit, Isaac admits his guilt over failing to save Nicole, pacifying Nicole.\n\nReaching the Government Sector, Isaac and Ellie repurpose an enormous mining drill to bore an entrance. Tricking Ellie into boarding a ship, Isaac remotely forces it to depart so she can escape. Isaac then releases the Necromorphs onto Tiedemann's forces as a distraction, causing the Government Sector to be overrun; the necromorphs soon reach the Marker, triggering Convergence. With Nicole's help, Isaac guides a needle into his eye, allowing him to recall Marker data and understand how to destroy it. Reaching the Marker, Isaac kills Tiedemann, only to be attacked by Nicole, who invades his mind; \"Nicole\" explains that she simply the Marker's means to manipulate him, and to become \"whole\" is for the Marker absorb the body and mind of its creator. Infuriated and betrayed, Isaac destroys Nicole and the Marker codes in his mind.\n\nAs Titan Station begins to collapse, Ellie returns with the gunship to rescue Isaac, who both safely escape just as the station explodes. In a [[post-credits scene]], an audio transmission is heard between two people: an unknown man and his ranking superior, known only as \"the Overseer\". The subordinate relays that Titan Station, which he calls \"Marker Site 12,\" and its Marker have been destroyed. The Overseer replies that the other sites will have to pick up the pieces.<ref name=\"epilogue\"/>\n\n===''Severed''===\n{{See also|Dead Space: Extraction}}\n\nRunning concurrently with the early parts of '''Dead Space 2''', Severed follows Gabe and Lexine Weller, the former now working for Sprawl Security. Patrolling the Titan Mines as the necromorph outbreak occurs, Gabe is soon one of the few surviving Security members, and contacts Lexine to warn her of the outbreak. Racing to Lexine, Gabe receives a transmission from Director Tiedemann ordering all surviving security teams to scrub the facility and eliminate all key subjects.\n\nExiting Titan Mines, Gabe is fired upon by a gunship containing his superior officer, Victor Bartlett. Using explosives to deter the gunship, Gabe demands a answers from Bartlett, who reveals that subjects in the \"Oracle program\" are included in key targets; due to her pregnancy, Lexine is on the list of targets, so Bartlett attacked him preemptively. Gabe flies to the hospital in a gunship to try and reach Lexine first, before witnessing Victor being disabled by two Unitologists interested in studying Lexine.\n\nGabe chases after the Unitologists to a docked ship, where Lexine escapes into the ship as her kidnappers transform into Necromorphs. Dispatching the threats, Gabe attempts to open the airlock as Lexine prepares the ship. Attempting to hack the airlock, Gabe is ambushed by Victor, who is holding a live grenade; Victor is killed outright, and Gabe is severely injured. Gabe shoots the airlock fuses to open the bay doors, and says goodbye as he succumbs to his wounds. An epilogue reveals Gabe's body has been taken for study, while Lexine's whereabouts are unknown.\n\n==Development==\n{{see also|Dead Space 2 Original Videogame Score}}\n\nThe game's creative director, Wright Bagwell, said that ''Dead Space'' was very similar to ''[[Resident Evil]]''. \"There's an interesting story from ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'' and ''Dead Space 2'', which is that when we started building ''Dead Space'', we basically started with a mechanic set that was really similar to ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''.

''[[Game Informer]]'''s Andrew Reiner gave ''Dead Space'' 2 a 9/10, calling it a \"monster of a sequel\". He praised its horror aspect by claiming: \"[b]attling a seven-foot beast that vomits acidic bile and tries to impale Isaac with razor-sharp appendages is one thing, but watching a mother cradle a necromorph baby will haunt my nightmares until I die.\" ''Official Xbox Magazine UK'' gave the game 9 out of 10.<ref name=\"metacritic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/dead-space-2|title=Dead Space 2 Metacritic}}</ref> ''GameTrailers'' gave the game 9.0 out of 10, praising the game's dark and dreary atmosphere and its intense and unrelenting gameplay, while pointing out the multiplayer component's shortcomings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/gamereview.php?id=12830|title=GameTrailers.com \"Dead Space 2 Review\"}}</ref>\n\n[[GameSpot]]'s editor Carolyn Petit, who gave the game a score of 8.5 for the Xbox 360 and a 9.0 for the PlayStation 3, said: \"''Dead Space 2'' doesn't bring with it the same sense of experiencing something utterly new and innovative that its predecessor did. But it's nonetheless a terrific game, with a campaign that simultaneously leaves you satisfied and eager for more, and intense multiplayer that gives you a great reason to keep coming back to this terrifying universe. Unless you're just plain chicken, this is a sci-fi horror adventure you definitely want to suit up for.\"\n\n[[IGN]]'s editor Greg Miller gave the game a 9.0, saying that the survival-horror genre got a new gold standard and that: \"''Dead Space 2'' is more than just an action game and it's more than a survival horror game&nbsp;\u2013 it's a game that tells a really personal story about a guy who has been seriously scarred by the events around him. That premise alone makes it interesting, but Visceral Games melds it with rewarding combat, shocking enemies, and huge [[Setpiece|set pieces]] before tossing it into a world that's truly creepy and scary.\" He also said that he did not find the multiplayer very interesting.<ref>http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/01/21/dead-space-2-review?page=2</ref>\n\nThierry Nguyen from [[1UP.com]] compared ''Dead Space 2'' and its predecessor to \"Ridley Scott's ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and James Cameron's ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''\". In his review, he says, \"The first installments in both series focus on civilians panicking their way through a dark spaceship while avoiding an extraterrestrial lurking horror; both follow-ups retain their predecessor's basic aesthetic while deliberately shifting from creeping tension into outright sci-fi action. Aliens introduced space marines, the power loader exosuit, and the Alien Queen; Dead Space 2 gives us scenes of Isaac flying around in zero-g, mowing down Necromorphs with an assault rifle while wearing 'space marine' armor, and confidently throwing explosives with his telekinetic powers.\"<ref name=\"1UP.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3183117|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717054720/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3183117|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-17|title=1UP.com Dead Space 2 Review}}</ref>\n\n[[Fangoria]]'s Doug Norris gave the game 4/4 skulls, praising both the gore and psychological horror.

He also thought that the multiplayer was \"rather unsatisfying and delivers nothing of the pacing and tension that the main game brings.\"\n\nHardcore Gamer's Adam Beck gave ''Dead Space 2'' a 4.5/5, praising the cinematic single-player campaign but criticizing its horror aspect by claiming \"there are just too many expected encounters when you enter a room and it never allows you to let your guard down\". He goes on to say \"''Dead Space 2'' is one of the most disturbing, grotesque and unsightly games I've ever played... but it's so damn good.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Beck|first=Adam|title=Dead Space 2|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/reviews/006.html|publisher=HardcoreGamer|accessdate=September 4, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027231815/http://www.hardcoregamer.com/reviews/006.html|archivedate=October 27, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Sales===\nEA reported that ''Dead Space 2'' shipped nearly 2 million units in the first week of its release.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thorsen |first=Tor |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6297125.html |title=Dead Space 2 ships nearly 2 million units&nbsp;\u2013 News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=February 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nUpon EA's closure of Visceral Games in October 2017, [[Battlefield Hardline]] level designer Zach Wilson estimated that the game had sold 4 million units and cost roughly 47 million dollars, although those numbers are unconfirmed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Zach|url=https://twitter.com/covernode/status/920713587664080897 |title=Developer clarifications regarding cost of game |date=October 18, 2017 |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"ch.1.1\">{{cite video game|title=Dead Space 2|developer=[[Visceral Games]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=2011-01-25|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|version=1.02-1.1|level=Chapter 1|quote='''Franco Delille''': ''[waking up Isaac]'' Isaac.

Hinson. In the following year, further efforts were begun to establish a graduate-level seminary to provide a theological education of greater depth in the [[Northwestern United States]]. The Western Baptist Theological Seminary was officially dedicated on October 4, 1927.\n\nThe board acquired the [[Philip Buehner House]], now Armstrong Hall, and {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land on the west slope of Portland's [[Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon|Mt. Tabor]] in 1944. Additional structures were built and classes convened at the new site in the fall of that year. The Portland campus continues to operate at this site at the crest of the [[Hawthorne District]].\n\nThe Western Baptist Theological Seminary became Western Seminary. Western Seminary has opened several extension campus locations in the [[Western United States]]. The first branch campus was launched in [[San Jose, California]] in 1986, followed by another in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1988. A [[Sacramento, California]] campus was opened in 1991, as was the former [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] campus in 1992. The Phoenix campus has become an independent seminary, [[Phoenix Seminary]]. Western Seminary's former Seattle campus is now [[The Seattle School of Theology & Psychology]] (formerly Mars Hill Graduate School).\n\nWestern's presidents have been reputable leaders in theological education, including Earl D.

Hinson. In the following year, further efforts were begun to establish a graduate-level seminary to provide a theological education of greater depth in the [[Northwestern United States]]. The Western Baptist Theological Seminary was officially dedicated on October 4, 1927.\n\nThe board acquired the [[Philip Buehner House]], now Armstrong Hall, and {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land on the west slope of Portland's [[Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon|Mt. Tabor]] in 1944. Additional structures were built and classes convened at the new site in the fall of that year. The Portland campus continues to operate at this site at the crest of the [[Hawthorne District]].\n\nThe Western Baptist Theological Seminary became Western Seminary. Western Seminary has opened several extension campus locations in the [[Western United States]].

Isolated workers are unable to frequently exchange hydrocarbons with nest-mates, and their hydrocarbon profiles diverge from that of the colony. After 20-40 days in isolation, the hydrocarbon profiles of workers diverges to such an extent that they are no longer accepted by the colony<ref>{{cite journal |last3= Soroker|first3= Victoria|last1=Boulay |first1=Rapha\u00ebl |last4= Lenoir|first4 = Alain| last2 = Hefetz|first2= Abraham|title= Camponotus fellah colony integration: worker individuality necessitates frequent hydrocarbon exchanges |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2000|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347200914088}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Boulay|first1= R.| last2 = Lenoir|first2= A.|title= Social isolation of mature workers affects nestmate recognition in the ant Camponotus fellah |journal= Behavioural Processes |date=2001 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635701001632}}</ref>. However, aggression is reduced if the isolated workers are exposed to airflow from the colony, indicating that volatile nest chemicals also contribute to nest-mate recognition<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katzav-Gozansky |first1=Tamar |last2=Boulay |first2=Rapha\u00ebl |last3=Ionescu-Hirsha |first3=Armin|last4= Hefetz|first4= Abraham|title=Nest volatiles as modulators of nestmate recognition in the ant Camponotus fellah |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |date=2008|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022191007002429}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katzav-Gozansky |first1=Tamar |last2=Boulay |first2=Rapha\u00ebl |last3=Vender Meer |first3=Robert|last4= Hefetz|first4= Abraham|title=In-nest environment modulates nestmate recognition in the ant Camponotus fellah |journal=Naturwissenschaften |date=2004|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00114-004-0513-0}}</ref>.\n\n== The role of trophallaxis ==\n[[Trophallaxis]] - the mouth-to-mouth transfer of liquid food - is a main mechanism of food dissemination in ant colonies. In ''C. fellah'', the colony trophallactic network has been quantified by combining unique marking of individuals with flourescently labelled food. This procedure refined our understanding of trophallaxis, revealing that transfer flow can switch direction during a trophallaxis event, that foragers receive (as well as unload) food, that foragers often leave the nest after offloading only a small amount of the food in their crop, and that non-foragers also offload considerable amounts of food. Further, the vast majority of trophallaxis events were short in duration, possibly functioning to maintain the colony odour rather than disseminate food <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Greenwald|first1= Efrat|last2= Segre|first2= Enrico|last3= Feinerman|first3= Ofer|title= Ant trophallactic networks: simultaneous measurement of interaction patterns and food dissemination\n|journal=  Scientific Reports|date= 2015|url= https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12496}}</ref>. Indeed, when the hydrocarbon profiles of members of ''C. fellah'' colonies are artificially modified, the colony reaches homogeneity more rapidly than non-trophallaxing species <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Lenoir|first1= Alain|last2= Hefetz|first2= Abraham|last3= Simon|first3= Tovit|last4= Soroker|first4= Victoria|title= Comparative dynamics of gestalt odour formation in two ant species Camponotus fellah and Aphaenogaster senilis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)\n|journal=  Physiological entomology|date= 2001|url= https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.0307-6962.2001.00244.x?casa_token=OM7p6piMq3oAAAAA%3AQvEpYgngC7-HoR8TiLhssRsn3lYXYTsVezrM2gH4Nhq6EWs3a3Cw0MIhWsGl2JmgLZAfn7k6ENML2e4}}</ref>. Through maintaining homogenous hydrocarbon profiles, trophallaxis mediates colony cohesion. The engagement of workers in socially cohesive trophallaxis may be underpinned by levels of [[octopamine]] in the brain. Usually after isolation, upon return to the colony, workers perform trophallaxis at an elevated rate. However, if workers are treated with octopamine, this increase in trophallaxis is not observed<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Boulay|first1= R.|last2= Soroker|first2= V.|last3= Godzinska|first3= E.J.|last4= Hefetz|first4= A.|last5= Lenoir|first5= A.|title= Octopamine reverses the isolation-induced increase in trophallaxis in the carpenter ant Camponotus fellah|journal= Journal of Experimental Biology|date= 2000|url= https://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/3/513}}</ref>. \n\n== Social structure ==\nA combination of automated behavioural tracking and [[social network analysis]] revealed that colony social networks comprise of three [[Community Structure Theory|communities]]: a nurse community of the queen and young workers who care for the brood, a forager community of older workers who leave the nest to forage, and a cleaner community of workers who specialise in nest maintenance.

This effect is markedly reduced when workers are isolated with just one other individual. The increase in the mortality of isolated workers likely results from an increase in energy expenditure and a decrease in energy income. Through energy balance, social interactions therefore seem to influence health and ageing.\n\n== Microbiota ==\n''Camponotus fellah'', like all tested [[Carpenter ant]] species harbours a primary endosymbiotic bacteria from the genus [[Blochmannia]]. This endosymbiont contributes to host nutrition, and when levels are experimentally reduced colony growth decreases <ref>{{cite journal |first1= Danival J.|last1= de Souza|first2= Annie|last2= B\u00e9zier|last3= Depoix|first3= Delphine|last4= Drezen|first4= Jean-Michel|last5= Lenoir|first5= Alain|title= Blochmannia endosymbionts improve colony growth and immune defence in the ant Camponotus fellah|journal= BMC Microbiology|date= 2009|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2180-9-29}}</ref>.\n\n== Learning and memory ==\nIn general ants rely heavily on olfactory cues and have well developed olfactory centres in their brains.

Isolated workers are unable to frequently exchange hydrocarbons with nest-mates, and their hydrocarbon profiles diverge from that of the colony. After 20-40 days in isolation, the hydrocarbon profiles of workers diverges to such an extent that they are no longer accepted by the colony<ref>{{cite journal |last3= Soroker|first3= Victoria|last1=Boulay |first1=Rapha\u00ebl |last4= Lenoir|first4 = Alain| last2 = Hefetz|first2= Abraham|title= Camponotus fellah colony integration: worker individuality necessitates frequent hydrocarbon exchanges |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2000|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347200914088}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Boulay|first1= R.| last2 = Lenoir|first2= A.|title= Social isolation of mature workers affects nestmate recognition in the ant Camponotus fellah |journal= Behavioural Processes |date=2001 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635701001632}}</ref>. However, aggression is reduced if the isolated workers are exposed to airflow from the colony, indicating that volatile nest chemicals also contribute to nest-mate recognition<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katzav-Gozansky |first1=Tamar |last2=Boulay |first2=Rapha\u00ebl |last3=Ionescu-Hirsha |first3=Armin|last4= Hefetz|first4= Abraham|title=Nest volatiles as modulators of nestmate recognition in the ant Camponotus fellah |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |date=2008|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022191007002429}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katzav-Gozansky |first1=Tamar |last2=Boulay |first2=Rapha\u00ebl |last3=Vender Meer |first3=Robert|last4= Hefetz|first4= Abraham|title=In-nest environment modulates nestmate recognition in the ant Camponotus fellah |journal=Naturwissenschaften |date=2004|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00114-004-0513-0}}</ref>.\n\n== The role of trophallaxis ==\n[[Trophallaxis]] - the mouth-to-mouth transfer of liquid food - is a main mechanism of food dissemination in ant colonies. In ''C. fellah'', the colony trophallactic network has been quantified by combining unique marking of individuals with flourescently labelled food. This procedure refined our understanding of trophallaxis, revealing that transfer flow can switch direction during a trophallaxis event, that foragers receive (as well as unload) food, that foragers often leave the nest after offloading only a small amount of the food in their crop, and that non-foragers also offload considerable amounts of food. Further, the vast majority of trophallaxis events were short in duration, possibly functioning to maintain the colony odour rather than disseminate food <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Greenwald|first1= Efrat|last2= Segre|first2= Enrico|last3= Feinerman|first3= Ofer|title= Ant trophallactic networks: simultaneous measurement of interaction patterns and food dissemination\n|journal=  Scientific Reports|date= 2015|url= https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12496}}</ref>. Indeed, when the hydrocarbon profiles of members of ''C. fellah'' colonies are artificially modified, the colony reaches homogeneity more rapidly than non-trophallaxing species <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Lenoir|first1= Alain|last2= Hefetz|first2= Abraham|last3= Simon|first3= Tovit|last4= Soroker|first4= Victoria|title= Comparative dynamics of gestalt odour formation in two ant species Camponotus fellah and Aphaenogaster senilis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)\n|journal=  Physiological entomology|date= 2001|url= https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.0307-6962.2001.00244.x?casa_token=OM7p6piMq3oAAAAA%3AQvEpYgngC7-HoR8TiLhssRsn3lYXYTsVezrM2gH4Nhq6EWs3a3Cw0MIhWsGl2JmgLZAfn7k6ENML2e4}}</ref>. Through maintaining homogenous hydrocarbon profiles, trophallaxis mediates colony cohesion. The engagement of workers in socially cohesive trophallaxis may be be underpinned by levels of [[octopamine]] in the brain. Usually after isolation, upon return to the colony, workers perform trophallaxis at an elevated rate. However, if workers are treated with octopamine, this increase in trophallaxis is not observed<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Boulay|first1= R.|last2= Soroker|first2= V.|last3= Godzinska|first3= E.J.|last4= Hefetz|first4= A.|last5= Lenoir|first5= A.|title= Octopamine reverses the isolation-induced increase in trophallaxis in the carpenter ant Camponotus fellah|journal= Journal of Experimental Biology|date= 2000|url= https://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/3/513}}</ref>. \n\n== Social structure ==\nA combination of automated behavioural tracking and [[social network analysis]] revealed that colony social networks comprise of three [[Community Structure Theory|communities]]: a nurse community of the queen and young workers who care for the brood, a forager community of older workers who leave the nest to forage, and a cleaner community of workers who specialise in nest maintenance.

This effect is markedly reduced when workers are isolated with just one other individual. The increase in the mortality of isolated workers likely results from an increase in energy expenditure and a decrease in energy income. Through energy balance, social interactions therefore seem to influence health and ageing.\n\n== Microbiota ==\n''Camponotus fellah'', like all tested [[Carpenter ant]] species harbours a primary endosymbiotic bacteria from the genus [[Blochmannia]].

Mike was the second oldest of six children of Thomas A. Shannon and Elizabeth W. Richason Shannon. Shannon's father was a St. Louis police officer and after getting his law degree, worked in the Prosecuting Attorney's office before becoming the Prosecuting Attorney for the City of St. Louis in the early 1970s.\n\nMike attended grade school at Epiphany of Our Lord Catholic School, and graduated from [[Christian Brothers College High School]] in 1957.  While at CBC Mike was the Missouri High School Player of the Year in both football and basketball his senior year. He is the only athlete to win both awards in the same year. He attended the [[University of Missouri]] before leaving in 1958 to begin his professional baseball career after signing with [[Bing Devine]], GM of the St. Louis Cardinals.

It evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Renaissance architecture]]. Originating in 12th century [[France]] and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as ''{{lang|la|Opus Francigenum}}'' (\"French work\") with the term ''Gothic'' first appearing during the later part of the [[Renaissance]]. \n\nThe defining element of Gothic architecture is the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]. It is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component. The use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed [[ribbed vault]], the [[flying buttress]] and window tracery.<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 17th edition, p.367, p.524</ref> These elements together formed a structurally and aesthetically integrated system, or style, that characterises the Gothic.<ref>Moffett, Fazio and Wodehouse, p.230</ref>\n\nAt the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that emphasised, internally, verticality in the structural members, and the atmosphere created by the play of light through [[stained glass window]]s.{{sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nGothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great [[cathedral]]s, [[abbey]]s and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[town hall]]s, [[Guild|guild halls]], universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of Gothic architecture are listed with [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s. \n\nWith the development of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Italy during the mid 15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century. A series of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revivals]] began in mid-18th century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.\n\n==Name==\nGothic architecture was known during the period as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} (\"French/[[Franks|Frankish]] work\") {{sfn|Jones|1999|p=90|ps=: \"The style was widely referred to as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} - \"[[Franks]]' work\".\"}} and in France as the ''Style Ogivale'' (style with pointed arches).<ref>Bannister Fletcher, p.524</ref>\n\nThe term \"[[Gothic (disambiguation)|Gothic]] architecture\" originated as a [[pejorative]] description.

Buildings of every type were constructed in the Gothic style, with evidence remaining of simple domestic buildings, elegant town houses, grand palaces, commercial premises, civic buildings, castles, city walls, bridges, village churches, abbey churches, abbey complexes and large cathedrals.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe greatest number of surviving Gothic buildings are churches. These range from tiny chapels to large cathedrals, and although many have been extended and altered in different styles, a large number remain either substantially intact or sympathetically restored, demonstrating the form, character and decoration of Gothic architecture. The Gothic style is most particularly associated with the great cathedrals of Northern France, the Low Countries, England and Spain, with other fine examples occurring across Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = The scope of Gothic architecture\n | image1    = Rheinstein crop.jpg\n | width1    = 149\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = [[Rheinstein Castle]], Trechtingshausen, Germany\n | image2    = Kosciol mariacki krakow.jpg\n | width2    = 137\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|Basilica of the Assumption of Mary]], Krak\u00f3w, Poland\n | image3    = St Mary Redcliffe adj sky.jpg\n | width3    = 146\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = [[St Mary Redcliffe|The Parish Church of St Mary Redcliffe]], Bristol, England\n | image4    =Tours Cathedral Saint-Gatian adj.jpg\n | width4    = 139\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = [[Tours Cathedral|The Cathedral of Saint-Gatian]], Tours, France\n | image5    =552SienaPalPubblico.JPG\n | width5    = 157\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The [[Palazzo Pubblico]], Siena, Italy\n | image6    = 27225 Oudenaarde Stadhuis 20 adj.jpg\n | width6    = 152\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = [[Oudenaarde Town Hall]], Oudenaarde, Belgium\n | image7   = San Pablo 20131208b.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      = \n | caption7  = [[Church of San Pablo, Valladolid|Church of San Pablo]], Valladolid, Spain\n }}\n\n==Influences==\n\n===Political===\nAt the end of the 12th century, Europe was divided into a multitude of [[city state]]s and kingdoms.

Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride. England and France remained largely [[Feudalism|feudal]] and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings, dukes and bishops, rather than grand town halls for their burghers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Religious===\nThe [[Catholic Church]] prevailed across Western Europe at this time, influencing not only faith but also wealth and power. Bishops were appointed by the feudal lords (kings, dukes and other landowners) and they often ruled as virtual princes over large estates.  The early Medieval periods had seen a rapid growth in monasticism, with several different orders being prevalent and spreading their influence widely. Foremost were the [[Benedictines]] whose great abbey churches vastly outnumbered any others in France and England. A part of their influence was that towns developed around them and they became centres of culture, learning and commerce. The [[Cluniacs|Cluniac]] and Cistercian Orders were prevalent in France, the great monastery at [[Cluny]] having established a formula for a well planned monastic site which was then to influence all subsequent monastic building for many centuries.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1>John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century [[St. Francis of Assisi]] established the [[Franciscans]], or so-called \"Grey Friars\", a mendicant order. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], another mendicant order founded during the same period but by [[St. Dominic]] in [[Toulouse]] and [[Bologna]], were particularly influential in the building of Italy's Gothic churches.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1>John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref> \n\n=== Importance of cathedrals and great churches===\nWhile many secular buildings exist from the Late Middle Ages, it is in the buildings of cathedrals and great churches that Gothic architecture displays its pertinent structures and characteristics to the fullest advantage. A Gothic [[cathedral]] or [[abbey]] was, prior to the 20th century, generally the landmark building in its town, rising high above all the domestic structures and often surmounted by one or more [[tower]]s and pinnacles and perhaps tall [[spire]]s.<ref name=BF/><ref name=Swaan>Wim Swaan, ''The Gothic Cathedral''</ref> Each cathedral served as a regional religious centre for its surrounding diocese, and with the large town churches, was a focus of community and civic pride.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIt is in the architecture of these grand Gothic churches that a unique combination of existing technologies established a new building style. Those technologies were the pointed [[arch]], the [[Rib vault|ribbed vault]], and the [[buttress]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Cathedrals in their cityscapes\n | image1    = Chartres Cathedral 000 sky.JPG\n | width1    = 250\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = [[Chartres Cathedral]], France\n | image2    = Lincoln Cathedral 01 crop.jpg\n | width2    = 240\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = [[Lincoln Cathedral]], England\n | image3    = Duomo from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg\n | width3    = 270\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = [[Florence Cathedral]], Italy<ref>While the engineering and construction of the dome of Florence Cathedral by [[Brunelleschi]] is often cited as one of the first works of the [[Renaissance]], the octagonal plan, ribs and pointed silhouette were already determined in the 14th century.</ref>\n | image4    = 20190204 CharlesBridge 4021 (46746175784).jpg\n | width4    = 272\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = [[Prague Cathedral]], Bohemia<ref>The Gothic south tower is surmounted by a Baroque spire.</ref>\n }}\n\n===Geographic===\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style.<ref name=BF/> On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic.<ref name=JH1/>\n\nThe local availability of materials affected both construction and style. In France, [[limestone]] was readily available in several grades, the very fine white limestone of [[Caen]] being favoured for sculptural decoration.  England had coarse limestone and red [[sandstone]] as well as dark green [[Purbeck marble]] which was often used for architectural features.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn Northern Germany, Netherlands, northern Poland, Denmark, and the Baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick. The resultant style, [[Brick Gothic]], is called \"Backsteingotik\" in Germany and Scandinavia and is associated with the Hanseatic League.  In Italy, stone was used for fortifications, but brick was preferred for other buildings. Because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble, many buildings were faced in marble, or were left with undecorated fa\u00e7ade so that this might be achieved at a later date.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe availability of timber also influenced the style of architecture, with timber buildings prevailing in Scandinavia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Availability of timber affected methods of roof construction across Europe. It is thought that the magnificent [[hammer-beam]] roofs of England were devised as a direct response to the lack of long straight seasoned timber by the end of the Medieval period, when forests had been decimated not only for the construction of vast roofs but also for ship building.<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT>Alec Clifton-Taylor, ''The Cathedrals of England''</ref>\n\n\n===Romanesque tradition===\n\nGothic architecture grew out of the previous architectural genre, [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. For the most part, there was not a clean break, as there was to be later in [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] with the revival of the [[Classical style]] in the early 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nBy the 12th century, Romanesque architecture (termed [[Norman architecture]] in England because of its association with the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]]), was established throughout Europe. The important categories of building: the [[cathedral]] church, the [[parish church]], the [[abbey church]], the [[monastery]], the [[castle]], the [[palace]], the [[great hall]], the [[gatehouse]], the [[town hall|civic building]] and the [[warehouse]], had been established in the Romanesque period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nMany architectural features that are associated with Gothic architecture had been developed and used by the architects of Romanesque buildings, particularly in the building of cathedrals and abbey churches.. These include [[ribbed vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, clustered columns, ambulatories, [[Rose window|wheel windows]], spires, stained glass windows, and richly carved door tympana. These were already features of ecclesiastical architecture before the development of the Gothic style, and all were to develop in increasingly elaborate ways.<ref name=NP>Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture''.</ref>\n\nIt was principally the widespread introduction of a single feature, the pointed arch, which was to bring about the change that separates Gothic from Romanesque. This technological change permitted both structural and stylistic change which broke the tradition of massive masonry and solid walls penetrated by small openings, replacing it with a style where light appears to triumph over substance. With its use came the development of many other architectural devices, previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural, aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style. These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture.<ref name=BF/> \n\n===Oriental influence===\nThe pointed arch, one of the defining attributes of Gothic, was employed in Late Roman and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] architecture by the 7th century. In the Roman context it occurred in early church building in Syria and occasional secular structures, like the [[Karamagara Bridge]] in Modern Turkey. In the Sassanid architecture of Iran, parabolic and pointed arches were employed in both palace and sacred construction.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Warren\n | first = John\n | year = 1991\n | title = Creswell's Use of the Theory of Dating by the Acuteness of the Pointed Arches in Early Muslim Architecture\n | periodical = Muqarnas\n | volume = 8\n | pages = 59\u201365 (61\u201363)\n | doi = 10.2307/1523154\n | jstor = 1523154\n | publisher=BRILL\n}}</ref><ref>Petersen, Andrew (2002-03-11).

By the early 12th century the ribbed vaults, characteristic of Gothic architecture, were coming into use. They appeared at the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, France, the [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] in 1120. The ribbed vault over the north transept at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England, built from 1128 to 1133, was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault. Pointed ribbed vaults were used in the chancel of [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]] in 1131.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe three-tiered interior elevation of arcade, gallery and clerestory that is typical of great Gothic churches, was well established in the Norman buildings of England, appearing at [[norwich Cathedral|Norwich]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] and Durham Cathedrals as well as the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen, in France.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOne of the features that unifies the internal appearance of a great Gothic church is the emphasis on vertical elements, in particular attached shafts that pass from the floor to the vault.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} These first appeared in France in the early 11th century in churches that have broad ribs reinforcing a barrel vault. They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England. At Peterborough Cathedral, the polygonal Norman apse has remained, as has three tiers of large Norman windows, now filled with Gothic tracery and 19th century stained glass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The transept ends at Peterborough, Ely and Norwich each have three rows of large Norman windows. This grouping of windows prefigures the clusters of Gothic lancet windows that are found in many English churches such [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Rose window]]s, which are characteristic of the west fronts and transept ends of the cathedrals of France, were in the Romanesque period, common in architecture of Germany, where they appear in various forms at [[Worms Cathedral]], and in Italy where they are either untraceried ocula or wheel windows such as that at the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], Verona. The first rose window above the west portal in France is said to be that at the [[Basilica of Saint Denis|Abbaye Saint-Denis]] 1140. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] is generally cited as the first truly Gothic building, however the distinction is best reserved for the choir, of which the [[ambulatory]] remains intact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Noyon Cathedral]] saw the earliest completion of a rebuilding of an entire French cathedral in the new style from 1150 to 1231.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} While using all those features that came to be known as Gothic, including pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting, the builders continued to employ many of the features and much of the character of Romanesque architecture including round-headed arch throughout the building, varying the shape to pointed where it was functionally practical to do so.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the Abbey Saint-Denis, [[Sens Cathedral]], Noyon Cathedral, [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England, simple cylindrical columns predominate over the Gothic forms of clustered columns and shafted piers. [[Wells Cathedral]] in England, commenced at the eastern end in 1175, was the first building in which the designer broke free from Romanesque forms. The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic. Wells Cathedral is thus considered the first truly Gothic cathedral.<ref>Cannon, J. 2007. Cathedral: The Great English Cathedrals and the World that Made Them</ref> \n\n<!---Needs icorporating-  The first cathedral in France built entirely in the new style was  [[Sens Cathedral]], begun between 1135 and 1140 and consecrated in 1160.{{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}<ref> ''Le Guide du Patrimoine de France'' (2002) pg. 53</ref>  Sens Cathedral  features a Gothic choir, and six-part rib vaults over the nave and collateral aisles, alternating pillars and doubled columns to support the vaults, and buttresses to offset the outward thrust from the vaults.  One of the builders who is believed to have worked on Sens Cathedral, [[William of Sens]], later traveled to England and became the architect who, between 1175 and 1180, reconstructed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in the new Gothic style. {{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}\n\nSens was quickly followed by  [[Senlis Cathedral]] (begun 1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>  --->\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 4\n | total_width= \n\n | image1    = Ely Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1766558.jpg\n | width1    = 168\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The south western tower at Ely Cathedral, England\n\n | image2    = Durham.2 crop.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The nave vault with pointed transverse arches at Durham Cathedral\n\n | image3    = Abbaye aux hommes int\u00e9rieur 03.jpeg\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = The sexpartite ribbed vault at Saint Etienne, Caen\n\n | image4    = Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = interior of the [[Cathedral of Cefalu]].\n}}\n\n===Abbot Suger===\nThe eastern end of the [[St Denis Basilica|Basilica Church of Saint-Denis]], built by [[Abbot Suger]] and completed in 1144, is often cited as the first truly Gothic building, as it draws together many of architectural forms which had evolved from the Romanesque and typify the Gothic style.\n\nSuger, friend and confidant of the French Kings, [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], decided in about 1137, to rebuild the great Church of Saint-Denis, attached to an abbey which was also a royal residence. He began with the West Front, reconstructing the original [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] fa\u00e7ade with its single door. He designed the west front of Saint-Denis to be an echo of the Roman [[Triumphal Arch of Constantine|Arch of Constantine]] with its three-part division and three large portals to ease the problem of congestion. The [[rose window]] is the earliest-known example above the West portal in France. The fa\u00e7ade combines both round arches and pointed arches of the Gothic style.\n\nAt the completion of the west front in 1140, Abbot Suger moved on to the reconstruction of the eastern end, leaving the Carolingian nave in use. He designed a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] that would be suffused with light.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">[[Erwin Panofsky]] argued that Suger was inspired to create a physical representation of the Heavenly [[Jerusalem]], although the extent to which Suger had any aims higher than aesthetic pleasure has been called into doubt by more recent art historians on the basis of Suger's own writings.</ref> To achieve his aims, his masons drew on the several new features which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture, the pointed arch, the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the ambulatory with radiating chapels, the clustered columns supporting ribs springing in different directions and the flying buttresses which enabled the insertion of large ''clerestory'' windows.\n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].<ref name=gothicplantagenet/><ref name=JH1/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 6\n | total_width \n | image1    = Saint-Denis - Basilique - Ext\u00e9rieur fa\u00e7ade ouest.JPG\n | width1    = 175\n | height1    = \n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The west front at the Abbey of Saint Denis, with its three deep portals\n | image2    = Basilica Saint Denis ambulatory.JPG\n | width2    = 160\n | height2    = \n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The ambulatory at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|Abbey of Saint-Denis]]\n | image3    = PM 103495 F Sens.jpg\n | width3    = 142 \n | height3   =\n | alt3      = \n | caption3   = The choir of Sens Cathedral \n | image4    = PM 103531 F Sens.jpg\n | width4    = 150 \n | height4   =\n | alt4      = \n | caption4   = The nave of Sens Cathedral \n | image5    = Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG\n | width5    = 155\n | height5    = \n | alt5      = \n | caption5  = The west front at Noyon Cathedral, showing transitional characteristics\n | image6    =Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Noyon)-Abside et ch\u0153ur adjusted.jpg\n | width6    = 155\n | height6    = \n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The interior of Noyon Cathedral\n }}\n\n==Structural elements==\n\n===Pointed arch===\n[[File:Romanesque blind arcading at Christchurch Priory.jpg|thumb|Norman [[Blind arcade|blind-arcading]] at Christchurch Priory, Dorset.]] \n[[File:Equlateral arch.PNG|thumb|right|Equilateral Arch]]\nOne of the defining characteristics of Gothic architecture is the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]].

This latter occurs at [[Durham Cathedral]] in the nave aisles in 1093.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance |title=Architectural Importance |publisher=Durham World Heritage Site |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>  Pointed arches also occur extensively in Romanesque decorative blind arcading, where semi-circular arches overlap each other in a simple decorative pattern, and the points are accidental to the design.\n\nIn Gothic architecture the pointed arch is used in every location where an arch is called for, both structural and decorative. Gothic openings such as doorways, windows, arcades and galleries have pointed arches. Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] above spaces both large and small is usually supported by ribs forming pointed arches. \n\nWhile structurally, use of the pointed arch gave a greater flexibility to architectural form, it also gave Gothic architecture a very different and more vertical visual character to<!---Do not change this to \"than\" again. It is grammatically wrong.---> Romanesque.  Rows of pointed arches upon delicate shafts form a typical wall decoration known as blind arcading. Niches with pointed arches and containing statuary are a major external feature of Gothic cathedrals. The pointed arch also lent itself to elaborate intersecting shapes which developed within window spaces into complex Gothic tracery forming the structural support of the large windows that are characteristic of the style.<ref name=CT/><ref name=NP/> \n\nMany Gothic openings are based upon the [[Equilateral triangle|equilateral]] form. In other words, when the arch is drafted, the [[radius]] is exactly the width of the opening and the centre of each arch coincides with the point from which the opposite arch springs. <small>(See diagram)</small> This makes the arch higher in relation to its width than a semi-circular arch which is exactly half as high as it is wide.<ref name=BF/> The equilateral arch gives a wide opening of satisfying proportion useful for doorways, decorative arcades and large windows.\n\nThe structural beauty of the Gothic arch means that no set proportion had to be rigidly maintained. The equilateral arch was employed as a useful tool, not as a principle of design. This meant that narrower or wider arches were introduced into a building plan wherever necessity dictated. In the architecture of some Italian cities, notably [[Venice]], semi-circular arches are interspersed with pointed ones.<ref name=\"Ref_h\">This does not happen in French or English Gothic and so to the British or French eye, appears to be a strange disregard for style.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Pointed arches\n | image1    = North_Bay_Peterborough_Cathedral.JPG\n | width1    = 171\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = One of three large arches that screen the front of Peterborough Cathedral. \n | image2    = Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG\n | width2    = 124\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The North transept of Salisbury Cathedral has grouped lancet openings \n | image3    =  Lincoln, Cathedral 20060726 015.jpg \n | width3    = 168\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = LIncoln Cathedral has arades, galleries, clerestory, vault, and blind arcades of pointed arches\n | image4    = Florencia - Firenze - Basilica de Santa Maria Novella - Interior - 01.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = At Santa Maria Novella, the wedge-shaped voussoirs that support the pointed vault are emphasised by colour.  \n | image5    = Wells-Cathedral 9762.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The eastern end of Wells Cathedral evolved in three stages to form a harmonious vista of pointed arches. \n | image6    = Reims Cathedral, exterior (4).jpg\n | width6    = 168\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The west front of Reims Cathedral shows the pointed arches of portals and galleries combined with gables and rose window. \n | image7    = Cathedrale-de-Strasbourg-IMG 4235.jpg\n | width7    = 150\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = A detail of the windows and galleries of the west front of Strasbourg Cahedral \n }}\n\n===Ribbed vault=== \n[[File:Voute.absidale.cathedrale.Paris.png|thumb|Sexpartite ribbed vault at Notre Dame de Paris]]\n\nThe Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] of pointed arches, unlike the semi-circular vault of Roman and Romanesque buildings, can be used to roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such as [[trapezoids]]. The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs, and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\n===Buttresses=== \n[[File:Strebewerk-2.jpg|thumb|Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over aisles.]] \nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses. The earliest Gothic cathedrals, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses. Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls. The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50\u201351}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Buttresses\n | image1    = \n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = \n | image2    =Lincoln, UK - panoramio (30).jpg\n | width2    = 247\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =  East end of Lincoln Cathedral, with wall buttress, and chapter house with flying buttresses. \n | image3    = Canterbury Cathedral 04.JPG\n | width3    = 245\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Wall buttresses and simple flying buttresses behind a parapet at Canterbury Cathedral\n | image4    = Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg\n | width4    = 247\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The complex buttresses of Amiens Cathedral support one of the highest Gothic vaults \n | image5    = Arri\u00e8re de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris en mars 2014.jpg\n | width5    = 274\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  The east end of Notre Dame de Paris with flying buttresses supporting the high vault\n }}\n\n==Plan, elevation and parts of a Gothic Cathedral== \n===Plan===\n[[File:Cathedral schematic plan en vectorial.svg|thumb|350px|Plan of a Gothic Cathedral]]\nMost large Gothic churches and many smaller parish churches are of the [[Latin cross]] (or \"cruciform\") plan, with a long nave making the body of the church, a transverse arm called the [[transept]] and, beyond it, an extension which may be called the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], chancel or presbytery. There are several regional variations on this plan. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a groundplan by the sturdy piers that support the tower. (see below){{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s. (see plans below). Aisles may extend along the sides of the transepts as well, as at Cologne, [[Amiens Cathedral]] and York Minster.(see plans) In the South of France there is often a single wide nave and no aisles, as at [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]] and [[Albi Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some churches with double aisles, or additional rows of chapels between the buttresses as at [[Notre Dame, Paris]], the transept does not project beyond the aisles (See plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In English cathedrals, transepts tend to project boldly and there may be two of them, as at Salisbury and [[Lincoln Cathedral]]s. The double transepts are to provide extra chapels, in lieu of the apsidal chapels found in French cathedrals (See Salisbury plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In France and Germany, the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  In England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery. It is almost always square ended with a cliff-like exterior face. Often there is a projecting ''Lady Chapel'', dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], as at Salisbury.<ref name=BF/><ref name=NP/><ref name=Swaan/> In Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually a shallow chapel or sometimes an apse.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}.<small> See section below</small>\n\nThe groundplans of the cathedrals show not only the larger parts of the building, developed for [[Catholic liturgy]]- the nave, aisles, transept, choir and chapels - but also reveal that each building contains a pattern of regular divisions called \"bays\". These bays or compartments are square, rectangular and sometimes trapezoidal, and are defined by the positions of the piers, columns and attached shafts that support the arcades and the overhead vaults. While internally the divisions are created by the locations of the vertical members, externally, the bays can be determined by the positions of the buttresses.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=14, 17}}\n\nOther elements that are visible on the plans are the locations of towers on the west fronts, porches such as those at Bourges and Salisbury, and the octagonal [[Chapter House]] at York Minster.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = Plan.cathedrale.Bourges.png\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = [[Bourges Cathedral]], France, length 125 m.\n | image2    = Plan.redress\u00e9.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = [[Notre Dame de Paris]], France, length 128 m.\n | width2    = 210\n | image3    = Amiens plan vert.png\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = [[Amiens Cathedral]], France, length 145 m.\n | image4    = Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png\n | width4    = 262\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = [[Cologne Cathedral]], Germany, length 144 m, completed C19th, to dimensions established in C14th \n | image5    = Salisbury cathedral plan vert.jpg\n | width5    = 170\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = [[Salisbury Cathedral]], England, length 135 m\n | image6    = YorkMinsterPlanDehio vert.jpg\n | width6    = 265\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = [[York Minster]], England, length 159 m\n }}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Elevation=== \n[[File:Gotic3d2.jpg|thumb|300px|Gothic Cathedral, showing nave, aisle, buttresses, arcade, gallery, clerestory and vault]]\nThe most common elevation for a Gothic cathedral is that of the architectural form known as the \"basilica\". This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]])\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestorey]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Roman basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestoreys, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey. This arrangement is usual in England where it can be seen at Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some French Cathedrals, such as Laon and the nave of Rouen, there is a fourth stage, a shallow tribune gallery between the triforium and the clerestorey.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  In the transepts of Notre Dame, the wall above the triforium gallery is pierced with rose windows.  In later Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches, the vertical members in the tracery of galleries and clerestorey may merge into a single decorative unit where the stages are present but not clearly defined, as at Saint Ouen at Rouen and the choir of Gloucester Cathedral in England. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches of Italy, triforium galleries are most often found in churches influenced by the arhitecture of Normandy, and were used at abbeys of women, as a space for the nuns to attend services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Elsewhere, many churches such as Florence Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Santa Maria Novella, had an interior alavation of two stages, the arcade and clerestorey. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = French Gothic elevations\n | image1    = Notre Dame 531 transverse crop rot.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris, showing the nave and double aisles; vault and flying buttresses.\n | image2    =Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | width2    = 183\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Notre Dame de Paris.

One of the best known and most typical of such west fronts is that of Notre Dame de Paris.  To emphasise its importance, the west front may be of a powerful design, with towers, imposing portals, jutting buttresses, gables, windows and an array of sculpture. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCentral to the west front is the main portal, often flanked by additional doors, after the manner of Suger's west front at the Basilica of Saint Denis. In England, the lateral doors may be present but relatively insignificant. In the arch of the central door, particularly in France, the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], is often a significant piece of sculpture, most frequently ''Christ in Majesty'' or ''the [[Last Judgment]]''.

See groundplans, above. \n\nIn France the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In many cases the chevet comprises projecting apses, as at the Abbey St Denis and Amiens Cathedral where there are seven. This is also the case at Cologne Cathedral in Germany and Prague Cathedral in the Czech Republic, while Chartres Cathedral has three and the [[Basilica of Saint Anthony]], Padua, had nine radiating square chapels. \n\nIn England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery. The building usually terminates in a square and a cliff-like exterior face as at York Minster and Lincoln Cathedral. Often there is a projecting ''Lady Chapel'', dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], as at Salisbury, Wells, and [[Ripon Cathedral]]s.<ref name=BF/><ref name=NP/><ref name=Swaan/> \n\nIn Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually a shallow chapel, as at [[Santa Maria Novella]].  At [[Florence Cathedral]] there is a polygonal apse, identical in size and shape to the transepts, radiating from the dome. [[Milan Cathedral]] has a polygonal east end. The Gothic cathedrals at Siena and Orvieto are both constrained by their mountainous sites to have square ends.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}.\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = East end\n | image1    = Bourges Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne Chor 06.jpg\n | width1    = 255\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The east end at Bourges Cathedral has a double ambulatory and small apses\n | image2    =Ely cathedral east end.jpg\n | width2    = 338\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Ely has a square east end in the Early English style and a Decorated Lady Chapel to the right<!---Do not change the upper case D to lower.

The position, construction and height of these towers  is as subject to variety as the nature of the west front, and was already well established by the beginning of the Gothic period. \n\nIn many parts of Europe, the location of twin towers on the west front of cathedrals was usual in the Romanesque period and may be seen at Abbaye les Hommes, Caen; [[Southwell Cathedral]], England; [[Lisbon Cathedral]], Portugal; [[Magdeburg Cathedral]], Germany; [[Cefalu Cathedral]], Sicily, and [[L\u00e9b\u00e9ny]] Abbey Church, Hungary.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Romanesque churches in the Rhineland often had many towers of different shapes, as did the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey Church of Cluny]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In mainland Italy, churches generally had one tower and that was freestanding from the building, sometimes at a distance, as at [[Pisa Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In Norman England, the crossing of large churches was often marked by a large tower, while abbey churches and cathedrals might have western towers as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Smaller churches, across Europe often had a single tower at the west.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The various configurations of church and tower of the Romanesque period continued into the Gothic, but with a greater emphasis on height. \n\nIn France, the plan for the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] called for two towers of equal height on the west front, and this plan was copied during the Gothic era at [Notre-Dame de Paris]], with towers of 69 meters (226&nbsp;ft) in height, and at other cathedrals of northern France such as Laon, Reims and Amiens.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=95\u201398}} Some of these churches were given towers over the crossing and transepts as well, with Rouen having three large towers, Laon having five, and the Romanesque Abbaey les Hommes, Caen, receiving additional towers during the Gothic period, until they numbered nine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  French Gothic towers are sometimes topped with spires.  [[Chartres Cathedral]]  has two on the western towers, of different dates and very different construction. That on the south is the tallest masonry spire of the 12th century, while that on the north is a highly elaborate Flamboyant design. The irregularity seen at Chartres also occurs at Rouen where there is a central tower in addition to the western towers. This tower displays another distinctly French feature, a delicate openwork [[fl\u00e8che]] made of wood covered with lead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nOpenwork spires of stone, sometimes of great height, were popular in the Flamboyant period, occurring singly at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], Burgos Cathedral, Freiburg Cathedral, [[Stefansdom]], Vienna; and also at Cologne Cathedral and Ulm Minster, both designed in the Medieval period but not realised until the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn England, during the Gothic era, there was a continuing fashion for three towers, with the largest being that over the crossing. This arrangement is seen at Canterbury, Wells, Lincoln, York, Lichfield. and Durham Cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, wherever the ground was considered stable, the central tower was surmounted by a spire. Like the south spire of Chartres Cathedral, English spires are often constructed of masonry. The earliest is the comparatively small spire at Oxford Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The tallest Medieval masonry spire is that built in the 13th century at Salisbury Cathedral (123 m - 404 ft).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Others exist at Norwich and [[Chichester Cathedral]]s, while [[Lichfield Cathedral]] has three.  Other cathedrals had tall spires of wooden construction sheathed with lead or copper. Two of these, on the central towers of Lincoln Cathedral and [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] surpassed 550 feet in height and were the tallest structures prior to the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nEngland's Gothic parish churches and collegiate churches generally have a single western tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} A number of the finest churches have masonry spires, with those of St James Church, Louth; St Wulfram's Church, Grantham; St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, and St Michael's, Coventry, all exceeding 85 metres (280 feet) in height.<ref>Julian Flannery, ''Fifty English Steeples: The Finest Medieval Parish Church Towers and Spires in England'', T&H, 2016, 10-0500343144</ref>  \n\nIn mainland [[Italy]], the tower, if present, is sometimes detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], or projects from the side of the building as at the Basilica of Santa Croce. In Italy there is no defined stylistic break between Romanesque and Gothic, as the architects had a seemingly pragmatic approach to the use of round and pointed arches. Towers of apparently Romanesque form often appear in conjunction with otherwise gothic structures. They tend to have graded series of openings in the Romanesque manner like the tower of the [[Badia Fiorentina]].  Some, like the tower at Santa Croce, have large openings of Gothic form and are surmounted by spires.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn addition to towers and spires, great Medieval churches, may have several other architectural forms, rising above the roofline, particularly over the crossing. These include the octagonal tower at Burgos Cathedral, the wooden octagonal tower at Ely Cathedral and the octagonal dome of Florence Cathedral, conceived in the late Gothic period and engineered by the Renaissance architect, Filippo Brunelleschi.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Towers and spires\n\n | image1    = Cathedrale laon facade 2012.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Laon Cathedral- the strongly articulated towers of the west front. \n\n | image2    = Facade cathedral.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Chartres Cathedral- C12th masonry spire, and Flamboyant spire \n\n | image3    = Canterbury-15.jpg\n | width3    = 167\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Canterbury Cathedral - the large tower over the crossing \n\n | image4    = Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg\n | width4    = 140\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rouen Cathedral- three different towers and a lead-covered fleche\n\n | image5    = Spire Cathedral St Stephen Vienna Wien Steffl 1.jpg\n | width5    = 137\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = St Stephan's Cathedral, Vienna- openwork stone spire \n\n | image6    = Lichfield Cathedral.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = Lichfield Cathedral- three masonry spires, the central being taller. \n\n | image7    = 26-Ely-004.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Ely Cathedral- the wooden octagon rises from an octagonal stone tower\n\n | image8    = Badia Fiorentina from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg\n | width8    = 150\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Badia Fiorentina, Florence- tall campanile with spire\n }}\n\n==Architectural character==\n\n===Height===\nA characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. A section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1.

In Italy, the tower, if present, is almost always detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], and is often from an earlier structure. In France and Spain, two towers on the front is the norm. In England, Germany and Scandinavia this is often the arrangement, but an English cathedral may also be surmounted by an enormous tower at the crossing.

The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England, the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated. The roofline, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened. The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book, [[The Celestial Hierarchy]], was popular among monks in France. Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine. To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/><ref name=Swaan/>\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall. These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs. The windows were very often filled with [[stained glass]] which added a dimension of colour to the light within the building, as well as providing a medium for figurative and narrative art.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Light\n | image1    =  Flying buttresses of Notre-Dame de Strasbourg.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Large clerestory windows between flying buttresses at Strasbourg\n | image2    = Lyon 5 - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean 03.jpg\n | width2    = 185\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall windows lighting the vault at [[Lyon Cathedral]], made possible by flying buttresses\n | image3    = Chapter House, Wells Cathedral 9 (9317650737).jpg\n | width3    = 185\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Windows in a polygonal arrangement, Lady Chapel, Wells Cathedral\n | image4    = Rouen (24748511178).jpg \n | width4    = 185\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Tall windows in the aisle at Rouen, with additional windows in the triforium   \n | image5    = York Minster, York (14047415195).jpg\n | width5    = 185\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \"Heart of Yorkshire\" window at York Minster, the scale of most west windows in England. \n | image6    = Paris 2019 (31878003887).jpg\n | width6    = 185\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The array of glass between thin stone mullions, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\n }}\n\n\n\n==Evolving styles== \nBetween the dedication of the choir at the Abbey of St Denis, Paris, in 1144 and the completion of [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at Westminster Abbey in 1519, there were nearly 400 years of stylistic development in Gothic architecture. Nowhere was this more manifest that in the building of cathedrals and the great churches of abbeys, colleges and prosperous towns.  \n\nWhile the plan and elevation of the various types of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture remained consistently linked to purpose and to regional preferences, all the other elements developed, generally towards greater complexity, over the decades.  The piers, the arcades, the galleries, the vaults and the portals, all evolved. The evolution was largely linked to and dependent upon the structural and ornamental flexibility of the pointed arch. \n\nThis development is traditionally divided into periods or styles according to the system of the 19th century French archaeologist [[Arcisse de Caumont]].<ref>Banister Fletcher, 17th edition, p. 534</ref> The periods are generally called Early Gothic (1137-1180), High Gothic (1180-1230), Rayonnant Gothic (1230-1350 and Flamboyant Gothic (1350-1530). These terms apply to the Gothic architecture of France and to those countries where the influence of French Gothic spread. These styles did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country.\n\nIn England, the reconstruction of Westminster Abbey and the east end of Canterbury Cathedral were both influenced by French Gothic, with the architect at Canterbury being [[William of Sens]]. Wells Cathedral, however, takes a completely different direction to French Gothic, introducing an unprecedented use of fluted mouldings, and other decorative innovations.  Salisbury Cathedral and the nave of Lincoln are also very different to the French prototypes.  Hence, the styles of English Gothic are referred to as Early English (or Lancet) Gothic (c. 1180\u20131275), Geometric Decorated and Flamboyant Decorated Gothic, (c. 1275\u20131380); and Perpendicular Gothic, (c. 1380\u20131520),  after the system proposed by [[Thomas Rickman]]<ref>Thomas Rickman,  ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315)</ref> \n\nOne of the indicators of style is the nature of the windows and doors, and their decorative treatment.  This is strongly associated with and affected by the type of arches used within the particular building. \nThe Gothic styles, Lancet, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular, affected all the various forms of architectonic decoration within the church- arcading, niches, shrines, wooden panelling, furniture of all sorts, reliquaries, vessels, and vestments.   \n\n===Arches, windows and tracery===\n====Early or Lancet Gothic====\nThe simplest shape of a Gothic window is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet windows may be used singly, as in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, or grouped, as in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral where they are in two in the aisles and threes in the clerestory.  Because large lancet windows, such as those lighting the aisles of a cathedral, may be wide in comparison to a single light in a traceried window, they often have armatures of wood or iron to support the glass.  The arch of a lancet opening is often equilateral, but sometimes is much more acute, and when employed in the arcade of a choir apse, such as at Westminster Abbey, adds to the emphasis of height. \n\nThe simple shape of the lancet arch may appear in Early Gothic buildings on openings of all types, doorways, niches, arcades, including galleries; and belfry openings.   \n\nThe use of lancet windows is found in the Early Gothic architecture of France, at the Abbey of St Denis, Sens and [[Senlis Cathedral]]s. At Chartres and Laon Cathedrals lancet windows are grouped beneath the rose windows. Tall narrow lancets are also found in radiating groups in the chancel apses of some cathedrals, such as Chartres.  It is common in France for lancet windows to be used in smaller, narrowere spaces, such as the chapels of a chevet, while traceries windows are used in the clerestory.  \n\nThe style Lancet Gothic is known in England as Early English Gothic, with Salisbury Cathedral being the prime example. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. <ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>  Wells Cathedral is notable for the continuous rows of lancet openings that make up the triforiun galleries.  \nLancet windows are used extensively in the Gothic churches of Italy, including Florence Cathedral and in the [[Brick Gothic]] churches of Germany and Poland.   \n\n====Geometric Gothic (England)====\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. In France, windows of clerestorys, and other larger windows were commonly divided into two lights, with some simple Geometric tracery above, a circle or a cinquefoil or sexfoil. This style of window remained popular without great change until after 1300\n\nIn England there was a much greater variation in the design of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces. The style is known as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English cathedrals and abbey churches, where both the eastern and the western terminations of the building may be occupied by a single large window such as the east window at Lincoln and the west window at Worcester Cathedral. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches springing from the vertical mullions.<ref name=CT/> \n\n====Rayonnant Gothic==== \nRayonnant Gothic is the term used particularly to described the style that produced the great rose windows of France. These windows deck not only the west fronts of cathedrals, but often, as at Notre Dame de Paris, the transept gables as well. It is common that although the transepts of French Cathedrals do not project strongly, they are given visual importance almsot equal to the west front, including large decorated portals and a rose window.  Particularly fine examples are at Notre Dame  and Chartres Cathedral. \n\n====Flamboyant Gothic====\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point. These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].<ref name=BF/>\n\nSome of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/><ref name=NP/>\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France. They are much rarer in England. A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=JH1/>\n\n====Perpendicular Gothic (England)====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court. There are three very famous royal chapels and one chapel-like Abbey which show the style at its most elaborate: [[King's College Chapel]], [[Cambridge]]; [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]]; [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[Bath Abbey]].<ref name=CT/> However very many simpler buildings, especially churches built during the wool boom in [[East Anglia]], are fine examples of the style.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Styles- Lancet, Early Gothic, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular\n | image1    = Durham Cathedral.jpg\n | width1    = 164\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Lancet Gothic windows,west front, Ripon Cathedral, England\n | image2    = Chartres Cathedral clerestory exterior.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Plate tracery, clerestory window, Chartres Cathedral, France\n | image3    = Ripon Cathedral (7557362580) crop.jpg\n | width3    = 137\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Geometric Decorated tracery, east window, Ripon Cathedral\n | image4    =  Stra\u00dfburger M\u00fcnster, Gro\u00dfe Fensterrose.jpg\n | width4    = 160\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rayonnant Gothic tracery, west rose, Strasbourg Cathedral, France\n | image5    = Amiens France Cath\u00e9drale-Notre-Dame-d-Amiens-03d.jpg\n | width5    = 180\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Flamboyant Gothic tracery, west rose, Amiens Cathedral, France\n | image6    =Limoges curvilinear tracery.JPG\n | width6    = 164\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = [[Flamboyant]] tracery, nave, [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges Cathedral]], France\n | image7    =  Kings College Chapel Cambridge west window.jpg\n | width7    = 160\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Perpendicular Gothic window under 4-centred arch, King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n | image8    = \n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  =  \n }} \n\n===Columns and piers===\n\nIn France, tall untapered columns were common in the Romanesque period. The use of columns of this type was rare in Norman England, where at Durham, Gloucester and Hereford there were massive circular piers built of masonry,  and at Durham, alternating with rectangular piers. \n\nIn Early French Gothic architecture, the columns became much more Classical in shape, proportion and the nature of the capital, which was often a modification of the Corinthian capital.  Columns of this type were used at the Abbey of St Denis, at Sens, at Notre Dame and at Canterbury in England.   In buildings with sexpartite vaults, they sometimes alternated with piers. \n\nIn the [[Brabantine Gothic architecture]] of the Holland and Belgium, columns remained part of the style into the 15th century, and have capitals of cabbage leaf foliage. \n\nIn France, the column developed in complexity by having a cluster of circular shafts grouped around the central circular core. This is seen a Reims, Amiens and Bourges Cathedrals,  and also at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral and in Spain at Burgos Cathedral. \n\nThe rectangular piers also developed, with attached shafts and mouldings which continue up the wall to support the vault, or into the decorative mouldings of the chancel arch, in a manner that had previously been utilised to decorate the arches of Romanesque portals. The eastern end of the Abbey of Saint Etienne, Caen, was rebuilt from 1166, with clustered piers. From 1176, Wells Cathedral was constructed with clustered piers throughout. Between the two buildings there is a great difference in the handling of the two. At Caen, the pier remains a decorated rectangular pier, set parallel to the wall surface. The shafts themselves maintain a circular, and classicising form. At Well, the core of the pier appears to have been rotated, and become a lozenge, angle-on to the lie of the arcade. The clusters of shafts are fluting. The capitals are of what is know as \"stiff-leaf\" foliage, and has a vitality of form different to any other foliage carving of that date. \n\nComplex clustered columns and fluted and shafted piers were subsequently widely adopted, and became part of the vertical visual character of Gothic cathedrals.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = \n | width1    = 164\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = \n | image2    = \n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = \n | image3    = \n | width3    = 137\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = \n | image4    =  \n | width4    = 160\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = \n | image5    = \n | width5    = 180\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \n | image6    =\n | width6    = 164\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = \n | image7    =  \n | width7    = 160\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = \n | image8    = \n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  =  \n }}\n\n===Developments in ribbed vaulting=== \nIn France the vaults over the high spaces of  nave and clerestory, in the Early Gothic period, was sexpartite, spanning two bays of the nave. This resulted in the vaulted space being almost square, and to diagoal ribs being semi-circular. Only the arches of the transverse ribs were pointed.  This is the case at Sens, at Notre Dame de Paris and the Nave of Laon Cathedral. \n\nAt Chartres Cathedral, and the choir of Laon Cathedral, however, the vault is in four parts, spans a single bay, is rectangular, and all the ribs are pointed.  The quadripartite proved much easier to build because it required less centring. It is also stronger as the compartments are smaller.  The quadripartite vault is used in the Early English cathedrals of Salisbury and Wells. It became the standard form of vault which leant itself to further development and elaboration. \n\nIn the nave of Lincoln Cathedral the vault acquired  extra ribs known as \"tiercerons\" which meet at a central \"ridge rib\" running the length of the nave. An additional elaboration, to span the wide nave, was the introduction of intermediate ribs which do not reach the centre of the vault, but join two small \"lierne\" ribs projecting from the ridge.  Other cathedrals with tierceron vaulting are Norwich, and Exeter. \n\nLierne ribs became a feature of later Gothic design, as at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and led the way to elaborate patterns within the vault, including net or \"reticular\" vaulting and \"stellar\" vaulting.  Stellar vaulting was particularly fashionable in Germany, Eastern Europe and Spain.  The use of short ribs leant itself to the introduction of curved and ogee shaped ribs, in the Flamboyant style. Flamboynt vaulting is particularly prevalent in Spain.   \n\nIn England there are a number of chapter house, notably at Wells, Lincoln and Westminster abbey, where the vault is supported by a single central column from which many ribs radiate in every direction like a palm tree. This also occurs at the high vault behind the altar at [[Jacobins Church]], Toulouse, in France. \n\nA further development was many shallow ribs radiating in a fan shape, so that visually, the appearance of the structural ribs is minimised, and the emphasis is upon the curving surfaces. These fan vaults were used successfully for narrower and lower structures such as the cloister at Gloucester Cathedral and the retrochoir at Peterborough, before being employed on the high vaults at the Chapel of Kings College Cambridge, and even even more elaborate form with pendant lanterns attached, at Henry Vii's Chapel at Westminster Abbey. \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Style- Ribbed vaults\n | image1    = B\u00f3veda de catedral de Notre Dame de Par\u00eds 3.jpg\n | width1    = 144\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame, Paris- square, sexpartite vaults spanning two nave bays\n | image2    = Salisbury Cathedral Interior 01.jpg\n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Salisbury Cathedral, England- rectangular quadripartite vault over single bay\n | image3    = Lincoln cathedral 13 Nave vault.jpg\n | width3    = 162\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Lincoln Cathedral, England- quadripartite form, with tierceron ribs and ridge rib with carved bosses. \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 155\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = Bremer Dom Juli 2009 PD 060.JPG\n | width5    = 144\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Bremer Cathedral, Germany- north aisle, a reticular (net) vault with intersecting ribs. \n | image6    = Wolfsberg Sankt Marein Pfarrkirche Mariae Himmelfahrt Netzrippengewoelbe 03092014 742.jpg\n | width6    = 144\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = St Marien's, Wolfsberg, Austria- stellar vault with intersecting lierne ribs.  \n | image7    = B\u00f3vedas catedral Salamanca 40.jpg\n | width7    = 162\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Salamanca Cathedral, Spain- vault has Flamboyant S-shaped and circular lierne ribs, \n | image8    = Peterborough Retrochoir fan vaulting.JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Peterborough Cathedral retrochoir- fan vaulting, which further evolved into pemdant vaulting. \n }}\n\n===Early Gothic architectural elements, 1137-1180 ===  \n\nThese elements are those to be found in the earliest Gothic buildings of France, Abbey, of St Denis, Sens Cathedral, Senlis Cathedral, Noyon Cathedral, and also affected the rebuilding of the choir at Canterbury in Kent, England, after a fire in 1174. \n\n* Pointed arches, often of equilateral projection \n* Continued use of semi-circular arches in conjunction with pointed arches e.g. in vaulting ribs \n* Ribbed vaulting\n* Nave vault sexpartite, spanning two bays \n* Quadripartite ailse vaults, trapezoid where necessary\n* Cylindrical columns, with simplified Corinthian capitals; sometimes with attached cylindrical shafts\n* Internal elevation of four stages: arcade, triforium, tribune (a shallow blind arcade); clerestory \n* The triforium has paired openings under an arch, in the Romanesque manner, but pointed.  \n* Large lancet windows (i.e. untraceried), sometimes with metal armature forming Geometric tracery\n* Rose windows at west front with simple tracery, including plate tracery. \n* Wall buttresses. \n* Three large portals \n* Two towers on west front\n* Columnar figures on jambs of portals \n* Sculptured tympanum \n* Stained glass  \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal \n | header_align = centre\n | header    = Early Gothic \n | image1    = Saint-Denis -

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine. When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of coloured glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Portals and the tympanum===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Saint Denis PM 086190 F.jpg|North portal of [[Basilica of St Denis]], with early [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] and columns made of elongated figures (1135\u20131140)\nFile:Amiens cathedral Tympanumt.JPG|Day of Judgement [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Amiens Cathedral]] (1220\u20131270), the prototype for other high Gothic portals.\nFile:Frontispice cath\u00e9drale Strasbourg.JPG|Portals and tympanum of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] (Begun 1176)\nFile:WestminsterNorth55.jpg|[[Westminster Abbey]] north portal (begun 1245)\n</gallery>\n\nEarly Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir. Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches, richly filled with sculpture. The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], or arch, over each doorway is filled with realistic statues illustrating biblical stories, and the columns between the doors are often also crowded with statuary. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe iconography of the sculptural decoration on the facade was not left to the artists. An edict of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 had set the rules: \"The composition of religious images is not to be left to the inspiration of artists; it is derived from the principles put in place by the Catholic Church and religious tradition. Only the art belongs to the artist; the composition belongs to the Fathers.\"{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=79}}\n\nThe portals and interiors were much more colourful than they are today. Each sculpture on the tympanum and in the interior was painted by the ''peintre imagier'', or image painter, following a system of colours codified in the 12th century; yellow, called ''gold'', symbolized intelligence, grandeur and virtue; white, called ''argent'', symbolized purity, wisdom, and correctness; black, or ''sable'', meant sadness, but also will; green, or ''sinople'', represented hope, liberty and joy; red or ''gueules'' (see [[gules]]) meant charity or victory; blue or ''azure'' symbolized the sky, faithfulness and perseverance; and violet, or ''pourpre'', was the colour of royalty and sovereignty.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=54}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chartres2006 076.jpg|Statues of Saints are literally \"pillars of the church\", supporting the portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]].\nFile:Paris - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame - Portail de la Vierge - PA00086250 - 003.jpg|The martyr Saint [[Denis]], holding his head, over the Portal of the Virgin ([[Notre-Dame de Paris]])\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris - Portail du Jugement dernier - d\u00e9tail 01.jpg|The serpent tempts Adam and Eve; part of the [[Last Judgement]] on the central portal of west facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:DevilCentralGateNotreDameParis.jpg|[[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] and Satan weighing souls during the [[Last Judgement]] ([[Notre-Dame de Paris]] central portal, west facade)\nFile:Chimera of Notre-Dame de Paris, 26 April 2014.jpg|A [[strix (mythology)|stryge]] on west facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Notre-Dame Rzygacze.JPG|[[Gargoyles]] were the rainspouts of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Gargoyle Point of View (3575829233).jpg|[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] on [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] west facade\nFile:H\u00f4tel de ville de Bruxelles - Gargouille 01.JPG|[[Gargoyle]] on [[Brussels Town Hall]]\nFile:Gargoyles and Saints - Siena Cathedral.jpg|Gargoyle on [[Siena Cathedral]] (13th century)\nFile:Labyrinthchartres.jpg|[[Labyrinth]] at [[Chartres Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as \"Books for the poor.\" To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6.

The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each Saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The strix appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.<ref name=fasti>Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131\u2013,{{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.</ref> They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nThe [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre-Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration. Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==French Gothic==\n{{Main|French Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFranceNormandieCoutancesCathNotreDameFacade.jpg|[[Coutances Cathedral]] in Normandy (1210\u20131274)\nP1240007 Bayeux cathedrale ND rwk.jpg|[[Bayeux Cathedral]] in Normandy (1180\u20131350)\nNef de la cath\u00e9drale d'Auxerre.jpg|Interior of [[Auxerre Cathedral]] in Burgundy (1215\u20131233)\nAlbi Sainte-C\u00e9cile.JPG|[[Albi Cathedral]], originally begun as a fortress, in Southwest France (1282\u20131480)\nNave of the Ste C\u00e9cile Cathedral - 2014-02-22.jpg|Polychrome interior of [[Albi Cathedral]] (1282\u20131480)\nFile:Fa\u00e7ade de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Toulouse.jpg|[[Toulouse Cathedral]] (13th century)\nPalmier des Jacobins.JPG|The Palm Tree of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]], 28 meters high ([[Toulouse]], 1292)\n</gallery>\n\nFrom the 12th century onwards, the Gothic style spread from Northern France to other regions of France and gradually to the rest of the Europe. It was often carried by the highly skilled craftsmen who had trained in the Ile-de-France and then carried their crafts to other cities. The style was adapted to local styles and materials.\n\nIn [[Normandy]], the new naves were usually very long, sometimes more than one hundred meters, and, from the long Romanesque tradition, the walls were thicker than in northern France, and had shorter buttresses. The interiors were narrower than in the north, and were given a strong sense of verticality by long and narrow bays and lancet arches. Rose windows were rare, replaced on the exterior by a large bay in ''tiers point''. The facades had less sculptural decoration; decoration in the interior was largely in geometric forms. Norman Gothic also usually featured a profusion of towers, lanterns and [[spire]]s; spires and [[Fl\u00e8che|spirelets]] sometimes were seventy meters high. [[Bayeux Cathedral]], [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Coutances Cathedral]] are notable examples of Norman Gothic.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n\nIn [[Burgundy]], which had a long [[Romanesque style]] tradition, a [[lantern tower]] was often included, and cathedrals often had a narrow passage the length of the cathedral at the level of the stained glass windows. as in [[Auxerre Cathedral]].\n\nIn the Southwest of France, the walls were thicker, with narrow openings, and doubled with arches. The flying buttress was rarely used, replaced by heavy [[abutment]]s with chapels between.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n\nThe south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. The Gothic cathedrals were often built with brick and tile rather than stone. They generally had thick walls and narrow windows, and were braced by heavy abutments rather than flying buttresses. The form of the tower of [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|the basilica of Saint-Sernin]] was copied by several cathedrals in the south, while the old nave of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] (1210\u20131220) gave the model of the single nave which was generally used in Southern French Gothic architecture (although some churches had two or three naves of equal height). Some Gothic cathedrals in the [[Southern France|Midi]] took unusual form; the [[Cathedral of Albi]] (1282\u20131480) was originally built as fortress, then converted to a cathedral. Albi Cathedral has another very distinctive feature; a colourful interior and painted ceiling.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}} In the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] of [[Toulouse]], the grafting of a single apse of polygonal plan on a church with two vessels gave birth to a starry vault whose complex organization anticipated more than a century on the Flamboyant Gothic. Tradition refers to this masterpiece as \"palm tree\", because the veins gush out of the smooth shaft of the column-like palm trees.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1337/ | title=Episcopal City of Albi}}</ref>\n\nThe facade of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] is unusual; it is the combination of two unfinished cathedral buildings, begun in the 13th century and finally put together. Toulouse Cathedral has no flying buttresses; it is supported by massive ''contreforts'' the height of the building, with chapels between.\n\n==English Gothic==\n{{Main|English Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir 2, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|12th century choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] ([[Early English Gothic]])\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Choir, Wiltshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|Choir of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131258) ([[Early English Gothic]])\nFile:YorkMinsterWest.jpg|West front of [[York Minster]] ([[Decorated Gothic]])\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|[[Gloucester Cathedral]] ([[Perpendicular Gothic]]) (1351\u20131377)\nFile:Westminster abbey16.jpg|Fan vaults with pendants at the [[Henry VII Chapel]] of [[Westminster Abbey]] ([[Perpendicular Gothic]]) (1503)\n</gallery>\n\nThe Gothic style was imported very early into England, in part due to the close connection with the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which until 1204 was still ruled by the Kings of England. The first period is generally called [[early English Gothic]], and was dominant from about 1180 to 1275. The first part of major English cathedral to feature the new style was the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], begun about 1175. It was created by a French master builder, [[William of Sens]]. He added several original touches, including coloured marble pavement, double columns in the arcades, and engaged slender ''colonettes'' which reached up to the vaults, borrowed from the design of [[Laon Cathedral]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=34\u201335}} [[Westminster Abbey]] was rebuilt from 1245 to 1517. [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131320) is also a good example of early Gothic, with the exception of its tower and spire, which were added in 1320.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe second period of English Gothic is known as [[Decorated Gothic]]. It is customarily divided into two the \"Geometric\" style (1250\u201390) and the \"Curvilinear\" style (1290\u20131350), and it is similar to the French [[Rayonnant]] style, with an emphasis on curvilinear forms, particularly in the windows. This period saw detailed stone carving reach its peak, with elaborately carved windows and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], often with floral patterns, or with an accolade, a carved arch over a window decorated with pinnacles and a [[fleuron (architecture)|fleuron]], or carved floral element.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe rib vaults of the Decorated Gothic became extremely ornate, with a profusion of ribs that were purely ornamental. The vaults were often decorated with hanging stone pendants. The columns also became more ornamental, as at Peterborough Cathedral, with ribs spreading upward.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520) was the final phase of English Gothic, lasting into the 16th century. As the name suggests, its emphasis was on clear horizontal and vertical lines, meeting at right angles. Columns extended upwards all the way to the roof, giving the interior the appearance of a cage of glass and stone, as in the nave of [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The [[Tudor Arch|Tudor arch]] appeared, wider and lower and often framed by [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], which was used to create larger windows and to balance the strong vertical elements. The design of the rib vaults became even more complex, including the [[fan vault]] with pendants used in the Henry VII chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]] (1503\u201307).{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\nA distinctive characteristic of English cathedrals is their extreme length, and their internal emphasis upon the horizontal, which may be emphasised visually as much or more than the vertical lines. Each English cathedral (with the exception of Salisbury) has an extraordinary degree of stylistic diversity, when compared with most French, German and Italian cathedrals. It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity. Unlike French cathedrals, English cathedrals sprawl across their sites, with double transepts projecting strongly and [[Lady chapel]]s tacked on at a later date, such as at Westminster Abbey. In the west front, the doors are not as significant as in France, the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch. The West window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables. The west front may have two towers like a French cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower at the crossing and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire. The distinctive English east end is square, but it may take a completely different form. Both internally and externally, the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings, particularly the capitals.<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\n==Northern European Gothic==\n{{See also|Architecture of Germany|Brabantine Gothic|Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic architecture in Lithuania|Polish Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Kdom.jpg|Rear of [[Cologne Cathedral]], [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] (1248\u20131473)\nFile:Matthias Church Budapest Corrected.jpg|[[Matthias Church]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (11th\u201315th centuries)\nFile:Saint Wenceslas Chapel, St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague 20160809 1.jpg|St. Wenceslas Chapel in [[St. Vitus Cathedral|Prague Cathedral]], [[Czech Republic]] (1356\u20131367)\nFile:Wien - Stephansdom (1).JPG|[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]], [[Austria]] (1339\u20131365)\nFile:20110917 Krakow Kosciol Mariacki 0306.jpg|[[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]] (1290\u20131365)\nFile:Haarlem bavo inside.jpg|[[Brabantine Gothic]] [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]] in [[Netherlands]] (c. 1479)\n</gallery>\n\nBetween the 13th and 16th centuries, Gothic cathedrals were constructed in most of the major cities of northern Europe. For the most part, they followed the French model, but with variations depending upon local traditions and the materials available. The first Gothic churches in Germany were built from about 1230. They included [[Liebfrauenkirche, Trier|Liebfrauenkirche]] ( ca. 1233\u20131283) in [[Trier]], claimed to be the oldest Gothic church in Germany,<ref>{{Cite web|author=UNESCO|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/367|title=UNESCO Cultural Heritage Sites; Liebfrukirche, Trier}}</ref> and [[Freiburg Cathedral]], which was built in three stages, the first beginning in 1120, though only the foundations of the original cathedral still exist. It is noted for its 116-metre tower, the only Gothic church tower in Germany that was completed in the Middle Ages (1330).\n\n[[Prague]], in the region of [[Bohemia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was another flourishing centre for Gothic architecture. [[Charles IV of Bohemia]] was both King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, and he had monumental tastes. He began construction of Prague's [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in the Gothic style in 1344, as well as a Gothic palace, [[Karl\u0161tejn|Karlstein Castle]] in Central Bohemia, and Gothic buildings for the new [[Charles University|University of Prague]]. The nave of [[Prague Cathedral]] featured the filet vault, a decorative type of vault in which the ribs criss-crossed in a mesh pattern, similar to the vaults of [[Bristol Cathedral]] and other English churches. His other Gothic projects included the lavishly decorated Chapel of the Holy Cross inside [[Karl\u0161tejn|Karlstein Castle]] (1357\u20131367), and the choir of [[Aachen Cathedral]] begun in 1355, which was built on the model of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=221\u2013230}} Gothic architecture in Germany and the kingdoms of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] generally followed the French formula, but the towers were much taller and, if completed, were often surmounted by enormous openwork spires. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness. German and Czech cathedrals, like the French, tend not to have strongly projecting transepts. There are also many [[hall church]]es (''Hallenkirchen'') without [[clerestory]] windows.<ref name=BF/><ref name=Swaan /> [[Cologne Cathedral]] is after [[Milan Cathedral]] the largest Gothic cathedral in the world.

Another regional variation is the [[Brabantine Gothic]] a style found in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is characterized by using light-coloured [[sandstone]] or limestone, which allowed rich detailing but was prone to erosion. Features included columns with sculpted cabbage-like foliage, arched windows whose points came right up into the vaults. and, sometimes, a wooden ceiling. Examples include [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]], in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands, originally built as a Catholic cathedral, now a Protestant church, and the [[Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon]] in Brussels (15th century).\n\n==Southern European Gothic==\n===Spain and Portugal===\n{{Main|Spanish Gothic architecture|Portuguese Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Catedral G\u00f3tica de Le\u00f3n.jpg|[[Le\u00f3n Cathedral]] (1205\u20131472)\nFile:KathedraleToledo.jpg|[[Toledo Cathedral]] (1227\u20131493)\nFile:Fachada de la Catedral de Burgos.jpg|[[Burgos Cathedral]] (1221\u20131260)\nFile:Catedral_de_Valencia,_Valencia,_Espa%C3%B1a,_2014-06-29,_DD_16.JPG|[[Valencia Cathedral]] (13th\u201315 c.)\nFile:Sevilla Cathedral - Southeast.jpg|[[Seville Cathedral]]\nFile:Karinecyril evora cathedrale2.JPG|[[Evora Cathedral]], [[\u00c9vora]], Portugal (1280\u20131340)\nFile:Evora53.jpg|Gothic nave of [[\u00c9vora Cathedral]], Portugal, leads to a [[Baroque]] chapel (1280\u20131340)\n</gallery>\n\nStrikingly different variations of the Gothic style appeared in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Important examples of Spanish Gothic include [[Toledo Cathedral]], [[Le\u00f3n Cathedral]], and [[Burgos Cathedral]].\nThe distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is their spatial complexity, with many areas of different shapes leading from each other. They are comparatively wide, and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories, giving a similar spacious appearance to the ''Hallenkirche'' of Germany, as at the Church of the [[Batalha Monastery]] in Portugal. Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels. Like English cathedrals, each is often stylistically diverse. This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources. Among the influences on both decoration and form are [[Islamic architecture]] and, towards the end of the period, Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner. The West front, as at Leon Cathedral, typically resembles a French west front, but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces. At [[Burgos Cathedral]] there are spires of German style. The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles. There are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof.<ref name=BF/> [[Church of San Pablo, Valladolid|Church of San Pablo]] in [[Valladolid]] is an outstanding example of construction that combines the [[Isabelline Gothic]] style (a local adaptation of the Gothic style) with the [[Renaissance architecture]].<!---DO NOT CHANGE. READ DISCUSSION PAGE--->\n\nIn the territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]] (Aragon, Catalonia, [[Roussillon]] in France, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Valencian Community]], among others in the Italian islands), the Gothic style suppressed the transept and made the [[Aisle#Church architecture|side-aisles]] almost as high as the main nave, creating wider spaces, and with few ornaments. There are two different Gothic styles in the Aragonese lands: [[Catalan Gothic]] and [[Valencian Gothic]], which are different from those in the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and France.\n\nThe most important samples of Catalan Gothic style are the cathedrals of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], [[Perpignan]] and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] (in [[Mallorca]]), the basilica of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] (in Barcelona), the [[Santa Maria del Pi, Barcelona|Bas\u00edlica del Pi]] (in Barcelona), and the church of [[Santa Maria, Manresa|Santa Maria de l'Alba]] in [[Manresa]].\n\nThe most important examples of Valencian Gothic style in the old [[Kingdom of Valencia]] are the [[Valencia Cathedral]], [[Llotja de la Seda]] (Unesco World Heritage site), [[Torres de Serranos]], Torres de Quart, [[Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba]], in [[Alfauir]], [[Palace of the Borgias]] in [[Gandia]], [[Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Valldigna]], [[Basilica of Santa Maria, Alicante|Basilica of Santa Maria]], in [[Alicante]], [[Orihuela Cathedral]], [[Castell\u00f3 Cathedral]] and [[El Fadr\u00ed]], [[Segorbe Cathedral]], etc.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Italian Gothic architecture|Venetian Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Duomo di Siena, April 2017.jpg|[[Siena Cathedral]] (1215\u20131263)\nFile:Toscana Siena4 tango7174.jpg|Interior of [[Siena Cathedral]] (1215\u20131263)\nFile:Facciata del Duomo di Orvieto.JPG|[[Orvieto Cathedral]] (1290\u20131591)\nFile:Interno duomo Orvieto.jpg|Nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] (begun 1290)\nFile:GPisano-PulpitoPisa background blurred.JPG|Pulpit of [[Pisa Cathedral]], by [[Giovanni Pisano]] (1302\u20131310)\nFile:Toscana Pisa11 tango7174.jpg|[[Santa Maria della Spina]] (about 1323)\nFile:Milan Cathedral from Piazza del Duomo.jpg|[[Milan Cathedral]] (1386\u20131510 \u2013 facade from 19th century)\nFile:Photograph of of the Doges Palace in Venice.jpg|[[Doges Palace]] (1424\u20131442)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Italian Gothic architecture]] went its own particular way, departing from the French model. It was influenced by other styles, notably the [[Byzantine style]] introduced in [[Ravenna]]. Major examples include [[Milan Cathedral]], the [[Orvieto Cathedral]], and particularly [[Florence Cathedral]], before the addition of the Duomo in the Renaissance.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe Italian style was influenced by the materials available in the different regions; [[marble]] was available in great quantities in [[Tuscany]], and was lavishly used in churches; it was scarce in [[Lombardy]], and brick was used instead. But many of the architectural elements were used apparently mainly to be different from the French style.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=147}}\n\nThe [[Cistercian]] monastic order introduced some of the first Gothic churches into Italy, in [[Fossanova Abbey]] (consecrated 1208) and the [[Casamari Abbey]] (1203\u20131217). They followed the basic plan of the Gothic Cistercian churches of [[Burgundy]], particularly [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=148}}\n\nThe Italian plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of \"''armon\u00eca''\", and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Italian Gothic cathedrals often retained Romanesque features; the nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] had Romanesque arches and vaults.\n\nItalian cathedrals also offered a variety of plans; Florence Cathedral (begun 1246) had a rectangular choir, based on the Cistercian model, but was designed to have three wings with polygonal chapels. Italian Gothic cathedrals were generally not as tall as those in France; they rarely used flying buttresses, and generally had only two levels, an arcade and a ''claire-voie'' with small windows; but [[Bologna Cathedral]] (begun in 1388), rivalled [[Bourges Cathedral]] in France in height. The smallest notable Italian Gothic church is [[Santa Maria della Spina]] in [[Pisa]] (about 1330), which resembles a Gothic jewel box.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|p=148}}\n\nA distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration, both externally as marble veneer on the brick fa\u00e7ade and internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments. The columns were sometimes painted red, and the walls were decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic. Italian cathedral fa\u00e7ades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors. The fa\u00e7ades have projecting open porches and ocular or wheel windows rather than roses, and do not usually have a tower. The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome. There is often a free-standing tower and baptistery. The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the [[fresco]].<ref name=BF/> The facade of Orvieto Cathedral, begun in 1310, is a striking example of mosaic decoration. Another innovation of Italian Gothic is the bronze doorway covered with sculpture; the most famous examples are the doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]] by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330\u20131336).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=161\u2013175}}\n\nItalian Gothic cathedrals did not have the elaborate sculptural tympanums over the entrances of French cathedrals, but they had abundant realistic sculptural decoration. Some of the finest work was done by [[Nicola Pisano]] at the [[Pisa Baptistery]] (1259\u201360) and in [[Siena Cathedral]], and by his son [[Giovanni Pisano]] on the west facade of [[Pisa Cathedral]] (1284\u201385).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=152\u2013176}}\n\n==Gothic in the Colonial Americas==\n{{See also|Mendicant monasteries in Mexico}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Bas\u00edlica Menor de Santa Mar\u00eda CCSD 07 2017 4676.jpg|[[Basilica Cathedral of Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor]] (1514-1541) in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic<ref name=\"whc.unesco.org\"/><ref name=\"5albemarleway.co.uk\"/>\nFile:SacristyCathedralDF.JPG|A Gothic vault in the sacristy of the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]] (started to built in 1573)<ref name=\"catedralmetropolitanademexico.mx\"/>\nFile:Palacio de Cort\u00e9s 2017.jpg|[[Palace of Cort\u00e9s, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cort\u00e9s]] (1523-1528) in Cuernavaca, Mexico, this palace has a style that blends Gothic and [[Mud\u00e9jar art|Mud\u00e9jar]]<ref name=\"Routledge\"/><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\nFile:20090405-182346- eglise du couvent saint gabriel -modifi\u00e9e-.jpg|[[San Gabriel Franciscan Convent, Cholula|San Gabriel Franciscan Convent]] in [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], Metropolitan area of Puebla City, Mexico, it is partially Gothic (built in the mid-16th century)<ref name=\"lonelyplanet.com/mexico\"/><ref name=\"inafed.gob.mx\"/>\nFile:Templo y convento de San Mateo Ap\u00f3stol.JPG|[[Earliest 16th-century monasteries on the slopes of Popocat\u00e9petl|Convent of San Mateo Ap\u00f3stol y Evangelista]] (1535-1567)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rosademaria.wordpress.com/2016/10/05/ex-convento-agustino/|title=Ex Convento Agustino|website=rosademaria.wordpress.com|date = 5 October 2016|language = Spanish}}</ref> in [[Atlatlahucan]], Mexico, is a late-Gothic [[Plateresque]] church that is a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]<ref name=\"list/702\"/>\n</gallery>\nThere are late-Gothic architecture from the era in some of the oldest Christian churches built in the Americas.

Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.\nThe Rouen Courthouse in Normandy is representative of Flamboyant Gothic in France.\n\nIn the 15th century, following the late Gothic or flamboyant period, elements of Gothic decoration borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in the town halls of northern France, in Flanders and in the Netherlands. The H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Compi\u00e8gne]] has an imposing gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate [[Accolade (architecture)|accolades]] or ornamental arches.

The Gothic style was adapted from English monasteries for use in the first colleges of [[Oxford University]], including [[Magdalen College]]. It was also used at the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain. The use of the late Gothic style at Oxford and [[Cambridge University]] inspired the picturesque Gothic architecture in U.S. colleges in the 19th and 20th century.\n\nBy the late Middle Ages university towns had grown in wealth and importance as well, and this was reflected in the buildings of some of Europe's ancient universities. Particularly remarkable examples still standing nowadays include the [[Collegio di Spagna]] in the [[University of Bologna]], built during the 14th and 15th centuries; the [[Karolinum|Collegium Carolinum]] of the [[Charles University in Prague]] in Bohemia; the [[University of Salamanca|Escuelas mayores]] of the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain; the chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]]; or the [[Collegium Maius]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.\n\n==Military architecture==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chateau-de-Vincennes-donjon.jpg|Donjon of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]], begun 1337\nCarcasonneouterwall.jpg|Restored outer walls of the medieval city of [[Carcassonne]] (13th\u201314th century)\nFile:Chateau.Louvre.png|The Louvre in the time of [[Charles V of France]] (1338\u20131380) drawn by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]\nFile:2012.05.12 MALBORK (4).JPG|[[Malbork Castle]] in Poland (13th century)\nFile:Exterior Alcazar Segovia.jpg|[[Alcazar of Segovia]] (12th\u201313th centuries)\nFile:Burg Hohenzollern.JPG|[[Hohenzollern Castle]] (1454\u20131461) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], southern Germany\n</gallery>\n\nIn the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]]. The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the centre, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), pg. 38</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337\u20131453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=38}}\n\n==Decline==\nBeginning in the 16th century, as [[Renaissance architecture]] from Italy began to appear in France and other countries in Europe, the dominance of Gothic architecture began to wane. Nonetheless, new Gothic buildings, particularly churches, continued to be built; new Gothic churches built in Paris in this period included [[Saint-Merri]] (1520\u20131552); and [[Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]]; The first signs of classicism in Paris churches, at [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]], did not appear until 1540. The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532\u20131560), rivalled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high. As construction of this church continued, elements of Renaissance decoration, including the system of classical orders of columns, were added to the design, making it an early Gothic-Renaissance hybrid.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nThe Gothic style began to be described as outdated, ugly and even barbaric. The term \"Gothic\" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term \"barbarous German style\" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style.{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} In the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to \"[[Goths|the Goths]]\" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}} In the 17th century, [[Moli\u00e8re]] also mocked the Gothic style in the 1669 poem ''La Gloire'': \"...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...\"{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=9}} The dominant styles in Europe became in turn [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], [[Baroque architecture]], and the grand classicism of the [[Louis XIV style]].\n\nNonetheless, Gothic architecture, usually churches or university buildings, continued to be built.

The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of medieval architecture turned to technical consideration. London's Palace of Westminster, St. Pancras railway station, New York's Trinity Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral are also famous examples of Gothic Revival buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gothic-architecture|title=Gothic Architecture and Churches {{!}} Architectural Digest|website=Architectural Digest|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> Such style also reached the [[Far East]] in the period, for instance, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[St. John's Cathedral (Hong Kong)|St. John's Cathedral]] which was located at the centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]].\n<!--- Need to read this through \n==Influences==\n\n===Romanesque and Norman influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Durham Cathedral.

The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).

It begins to appear throughout the Islamic world in close succession after its adoption in the late Umayyad or early Abbasid period. Some examples are the [[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress|Al-Ukhaidir Palace]] (775 AD), the Abbasid reconstruction of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Al-Aqsa mosque]] in 780 AD, the [[White Mosque, Ramla|Ramlah Cisterns]] (789 AD), the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] (851 AD), and the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] (879 AD) in Cairo. It also appears in one of the early reconstructions of the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and the Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba in 987 AD. The pointed arch had already been used in Syria, but in the mosque of Ibn Tulun we have one of the earliest examples of its use on an extensive scale, some centuries before it was exploited in the West by the Gothic architects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Islamic Art|last=Rice|first=David T.|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=1979|isbn=9780500201503|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamicartworldo00davi/page/45 45]|url=https://archive.org/details/islamicartworldo00davi/page/45}}</ref>\n\nA kind of [[rib vault]] was also used in Islamic architecture, for example in the ceiling of the [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]]. In Cordoba, the dome was supported by [[pendentives]], which connected the dome to the arches below. The pendentives were decorated with ribs. Unlike the Gothic rib vault, the Islamic ribs were purely decorative; they did not extend outside of the vault, and they were not part of the structure supporting the roof. \n\nThe military and [[Islamic world contributions to Medieval Europe|cultural contacts with]] the [[medieval Islamic world]], including the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] of [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Islamic Sicily]] in 1090, the [[Crusades]] (beginning 1096), and the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic presence in Spain]], may have influenced [[Medieval Europe]]'s adoption of the pointed arch.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Bony|1983|p=17}} Another feature of Gothic architecture, a kind of rib vault, had also earlier appeared in Islamic architecture, and spread to Western Europe via [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]].<ref name=\"Bloom\"/><ref name=Giese-Vogeli>{{cite book|last=Giese-V\u00f6geli|first=Francine|title=Das islamische Rippengew\u00f6lbe : Ursprung, Form, Verbreitung |trans-title=Islamic rib vaults: Origins, form, spread|date=2007|publisher=Gebr.

The dome of the Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba was supported by pendentives, rather than the vault. These were frequently used in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Byzantine architecture]], as in the dome of [[Hagia Sophia]] in Istanbul, which also was supported by pendentives. The Gothic rib vault, among other features, such as the flying buttress, have their antecedents in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] architecture, such as [[Durham Cathedral]], constructed between 1093 and 1096.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Mignon|2015|p=10}}\n\nIn those parts of the [[Western Mediterranean]] subject to Islamic control or influence, rich regional variants arose, fusing Romanesque and later Gothic traditions with [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] decorative forms.

It evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Renaissance architecture]]. Originating in 12th century [[France]] and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as ''{{lang|la|Opus Francigenum}}'' (\"French work\") with the term ''Gothic'' first appearing during the later part of the [[Renaissance]]. \n\nThe defining element of Gothic architecture is the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]]. It is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component. The use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed [[ribbed vault]], the [[flying buttress]] and window tracery.<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 17th edition, p.367, p.524</ref> These elements together formed a structurally and aesthetically integrated system, or style, that characterises the Gothic.<ref>Moffett, Fazio and Wodehouse, p.230</ref>\n\nAt the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that emphasised, internally, verticality in the structural members, and the atmosphere created by the play of light through [[stained glass window]]s.{{sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nGothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great [[cathedral]]s, [[abbey]]s and churches of Europe. It is also the architecture of many [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[town hall]]s, [[Guild|guild halls]], universities and to a less prominent extent, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of Gothic architecture are listed with [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s. \n\nWith the development of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Italy during the mid 15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century. A series of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revivals]] began in mid-18th century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.\n\n==Name==\nGothic architecture was known during the period as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} (\"French/[[Franks|Frankish]] work\") {{sfn|Jones|1999|p=90|ps=: \"The style was widely referred to as {{lang|la|opus francigenum}} - \"[[Franks]]' work\".\"}} and in France as the ''Style Ogivale'' (style with pointed arches).<ref>Bannister Fletcher, p.524</ref>\n\nThe term \"[[Gothic (disambiguation)|Gothic]] architecture\" originated as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term \"barbarous German style\" in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style,<ref name=vas>[[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari, G]]. ''The Lives of the Artists''. Translated with an introduction and notes by J.C. and [[Peter Bondanella|P. Bondanella]]. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]] (Oxford World\u2019s Classics), 1991, pp. 117 & 527. {{ISBN|9780199537198}}</ref> and in the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributes various architectural features to \"the Goths\" whom he holds responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered Rome, and erecting new ones in this style.<ref>Vasari, Giorgio. (1907) ''[https://archive.org/details/vasariontechniqu1907vasa Vasari on technique: being the introduction to the three arts of design, architecture, sculpture and painting, prefixed to the Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects]''. [[Gerard Baldwin Brown|G. Baldwin Brown]] Ed. Louisa S. Maclehose Trans. London: Dent, pp. b & 83.</ref> At the time in which Vasari was writing, Italy had experienced a century of building in the Classical architectural vocabulary revived in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and seen as evidence of a new [[Golden Age]] of learning and refinement. Vasari was echoed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], also of the 16th century, who referred to \"Gotz\" and \"Ostrogotz.\"<ref name=\"Ref_a\">\"Gotz\" is rendered as \"Huns\" in [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s English translation.</ref>\n\nAccording to a 19th-century correspondent in the London Journal ''[[Notes and Queries]]'':\n<blockquote>There can be no doubt that the term 'Gothic' as applied to pointed styles of ecclesiastical architecture was used at first contemptuously, and in derision, by those who were ambitious to imitate and revive the Grecian orders of architecture, after the revival of classical literature. Authorities such as [[Christopher Wren]] lent their aid in deprecating the old medieval style, which they termed Gothic, as synonymous with everything that was barbarous and rude.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 9. 29 December 1849</ref><ref name=\"Ref_c\">[[Christopher Wren]], 17th-century architect of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Description and scope==\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}} \n\nGothic architecture is the architecture of the late medieval period, characterised by use of the pointed arch.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Other features common to Gothic architecture are the rib vault, buttresses, including flying buttresses; large windows which are often grouped, or have tracery; rose windows, towers, spires and pinnacles; and ornate west fronts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs an architectural style, Gothic developed primarily in ecclesiastical architecture,{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} and its principles and characteristic forms were applied to other types of buildings. Buildings of every type were constructed in the Gothic style, with evidence remaining of simple domestic buildings, elegant town houses, grand palaces, commercial premises, civic buildings, castles, city walls, bridges, village churches, abbey churches, abbey complexes and large cathedrals.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe greatest number of surviving Gothic buildings are churches. These range from tiny chapels to large cathedrals, and although many have been extended and altered in different styles, a large number remain either substantially intact or sympathetically restored, demonstrating the form, character and decoration of Gothic architecture. The Gothic style is most particularly associated with the great cathedrals of Northern France, the Low Countries, England and Spain, with other fine examples occurring across Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = The scope of Gothic architecture\n | image1    = Rheinstein crop.jpg\n | width1    = 149\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = [[Rheinstein Castle]], Trechtingshausen, Germany\n | image2    = Kosciol mariacki krakow.jpg\n | width2    = 137\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|Basilica of the Assumption of Mary]], Krak\u00f3w, Poland\n | image3    = St Mary Redcliffe adj sky.jpg\n | width3    = 146\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = [[St Mary Redcliffe|The Parish Church of St Mary Redcliffe]], Bristol, England\n | image4    =Tours Cathedral Saint-Gatian adj.jpg\n | width4    = 139\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = [[Tours Cathedral|The Cathedral of Saint-Gatian]], Tours, France\n | image5    =552SienaPalPubblico.JPG\n | width5    = 157\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The [[Palazzo Pubblico]], Siena, Italy\n | image6    = 27225 Oudenaarde Stadhuis 20 adj.jpg\n | width6    = 152\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = [[Oudenaarde Town Hall]], Oudenaarde, Belgium\n | image7   = San Pablo 20131208b.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      = \n | caption7  = [[Church of San Pablo, Valladolid|Church of San Pablo]], Valladolid, Spain\n }}\n\n==Influences==\n\n===Political===\nAt the end of the 12th century, Europe was divided into a multitude of [[city state]]s and kingdoms. The area encompassing modern Germany, southern Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Slovakia, Czech Republic and much of northern Italy (excluding [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Papal State]]) was nominally part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but local rulers exercised considerable autonomy. [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Denmark]], [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] were independent kingdoms, as was the [[Angevin Empire]], whose [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet kings]] ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] and large domains in what was to become modern France.<ref name=gothicplantagenet>\"L'art Gothique\", section: \"L'architecture Gothique en Angleterre\" by Ute Engel: L'Angleterre fut l'une des premieres r\u00e9gions \u00e0 adopter, dans la deuxi\u00e8me moiti\u00e9 du XIIeme si\u00e8cle, la nouvelle architecture gothique n\u00e9e en France.

[[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] kings brought the Gothic tradition from France to Southern Italy, while [[Lusignan]] kings introduced [[French Gothic]] architecture to Cyprus.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThroughout Europe at this time there was a rapid growth in trade and an associated growth in towns.<ref name=BF>Banister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''.</ref><ref name=JH1/> Germany and the Lowlands had large flourishing towns that grew in comparative peace, in trade and competition with each other, or united for mutual weal, as in the [[Hanseatic League]]. Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride. England and France remained largely [[Feudalism|feudal]] and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings, dukes and bishops, rather than grand town halls for their burghers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Religious===\nThe [[Catholic Church]] prevailed across Western Europe at this time, influencing not only faith but also wealth and power. Bishops were appointed by the feudal lords (kings, dukes and other landowners) and they often ruled as virtual princes over large estates.  The early Medieval periods had seen a rapid growth in monasticism, with several different orders being prevalent and spreading their influence widely. Foremost were the [[Benedictines]] whose great abbey churches vastly outnumbered any others in France and England. A part of their influence was that towns developed around them and they became centres of culture, learning and commerce. The [[Cluniacs|Cluniac]] and Cistercian Orders were prevalent in France, the great monastery at [[Cluny]] having established a formula for a well planned monastic site which was then to influence all subsequent monastic building for many centuries.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1>John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century [[St. Francis of Assisi]] established the [[Franciscans]], or so-called \"Grey Friars\", a mendicant order. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], another mendicant order founded during the same period but by [[St. Dominic]] in [[Toulouse]] and [[Bologna]], were particularly influential in the building of Italy's Gothic churches.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1>John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref> \n\n=== Importance of cathedrals and great churches===\nWhile many secular buildings exist from the Late Middle Ages, it is in the buildings of cathedrals and great churches that Gothic architecture displays its pertinent structures and characteristics to the fullest advantage. A Gothic [[cathedral]] or [[abbey]] was, prior to the 20th century, generally the landmark building in its town, rising high above all the domestic structures and often surmounted by one or more [[tower]]s and pinnacles and perhaps tall [[spire]]s.<ref name=BF/><ref name=Swaan>Wim Swaan, ''The Gothic Cathedral''</ref> Each cathedral served as a regional religious centre for its surrounding diocese, and with the large town churches, was a focus of community and civic pride.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIt is in the architecture of these grand Gothic churches that a unique combination of existing technologies established a new building style. Those technologies were the pointed [[arch]], the [[Rib vault|ribbed vault]], and the [[buttress]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Cathedrals in their cityscapes\n | image1    = Chartres Cathedral 000 sky.JPG\n | width1    = 250\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = [[Chartres Cathedral]], France\n | image2    = Lincoln Cathedral 01 crop.jpg\n | width2    = 240\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = [[Lincoln Cathedral]], England\n | image3    = Duomo from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg\n | width3    = 270\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = [[Florence Cathedral]], Italy<ref>While the engineering and construction of the dome of Florence Cathedral by [[Brunelleschi]] is often cited as one of the first works of the [[Renaissance]], the octagonal plan, ribs and pointed silhouette were already determined in the 14th century.</ref>\n | image4    = 20190204 CharlesBridge 4021 (46746175784).jpg\n | width4    = 272\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = [[Prague Cathedral]], Bohemia<ref>The Gothic south tower is surmounted by a Baroque spire.</ref>\n }}\n\n===Geographic===\nFrom the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style.<ref name=BF/> On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic.<ref name=JH1/>\n\nThe local availability of materials affected both construction and style. In France, [[limestone]] was readily available in several grades, the very fine white limestone of [[Caen]] being favoured for sculptural decoration.  England had coarse limestone and red [[sandstone]] as well as dark green [[Purbeck marble]] which was often used for architectural features.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn Northern Germany, Netherlands, northern Poland, Denmark, and the Baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick. The resultant style, [[Brick Gothic]], is called \"Backsteingotik\" in Germany and Scandinavia and is associated with the Hanseatic League.  In Italy, stone was used for fortifications, but brick was preferred for other buildings. Because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble, many buildings were faced in marble, or were left with undecorated fa\u00e7ade so that this might be achieved at a later date.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe availability of timber also influenced the style of architecture, with timber buildings prevailing in Scandinavia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Availability of timber affected methods of roof construction across Europe. It is thought that the magnificent [[hammer-beam]] roofs of England were devised as a direct response to the lack of long straight seasoned timber by the end of the Medieval period, when forests had been decimated not only for the construction of vast roofs but also for ship building.<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT>Alec Clifton-Taylor, ''The Cathedrals of England''</ref>\n\n\n===Romanesque tradition===\n\nGothic architecture grew out of the previous architectural genre, [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. For the most part, there was not a clean break, as there was to be later in [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] with the revival of the [[Classical style]] in the early 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nBy the 12th century, Romanesque architecture (termed [[Norman architecture]] in England because of its association with the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]]), was established throughout Europe. The important categories of building: the [[cathedral]] church, the [[parish church]], the [[abbey church]], the [[monastery]], the [[castle]], the [[palace]], the [[great hall]], the [[gatehouse]], the [[town hall|civic building]] and the [[warehouse]], had been established in the Romanesque period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nMany architectural features that are associated with Gothic architecture had been developed and used by the architects of Romanesque buildings, particularly in the building of cathedrals and abbey churches.. These include [[ribbed vault]]s, [[buttress]]es, clustered columns, ambulatories, [[Rose window|wheel windows]], spires, stained glass windows, and richly carved door tympana. These were already features of ecclesiastical architecture before the development of the Gothic style, and all were to develop in increasingly elaborate ways.<ref name=NP>Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture''.</ref>\n\nIt was principally the widespread introduction of a single feature, the pointed arch, which was to bring about the change that separates Gothic from Romanesque. This technological change permitted both structural and stylistic change which broke the tradition of massive masonry and solid walls penetrated by small openings, replacing it with a style where light appears to triumph over substance. With its use came the development of many other architectural devices, previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural, aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style. These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture.<ref name=BF/> \n\n===Oriental influence===\nThe pointed arch, one of the defining attributes of Gothic, was employed in Late Roman and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] architecture by the 7th century. In the Roman context it occurred in early church building in Syria and occasional secular structures, like the [[Karamagara Bridge]] in Modern Turkey. In the Sassanid architecture of Iran, parabolic and pointed arches were employed in both palace and sacred construction.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Warren\n | first = John\n | year = 1991\n | title = Creswell's Use of the Theory of Dating by the Acuteness of the Pointed Arches in Early Muslim Architecture\n | periodical = Muqarnas\n | volume = 8\n | pages = 59\u201365 (61\u201363)\n | doi = 10.2307/1523154\n | jstor = 1523154\n | publisher=BRILL\n}}</ref><ref>Petersen, Andrew (2002-03-11).

By the early 12th century the ribbed vaults, characteristic of Gothic architecture, were coming into use. They appeared at the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, France, the [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] in 1120. The ribbed vault over the north transept at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England, built from 1128 to 1133, was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault. Pointed ribbed vaults were used in the chancel of [[Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9]] in 1131.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe three-tiered interior elevation of arcade, gallery and clerestory that is typical of great Gothic churches, was well established in the Norman buildings of England, appearing at [[norwich Cathedral|Norwich]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] and Durham Cathedrals as well as the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen, in France.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOne of the features that unifies the internal appearance of a great Gothic church is the emphasis on vertical elements, in particular attached shafts that pass from the floor to the vault.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} These first appeared in France in the early 11th century in churches that have broad ribs reinforcing a barrel vault. They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England. At Peterborough Cathedral, the polygonal Norman apse has remained, as has three tiers of large Norman windows, now filled with Gothic tracery and 19th century stained glass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The transept ends at Peterborough, Ely and Norwich each have three rows of large Norman windows. This grouping of windows prefigures the clusters of Gothic lancet windows that are found in many English churches such [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Rose window]]s, which are characteristic of the west fronts and transept ends of the cathedrals of France, were in the Romanesque period, common in architecture of Germany, where they appear in various forms at [[Worms Cathedral]], and in Italy where they are either untraceried ocula or wheel windows such as that at the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], Verona. The first rose window above the west portal in France is said to be that at the [[Basilica of Saint Denis|Abbaye Saint-Denis]] 1140. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] is generally cited as the first truly Gothic building, however the distinction is best reserved for the choir, of which the [[ambulatory]] remains intact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Noyon Cathedral]] saw the earliest completion of a rebuilding of an entire French cathedral in the new style from 1150 to 1231.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} While using all those features that came to be known as Gothic, including pointed arches, flying buttresses and ribbed vaulting, the builders continued to employ many of the features and much of the character of Romanesque architecture including round-headed arch throughout the building, varying the shape to pointed where it was functionally practical to do so.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt the Abbey Saint-Denis, [[Sens Cathedral]], Noyon Cathedral, [[Notre Dame de Paris]] and at the eastern end of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England, simple cylindrical columns predominate over the Gothic forms of clustered columns and shafted piers. [[Wells Cathedral]] in England, commenced at the eastern end in 1175, was the first building in which the designer broke free from Romanesque forms. The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic. Wells Cathedral is thus considered the first truly Gothic cathedral.<ref>Cannon, J. 2007. Cathedral: The Great English Cathedrals and the World that Made Them</ref> \n\n<!---Needs icorporating-  The first cathedral in France built entirely in the new style was  [[Sens Cathedral]], begun between 1135 and 1140 and consecrated in 1160.{{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}<ref> ''Le Guide du Patrimoine de France'' (2002) pg. 53</ref>  Sens Cathedral  features a Gothic choir, and six-part rib vaults over the nave and collateral aisles, alternating pillars and doubled columns to support the vaults, and buttresses to offset the outward thrust from the vaults.  One of the builders who is believed to have worked on Sens Cathedral, [[William of Sens]], later traveled to England and became the architect who, between 1175 and 1180, reconstructed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in the new Gothic style. {{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}\n\nSens was quickly followed by  [[Senlis Cathedral]] (begun 1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>  --->\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 4\n | total_width= \n\n | image1    = Ely Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 1766558.jpg\n | width1    = 168\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The south western tower at Ely Cathedral, England\n\n | image2    = Durham.2 crop.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The nave vault with pointed transverse arches at Durham Cathedral\n\n | image3    = Abbaye aux hommes int\u00e9rieur 03.jpeg\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = The sexpartite ribbed vault at Saint Etienne, Caen\n\n | image4    = Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = interior of the [[Cathedral of Cefalu]].\n}}\n\n===Abbot Suger===\nThe eastern end of the [[St Denis Basilica|Basilica Church of Saint-Denis]], built by [[Abbot Suger]] and completed in 1144, is often cited as the first truly Gothic building, as it draws together many of architectural forms which had evolved from the Romanesque and typify the Gothic style.\n\nSuger, friend and confidant of the French Kings, [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], decided in about 1137, to rebuild the great Church of Saint-Denis, attached to an abbey which was also a royal residence. He began with the West Front, reconstructing the original [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] fa\u00e7ade with its single door. He designed the west front of Saint-Denis to be an echo of the Roman [[Triumphal Arch of Constantine|Arch of Constantine]] with its three-part division and three large portals to ease the problem of congestion. The [[rose window]] is the earliest-known example above the West portal in France. The fa\u00e7ade combines both round arches and pointed arches of the Gothic style.\n\nAt the completion of the west front in 1140, Abbot Suger moved on to the reconstruction of the eastern end, leaving the Carolingian nave in use. He designed a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] that would be suffused with light.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">[[Erwin Panofsky]] argued that Suger was inspired to create a physical representation of the Heavenly [[Jerusalem]], although the extent to which Suger had any aims higher than aesthetic pleasure has been called into doubt by more recent art historians on the basis of Suger's own writings.</ref> To achieve his aims, his masons drew on the several new features which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture, the pointed arch, the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the ambulatory with radiating chapels, the clustered columns supporting ribs springing in different directions and the flying buttresses which enabled the insertion of large ''clerestory'' windows.\n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].<ref name=gothicplantagenet/><ref name=JH1/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | perrow    = 6\n | total_width \n | image1    = Saint-Denis - Basilique - Ext\u00e9rieur fa\u00e7ade ouest.JPG\n | width1    = 175\n | height1    = \n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The west front at the Abbey of Saint Denis, with its three deep portals\n | image2    = Basilica Saint Denis ambulatory.JPG\n | width2    = 160\n | height2    = \n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The ambulatory at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|Abbey of Saint-Denis]]\n | image3    = PM 103495 F Sens.jpg\n | width3    = 142 \n | height3   =\n | alt3      = \n | caption3   = The choir of Sens Cathedral \n | image4    = PM 103531 F Sens.jpg\n | width4    = 150 \n | height4   =\n | alt4      = \n | caption4   = The nave of Sens Cathedral \n | image5    = Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG\n | width5    = 155\n | height5    = \n | alt5      = \n | caption5  = The west front at Noyon Cathedral, showing transitional characteristics\n | image6    =Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Noyon)-Abside et ch\u0153ur adjusted.jpg\n | width6    = 155\n | height6    = \n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The interior of Noyon Cathedral\n }}\n\n==Structural elements==\n\n===Pointed arch===\n[[File:Romanesque blind arcading at Christchurch Priory.jpg|thumb|Norman [[Blind arcade|blind-arcading]] at Christchurch Priory, Dorset.]] \n[[File:Equlateral arch.PNG|thumb|right|Equilateral Arch]]\nOne of the defining characteristics of Gothic architecture is the [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arch]].

This latter occurs at [[Durham Cathedral]] in the nave aisles in 1093.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance |title=Architectural Importance |publisher=Durham World Heritage Site |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>  Pointed arches also occur extensively in Romanesque decorative blind arcading, where semi-circular arches overlap each other in a simple decorative pattern, and the points are accidental to the design.\n\nIn Gothic architecture the pointed arch is used in every location where an arch is called for, both structural and decorative. Gothic openings such as doorways, windows, arcades and galleries have pointed arches. Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] above spaces both large and small is usually supported by ribs forming pointed arches. \n\nWhile structurally, use of the pointed arch gave a greater flexibility to architectural form, it also gave Gothic architecture a very different and more vertical visual character to<!---Do not change this to \"than\" again. It is grammatically wrong.---> Romanesque.  Rows of pointed arches upon delicate shafts form a typical wall decoration known as blind arcading. Niches with pointed arches and containing statuary are a major external feature of Gothic cathedrals. The pointed arch also lent itself to elaborate intersecting shapes which developed within window spaces into complex Gothic tracery forming the structural support of the large windows that are characteristic of the style.<ref name=CT/><ref name=NP/> \n\nMany Gothic openings are based upon the [[Equilateral triangle|equilateral]] form. In other words, when the arch is drafted, the [[radius]] is exactly the width of the opening and the centre of each arch coincides with the point from which the opposite arch springs. <small>(See diagram)</small> This makes the arch higher in relation to its width than a semi-circular arch which is exactly half as high as it is wide.<ref name=BF/> The equilateral arch gives a wide opening of satisfying proportion useful for doorways, decorative arcades and large windows.\n\nThe structural beauty of the Gothic arch means that no set proportion had to be rigidly maintained. The equilateral arch was employed as a useful tool, not as a principle of design. This meant that narrower or wider arches were introduced into a building plan wherever necessity dictated. In the architecture of some Italian cities, notably [[Venice]], semi-circular arches are interspersed with pointed ones.<ref name=\"Ref_h\">This does not happen in French or English Gothic and so to the British or French eye, appears to be a strange disregard for style.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Pointed arches\n | image1    = North_Bay_Peterborough_Cathedral.JPG\n | width1    = 171\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = One of three large arches that screen the front of Peterborough Cathedral. \n | image2    = Catedral de Salisbury, Salisbury, Inglaterra, 2014-08-12, DD 35-37 HDR.JPG\n | width2    = 124\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The North transept of Salisbury Cathedral has grouped lancet openings \n | image3    =  Lincoln, Cathedral 20060726 015.jpg \n | width3    = 168\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = LIncoln Cathedral has arades, galleries, clerestory, vault, and blind arcades of pointed arches\n | image4    = Florencia - Firenze - Basilica de Santa Maria Novella - Interior - 01.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = At Santa Maria Novella, the wedge-shaped voussoirs that support the pointed vault are emphasised by colour.  \n | image5    = Wells-Cathedral 9762.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The eastern end of Wells Cathedral evolved in three stages to form a harmonious vista of pointed arches. \n | image6    = Reims Cathedral, exterior (4).jpg\n | width6    = 168\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The west front of Reims Cathedral shows the pointed arches of portals and galleries combined with gables and rose window. \n | image7    = Cathedrale-de-Strasbourg-IMG 4235.jpg\n | width7    = 150\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = A detail of the windows and galleries of the west front of Strasbourg Cahedral \n }}\n\n===Ribbed vault=== \n[[File:Voute.absidale.cathedrale.Paris.png|thumb|Sexpartite ribbed vault at Notre Dame de Paris]]\n\nThe Gothic [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] of pointed arches, unlike the semi-circular vault of Roman and Romanesque buildings, can be used to roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such as [[trapezoids]]. The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs, and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\n===Buttresses=== \n[[File:Strebewerk-2.jpg|thumb|Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over aisles.]] \nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses. The earliest Gothic cathedrals, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses. Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls. The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50\u201351}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Buttresses\n | image1    = \n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = \n | image2    =Lincoln, UK - panoramio (30).jpg\n | width2    = 247\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =  East end of Lincoln Cathedral, with wall buttress, and chapter house with flying buttresses. \n | image3    = Canterbury Cathedral 04.JPG\n | width3    = 245\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Wall buttresses and simple flying buttresses behind a parapet at Canterbury Cathedral\n | image4    = Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg\n | width4    = 247\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The complex buttresses of Amiens Cathedral support one of the highest Gothic vaults \n | image5    = Arri\u00e8re de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris en mars 2014.jpg\n | width5    = 274\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  The east end of Notre Dame de Paris with flying buttresses supporting the high vault\n }}\n\n==Plan, elevation and parts of a Gothic Cathedral== \n===Plan===\n[[File:Cathedral schematic plan en vectorial.svg|thumb|350px|Plan of a Gothic Cathedral]]\nMost large Gothic churches and many smaller parish churches are of the [[Latin cross]] (or \"cruciform\") plan, with a long nave making the body of the church, a transverse arm called the [[transept]] and, beyond it, an extension which may be called the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], chancel or presbytery. There are several regional variations on this plan. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a groundplan by the sturdy piers that support the tower. (see below){{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s. (see plans below). Aisles may extend along the sides of the transepts as well, as at Cologne, [[Amiens Cathedral]] and York Minster.(see plans) In the South of France there is often a single wide nave and no aisles, as at [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]] and [[Albi Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some churches with double aisles, or additional rows of chapels between the buttresses as at [[Notre Dame, Paris]], the transept does not project beyond the aisles (See plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In English cathedrals, transepts tend to project boldly and there may be two of them, as at Salisbury and [[Lincoln Cathedral]]s. The double transepts are to provide extra chapels, in lieu of the apsidal chapels found in French cathedrals (See Salisbury plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In France and Germany, the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  In England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery. It is almost always square ended with a cliff-like exterior face.

This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]])\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestorey]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Roman basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestoreys, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey. This arrangement is usual in England where it can be seen at Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some French Cathedrals, such as Laon and the nave of Rouen, there is a fourth stage, a shallow tribune gallery between the triforium and the clerestorey.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  In the transepts of Notre Dame, the wall above the triforium gallery is pierced with rose windows.  In later Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches, the vertical members in the tracery of galleries and clerestorey may merge into a single decorative unit where the stages are present but not clearly defined, as at Saint Ouen at Rouen and the choir of Gloucester Cathedral in England. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches of Italy, triforium galleries are most often found in churches influenced by the arhitecture of Normandy, and were used at abbeys of women, as a space for the nuns to attend services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Elsewhere, many churches such as Florence Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Santa Maria Novella, had an interior alavation of two stages, the arcade and clerestorey. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = French Gothic elevations\n | image1    = Notre Dame 531 transverse crop rot.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris, showing the nave and double aisles; vault and flying buttresses.\n | image2    =Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | width2    = 183\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Notre Dame de Paris.

One of the best known and most typical of such west fronts is that of Notre Dame de Paris.  To emphasise its importance, the west front may be of a powerful design, with towers, imposing portals, jutting buttresses, gables, windows and an array of sculpture. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCentral to the west front is the main portal, often flanked by additional doors, after the manner of Suger's west front at the Basilica of Saint Denis. In England, the lateral doors may be present but relatively insignificant. In the arch of the central door, particularly in France, the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], is often a significant piece of sculpture, most frequently ''Christ in Majesty'' or ''the [[Last Judgment]]''. If there is a central doorjamb or a [[Trumeau (architecture)|trumeau]], then it frequently bears a statue of Jesus or the ''Madonna and Child'' if the dedication is to Mary.  Figures in niches set into the mouldings around the portals.  \n\nAbove the main portal there is a large window which lights the nave. In France and Spain this is generally a [[rose window]] as at Notre Dame de Paris and [[Burgos Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In Italy there is generally an untraceried ocular window as at Santa Maria Novella.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, rose windows are rare and the west end is generally dominated by a  single very large traceried window as at York Minster and Canterbury, while some Early English fronts retain rows of lancet windows as at Salisbury and [[Ripon Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe west front of most French cathedrals and many English, Spanish and German cathedrals have two towers, which, particularly in France, express an enormous diversity of form and decoration.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JH1/> In Germany and Eastern Europe there may be a single tall tower at the western end as at [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, where the principle tower is usually over the crossing, the west front may be framed by large turrets,{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}   \n\nIn Italy, with the exception of [[Milan Cathedral]], the form of a Gothic west front is less strongly architectonic and sculptural than in other parts of Europe.

See groundplans, above. \n\nIn France the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In many cases the chevet comprises projecting apses, as at the Abbey St Denis and Amiens Cathedral where there are seven. This is also the case at Cologne Cathedral in Germany and Prague Cathedral in the Czech Republic, while Chartres Cathedral has three and the [[Basilica of Saint Anthony]], Padua, had nine radiating square chapels. \n\nIn England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery. The building usually terminates in a square and a cliff-like exterior face as at York Minster and Lincoln Cathedral. Often there is a projecting ''Lady Chapel'', dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], as at Salisbury, Wells, and [[Ripon Cathedral]]s.<ref name=BF/><ref name=NP/><ref name=Swaan/> \n\nIn Italy, the eastern projection beyond the transept is usually a shallow chapel, as at [[Santa Maria Novella]].  At [[Florence Cathedral]] there is a polygonal apse, identical in size and shape to the transepts, radiating from the dome. [[Milan Cathedral]] has a polygonal east end. The Gothic cathedrals at Siena and Orvieto are both constrained by their mountainous sites to have square ends.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}.\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = East end\n | image1    = Bourges Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne Chor 06.jpg\n | width1    = 255\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The east end at Bourges Cathedral has a double ambulatory and small apses\n | image2    =Ely cathedral east end.jpg\n | width2    = 338\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Ely has a square east end in the Early English style and a Decorated Lady Chapel to the right<!---Do not change the upper case D to lower.

The position, construction and height of these towers  is as subject to variety as the nature of the west front, and was already well established by the beginning of the Gothic period. \n\nIn many parts of Europe, the location of twin towers on the west front of cathedrals was usual in the Romanesque period and may be seen at Abbaye les Hommes, Caen; [[Southwell Cathedral]], England; [[Lisbon Cathedral]], Portugal; [[Magdeburg Cathedral]], Germany; [[Cefalu Cathedral]], Sicily, and [[L\u00e9b\u00e9ny]] Abbey Church, Hungary.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Romanesque churches in the Rhineland often had many towers of different shapes, as did the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey Church of Cluny]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In mainland Italy, churches generally had one tower and that was freestanding from the building, sometimes at a distance, as at [[Pisa Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In Norman England, the crossing of large churches was often marked by a large tower, while abbey churches and cathedrals might have western towers as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Smaller churches, across Europe often had a single tower at the west.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The various configurations of church and tower of the Romanesque period continued into the Gothic, but with a greater emphasis on height. \n\nIn France, the plan for the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] called for two towers of equal height on the west front, and this plan was copied during the Gothic era at [Notre-Dame de Paris]], with towers of 69 meters (226&nbsp;ft) in height, and at other cathedrals of northern France such as Laon, Reims and Amiens.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=95\u201398}} Some of these churches were given towers over the crossing and transepts as well, with Rouen having three large towers, Laon having five, and the Romanesque Abbaey les Hommes, Caen, receiving additional towers during the Gothic period, until they numbered nine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  French Gothic towers are sometimes topped with spires.  [[Chartres Cathedral]]  has two on the western towers, of different dates and very different construction. That on the south is the tallest masonry spire of the 12th century, while that on the north is a highly elaborate Flamboyant design. The irregularity seen at Chartres also occurs at Rouen where there is a central tower in addition to the western towers. This tower displays another distinctly French feature, a delicate openwork [[fl\u00e8che]] made of wood covered with lead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nOpenwork spires of stone, sometimes of great height, were popular in the Flamboyant period, occurring singly at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], Burgos Cathedral, Freiburg Cathedral, [[Stefansdom]], Vienna; and also at Cologne Cathedral and Ulm Minster, both designed in the Medieval period but not realised until the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn England, during the Gothic era, there was a continuing fashion for three towers, with the largest being that over the crossing. This arrangement is seen at Canterbury, Wells, Lincoln, York, Lichfield. and Durham Cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, wherever the ground was considered stable, the central tower was surmounted by a spire. Like the south spire of Chartres Cathedral, English spires are often constructed of masonry. The earliest is the comparatively small spire at Oxford Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The tallest Medieval masonry spire is that built in the 13th century at Salisbury Cathedral (123 m - 404 ft).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Others exist at Norwich and [[Chichester Cathedral]]s, while [[Lichfield Cathedral]] has three.  Other cathedrals had tall spires of wooden construction sheathed with lead or copper. Two of these, on the central towers of Lincoln Cathedral and [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] surpassed 550 feet in height and were the tallest structures prior to the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nEngland's Gothic parish churches and collegiate churches generally have a single western tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} A number of the finest churches have masonry spires, with those of St James Church, Louth; St Wulfram's Church, Grantham; St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, and St Michael's, Coventry, all exceeding 85 metres (280 feet) in height.<ref>Julian Flannery, ''Fifty English Steeples: The Finest Medieval Parish Church Towers and Spires in England'', T&H, 2016, 10-0500343144</ref>  \n\nIn mainland [[Italy]], the tower, if present, is sometimes detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], or projects from the side of the building as at the Basilica of Santa Croce. In Italy there is no defined stylistic break between Romanesque and Gothic, as the architects had a seemingly pragmatic approach to the use of round and pointed arches. Towers of apparently Romanesque form often appear in conjunction with otherwise gothic structures. They tend to have graded series of openings in the Romanesque manner like the tower of the [[Badia Fiorentina]].  Some, like the tower at Santa Croce, have large openings of Gothic form and are surmounted by spires.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn addition to towers and spires, great Medieval churches, may have several other architectural forms, rising above the roofline, particularly over the crossing. These include the octagonal tower at Burgos Cathedral, the wooden octagonal tower at Ely Cathedral and the octagonal dome of Florence Cathedral, conceived in the late Gothic period and engineered by the Renaissance architect, Filippo Brunelleschi.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Towers and spires\n\n | image1    = Cathedrale laon facade 2012.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Laon Cathedral- the strongly articulated towers of the west front. \n\n | image2    = Facade cathedral.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Chartres Cathedral- C12th masonry spire, and Flamboyant spire \n\n | image3    = Canterbury-15.jpg\n | width3    = 167\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Canterbury Cathedral - the large tower over the crossing \n\n | image4    = Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg\n | width4    = 140\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rouen Cathedral- three different towers and a lead-covered fleche\n\n | image5    = Spire Cathedral St Stephen Vienna Wien Steffl 1.jpg\n | width5    = 137\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = St Stephan's Cathedral, Vienna- openwork stone spire \n\n | image6    = Lichfield Cathedral.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = Lichfield Cathedral- three masonry spires, the central being taller. \n\n | image7    = 26-Ely-004.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Ely Cathedral- the wooden octagon rises from an octagonal stone tower\n\n | image8    = Badia Fiorentina from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg\n | width8    = 150\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Badia Fiorentina, Florence- tall campanile with spire\n }}\n\n==Architectural character==\n\n===Height===\nA characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. A section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/>\n\nExternally, [[tower]]s and [[spire]]s are characteristic of Gothic churches both great and small, the number and positioning being one of the greatest variables in Gothic architecture. In Italy, the tower, if present, is almost always detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], and is often from an earlier structure. In France and Spain, two towers on the front is the norm. In England, Germany and Scandinavia this is often the arrangement, but an English cathedral may also be surmounted by an enormous tower at the crossing. Smaller churches usually have just one tower, but this may also be the case at larger buildings, such as [[Salisbury Cathedral]] or [[Ulm Minster]], which has the tallest spire in the world,<ref name=\"Ref_g\">The open-work spire was completed in 1890 to the original design.</ref> slightly exceeding that of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the tallest which was actually completed during the medieval period, at {{convert|160|m|ft}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center \n | perrow    = 6\n | header    = Height\n\n| image1    = \u00c9glise Sainte-Marie de L\u00fcbeck.jpg\n | width1   = 175\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = The tallest wood and copper spires, in the world, Lubeck Cathedral, Germany. <small>rebuilt post WWII</small>\n\n | image2    = Lincoln Cathedral, Central Tower.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Lincoln Cathedral- the large central tower, carried the tallest spire in the world \n\n | image3    =  Salisbury Cathedral from West.JPG\n | width3    = 146\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = The tallest spire of the C13th century, and tallest masonry spire ever built, at Salisbury Cathedral. \n\n | image4    = Cathedrale Strasbourg vue generale.jpg\n | width4    = 146\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The openwork spire of Strasbourg Cathedral, the tallest stone spire of the  Gothic era.  \n\n | image5    = Westturm und Hahnent\u00fcrme des Freiburger M\u00fcnsters vom Schlossberg 2.jpg\n | width5    = 164\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = The tallest remaining medieval spire in Germany, at Freiburg Minster \n\n | image6    = Cupola di santa maria del fiore dal campanile di giotto, 02.JPG\n | width6    = 165\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The dome of Florence Cathedral, designed c. 1370, engineered by [[Brunelleschi]], C15th  \n\n | image7    =  London UK Interior-of-Westminster-Abbey-02.jpg \n | width7    = 152\n | alt7      = Photo by CEphoto, Uwe Aranas\n | caption7  =  Westminster Abbey, nave- 31 m (102 ft)\n\n | image8    = 0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (4).JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  =  The choir of Amiens Cathedral, 42.3 m (139 ft)\n\n | image9   = CologneCathedralAltar.jpg\n | width9    = 160\n | alt9      =\n | caption9  = Cologne Cathedral, choir 43.35 m (142.2 ft)\n\n | image10   = Palma LaSeu interior crop.jpg\n | width10    = 155\n | alt10      =\n | caption10  = Le Seu,Palma, Mallorca, nave, 44 m (144 ft)\n\n | image11    = Florenca122.jpg\n | width11    = 174\n | alt11      =\n | caption11  = The nave of Florence Cathedral, 45 m (148 ft)   \n\n | image12    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais, choeur.jpg\n | width12    = 158\n | alt12      =\n | caption12  = The choir of Beauvais Cathedral, 47.5 m (156 ft) \n  }}\n\n\n<!---===Height===\nAn important characteristic of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and in proportion to its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide.

The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated. The roofline, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = \n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened. The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book, [[The Celestial Hierarchy]], was popular among monks in France. Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine. To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/><ref name=Swaan/>\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall. These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs. The windows were very often filled with [[stained glass]] which added a dimension of colour to the light within the building, as well as providing a medium for figurative and narrative art.<ref name=Swaan/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Light\n | image1    =  Flying buttresses of Notre-Dame de Strasbourg.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Large clerestory windows between flying buttresses at Strasbourg\n | image2    = Lyon 5 - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean 03.jpg\n | width2    = 185\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall windows lighting the vault at [[Lyon Cathedral]], made possible by flying buttresses\n | image3    = Chapter House, Wells Cathedral 9 (9317650737).jpg\n | width3    = 185\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Windows in a polygonal arrangement, Lady Chapel, Wells Cathedral\n | image4    = Rouen (24748511178).jpg \n | width4    = 185\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Tall windows in the aisle at Rouen, with additional windows in the triforium   \n | image5    = York Minster, York (14047415195).jpg\n | width5    = 185\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \"Heart of Yorkshire\" window at York Minster, the scale of most west windows in England. \n | image6    = Paris 2019 (31878003887).jpg\n | width6    = 185\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The array of glass between thin stone mullions, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\n }}\n\n\n\n==Evolving styles== \nBetween the dedication of the choir at the Abbey of St Denis, Paris, in 1144 and the completion of [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at Westminster Abbey in 1519, there were nearly 400 years of stylistic development in Gothic architecture. Nowhere was this more manifest that in the building of cathedrals and the great churches of abbeys, colleges and prosperous towns.  \n\nWhile the plan and elevation of the various types of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture remained consistently linked to purpose and to regional preferences, all the other elements developed, generally towards greater complexity, over the decades.  The piers, the arcades, the galleries, the vaults and the portals, all evolved. The evolution was largely linked to and dependent upon the structural and ornamental flexibility of the pointed arch. \n\nThis development is traditionally divided into periods or styles according to the system of the 19th century French archaeologist [[Arcisse de Caumont]].<ref>Banister Fletcher, 17th edition, p. 534</ref> The periods are generally called Early Gothic (1137-1180), High Gothic (1180-1230), Rayonnant Gothic (1230-1350 and Flamboyant Gothic (1350-1530). These terms apply to the Gothic architecture of France and to those countries where the influence of French Gothic spread. These styles did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country.\n\nIn England, the reconstruction of Westminster Abbey and the east end of Canterbury Cathedral were both influenced by French Gothic, with the architect at Canterbury being [[William of Sens]]. Wells Cathedral, however, takes a completely different direction to French Gothic, introducing an unprecedented use of fluted mouldings, and other decorative innovations.  Salisbury Cathedral and the nave of Lincoln are also very different to the French prototypes.  Hence, the styles of English Gothic are referred to as Early English (or Lancet) Gothic (c. 1180\u20131275), Geometric Decorated and Flamboyant Decorated Gothic, (c. 1275\u20131380); and Perpendicular Gothic, (c. 1380\u20131520),  after the system proposed by [[Thomas Rickman]]<ref>Thomas Rickman,  ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315)</ref> \n\nOne of the indicators of style is the nature of the windows and doors, and their decorative treatment.  This is strongly associated with and affected by the type of arches used within the particular building. \nThe Gothic styles, Lancet, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular, affected all the various forms of architectonic decoration within the church- arcading, niches, shrines, wooden panelling, furniture of all sorts, reliquaries, vessels, and vestments.   \n\n===Arches, windows and tracery===\n====Early or Lancet Gothic====\nThe simplest shape of a Gothic window is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet windows may be used singly, as in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, or grouped, as in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral where they are in two in the aisles and threes in the clerestory.  Because large lancet windows, such as those lighting the aisles of a cathedral, may be wide in comparison to a single light in a traceried window, they often have armatures of wood or iron to support the glass.  The arch of a lancet opening is often equilateral, but sometimes is much more acute, and when employed in the arcade of a choir apse, such as at Westminster Abbey, adds to the emphasis of height. \n\nThe simple shape of the lancet arch may appear in Early Gothic buildings on openings of all types, doorways, niches, arcades, including galleries; and belfry openings.   \n\nThe use of lancet windows is found in the Early Gothic architecture of France, at the Abbey of St Denis, Sens and [[Senlis Cathedral]]s. At Chartres and Laon Cathedrals lancet windows are grouped beneath the rose windows. Tall narrow lancets are also found in radiating groups in the chancel apses of some cathedrals, such as Chartres.  It is common in France for lancet windows to be used in smaller, narrowere spaces, such as the chapels of a chevet, while traceries windows are used in the clerestory.  \n\nThe style Lancet Gothic is known in England as Early English Gothic, with Salisbury Cathedral being the prime example. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. <ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>  Wells Cathedral is notable for the continuous rows of lancet openings that make up the triforiun galleries.  \nLancet windows are used extensively in the Gothic churches of Italy, including Florence Cathedral and in the [[Brick Gothic]] churches of Germany and Poland.   \n\n====Geometric Gothic (England)====\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. In France, windows of clerestorys, and other larger windows were commonly divided into two lights, with some simple Geometric tracery above, a circle or a cinquefoil or sexfoil. This style of window remained popular without great change until after 1300\n\nIn England there was a much greater variation in the design of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces. The style is known as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English cathedrals and abbey churches, where both the eastern and the western terminations of the building may be occupied by a single large window such as the east window at Lincoln and the west window at Worcester Cathedral. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches springing from the vertical mullions.<ref name=CT/> \n\n====Rayonnant Gothic==== \nRayonnant Gothic is the term used particularly to described the style that produced the great rose windows of France. These windows deck not only the west fronts of cathedrals, but often, as at Notre Dame de Paris, the transept gables as well. It is common that although the transepts of French Cathedrals do not project strongly, they are given visual importance almsot equal to the west front, including large decorated portals and a rose window.  Particularly fine examples are at Notre Dame  and Chartres Cathedral. \n\n====Flamboyant Gothic====\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point. These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].<ref name=BF/>\n\nSome of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/><ref name=NP/>\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France. They are much rarer in England. A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=JH1/>\n\n====Perpendicular Gothic (England)====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court. There are three very famous royal chapels and one chapel-like Abbey which show the style at its most elaborate: [[King's College Chapel]], [[Cambridge]]; [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]]; [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[Bath Abbey]].<ref name=CT/> However very many simpler buildings, especially churches built during the wool boom in [[East Anglia]], are fine examples of the style.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Styles- Lancet, Early Gothic, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular\n | image1    = Durham Cathedral.jpg\n | width1    = 164\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Lancet Gothic windows,west front, Ripon Cathedral, England\n | image2    = Chartres Cathedral clerestory exterior.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Plate tracery, clerestory window, Chartres Cathedral, France\n | image3    = Ripon Cathedral (7557362580) crop.jpg\n | width3    = 137\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Geometric Decorated tracery, east window, Ripon Cathedral\n | image4    =  Stra\u00dfburger M\u00fcnster, Gro\u00dfe Fensterrose.jpg\n | width4    = 160\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rayonnant Gothic tracery, west rose, Strasbourg Cathedral, France\n | image5    = Amiens France Cath\u00e9drale-Notre-Dame-d-Amiens-03d.jpg\n | width5    = 180\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Flamboyant Gothic tracery, west rose, Amiens Cathedral, France\n | image6    =Limoges curvilinear tracery.JPG\n | width6    = 164\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = [[Flamboyant]] tracery, nave, [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges Cathedral]], France\n | image7    =  Kings College Chapel Cambridge west window.jpg\n | width7    = 160\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Perpendicular Gothic window under 4-centred arch, King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n | image8    = \n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  =  \n }} \n\n===Columns and piers===\n\nIn France, tall untapered columns were common in the Romanesque period. The use of columns of this type was rare in Norman England, where at Durham, Gloucester and Hereford there were massive circular piers built of masonry,  and at Durham, alternating with rectangular piers. \n\nIn Early French Gothic architecture, the columns became much more Classical in shape, proportion and the nature of the capital, which was often a modification of the Corinthian capital.  Columns of this type were used at the Abbey of St Denis, at Sens, at Notre Dame and at Canterbury in England.   In buildings with sexpartite vaults, they sometimes alternated with piers. \n\nIn the [[Brabantine Gothic architecture]] of the Holland and Belgium, columns remained part of the style into the 15th century, and have capitals of cabbage leaf foliage. \n\nIn France, the column developed in complexity by having a cluster of circular shafts grouped around the central circular core. This is seen a Reims, Amiens and Bourges Cathedrals,  and also at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral and in Spain at Burgos Cathedral. \n\nThe rectangular piers also developed, with attached shafts and mouldings which continue up the wall to support the vault, or into the decorative mouldings of the chancel arch, in a manner that had previously been utilised to decorate the arches of Romanesque portals. The eastern end of the Abbey of Saint Etienne, Caen, was rebuilt from 1166, with clustered piers. From 1176, Wells Cathedral was constructed with clustered piers throughout. Between the two buildings there is a great difference in the handling of the two. At Caen, the pier remains a decorated rectangular pier, set parallel to the wall surface. The shafts themselves maintain a circular, and classicising form. At Well, the core of the pier appears to have been rotated, and become a lozenge, angle-on to the lie of the arcade. The clusters of shafts are fluting. The capitals are of what is know as \"stiff-leaf\" foliage, and has a vitality of form different to any other foliage carving of that date. \n\nComplex clustered columns and fluted and shafted piers were subsequently widely adopted, and became part of the vertical visual character of Gothic cathedrals.\n\n===Developments in ribbed vaulting=== \nIn France the vaults over the high spaces of  nave and clerestory, in the Early Gothic period, was sexpartite, spanning two bays of the nave. This resulted in the vaulted space being almost square, and to diagoal ribs being semi-circular. Only the arches of the transverse ribs were pointed.  This is the case at Sens, at Notre Dame de Paris and the Nave of Laon Cathedral. \n\nAt Chartres Cathedral, and the choir of Laon Cathedral, however, the vault is in four parts, spans a single bay, is rectangular, and all the ribs are pointed.  The quadripartite proved much easier to build because it required less centring. It is also stronger as the compartments are smaller.  The quadripartite vault is used in the Early English cathedrals of Salisbury and Wells. It became the standard form of vault which leant itself to further development and elaboration. \n\nIn the nave of Lincoln Cathedral the vault acquired  extra ribs known as \"tiercerons\" which meet at a central \"ridge rib\" running the length of the nave. An additional elaboration, to span the wide nave, was the introduction of intermediate ribs which do not reach the centre of the vault, but join two small \"lierne\" ribs projecting from the ridge.  Other cathedrals with tierceron vaulting are Norwich, and Exeter. \n\nLierne ribs became a feature of later Gothic design, as at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and led the way to elaborate patterns within the vault, including net or \"reticular\" vaulting and \"stellar\" vaulting.  Stellar vaulting was particularly fashionable in Germany, Eastern Europe and Spain.  The use of short ribs leant itself to the introduction of curved and ogee shaped ribs, in the Flamboyant style. Flamboynt vaulting is particularly prevalent in Spain.   \n\nIn England there are a number of chapter house, notably at Wells, Lincoln and Westminster abbey, where the vault is supported by a single central column from which many ribs radiate in every direction like a palm tree. This also occurs at the high vault behind the altar at [[Jacobins Church]], Toulouse, in France. \n\nA further development was many shallow ribs radiating in a fan shape, so that visually, the appearance of the structural ribs is minimised, and the emphasis is upon the curving surfaces. These fan vaults were used successfully for narrower and lower structures such as the cloister at Gloucester Cathedral and the retrochoir at Peterborough, before being employed on the high vaults at the Chapel of Kings College Cambridge, and even even more elaborate form with pendant lanterns attached, at Henry Vii's Chapel at Westminster Abbey. \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Style- Ribbed vaults\n | image1    = B\u00f3veda de catedral de Notre Dame de Par\u00eds 3.jpg\n | width1    = 144\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame, Paris- square, sexpartite vaults spanning two nave bays\n | image2    = Salisbury Cathedral Interior 01.jpg\n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Salisbury Cathedral, England- rectangular quadripartite vault over single bay\n | image3    = Lincoln cathedral 13 Nave vault.jpg\n | width3    = 162\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Lincoln Cathedral, England- quadripartite form, with tierceron ribs and ridge rib with carved bosses. \n | image4    = \n | width4    = 155\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =   \n | image5    = Bremer Dom Juli 2009 PD 060.JPG\n | width5    = 144\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Bremer Cathedral, Germany- north aisle, a reticular (net) vault with intersecting ribs. \n | image6    = Wolfsberg Sankt Marein Pfarrkirche Mariae Himmelfahrt Netzrippengewoelbe 03092014 742.jpg\n | width6    = 144\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = St Marien's, Wolfsberg, Austria- stellar vault with intersecting lierne ribs.  \n | image7    = B\u00f3vedas catedral Salamanca 40.jpg\n | width7    = 162\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Salamanca Cathedral, Spain- vault has Flamboyant S-shaped and circular lierne ribs, \n | image8    = Peterborough Retrochoir fan vaulting.JPG\n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Peterborough Cathedral retrochoir- fan vaulting, which further evolved into pemdant vaulting. \n }}\n\n===Early Gothic architectural elements, 1137-1180 ===  \n\nThese elements are those to be found in the earliest Gothic buildings of France, Abbey, of St Denis, Sens Cathedral, Senlis Cathedral, Noyon Cathedral, and also affected the rebuilding of the choir at Canterbury in Kent, England, after a fire in 1174. \n\n* Pointed arches, often of equilateral projection \n* Continued use of semi-circular arches in conjunction with pointed arches e.g. in vaulting ribs \n* Ribbed vaulting\n* Nave vault sexpartite, spanning two bays \n* Quadripartite ailse vaults, trapezoid where necessary\n* Cylindrical columns, with simplified Corinthian capitals; sometimes with attached cylindrical shafts\n* Internal elevation of four stages: arcade, triforium, tribune (a shallow blind arcade); clerestory \n* The triforium has paired openings under an arch, in the Romanesque manner, but pointed.  \n* Large lancet windows (i.e. untraceried), sometimes with metal armature forming Geometric tracery\n* Rose windows at west front with simple tracery, including plate tracery. \n* Wall buttresses. \n* Three large portals \n* Two towers on west front\n* Columnar figures on jambs of portals \n* Sculptured tympanum \n* Stained glass  \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal \n | header_align = centre\n | header    = Early Gothic \n | image1    = Saint-Denis -

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine. When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], he instructed that the windows in the choir admit as much light as possible.\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of coloured glass were joined together with pieces of lead, and then their surfaces were painted with faces and other details. and then the windows were mounted in the stone frames. Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass.\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Portals and the tympanum===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Saint Denis PM 086190 F.jpg|North portal of [[Basilica of St Denis]], with early [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] and columns made of elongated figures (1135\u20131140)\nFile:Amiens cathedral Tympanumt.JPG|Day of Judgement [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Amiens Cathedral]] (1220\u20131270), the prototype for other high Gothic portals.\nFile:Frontispice cath\u00e9drale Strasbourg.JPG|Portals and tympanum of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] (Begun 1176)\nFile:WestminsterNorth55.jpg|[[Westminster Abbey]] north portal (begun 1245)\n</gallery>\n\nEarly Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir. Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches, richly filled with sculpture. The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], or arch, over each doorway is filled with realistic statues illustrating biblical stories, and the columns between the doors are often also crowded with statuary. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe iconography of the sculptural decoration on the facade was not left to the artists. An edict of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 had set the rules: \"The composition of religious images is not to be left to the inspiration of artists; it is derived from the principles put in place by the Catholic Church and religious tradition. Only the art belongs to the artist; the composition belongs to the Fathers.\"{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=79}}\n\nThe portals and interiors were much more colourful than they are today. Each sculpture on the tympanum and in the interior was painted by the ''peintre imagier'', or image painter, following a system of colours codified in the 12th century; yellow, called ''gold'', symbolized intelligence, grandeur and virtue; white, called ''argent'', symbolized purity, wisdom, and correctness; black, or ''sable'', meant sadness, but also will; green, or ''sinople'', represented hope, liberty and joy; red or ''gueules'' (see [[gules]]) meant charity or victory; blue or ''azure'' symbolized the sky, faithfulness and perseverance; and violet, or ''pourpre'', was the colour of royalty and sovereignty.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=54}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chartres2006 076.jpg|Statues of Saints are literally \"pillars of the church\", supporting the portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]].\nFile:Paris - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame - Portail de la Vierge - PA00086250 - 003.jpg|The martyr Saint [[Denis]], holding his head, over the Portal of the Virgin ([[Notre-Dame de Paris]])\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris - Portail du Jugement dernier - d\u00e9tail 01.jpg|The serpent tempts Adam and Eve; part of the [[Last Judgement]] on the central portal of west facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:DevilCentralGateNotreDameParis.jpg|[[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] and Satan weighing souls during the [[Last Judgement]] ([[Notre-Dame de Paris]] central portal, west facade)\nFile:Chimera of Notre-Dame de Paris, 26 April 2014.jpg|A [[strix (mythology)|stryge]] on west facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Notre-Dame Rzygacze.JPG|[[Gargoyles]] were the rainspouts of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Gargoyle Point of View (3575829233).jpg|[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] on [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] west facade\nFile:H\u00f4tel de ville de Bruxelles - Gargouille 01.JPG|[[Gargoyle]] on [[Brussels Town Hall]]\nFile:Gargoyles and Saints - Siena Cathedral.jpg|Gargoyle on [[Siena Cathedral]] (13th century)\nFile:Labyrinthchartres.jpg|[[Labyrinth]] at [[Chartres Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read. They were described as \"Books for the poor.\" To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the facades was originally painted and gilded.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e9ne, ''Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI siecle'', Volume 6. (Project Gutenburg).</ref>\n\nEach feature of the Cathedral had a symbolic meaning. The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each Saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The strix appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.<ref name=fasti>Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131\u2013,{{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.</ref> They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nThe [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre-Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration. Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==French Gothic==\n{{Main|French Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFranceNormandieCoutancesCathNotreDameFacade.jpg|[[Coutances Cathedral]] in Normandy (1210\u20131274)\nP1240007 Bayeux cathedrale ND rwk.jpg|[[Bayeux Cathedral]] in Normandy (1180\u20131350)\nNef de la cath\u00e9drale d'Auxerre.jpg|Interior of [[Auxerre Cathedral]] in Burgundy (1215\u20131233)\nAlbi Sainte-C\u00e9cile.JPG|[[Albi Cathedral]], originally begun as a fortress, in Southwest France (1282\u20131480)\nNave of the Ste C\u00e9cile Cathedral - 2014-02-22.jpg|Polychrome interior of [[Albi Cathedral]] (1282\u20131480)\nFile:Fa\u00e7ade de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Toulouse.jpg|[[Toulouse Cathedral]] (13th century)\nPalmier des Jacobins.JPG|The Palm Tree of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]], 28 meters high ([[Toulouse]], 1292)\n</gallery>\n\nFrom the 12th century onwards, the Gothic style spread from Northern France to other regions of France and gradually to the rest of the Europe. It was often carried by the highly skilled craftsmen who had trained in the Ile-de-France and then carried their crafts to other cities. The style was adapted to local styles and materials.\n\nIn [[Normandy]], the new naves were usually very long, sometimes more than one hundred meters, and, from the long Romanesque tradition, the walls were thicker than in northern France, and had shorter buttresses. The interiors were narrower than in the north, and were given a strong sense of verticality by long and narrow bays and lancet arches. Rose windows were rare, replaced on the exterior by a large bay in ''tiers point''. The facades had less sculptural decoration; decoration in the interior was largely in geometric forms. Norman Gothic also usually featured a profusion of towers, lanterns and [[spire]]s; spires and [[Fl\u00e8che|spirelets]] sometimes were seventy meters high. [[Bayeux Cathedral]], [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Coutances Cathedral]] are notable examples of Norman Gothic.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n\nIn [[Burgundy]], which had a long [[Romanesque style]] tradition, a [[lantern tower]] was often included, and cathedrals often had a narrow passage the length of the cathedral at the level of the stained glass windows. as in [[Auxerre Cathedral]].\n\nIn the Southwest of France, the walls were thicker, with narrow openings, and doubled with arches. The flying buttress was rarely used, replaced by heavy [[abutment]]s with chapels between.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n\nThe south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. The Gothic cathedrals were often built with brick and tile rather than stone. They generally had thick walls and narrow windows, and were braced by heavy abutments rather than flying buttresses. The form of the tower of [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|the basilica of Saint-Sernin]] was copied by several cathedrals in the south, while the old nave of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] (1210\u20131220) gave the model of the single nave which was generally used in Southern French Gothic architecture (although some churches had two or three naves of equal height). Some Gothic cathedrals in the [[Southern France|Midi]] took unusual form; the [[Cathedral of Albi]] (1282\u20131480) was originally built as fortress, then converted to a cathedral. Albi Cathedral has another very distinctive feature; a colourful interior and painted ceiling.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}} In the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] of [[Toulouse]], the grafting of a single apse of polygonal plan on a church with two vessels gave birth to a starry vault whose complex organization anticipated more than a century on the Flamboyant Gothic. Tradition refers to this masterpiece as \"palm tree\", because the veins gush out of the smooth shaft of the column-like palm trees.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1337/ | title=Episcopal City of Albi}}</ref>\n\nThe facade of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] is unusual; it is the combination of two unfinished cathedral buildings, begun in the 13th century and finally put together. Toulouse Cathedral has no flying buttresses; it is supported by massive ''contreforts'' the height of the building, with chapels between.\n\n==English Gothic==\n{{Main|English Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir 2, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|12th century choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] ([[Early English Gothic]])\nFile:Salisbury Cathedral Choir, Wiltshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|Choir of [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131258) ([[Early English Gothic]])\nFile:YorkMinsterWest.jpg|West front of [[York Minster]] ([[Decorated Gothic]])\nFile:Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|[[Gloucester Cathedral]] ([[Perpendicular Gothic]]) (1351\u20131377)\nFile:Westminster abbey16.jpg|Fan vaults with pendants at the [[Henry VII Chapel]] of [[Westminster Abbey]] ([[Perpendicular Gothic]]) (1503)\n</gallery>\n\nThe Gothic style was imported very early into England, in part due to the close connection with the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which until 1204 was still ruled by the Kings of England. The first period is generally called [[early English Gothic]], and was dominant from about 1180 to 1275. The first part of major English cathedral to feature the new style was the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], begun about 1175. It was created by a French master builder, [[William of Sens]]. He added several original touches, including coloured marble pavement, double columns in the arcades, and engaged slender ''colonettes'' which reached up to the vaults, borrowed from the design of [[Laon Cathedral]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=34\u201335}} [[Westminster Abbey]] was rebuilt from 1245 to 1517. [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220\u20131320) is also a good example of early Gothic, with the exception of its tower and spire, which were added in 1320.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe second period of English Gothic is known as [[Decorated Gothic]]. It is customarily divided into two the \"Geometric\" style (1250\u201390) and the \"Curvilinear\" style (1290\u20131350), and it is similar to the French [[Rayonnant]] style, with an emphasis on curvilinear forms, particularly in the windows. This period saw detailed stone carving reach its peak, with elaborately carved windows and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], often with floral patterns, or with an accolade, a carved arch over a window decorated with pinnacles and a [[fleuron (architecture)|fleuron]], or carved floral element.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe rib vaults of the Decorated Gothic became extremely ornate, with a profusion of ribs that were purely ornamental. The vaults were often decorated with hanging stone pendants. The columns also became more ornamental, as at Peterborough Cathedral, with ribs spreading upward.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe [[Perpendicular Gothic]] (c. 1380\u20131520) was the final phase of English Gothic, lasting into the 16th century. As the name suggests, its emphasis was on clear horizontal and vertical lines, meeting at right angles. Columns extended upwards all the way to the roof, giving the interior the appearance of a cage of glass and stone, as in the nave of [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The [[Tudor Arch|Tudor arch]] appeared, wider and lower and often framed by [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], which was used to create larger windows and to balance the strong vertical elements. The design of the rib vaults became even more complex, including the [[fan vault]] with pendants used in the Henry VII chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]] (1503\u201307).{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\nA distinctive characteristic of English cathedrals is their extreme length, and their internal emphasis upon the horizontal, which may be emphasised visually as much or more than the vertical lines. Each English cathedral (with the exception of Salisbury) has an extraordinary degree of stylistic diversity, when compared with most French, German and Italian cathedrals. It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity. Unlike French cathedrals, English cathedrals sprawl across their sites, with double transepts projecting strongly and [[Lady chapel]]s tacked on at a later date, such as at Westminster Abbey. In the west front, the doors are not as significant as in France, the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch. The West window is very large and never a rose, which are reserved for the transept gables. The west front may have two towers like a French cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower at the crossing and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire. The distinctive English east end is square, but it may take a completely different form. Both internally and externally, the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings, particularly the capitals.<ref name=BF/><ref name=CT/>\n\n==Northern European Gothic==\n{{See also|Architecture of Germany|Brabantine Gothic|Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic architecture in Lithuania|Polish Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Kdom.jpg|Rear of [[Cologne Cathedral]], [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] (1248\u20131473)\nFile:Matthias Church Budapest Corrected.jpg|[[Matthias Church]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (11th\u201315th centuries)\nFile:Saint Wenceslas Chapel, St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague 20160809 1.jpg|St. Wenceslas Chapel in [[St. Vitus Cathedral|Prague Cathedral]], [[Czech Republic]] (1356\u20131367)\nFile:Wien - Stephansdom (1).JPG|[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]], [[Austria]] (1339\u20131365)\nFile:20110917 Krakow Kosciol Mariacki 0306.jpg|[[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]] (1290\u20131365)\nFile:Haarlem bavo inside.jpg|[[Brabantine Gothic]] [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]] in [[Netherlands]] (c. 1479)\n</gallery>\n\nBetween the 13th and 16th centuries, Gothic cathedrals were constructed in most of the major cities of northern Europe. For the most part, they followed the French model, but with variations depending upon local traditions and the materials available. The first Gothic churches in Germany were built from about 1230. They included [[Liebfrauenkirche, Trier|Liebfrauenkirche]] ( ca. 1233\u20131283) in [[Trier]], claimed to be the oldest Gothic church in Germany,<ref>{{Cite web|author=UNESCO|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/367|title=UNESCO Cultural Heritage Sites; Liebfrukirche, Trier}}</ref> and [[Freiburg Cathedral]], which was built in three stages, the first beginning in 1120, though only the foundations of the original cathedral still exist. It is noted for its 116-metre tower, the only Gothic church tower in Germany that was completed in the Middle Ages (1330).\n\n[[Prague]], in the region of [[Bohemia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was another flourishing centre for Gothic architecture. [[Charles IV of Bohemia]] was both King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, and he had monumental tastes. He began construction of Prague's [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in the Gothic style in 1344, as well as a Gothic palace, [[Karl\u0161tejn|Karlstein Castle]] in Central Bohemia, and Gothic buildings for the new [[Charles University|University of Prague]]. The nave of [[Prague Cathedral]] featured the filet vault, a decorative type of vault in which the ribs criss-crossed in a mesh pattern, similar to the vaults of [[Bristol Cathedral]] and other English churches. His other Gothic projects included the lavishly decorated Chapel of the Holy Cross inside [[Karl\u0161tejn|Karlstein Castle]] (1357\u20131367), and the choir of [[Aachen Cathedral]] begun in 1355, which was built on the model of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=221\u2013230}} Gothic architecture in Germany and the kingdoms of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] generally followed the French formula, but the towers were much taller and, if completed, were often surmounted by enormous openwork spires. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is their breadth and openness. German and Czech cathedrals, like the French, tend not to have strongly projecting transepts. There are also many [[hall church]]es (''Hallenkirchen'') without [[clerestory]] windows.<ref name=BF/><ref name=Swaan /> [[Cologne Cathedral]] is after [[Milan Cathedral]] the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. Construction began in 1248 and took, with interruptions, until 1880 to complete&nbsp;\u2013 a period of over 600 years. It is 144.5 metres long, 86.5&nbsp;m wide and its two towers are 157&nbsp;m tall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/interessantes/interesting-issues/?L=1|title=K\u00f6lner Dom|website=www.koelner-dom.de|access-date=27 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417123118/https://www.koelner-dom.de/interessantes/interesting-issues/?L=1|archive-date=17 April 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Brick Gothic]] ({{Lang-de|Backsteingotik}}, {{Lang-pl|Gotyk ceglany}}) is a specific style common in [[Northern Europe]], especially in Northern Germany, Poland and in the regions around the [[Baltic Sea]] without natural rock resources.

Another regional variation is the [[Brabantine Gothic]] a style found in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is characterized by using light-coloured [[sandstone]] or limestone, which allowed rich detailing but was prone to erosion. Features included columns with sculpted cabbage-like foliage, arched windows whose points came right up into the vaults. and, sometimes, a wooden ceiling. Examples include [[Grote Kerk, Haarlem]], in [[Haarlem]], the Netherlands, originally built as a Catholic cathedral, now a Protestant church, and the [[Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon]] in Brussels (15th century).\n\n==Southern European Gothic==\n===Spain and Portugal===\n{{Main|Spanish Gothic architecture|Portuguese Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Catedral G\u00f3tica de Le\u00f3n.jpg|[[Le\u00f3n Cathedral]] (1205\u20131472)\nFile:KathedraleToledo.jpg|[[Toledo Cathedral]] (1227\u20131493)\nFile:Fachada de la Catedral de Burgos.jpg|[[Burgos Cathedral]] (1221\u20131260)\nFile:Catedral_de_Valencia,_Valencia,_Espa%C3%B1a,_2014-06-29,_DD_16.JPG|[[Valencia Cathedral]] (13th\u201315 c.)\nFile:Sevilla Cathedral - Southeast.jpg|[[Seville Cathedral]]\nFile:Karinecyril evora cathedrale2.JPG|[[Evora Cathedral]], [[\u00c9vora]], Portugal (1280\u20131340)\nFile:Evora53.jpg|Gothic nave of [[\u00c9vora Cathedral]], Portugal, leads to a [[Baroque]] chapel (1280\u20131340)\n</gallery>\n\nStrikingly different variations of the Gothic style appeared in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Important examples of Spanish Gothic include [[Toledo Cathedral]], [[Le\u00f3n Cathedral]], and [[Burgos Cathedral]].\nThe distinctive characteristic of Gothic cathedrals of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is their spatial complexity, with many areas of different shapes leading from each other. They are comparatively wide, and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories, giving a similar spacious appearance to the ''Hallenkirche'' of Germany, as at the Church of the [[Batalha Monastery]] in Portugal. Many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels. Like English cathedrals, each is often stylistically diverse. This expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources. Among the influences on both decoration and form are [[Islamic architecture]] and, towards the end of the period, Renaissance details combined with the Gothic in a distinctive manner. The West front, as at Leon Cathedral, typically resembles a French west front, but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces. At [[Burgos Cathedral]] there are spires of German style. The roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles. There are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof.<ref name=BF/> [[Church of San Pablo, Valladolid|Church of San Pablo]] in [[Valladolid]] is an outstanding example of construction that combines the [[Isabelline Gothic]] style (a local adaptation of the Gothic style) with the [[Renaissance architecture]].<!---DO NOT CHANGE. READ DISCUSSION PAGE--->\n\nIn the territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]] (Aragon, Catalonia, [[Roussillon]] in France, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Valencian Community]], among others in the Italian islands), the Gothic style suppressed the transept and made the [[Aisle#Church architecture|side-aisles]] almost as high as the main nave, creating wider spaces, and with few ornaments. There are two different Gothic styles in the Aragonese lands: [[Catalan Gothic]] and [[Valencian Gothic]], which are different from those in the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and France.\n\nThe most important samples of Catalan Gothic style are the cathedrals of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], [[Perpignan]] and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] (in [[Mallorca]]), the basilica of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] (in Barcelona), the [[Santa Maria del Pi, Barcelona|Bas\u00edlica del Pi]] (in Barcelona), and the church of [[Santa Maria, Manresa|Santa Maria de l'Alba]] in [[Manresa]].\n\nThe most important examples of Valencian Gothic style in the old [[Kingdom of Valencia]] are the [[Valencia Cathedral]], [[Llotja de la Seda]] (Unesco World Heritage site), [[Torres de Serranos]], Torres de Quart, [[Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba]], in [[Alfauir]], [[Palace of the Borgias]] in [[Gandia]], [[Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Valldigna]], [[Basilica of Santa Maria, Alicante|Basilica of Santa Maria]], in [[Alicante]], [[Orihuela Cathedral]], [[Castell\u00f3 Cathedral]] and [[El Fadr\u00ed]], [[Segorbe Cathedral]], etc.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Italian Gothic architecture|Venetian Gothic architecture}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Duomo di Siena, April 2017.jpg|[[Siena Cathedral]] (1215\u20131263)\nFile:Toscana Siena4 tango7174.jpg|Interior of [[Siena Cathedral]] (1215\u20131263)\nFile:Facciata del Duomo di Orvieto.JPG|[[Orvieto Cathedral]] (1290\u20131591)\nFile:Interno duomo Orvieto.jpg|Nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] (begun 1290)\nFile:GPisano-PulpitoPisa background blurred.JPG|Pulpit of [[Pisa Cathedral]], by [[Giovanni Pisano]] (1302\u20131310)\nFile:Toscana Pisa11 tango7174.jpg|[[Santa Maria della Spina]] (about 1323)\nFile:Milan Cathedral from Piazza del Duomo.jpg|[[Milan Cathedral]] (1386\u20131510 \u2013 facade from 19th century)\nFile:Photograph of of the Doges Palace in Venice.jpg|[[Doges Palace]] (1424\u20131442)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Italian Gothic architecture]] went its own particular way, departing from the French model. It was influenced by other styles, notably the [[Byzantine style]] introduced in [[Ravenna]]. Major examples include [[Milan Cathedral]], the [[Orvieto Cathedral]], and particularly [[Florence Cathedral]], before the addition of the Duomo in the Renaissance.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=62}}\n\nThe Italian style was influenced by the materials available in the different regions; [[marble]] was available in great quantities in [[Tuscany]], and was lavishly used in churches; it was scarce in [[Lombardy]], and brick was used instead. But many of the architectural elements were used apparently mainly to be different from the French style.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=147}}\n\nThe [[Cistercian]] monastic order introduced some of the first Gothic churches into Italy, in [[Fossanova Abbey]] (consecrated 1208) and the [[Casamari Abbey]] (1203\u20131217). They followed the basic plan of the Gothic Cistercian churches of [[Burgundy]], particularly [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]].{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=148}}\n\nThe Italian plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of \"''armon\u00eca''\", and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Italian Gothic cathedrals often retained Romanesque features; the nave of [[Orvieto Cathedral]] had Romanesque arches and vaults.\n\nItalian cathedrals also offered a variety of plans; Florence Cathedral (begun 1246) had a rectangular choir, based on the Cistercian model, but was designed to have three wings with polygonal chapels. Italian Gothic cathedrals were generally not as tall as those in France; they rarely used flying buttresses, and generally had only two levels, an arcade and a ''claire-voie'' with small windows; but [[Bologna Cathedral]] (begun in 1388), rivalled [[Bourges Cathedral]] in France in height. The smallest notable Italian Gothic church is [[Santa Maria della Spina]] in [[Pisa]] (about 1330), which resembles a Gothic jewel box.{{sfn|Martindale|1993|p=148}}\n\nA distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration, both externally as marble veneer on the brick fa\u00e7ade and internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments. The columns were sometimes painted red, and the walls were decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic. Italian cathedral fa\u00e7ades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors. The fa\u00e7ades have projecting open porches and ocular or wheel windows rather than roses, and do not usually have a tower. The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome. There is often a free-standing tower and baptistery. The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the [[fresco]].<ref name=BF/> The facade of Orvieto Cathedral, begun in 1310, is a striking example of mosaic decoration. Another innovation of Italian Gothic is the bronze doorway covered with sculpture; the most famous examples are the doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]] by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330\u20131336).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=161\u2013175}}\n\nItalian Gothic cathedrals did not have the elaborate sculptural tympanums over the entrances of French cathedrals, but they had abundant realistic sculptural decoration. Some of the finest work was done by [[Nicola Pisano]] at the [[Pisa Baptistery]] (1259\u201360) and in [[Siena Cathedral]], and by his son [[Giovanni Pisano]] on the west facade of [[Pisa Cathedral]] (1284\u201385).{{sfn|Martindale|1993|pp=152\u2013176}}\n\n==Gothic in the Colonial Americas==\n{{See also|Mendicant monasteries in Mexico}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Bas\u00edlica Menor de Santa Mar\u00eda CCSD 07 2017 4676.jpg|[[Basilica Cathedral of Santa Mar\u00eda la Menor]] (1514-1541) in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic<ref name=\"whc.unesco.org\"/><ref name=\"5albemarleway.co.uk\"/>\nFile:SacristyCathedralDF.JPG|A Gothic vault in the sacristy of the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]] (started to built in 1573)<ref name=\"catedralmetropolitanademexico.mx\"/>\nFile:Palacio de Cort\u00e9s 2017.jpg|[[Palace of Cort\u00e9s, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cort\u00e9s]] (1523-1528) in Cuernavaca, Mexico, this palace has a style that blends Gothic and [[Mud\u00e9jar art|Mud\u00e9jar]]<ref name=\"Routledge\"/><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\nFile:20090405-182346- eglise du couvent saint gabriel -modifi\u00e9e-.jpg|[[San Gabriel Franciscan Convent, Cholula|San Gabriel Franciscan Convent]] in [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], Metropolitan area of Puebla City, Mexico, it is partially Gothic (built in the mid-16th century)<ref name=\"lonelyplanet.com/mexico\"/><ref name=\"inafed.gob.mx\"/>\nFile:Templo y convento de San Mateo Ap\u00f3stol.JPG|[[Earliest 16th-century monasteries on the slopes of Popocat\u00e9petl|Convent of San Mateo Ap\u00f3stol y Evangelista]] (1535-1567)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rosademaria.wordpress.com/2016/10/05/ex-convento-agustino/|title=Ex Convento Agustino|website=rosademaria.wordpress.com|date = 5 October 2016|language = Spanish}}</ref> in [[Atlatlahucan]], Mexico, is a late-Gothic [[Plateresque]] church that is a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]<ref name=\"list/702\"/>\n</gallery>\nThere are late-Gothic architecture from the era in some of the oldest Christian churches built in the Americas.

The H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Compi\u00e8gne]] has an imposing gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate [[Accolade (architecture)|accolades]] or ornamental arches. Similarly flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and in modern Belgium, in [[Brussels]] and [[Ghent]] and [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p=64}}\n\nNotable Gothic civil architecture in Spain includes the [[Llotja de la Seda|Silk Exchange]] in [[Valencia]], Spain (1482\u20131548), a major marketplace, which features a main hall with twisting columns beneath its vaulted ceiling. Another Spanish Gothic landmark is the [[Palace of the Kings of Navarre of Olite|Palace of the Kings of Navarre]] in [[Olite]] (1269\u20131512), which combining the features of a palace and a fortress.\n\n===University Gothic===\n{{See also|Collegiate Gothic}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nFile:Karolinum ark DSCN2206.JPG|Gothic oriel window of [[Karolinum|Collegium Carolinum]] of [[Charles University|Prague University]] (around 1380)\nFile:Fachada de la Universidad de Salamanca.jpg|Facade of the [[University of Salamanca]] in late Gothic [[Plateresque]] style (late 15th century)\nFile:Krak\u00f3w - Collegium Maius - Dziedziniec 02.jpg|Cloister of [[Collegium Maius]] in [[Krakow]], Poland (late 15th century)\nFile:King's College Chapel, Cambridge 15.JPG|Chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]] (1446\u20131544)\nFile:Magdalen College Oxford 20040613.jpg|Tower and cloisters of [[Magdalen College]], [[Oxford]] (1474\u20131480)\n</gallery>\nThe first universities in Europe were closely associated with the Catholic church, and in the late 15th century they adapted variations of the Gothic style for their architecture. The Gothic style was adapted from English monasteries for use in the first colleges of [[Oxford University]], including [[Magdalen College]]. It was also used at the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain. The use of the late Gothic style at Oxford and [[Cambridge University]] inspired the picturesque Gothic architecture in U.S. colleges in the 19th and 20th century.\n\nBy the late Middle Ages university towns had grown in wealth and importance as well, and this was reflected in the buildings of some of Europe's ancient universities. Particularly remarkable examples still standing nowadays include the [[Collegio di Spagna]] in the [[University of Bologna]], built during the 14th and 15th centuries; the [[Karolinum|Collegium Carolinum]] of the [[Charles University in Prague]] in Bohemia; the [[University of Salamanca|Escuelas mayores]] of the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain; the chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge]]; or the [[Collegium Maius]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.\n\n==Military architecture==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chateau-de-Vincennes-donjon.jpg|Donjon of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]], begun 1337\nCarcasonneouterwall.jpg|Restored outer walls of the medieval city of [[Carcassonne]] (13th\u201314th century)\nFile:Chateau.Louvre.png|The Louvre in the time of [[Charles V of France]] (1338\u20131380) drawn by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]\nFile:2012.05.12 MALBORK (4).JPG|[[Malbork Castle]] in Poland (13th century)\nFile:Exterior Alcazar Segovia.jpg|[[Alcazar of Segovia]] (12th\u201313th centuries)\nFile:Burg Hohenzollern.JPG|[[Hohenzollern Castle]] (1454\u20131461) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], southern Germany\n</gallery>\n\nIn the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]]. The new kind of fortification was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the centre, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), pg. 38</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337\u20131453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=38}}\n\n==Decline==\nBeginning in the 16th century, as [[Renaissance architecture]] from Italy began to appear in France and other countries in Europe, the dominance of Gothic architecture began to wane. Nonetheless, new Gothic buildings, particularly churches, continued to be built; new Gothic churches built in Paris in this period included [[Saint-Merri]] (1520\u20131552); and [[Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois]]; The first signs of classicism in Paris churches, at [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]], did not appear until 1540. The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532\u20131560), rivalled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high. As construction of this church continued, elements of Renaissance decoration, including the system of classical orders of columns, were added to the design, making it an early Gothic-Renaissance hybrid.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nThe Gothic style began to be described as outdated, ugly and even barbaric. The term \"Gothic\" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description. [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term \"barbarous German style\" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style.{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} In the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to \"[[Goths|the Goths]]\" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}} In the 17th century, [[Moli\u00e8re]] also mocked the Gothic style in the 1669 poem ''La Gloire'': \"...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...\"{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=9}} The dominant styles in Europe became in turn [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], [[Baroque architecture]], and the grand classicism of the [[Louis XIV style]].\n\nNonetheless, Gothic architecture, usually churches or university buildings, continued to be built. Ireland was an island of Gothic architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the construction of [[St Columb's Cathedral|Derry Cathedral]] (completed 1633), [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Sligo|Sligo Cathedral]] (c. 1730), and [[Down Cathedral]] (1790\u20131818) are other notable examples.<ref>{{cite web|first =Bob|last = Hunter |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/plantation/transcripts/pa01_t06.shtml |title =Londonderry Cathedtral| publisher = BBC|website =Wars & Conflict: The Plantation of Ulster|date = 18 September 2014}}</ref> In the 17th and 18th century several important Gothic buildings were constructed at [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]], including [[Tom Tower]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], by [[Christopher Wren]] (1681\u201382) It also appeared, in a whimsical fashion, in [[Horace Walpole]]'s [[Twickenham]] [[villa]], [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]] (1749\u20131776) The two western towers of [[Westminster Abbey]] were constructed between 1722 and 1745 by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], opening a new period of [[Gothic Revival]].\n\n==Survival, rediscovery and revival==\n{{main|Gothic Revival architecture}}\n\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Big Ben 1 2012-07-03.jpg|[[Big Ben|Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben)]] (completed in 1859) and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London (1840\u20131876)\n\n</gallery>\n\nIn England, partly in response to a philosophy propounded by the [[Oxford Movement]] and others associated with the emerging revival of 'high church' or [[Anglo-Catholic]] ideas during the second quarter of the 19th century, neo-Gothic began to become promoted by influential establishment figures as the preferred style for ecclesiastical, civic and institutional architecture. The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of medieval architecture turned to technical consideration. London's Palace of Westminster, St. Pancras railway station, New York's Trinity Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral are also famous examples of Gothic Revival buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gothic-architecture|title=Gothic Architecture and Churches {{!}} Architectural Digest|website=Architectural Digest|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> Such style also reached the [[Far East]] in the period, for instance, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[St. John's Cathedral (Hong Kong)|St. John's Cathedral]] which was located at the centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]].\n<!--- Need to read this through \n==Influences==\n\n===Romanesque and Norman influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Durham Cathedral.

The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).
