{"title_page": "History of rail transportation in the United States", "text_new": "[[File:69workmen.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was completed in 1869.]]\n: ''This article is part of the [[history of rail transport by country]] series.''\n\nWooden railroads, called wagonways, were built in the [[History of the United States|United States]] starting from the 1720s. A railroad was m used in the construction of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] fortress at [[Louisburg, Nova Scotia]], in [[New France]] (now [[Canada]]) in 1720. Between 1762 and 1764, at the close of the [[French and Indian War]] (1756\u20131763), a [[gravity railroad]] ([[tramway (industrial)|mechanized tramway]]) ([[Montresor's Tramway]]) is built by [[British Army|British military engineers]] up the steep riverside terrain near the [[Niagara River]] waterfall's [[escarpment]] at the [[Niagara Portage]]  (which the local [[Seneca people|Seneca]]s called ''\"Crawl on All Fours.\"'') in [[Lewiston, New York]].\n\nRailroads played a large role in the development of the [[United States]] from the [[industrial revolution]] in the [[Northeastern United States|North-east]] (1810\u20131850) to the settlement of the West (1850\u20131890). The American railroad mania began with the founding of the first passenger and freight line in the nation of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1827 and the \"Laying of the First Stone\" ceremonies and beginning of its long construction heading westward over the obstacles of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] eastern chain the following year of 1828, and flourished with continuous railway building projects for the next 45 years until the financial  [[Panic of 1873]] followed by a major [[economic depression]] bankrupted many companies and temporarily stymied and ended growth.\n\nAlthough the antebellum South started early to build railways, it concentrated on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports, and the absence of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860 before the war. In the heavily settled Midwestern [[Corn Belt]], over 80 percent of farms were within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs, and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on [[Wall Street]] and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.\n\nThe system was largely built by 1910, but then trucks arrived to eat away the freight traffic, and automobiles (and later airplanes) to devour the passenger traffic. After 1940, the use of diesel electric locomotives made for much more efficient operations that needed fewer workers on the road and in repair shops.\n\nA series of bankruptcies and consolidations left the rail system in the hands of a few large operations by the 1980s. Almost all long-distance passenger traffic was shifted to [[Amtrak]] in 1971, a government-owned operation. Commuter rail service is provided near a few major cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia. Computerization and improved equipment steadily reduced employment, which peaked at 2.1 million in 1920, falling to 1.2 million in 1950 and 215,000 in 2010. Route mileage peaked at {{convert|254251|mi|km}} in 1916 and fell to {{convert|139,679|mi|km}} in 2011.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970'' (1976) table Q398; ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012.''

Canals and rivers were unavailable in the winter season due to freezing, but the railroads ran year-round despite poor weather. And railroads were safer: the likelihood of a train crash was less than the likelihood of a boat sinking. The railroads provided cost-effective transportation because they allowed shippers to have a smaller inventory of goods, which reduced storage costs during winter, and to avoid insurance costs from the risk of losing goods during transit.<ref name=\"BFDC\">{{cite book|author=United States.

For the common person in the early 1800s, transportation was often traveled by horse or stagecoach. The network of trails along which coaches navigated were riddled with ditches, potholes, and stones. This made travel fairly uncomfortable. Adding to injury, coaches were cramped with little leg room. Travel by train offered a new style. Locomotives proved themselves a smooth, headache free ride with plenty of room to move around.

The canals and steamboats lost out because of the dramatic increases in efficiency and speed of the railroads, which could go almost anywhere year round. The railroads were faster and went to many places a canal would be impractical or too expensive to build or a natural river never went. Railroads also had better scheduling since they often could go year round, more or less ignoring the weather. Canals and river traffic were cheaper if you lived on or near a canal or river that wasn't frozen over part of the year, but only a few did. Long distance transport of goods by wagon to a canal or river was slow and expensive. A railroad to a city made it an inland \"port\" that often prospered or turned a town into a city.<ref>Albert W.

Practically all the mills and factories supplying rails and equipment were in the North, and the Union blockade kept the South from getting new equipment or spare parts.

Most transports was by boat, not rail, and after the Union blockaded the ports in 1861 and seized the key rivers in 1862, long-distance travel was difficult. The outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the railroad companies, for the hoarding of the cotton crop in an attempt to force European intervention left railroads bereft of their main source of income.<ref name=\"Ramsdell\">Charles W.

''See'' [[Dieselisation#North America|Dieselisation in North America]].\n\nThough [[electric railway]]s expanded in Europe, they never reached the same popularity in North America. They were built primarily in the [[North-western United States|north-west]] and the [[North-eastern United States|north-east]] beginning in the late 19th century. While some railroads used electric locomotives for both freight and passenger trains, by the end of the 20th century most freight trains were pulled only by diesel locomotives.

Lines with hundreds or thousands of employees developed systematic rules and procedures, not only for running the equipment but in hiring, promoting, paying and supervising employees. The railway system of management was adopted by all major business sectors. Railways offered a new type of work experience in enterprises vastly larger in size, complexity and management. At first workers were recruited from occupations where skills were roughly analogous and transferable, that is, workshop mechanics from the iron, machine and building trades; [[Conductor (transportation)|conductors]] from [[stagecoach]] drivers, steamship stewards and mail boat captains; [[station master]]s from commerce and commission agencies; and clerks from government offices.<ref>{{cite book |last=Licht |first=Walter |date=1987 |title=Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691102214}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the strikes of the 1870s and 1880s, Congress passed the ''Arbitration Act of 1888,'' which authorized the creation of [[arbitration]] panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards.<ref>Arbitration Act of 1888, {{USStat|25|501}}, October 1, 1888.</ref> The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 [[Pullman Strike]], issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a [[United States district court|federal court]] [[injunction]] backed by federal troops.\n\n[[File:Railroad Coupling (CMRR).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Janney coupler|Automatic couplers]] were required by the 1893 [[Railroad Safety Appliance Act|Safety Appliance Act]].]]\nCongress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the [[Erdman Act]], passed in 1898.<ref>Erdman Act of 1898, June 1, 1898, ch. 370, {{USStat|30|424}}.</ref> This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited \"yellow dog\" contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued.

The generation between 1865 and 1895 was already mortgaged to the railways, and no one knew it better than the generation itself.<ref>Henry Adams, ''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/hadams/eha16.html The Education of Henry Adams'' (1918) p 240] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318035849/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/hadams/eha16.html |date=2017-03-18 }}</ref> \nThe impact can be examined through five aspects: shipping, finance, management, careers, and popular reaction.<ref>George Rogers Taylor, ''The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860'' (New York, 1951).</ref>\n\n===Shipping freight and passengers===\nFirst they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market. The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the Telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. For highly efficient Northern railroads played a major role in winning the Civil War, while the overburdened Southern lines collapsed in the face of an insurmountable challenge.<ref>John E. Clark, Jr., ''Railroads in the Civil War: The Impact of Management on Victory and Defeat'' (2004)</ref>  In the late 19th century pipelines were built for the oil trade, and in the 20th century trucking and aviation emerged.<ref>Leland H.

Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories or canals.  The famous Erie canal, 300 miles long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts.   A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers cost about the same as one mile of track.\n\nIn 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).<ref>Edward C.

However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route.  Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. The larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres.<ref>Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age''  (1961) pp 57\u201368.</ref> The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914.<ref>Leland H.

Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler and Stephen Salsbury. \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\" in Bruce Mazlish, ed., ''The Railroad and the Space Program'' (MIT Press, 1965)  pp 127\u201362</ref>\n\nAfter a serious accident, the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers to keep track of all train movements. Discipline was essential\u2014everyone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow.<ref>Chandler and Salsbury, \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\"  pp 130\u201334</ref> As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations.  The [[Erie Railroad]], faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]\u2014the largest in the world\u2014was making further advances in using bureaucracy under [[John Edgar Thomson]], president 1852\u20131874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., \"The Railroads: Pioneers in Modern Corporate Management\". ''Business History Review'' 1965 39(1): 16\u201340. {{JSTOR|3112463}}.</ref>\n\n=== Career paths===\nThe fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up to the engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57.  Women were not hired.<ref>Walter Licht, ''working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983) p 289</ref>\n\nWhite-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.  At each level, they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care.  Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by the foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be.<ref>Licht, ''Working for the Railroad'' pp 262\u201363. 269.</ref>  Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.<ref>Dora L. Costa, \"The evolution of retirement.\" in  Costa, ''The Evolution of Retirement: An American Economic History, 1880\u20131990'' (U of Chicago Press, 1998), pp 6\u201331 [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c6108.pdf online].</ref>\n\n===Early attitudes towards railroads===\nBoosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people would dress in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that:\n:The startling introduction of railroads into this agricultural society provoked a discussion that soon arrived at the enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignify, expand and enrich the nation. They became part of the public celebrations of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism.]] The rhetoric, the form, and the central figures of civic ceremonies changed to accommodate the intrusion of this technology....[Between 1828 and 1869] Americans integrated the railroad into the national economy and enfolded it within the sublime.<ref>{{cite book|author=David E. Nye|title=American Technological Sublime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrdbOJFxWIoC&pg=PR9|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|page=9|isbn=9780262640343}}</ref>\n\nTravel became much easier, cheaper and more common. Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores.  Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering.  Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:\n: with the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine the United States of continental proportions without the railroad.<ref>Gary S. Cross and Rick Szostak, ''Technology and American society: A history'' (2005) p 102.</ref>\n\nThe engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government.<ref>Robert Zussman, ''Mechanics of the middle class: work and politics among American engineers'' (1985).</ref> By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the [[Pennsylvania Station (1910\u20131963)|Pennsylvania Station in New York City]], and the [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington DC]].<ref>Carl W. Condit, \"Cincinnati Passenger Stations Before 1930,\" ''Railroad History'' No. 132 (1975) pp. 5\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/43520516 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAs early as the 1830s, novelists and poets began fretting that the railroads would destroy the rustic attractions of the American landscape. By the 1840s concerns were rising about terrible accidents when speeding trains crashed into helpless wooden carriages.<ref>George H. Douglas, ''All Aboard! The Railroad in American Life'' (1992), chapter 5</ref> By the 1870s, railroads were vilified by Western farmers who absorbed the Granger movement theme that monopolistic carriers controlled too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to impose maximum prices.

Miller, \"Origins of the Iowa Granger Law,\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 40#4 (1954), pp. 657\u2013680 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1895862 in JSTOR]</ref> Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated  in late 19th century political rhetoric.<ref>Douglas, ''All Aboard!''

Railroads throughout the United States allowed quicker, more efficient transport of goods and people that were previously unavailable. Agriculture, animals, soldiers, goods, and natural resources were now able to move large distances in much shorter amounts of time. As a result, things that were not harvested before like certain tracts of arable land or animal populations were now being used.\n\n=== Galena and Chicago Union Railroad ===\n[[File:Illinois_regions_map.png|thumb|324x324px|A current map showing Chicago, Galena, Springfield,and St. Louis.]]\n[[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad|The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] was the first railway to be built from [[Chicago]]. It never reached Galena, Illinois, but it reached Clinton, Iowa, and Freeport, Illinois. This railroad marked the beginning of Chicago's economic dominance in the Midwest  though transportation of goods such as agriculture and bison hides. Railroads affected the American environment by opening up unexplored, immense tracts of the American wilderness for settlement commercialization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schivelbusch|first=Wolfgang|date=2014|title=The American Railroad|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\nThe idea behind a railroad to Chicago was to steal Midwestern agricultural business from [[St. Louis]], Missouri and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin. The area around Chicago was ideal for a railroad because it was flat and grassy. Citizens of Chicago believed they could use their environment for commercial gain by actually buying goods grown from the land as well as increasing the value the value of adjacent land neighboring the railroad. The Galena and Chicago Union railroad underwent construction in March 1848 to have the railroad run through Chicago, a booming Midwest town. In order to fund this, local Illinoisans pledged together to build a railway because of the potential economic prosperity. William Cronon writes, \u201dBy the following April [1849], over twelve hundred people had pledged to buy stock hypothetically valued at about $350,000, though they had paid only about $20,000 in actual cash.\u201d Farmers were enamored with the idea of a railroad because transporting crops and goods became much easier and more effective than traveling on dirt roads that could easily become muddy or impassable, so they pledged a lot of their money towards the venture. The process of local funding was stock installments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Nature's Metropolis|last=Cronon|first=William|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=1991|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nBy 1852, the Galena and Chicago Union railroad supplied Chicago over half of its wheat. This statistic changed the way people thought about the environment and its railways because railways through the countryside provided Chicagoans with increased wealth; railways became a symbol of mastery over land by being able to transport anything across terrain. This mastery coupled with an aligning of railroads with prosperity and wealth changed the way Chicagoans saw railways. It was a beacon of hope and deliverer of goods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Impact on buffalo population ==\n[[File:\"Rath & Wright's buffalo hide yard in 1878, showing 40,000 buffalo hides, Dodge City, Kansas.\" - NARA - 520093.tif|thumb|323x323px|A buffalo hide yard in Dodge City, Kansas, in 1878.]]\n[[File:William_Temple_Hornaday.jpeg|thumb|236x236px|Willam Hornaday, a leading conservationist of the 19th century.]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, herds of [[American bison|buffalo]] were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4\u20136 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and graze the same land as the bison. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], an influential zoologist and student of the American bison, wrote, \"as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began.\" Railroads gave rise to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hide, meat, and bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could not consume all of the carcasses that were left behind by hunters. There were so many rotting, pungent, bison corpses that nature's scavengers did not have enough power to consume.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Railroaded|last=White|first=Richard|publisher=W.W.

He describes the pristine wilderness \"long before the white man and long before the wheel\" and before pioneers started to build mines, mills, and factories in the verdant land. Because of the optimism for wealth and adventure, Lightfoot claims, \"The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring.\" He also describes the cost this industry had on nature by penning the line, \"Open her heart let the life blood flow.\" He describes nature's heart as being bled by the workers' dreams, which could not be stopped, \"Into the muskeg and into the rain.\" Because man wants to be in control of nature and conquer it, he wants to be able to say,\n\n\"On the mountain tops we stand\n\nAll the world at our command\n\nWe have opened up the soil\n\nWith our teardrops and our toil\"\n\nThrough hard work technology, pioneers and businessmen adapted the environment for their own commercial needs and quest for power.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian Railway Trilogy|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Gordon|work=The Way I Feel}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThere is no question about the importance of railroads in American history.  Churella finds that back in the 1950s business and economic historians, led by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] and [[Robert Fogel]], made railroads the centerpiece of advanced historiography.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven E. Woodworth|title=The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rb3ANWoZt1YC&pg=PA567|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|page=567|isbn=9780313290190}}</ref>  That era has passed as graduate programs have faded away, courses on railroad history do not make the curriculum, and the historiography has shifted away from professional historian to the \"railfans\"\u2014very well informed amateur writers fascinated by the memorabilia, technology and locomotives of the steam era. Looking at the voluminous output of railfan authors, Klein says:\n\n:The vast bulk of this work is devoted to minute descriptions of power, rolling stock, obscure short lines, and technical subjects....  But few address the larger questions of railroad history or place their topic in broader contexts.<ref>Maury Klein, ''Unfinished Business: The Railroad in American Life'' (1994) p. 169</ref><ref>Albert J. Churella, \"Company, State, and Region: Three Approaches to Railroad History,\" ''Enterprise & Society,'' (2006) 7#3, pp. 581\u2013591</ref>\n\nThe result is a multiplicity of histories of specific railroads, large and small. Typically they deal with standard topics: the builders and their organizational, legislative and financial dealings; colorful construction crews laying down wood ties and steel rail; the development of locomotives and passenger cars; boosters who sought a stop in their little town else it would die; the 1880\u20131920 golden age of the passenger long-distance travel and local excursions; the steady erosion of passenger service during the automobile age; the freight agent and the small-town depot.

A railroad was reportedly used in the construction of the [[Kingdom of France|French]] fortress at [[Louisburg, Nova Scotia]], in [[New France]] (now [[Canada]]) in 1720. Between 1762 and 1764, at the close of the [[French and Indian War]] (1756\u20131763), a [[gravity railroad]] ([[tramway (industrial)|mechanized tramway]]) ([[Montresor's Tramway]]) is built by [[British Army|British military engineers]] up the steep riverside terrain near the [[Niagara River]] waterfall's [[escarpment]] at the [[Niagara Portage]]  (which the local [[Seneca people|Seneca]]s called ''\"Crawl on All Fours.\"'') in [[Lewiston, New York]].\n\nRailroads played a large role in the development of the [[United States]] from the [[industrial revolution]] in the [[Northeastern United States|North-east]] (1810\u20131850) to the settlement of the West (1850\u20131890). The American railroad mania began with the founding of the first passenger and freight line in the nation of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] in 1827 and the \"Laying of the First Stone\" ceremonies and beginning of its long construction heading westward over the obstacles of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] eastern chain the following year of 1828, and flourished with continuous railway building projects for the next 45 years until the financial  [[Panic of 1873]] followed by a major [[economic depression]] bankrupted many companies and temporarily stymied and ended growth.\n\nAlthough the antebellum South started early to build railways, it concentrated on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports, and the absence of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860 before the war. In the heavily settled Midwestern [[Corn Belt]], over 80 percent of farms were within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs, and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, but thanks to a fast developing financial system based on [[Wall Street]] and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.\n\nThe system was largely built by 1910, but then trucks arrived to eat away the freight traffic, and automobiles (and later airplanes) to devour the passenger traffic. After 1940, the use of diesel electric locomotives made for much more efficient operations that needed fewer workers on the road and in repair shops.\n\nA series of bankruptcies and consolidations left the rail system in the hands of a few large operations by the 1980s. Almost all long-distance passenger traffic was shifted to [[Amtrak]] in 1971, a government-owned operation. Commuter rail service is provided near a few major cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia. Computerization and improved equipment steadily reduced employment, which peaked at 2.1 million in 1920, falling to 1.2 million in 1950 and 215,000 in 2010. Route mileage peaked at {{convert|254251|mi|km}} in 1916 and fell to {{convert|139,679|mi|km}} in 2011.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970'' (1976) table Q398; ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012.''

This became the Crum Creek Branch of the [[Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad]] (part of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]) in 1887. This is the first railroad meant to be permanent, and the first to evolve into trackage of a [[common carrier]] after an intervening closure.\n\nIn 1826 [[Massachusetts]] incorporated [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]]'s [[Granite Railway]] as a [[common carrier|common]] freight carrier<ref>Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1826).

To link the port of [[Baltimore, MD|Baltimore]] to the [[Ohio River]], the state of [[Maryland]] in 1827 chartered the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O), the first section of which opened in 1830. Similarly, the [[South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company]] was chartered in 1827 to connect [[Charleston, SC|Charleston]] to the [[Savannah River]], and [[Pennsylvania]] built the [[Main Line of Public Works]] between [[Philadelphia, PA|Philadelphia]] and the [[Ohio River]].\n\nThe Americans closely followed and copied [[History of rail transport#Britain|British railroad technology]].

This program enabled the opening of numerous western lines, especially the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific-Central Pacific]] with fast service from San Francisco to [[Omaha]] and east to [[Chicago]]. West of Chicago, many cities grew up as rail centers, with repair shops and a base of technically literate workers.<ref>James R. Shortridge, ''Cities on the plains: The evolution of urban Kansas'' (University Press of Kansas, 2004).</ref>\n\nRailroads soon replaced many [[canal]]s and [[Toll road|turnpikes]] and by the 1870s had significantly displaced [[steamboat]]s as well.<ref>Louis C. Hunter, ''Steamboats on the Western rivers: An economic and technological history'' (1949) ch 15</ref> The railroads were superior to these alternative modes of transportation, particularly water routes because they lowered costs in two ways. Canals and rivers were unavailable in the winter season due to freezing, but the railroads ran year-round despite poor weather. And railroads were safer: the likelihood of a train crash was less than the likelihood of a boat sinking. The railroads provided cost-effective transportation because they allowed shippers to have a smaller inventory of goods, which reduced storage costs during winter, and to avoid insurance costs from the risk of losing goods during transit.<ref name=\"BFDC\">{{cite book|author=United States.

For the common person in the early 1800s, transportation was often traveled by horse or stagecoach. The network of trails along which coaches navigated were riddled with ditches, potholes, and stones. This made travel fairly uncomfortable. Adding to injury, coaches were cramped with little leg room. Travel by train offered a new style. Locomotives proved themselves a smooth, headache free ride with plenty of room to move around.

The railroads were faster and went to many places a canal would be impractical or too expensive to build or a natural river never went. Railroads also had better scheduling since they often could go year round, more or less ignoring the weather. Canals and river traffic were cheaper if you lived on or near a canal or river that wasn't frozen over part of the year, but only a few did. Long distance transport of goods by wagon to a canal or river was slow and expensive. A railroad to a city made it an inland \"port\" that often prospered or turned a town into a city.<ref>Albert W.

Most transports was by boat, not rail, and after the Union blockaded the ports in 1861 and seized the key rivers in 1862, long-distance travel was difficult. The outbreak of war had a depressing effect on the economic fortunes of the railroad companies, for the hoarding of the cotton crop in an attempt to force European intervention left railroads bereft of their main source of income.<ref name=\"Ramsdell\">Charles W.

However, although England had early adopted a [[standard gauge]] of {{Track gauge|ussg|lk=on}}, once Americans started building locomotives, they experimented with different gauges, resulting in the standard gauge, or a close approximation, being adopted in the [[Northeast (U.S.)|Northeast]] and [[Midwest U.S.]], but a {{Track gauge|5ft|lk=on}} gauge in the [[South (U.S.)|South]], and a {{Track gauge|5ft6in|lk=on}} gauge in Canada.

Most U.S. roads discontinued use of steam locomotives by the 1950s. A diesel engine was expensive to build, but was less complex and easier to maintain than a steam locomotive, and required only one person to operate. This meant reduced costs and greater reliability for the railroads.<ref name=\"Stover\" />{{rp|213\u201314}} Several companies developed fast [[streamliner]] trains, such as the [[Super Chief]] and the [[California Zephyr]] during the 1930s and 1940s. Their locomotives used either diesel or similar [[internal combustion engine]] designs. ''See'' [[Dieselisation#North America|Dieselisation in North America]].\n\nThough [[electric railway]]s expanded in Europe, they never reached the same popularity in North America. They were built primarily in the [[North-western United States|north-west]] and the [[North-eastern United States|north-east]] beginning in the late 19th century. While some railroads used electric locomotives for both freight and passenger trains, by the end of the 20th century most freight trains were pulled only by diesel locomotives. The Northeast Corridor, the most heavily traveled passenger line in the US, is one of few long lines currently operating with electrification.

Before [[Electrical telegraph#Morse telegraphs|telegraphs]], the American railroads initially managed their train operations using timetables.

These orders overrode the timetable, allowing the cancellation, rescheduling and addition of trains. The earliest recorded use of train orders was by the [[Erie Railroad]] in 1851.<ref>{{cite book |title=Trains Across the Continent: North American Railroad History |url=https://archive.org/details/trainsacrosscont00rudo |url-access=registration |last=Daniels |first=Rudolph |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-21411-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/trainsacrosscont00rudo/page/223 223]}}</ref>\n\nThe development of the electrical [[track circuit]] in the 1870s led to the use of systems off [[North American railway signaling#Absolute or manual block|block signals]], which improved the railroads' speed, safety and efficiency.

Lines with hundreds or thousands of employees developed systematic rules and procedures, not only for running the equipment but in hiring, promoting, paying and supervising employees. The railway system of management was adopted by all major business sectors. Railways offered a new type of work experience in enterprises vastly larger in size, complexity and management. At first workers were recruited from occupations where skills were roughly analogous and transferable, that is, workshop mechanics from the iron, machine and building trades; [[Conductor (transportation)|conductors]] from [[stagecoach]] drivers, steamship stewards and mail boat captains; [[station master]]s from commerce and commission agencies; and clerks from government offices.<ref>{{cite book |last=Licht |first=Walter |date=1987 |title=Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691102214}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the strikes of the 1870s and 1880s, Congress passed the ''Arbitration Act of 1888,'' which authorized the creation of [[arbitration]] panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards.<ref>Arbitration Act of 1888, {{USStat|25|501}}, October 1, 1888.</ref> The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 [[Pullman Strike]], issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a [[United States district court|federal court]] [[injunction]] backed by federal troops.\n\n[[File:Railroad Coupling (CMRR).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Janney coupler|Automatic couplers]] were required by the 1893 [[Railroad Safety Appliance Act|Safety Appliance Act]].]]\nCongress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the [[Erdman Act]], passed in 1898.<ref>Erdman Act of 1898, June 1, 1898, ch. 370, {{USStat|30|424}}.</ref> This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited \"yellow dog\" contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used. A successor statute, the [[Newlands Labor Act|Newlands Act]], was passed in 1913 and proved more effective,<ref>Newlands Act, July 15, 1913, ch. 6, {{USStat|38|103}}.</ref> but was largely superseded when the federal government [[nationalized]] the railroads in 1917.\n\nAs railroads expanded after the Civil War, so too did the rate of accidents among railroad personnel, especially [[Brakeman|brakemen]]. Many accidents were associated with the [[Railway coupling|coupling and uncoupling]] of railroad cars, and the operation of manually operated brakes ([[Parking brake#Railroad hand brakes|hand brakes]]). The rise in accidents led to calls for safety legislation, as early as the 1870s.<ref name=\"McDonald\">{{cite book |title=The Federal Railroad Safety Program |last=McDonald |first=Charles|year=1993 |publisher=U.S. Federal Railroad Administration |location=Washington, DC|url=http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/safety/rail_safety_program_booklet_v2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731183723/http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/safety/rail_safety_program_booklet_v2.pdf |archive-date=2009-07-31}}</ref>{{rp|2\u20134}} In the 1880s, the number of on-the-job fatalities of railroad workers was second only to those of [[Coal mining|coal miners]].<ref name=\"McDonald\" />{{rp|5}} Through that decade, several [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] enacted safety laws.

The generation between 1865 and 1895 was already mortgaged to the railways, and no one knew it better than the generation itself.<ref>Henry Adams, ''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/hadams/eha16.html The Education of Henry Adams'' (1918) p 240] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318035849/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/hadams/eha16.html |date=2017-03-18 }}</ref> \nThe impact can be examined through five aspects: shipping, finance, management, careers, and popular reaction.<ref>George Rogers Taylor, ''The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860'' (New York, 1951).</ref>\n\n===Shipping freight and passengers===\nFirst they provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers across a large national market. The result was a transforming impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture and finance. Supplemented with the Telegraph that added rapid communications, the United States now had an integrated national market practically the size of Europe, with no internal barriers or tariffs, all supported by a common language, and financial system and a common legal system. The railroads at first supplemented, then largely replaced the previous transportation modes of turnpikes and canals, rivers and intracoastal ocean traffic. For highly efficient Northern railroads played a major role in winning the Civil War, while the overburdened Southern lines collapsed in the face of an insurmountable challenge.<ref>John E. Clark, Jr., ''Railroads in the Civil War: The Impact of Management on Victory and Defeat'' (2004)</ref>  In the late 19th century pipelines were built for the oil trade, and in the 20th century trucking and aviation emerged.<ref>Leland H.

Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories or canals.  The famous Erie canal, 300 miles long in upstate New York, cost $7 million of state money, which was about what private investors spent on one short railroad in Western Massachusetts.   A new steamboat on the Hudson, Mississippi, Missouri, or Ohio rivers cost about the same as one mile of track.\n\nIn 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897 it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion).<ref>Edward C. Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age: Business, labor, and public policy, 1860\u20131897'' (1961) p 52, 68\u201374.</ref>\nFunding came from financiers throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain.<ref>Alfred D.

However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads, so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route.  Some cash came from states, or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line. The larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era, as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system. Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads; the state total was 49 million acres.<ref>Kirkland, ''Industry comes of age''  (1961) pp 57\u201368.</ref> The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. Boston was the first center, but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914.<ref>Leland H.

Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler and Stephen Salsbury. \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\" in Bruce Mazlish, ed., ''The Railroad and the Space Program'' (MIT Press, 1965)  pp 127\u201362</ref>\n\nAfter a serious accident, the [[Boston and Albany Railroad|Western Railroad of Massachusetts]] put in place a system of responsibility for district managers and dispatchers to keep track of all train movements. Discipline was essential\u2014everyone had to follow the rules exactly to prevent accidents. Decision-making powers had to be distributed to ensure safety and to juggle the complexity of numerous trains running in both directions on a single track, keeping to schedules that could easily be disrupted by weather mechanical breakdowns, washouts or hitting a wandering cow.<ref>Chandler and Salsbury, \"The railroads: Innovators in modern business administration.\"  pp 130\u201334</ref> As the lines grew longer with more and more business originating at dozens of different stations, the Baltimore and Ohio set up more complex system that separated finances from daily operations.  The [[Erie Railroad]], faced with growing competition, had to make lower bids for freight movement, and had to know on a daily basis how much each train was costing them. Statistics was the weapon of choice. By the 1860s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]\u2014the largest in the world\u2014was making further advances in using bureaucracy under [[John Edgar Thomson]], president 1852\u20131874. He divided the system into several geographical divisions, which each reported daily to a general superintendent in Philadelphia. All the American railroads copied each other in the new managerial advances, and by the 1870s emerging big businesses in the industrial field likewise copied the railroad model.<ref>Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., \"The Railroads: Pioneers in Modern Corporate Management\". ''Business History Review'' 1965 39(1): 16\u201340. {{JSTOR|3112463}}.</ref>\n\n=== Career paths===\nThe fourth dimension was in management of the workforce, both blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Railroading became a career in which young men entered at about age 18 to 20, and spent their entire lives usually with the same line. Young men could start working on the tracks, become a fireman, and work his way up to the engineer. The mechanical world of the roundhouses have their own career tracks. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer, be promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57.  Women were not hired.<ref>Walter Licht, ''working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983) p 289</ref>\n\nWhite-collar careers paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.  At each level, they had more and more knowledge experience and human capital. They were very hard to replace, and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care.  Hiring, firing and wage rates were set not by the foreman, but by central administrators, in order to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was by the book, and increasingly complex set of rules told everyone exactly what they should do it every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be.<ref>Licht, ''Working for the Railroad'' pp 262\u201363. 269.</ref>  Young men who were first hired in the 1840s and 1850s retired from the same railroad 40 or 50 years later. To discourage them from leaving for another company, they were promised pensions when they retired. Indeed, the railroads invented the American pension system.<ref>Dora L. Costa, \"The evolution of retirement.\" in  Costa, ''The Evolution of Retirement: An American Economic History, 1880\u20131990'' (U of Chicago Press, 1998), pp 6\u201331 [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c6108.pdf online].</ref>\n\n===Early attitudes towards railroads===\nBoosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people would dress in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. David Nye argues that:\n:The startling introduction of railroads into this agricultural society provoked a discussion that soon arrived at the enthusiastic consensus that railways were sublime and that they would help to unify, dignify, expand and enrich the nation. They became part of the public celebrations of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism.]] The rhetoric, the form, and the central figures of civic ceremonies changed to accommodate the intrusion of this technology....[Between 1828 and 1869] Americans integrated the railroad into the national economy and enfolded it within the sublime.<ref>{{cite book|author=David E.

Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores.  Hotels, resorts and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering.  Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:\n: with the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine the United States of continental proportions without the railroad.<ref>Gary S. Cross and Rick Szostak, ''Technology and American society: A history'' (2005) p 102.</ref>\n\nThe engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government.<ref>Robert Zussman, ''Mechanics of the middle class: work and politics among American engineers'' (1985).</ref> By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the [[Pennsylvania Station (1910\u20131963)|Pennsylvania Station in New York City]], and the [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington DC]].<ref>Carl W.

Railroads throughout the United States allowed quicker, more efficient transport of goods and people that were previously unavailable. Agriculture, animals, soldiers, goods, and natural resources were now able to move large distances in much shorter amounts of time. As a result, things that were not harvested before like certain tracts of arable land or animal populations were now being used.\n\n=== Galena and Chicago Union Railroad ===\n[[File:Illinois_regions_map.png|thumb|324x324px|A current map showing Chicago, Galena, Springfield,and St. Louis.]]\n[[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad|The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] was the first railway to be built from [[Chicago]]. It never reached Galena, Illinois, but it reached Clinton, Iowa, and Freeport, Illinois. This railroad marked the beginning of Chicago's economic dominance in the Midwest  though transportation of goods such as agriculture and bison hides. Railroads affected the American environment by opening up unexplored, immense tracts of the American wilderness for settlement commercialization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schivelbusch|first=Wolfgang|date=2014|title=The American Railroad|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\nThe idea behind a railroad to Chicago was to steal Midwestern agricultural business from [[St. Louis]], Missouri and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin. The area around Chicago was ideal for a railroad because it was flat and grassy. Citizens of Chicago believed they could use their environment for commercial gain by actually buying goods grown from the land as well as increasing the value the value of adjacent land neighboring the railroad. The Galena and Chicago Union railroad underwent construction in March 1848 to have the railroad run through Chicago, a booming Midwest town. In order to fund this, local Illinoisans pledged together to build a railway because of the potential economic prosperity. William Cronon writes, \u201dBy the following April [1849], over twelve hundred people had pledged to buy stock hypothetically valued at about $350,000, though they had paid only about $20,000 in actual cash.\u201d Farmers were enamored with the idea of a railroad because transporting crops and goods became much easier and more effective than traveling on dirt roads that could easily become muddy or impassable, so they pledged a lot of their money towards the venture. The process of local funding was stock installments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Nature's Metropolis|last=Cronon|first=William|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=1991|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nBy 1852, the Galena and Chicago Union railroad supplied Chicago over half of its wheat. This statistic changed the way people thought about the environment and its railways because railways through the countryside provided Chicagoans with increased wealth; railways became a symbol of mastery over land by being able to transport anything across terrain. This mastery coupled with an aligning of railroads with prosperity and wealth changed the way Chicagoans saw railways. It was a beacon of hope and deliverer of goods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Impact on buffalo population ==\n[[File:\"Rath & Wright's buffalo hide yard in 1878, showing 40,000 buffalo hides, Dodge City, Kansas.\" - NARA - 520093.tif|thumb|323x323px|A buffalo hide yard in Dodge City, Kansas, in 1878.]]\n[[File:William_Temple_Hornaday.jpeg|thumb|236x236px|Willam Hornaday, a leading conservationist of the 19th century.]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, herds of [[American bison|buffalo]] were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4\u20136 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and graze the same land as the bison. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], an influential zoologist and student of the American bison, wrote, \"as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began.\" Railroads gave rise to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hide, meat, and bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could not consume all of the carcasses that were left behind by hunters. There were so many rotting, pungent, bison corpses that nature's scavengers did not have enough power to consume.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Railroaded|last=White|first=Richard|publisher=W.W.

He describes the pristine wilderness \"long before the white man and long before the wheel\" and before pioneers started to build mines, mills, and factories in the verdant land. Because of the optimism for wealth and adventure, Lightfoot claims, \"The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring.\" He also describes the cost this industry had on nature by penning the line, \"Open her heart let the life blood flow.\" He describes nature's heart as being bled by the workers' dreams, which could not be stopped, \"Into the muskeg and into the rain.\" Because man wants to be in control of nature and conquer it, he wants to be able to say,\n\n\"On the mountain tops we stand\n\nAll the world at our command\n\nWe have opened up the soil\n\nWith our teardrops and our toil\"\n\nThrough hard work technology, pioneers and businessmen adapted the environment for their own commercial needs and quest for power.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian Railway Trilogy|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Gordon|work=The Way I Feel}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThere is no question about the importance of railroads in American history.  Churella finds that back in the 1950s business and economic historians, led by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] and [[Robert Fogel]], made railroads the centerpiece of advanced historiography.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven E. Woodworth|title=The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rb3ANWoZt1YC&pg=PA567|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|page=567|isbn=9780313290190}}</ref>  That era has passed as graduate programs have faded away, courses on railroad history do not make the curriculum, and the historiography has shifted away from professional historian to the \"railfans\"\u2014very well informed amateur writers fascinated by the memorabilia, technology and locomotives of the steam era. Looking at the voluminous output of railfan authors, Klein says:\n\n:The vast bulk of this work is devoted to minute descriptions of power, rolling stock, obscure short lines, and technical subjects....  But few address the larger questions of railroad history or place their topic in broader contexts.<ref>Maury Klein, ''Unfinished Business: The Railroad in American Life'' (1994) p. 169</ref><ref>Albert J. Churella, \"Company, State, and Region: Three Approaches to Railroad History,\" ''Enterprise & Society,'' (2006) 7#3, pp. 581\u2013591</ref>\n\nThe result is a multiplicity of histories of specific railroads, large and small. Typically they deal with standard topics: the builders and their organizational, legislative and financial dealings; colorful construction crews laying down wood ties and steel rail; the development of locomotives and passenger cars; boosters who sought a stop in their little town else it would die; the 1880\u20131920 golden age of the passenger long-distance travel and local excursions; the steady erosion of passenger service during the automobile age; the freight agent and the small-town depot. They end with the more recent saga of retrenchment, merger, and abandonment.<ref name=\"Churella pp. 581-591\">Churella, \"Company, State, and Region: Three Approaches to Railroad History,\" pp. 581\u2013591</ref><ref>Wallace Farnham, \"Railroads in Western History: The View from the Union Pacific,\" ''University of Wyoming Publications'' (1966), Vol. 32, pp. 95\u2013112</ref> Klein, Churella, Roth, and Franham all find that the popular writers show little interest in the development of managerial and organizational complexity of the sort that Chandler studied, or the economic impact that concerned Fogel's cohort.<ref>Marty Roth, \"Review\" of \"Minneapolis and the Age of Railways,\" ''Pioneer America Society Transactions'' (2009) vol 32 pp 185\u20136 [http://www.pioneeramerica.org/currentpast/past2009contents.html online]</ref> From outside the field of railroad history, academic labor historians now deal with the culture of the workers, strikes, the careers for blue collar and white collar men, and racial discrimination.

The first was on the night of 7{{ndash}}8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on [[Easter Tuesday]], 15 April 1941. Two hundred [[bombers]] of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on [[London]], this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref name=bbrem>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm|title=The Belfast blitz is remembered|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2001|publisher=BBC News|quote=On 16 April 1941 Belfast was devastated as it bore the worst air raid of any city outside London [\u2026] It was one of the largest German strike forces used to date in the war and the ''Luftwaffe'' was heading for a city later described as the most poorly defended in the United Kingdom.}}</ref><ref name=membb>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a7713966.shtml|title=Memories of the Belfast Blitz|accessdate=19 January 2015|author= [[Belfast Central Library]]|work= WW2 People's War|publisher=BBC|quote=No city, save London, suffered more loss of life in one night\u2019s raid on the United Kingdom.}}</ref>\n\nThe third raid on Belfast took place over the evening and morning of 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941; 150 were killed.

Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the ''Luftwaffe''. Meanwhile, unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK.  Under the leadership of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], it had declared its [[Irish neutrality|neutrality]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers|Axis]] nations: the German Legation in [[Dublin]] remained open throughout the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keogh|first=Dermot|title=Eamon de Valera and Hitler: An Analysis of International Reaction to the Visit to the German Minister, May 1945|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/AAE/Article.pdf|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69\u201392|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Government===\nThe [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came. [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig, Lord Craigavon]], had been Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921 up until his death in 1940. His death (along with preceding ill-health) came at a bad time and arguably inadvertently caused a leadership vacuum. [[Richard Dawson Bates]] was the Home Affairs Minister. [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]], the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister. He successfully busied himself with the task of making Northern Ireland a major supplier of food to Britain in her time of need.<ref name=\"bardon\">{{cite web|title=Extracts from an article, \"The Belfast Blitz, 1941\"|author=Jonathan Bardon|url=http://www.joeoloughlin.co.uk/?p=65|work=BELFAST BLITZ|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John Clarke MacDermott]], the Minister of Public Security, after the first bombing, initiated the \"Hiram Plan\" to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible.<ref name=Hiram>{{cite web|title=Historical Topics Series 2 The Belfast Blitz |url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/historical_topics_series_-_02_-_the_belfast_blitz.pdf |work=BELFAST BLITZ |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> It was MacDermott who sent a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] to de Valera seeking assistance.

He was succeeded by [[John Miller Andrews]], then 69 years old, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. On 28 April 1943, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office.

They are best known for the [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] and the [[Short Stirling|Stirling]] long-range [[heavy bomber]]. Up to 20,000 people were employed. The factory was re-equipping as early as 1936 for the manufacture of 189 [[Handley Page Hereford]] [[bomber]]s\n* [[Mackie International|James Mackie & Sons]] were re-equipped in 1938. They were the primary supplier of [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] anti-aircraft shells.\n* Harland's Engineering works built [[tank]]s. They designed the [[Churchill tank|Churchill]].\n* Aero [[linen]] for covering aircraft, such as the [[Hawker Hurricane]], and [[military glider]] frames was manufactured by a number of Belfast [[flax]] spinning mills, such as The York Street Flax Spinning Co.; Brookfield Spinning Co.; Wm. Ewart's Rosebank Weaving Co.; and the Linen Thread Co.\n* Other Belfast factories manufactured gun mountings, [[Artillery|ordnance]] pieces, aircraft parts and [[ammunition]].\n\nWar materials and food were sent by sea from Belfast to Britain, some under the protection of the [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]. The M.V. ''Munster'', for example, operated by the [[Belfast Steamship Company]], plied between Belfast and [[Liverpool]] under the tricolour, until she hit a [[Naval mine|mine]] and was sunk outside Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|title=Munster|url=http://lugnad.ie/remember-munster/|work=Commemorative Brochure|publisher=[[Maritime Institute of Ireland]]|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James Craig, Viscount Craigavon, <br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland until his death in 1940.

Progress in Northern Ireland was minimal}}</ref> However at the time Lord Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921, said: \"Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be.\" He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: \"if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours'&nbsp;\". His reply was: \"We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|Empire]] to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the [[Ulster]] people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.\"\n\nDawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, apparently refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts in 1939 that Belfast was regarded as \"a very definite German objective\", little was done outside providing shelters in the Harbour area.<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' 2015, p. 41-2.</ref>\n\n====Air-raid shelters====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nBelfast, the city with the highest population density per area in Britain at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters. Prior to the \"Belfast Blitz\" there were only 200 public shelters in the city, although around 4,000 households had built their own private shelters. These private air-raid shelters were [[Air raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]], constructed of sheets of [[corrugated galvanised iron]] covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them. \n\nNo searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some [[barrage balloon]]s positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover. Indeed, on the night of the first raid, no [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft took to the air to intercept German planes. On the ground, there were only 22 anti-aircraft guns positioned around the city, six light and sixteen heavy, and on the first night only seven of these were manned and operational.\n\n====Children====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nFew children had been successfully evacuated. The \"Hiram Plan\" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.\n\n====German preparation====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nFrom papers recovered after the war, we know of a ''Luftwaffe'' reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:\n* [[Harland and Wolff]]\n* ''Die Tankstelle'' Conns Water\n* Short and Harland aircraft factory\n* The power station of Belfast\n* Rank & Co mill\n* Belfast waterworks\n* [[Victoria Barracks, Belfast|Victoria Barracks]]\n\n[[File:Johnmillerandrews.jpg|thumb|left|John Miller Andrews<br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland 1940\u201343. ''HMSO image'']]\n\n===Earlier raids===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThere had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]] or the cities of the [[North West England|northwest of England]].\nOn 24 March 1941, [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John MacDermott]], Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected: \"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There <nowiki>[is]</nowiki> ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn.\" MacDermott would be proved right.\n\nThe first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, from ''Kampfgruppe 26'', flying at {{convert|7000|ft|m}}, dropped [[Incendiary bomb|incendiaries]], high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. Thirteen lost their lives, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a {{convert|4.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} factory floor for manufacturing the [[fuselage]]s of [[Short Stirling]] bombers. The Royal Air Force announced that Squadron Leader J.W.C. Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over [[Downpatrick]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' crews returned to their base in Northern [[France]] and reported that Belfast's defences were, \"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient\". This raid overall causing relatively little damage but a lot was revealed about Belfast's inadequate defences.\n\n==Easter Tuesday Blitz==\n[[William Joyce]] (known as \"[[Lord Haw-Haw]]\") announced in radio broadcasts from Hamburg that there will be \"Easter eggs for Belfast\". {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Junkers Ju88.jpg|right|thumb|Junkers Ju-88]]\nOn [[Easter]] Tuesday, 15 April 1941, spectators watching a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match at [[Windsor Park]] noticed a lone [[Luftwaffe#World War I|Luftwaffe]] [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] Ju-88 aircraft circling overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz//personal_peter.shtml|title=The most unprotected city in the UK|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=Peter Hughes|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nThat evening over 150 bombers left their bases in northern [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] and headed for [[Belfast]]. There were [[Heinkel He 111]]s, [[Junkers Ju 88]]s and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dorniers]]. At 10:40&nbsp;pm the [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens sounded]]. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city. The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting.\n\nPublic buildings destroyed or badly damaged included Belfast City Hall's Banqueting Hall, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children and Ballymacarrett library, (the last two being located on Templemore Avenue). Strand Public Elementary school, the LMS railway station, the adjacent Midland Hotel on York Road, and Salisbury Avenue tram depot were all hit. Churches destroyed or wrecked included Macrory Memorial Presbyterian in Duncairn Gardens; Duncairn Methodist, Castleton Presbyterian on York Road; St Silas's on the Oldpark Road; St James's on the [[Antrim Road]]; Newington Presbyterian on Limestone Road; Crumlin Road Presbyterian; Holy Trinity on Clifton Street and Clifton Street Presbyterian; York Street Presbyterian and York Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian; Newtownards Road Methodist and Rosemary Street Presbyterian (the last of which was not rebuilt).\n\nStreets heavily bombed in the city centre included High Street, Ann Street, Callender Street, Chichester Street, Castle Street, Tomb Street, Bridge Street (effectively obliterated), Rosemary Street, Waring Street, North Street, Victoria Street, Donegall Street, York Street, Gloucester Street, and East Bridge Street. In the east of the city, Westbourne and Newcastle Streets on the Newtownards Road, Thorndyke Street off the Albertbridge Road and Ravenscroft Avenue were destroyed or damaged. In the west and north of the city, streets heavily bombed included Percy Street, York Park, York Crescent, Eglinton Street, Carlisle Street, Ballyclare, Ballycastle and Ballynure Streets off the Oldpark Road; Southport Street, Walton Street, Antrim Road, Annadale Street, Cliftonville Road, Hillman Street, Atlantic Avenue, Hallidays Road, Hughenden Avenue, Sunningdale Park, Shandarragh Park, and Whitewell Road. Burke Street which ran between Annadale and Dawson streets in the New Lodge area, was completely wiped off the map with all its 20 houses flattened and all of the occupants killed.<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\"/>\n\nThere was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the [[anti-aircraft]] batteries ceased firing. But the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5{{nbsp}}am.\n\nFifty-five thousand houses were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. Outside of London, with some 900 dead, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref>Wills, (2007). ''That Neutral Island'', page 213.</ref> A stray bomber attacked [[Derry]], killing 15. Another attacked [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], killing five. By 4 am the entire city seemed to be in flames. At 4:15{{nbsp}}am John MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, managed to contact Basil Brooke (then Agriculture Minister), seeking permission to seek help from the Irish government. Brooke noted in his diary ''\"I gave him authority as it is obviously a question of expediency\"''. Since 1:45{{nbsp}}am all telephones had been cut. Fortunately, the [[Rail transport|railway]] telegraphy link between Belfast and Dublin was still operational. The telegram was sent at 4:35{{nbsp}}am,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} asking the Irish [[Taoiseach]], \u00c9amon de Valera for assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2011/0413/646678-radio-documentary-ww2-hidden-heroes-belfast-blitz-republic-firemen|title=Hidden Heroes of the Belfast Blitz|date=16 April 2011|website=rte.ie|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Human cost==\nOver 900 lives were lost, 1,500 people were injured, 400 of them seriously. Fifty-thousand houses, more than half the houses in the city, were damaged. Eleven churches, two hospitals and two schools were destroyed. These figures are based on newspaper reports of the time, personal recollections and other [[primary source]]s, such as:-<br>\nJimmy Doherty, an air raid warden (who later served in London during the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] blitz), who wrote a book on the Belfast blitz;<br>\nEmma Duffin, a nurse at the Queen's University Hospital, (who previously served during the [[World War I|Great War]]), who kept a [[diary]]; <br> \nand Major Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan, who produced a detailed report for the Dublin government. There are other diarists and narratives. Brian Barton of [[Queen's University, Belfast]], has written most on this topic.<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713203032/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}</ref>\n\n===Instructions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThere were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on Hallidays Road received a direct hit, killing all those in it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate that their homes had not received a direct hit or caught fire. In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a mill. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another building, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets, killing all those who remained in their homes.\n\nMajor O'Sullivan reported that \"In the heavily 'blitzed' areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.\"\n\nThat night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant [[Shankill Road, Belfast|Shankill area]], took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air-raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing.\n\n===Mortuary===\nThe mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. Two hundred and fifty-five corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/46 Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 46.]</ref> Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the [[Milltown Cemetery|Milltown]] and [[Belfast City Cemetery|Belfast City Cemeteries]].\n\n===Nurse Emma Duffin===\nNurse Emma Duffin, who had served in [[World War I]], contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:{{quote|(Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been ... made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.}}\n\n==Major Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nMajor Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs \"fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.\" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how \"in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the [[Mater Infirmorum Hospital|Mater Hospital]] at 2&nbsp;pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, ([[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor [[Errol Flynn]]), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of \"casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.\" O'Sullivan reported: \"There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead&nbsp;\u2013 heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.\". His report concluded with: \"a second Belfast <!-- word(s) missing? --> would be too horrible to contemplate\".<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\"/>\n\n===Refugees===\nTwo hundred and twenty thousand people fled from the city. Many \"arrived in [[Fermanagh]] having nothing with them only night shirts\". Ten thousand \"officially\" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of [[Dromara]] saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In [[Newtownards]], Bangor, Larne, [[Carrickfergus]], Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nMajor O'Sullivan reported on a:{{quote|continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings... Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference.\n\nTrain after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line. At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets ... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.}}\n\nMoya Woodside<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 20750128|title = Woman in Wartime: The Mass-Observation Diary of Moya Woodside|journal = The Irish Review (1986\u2013)|issue = 42|pages = 58\u201371|last1 = Muldowney|first1 = Mary|year = 2010}}</ref> noted in her diary: \"Evacuation is taking on panic proportions.

In each station volunteers were asked for, as it was beyond their normal duties. In every instance, all stepped forward. They remained for three days, until they were sent back by the Northern Ireland government. By then 250 firemen from Clydeside had arrived.\n\n[[Taoiseach]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] formally protested to Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |title=The Dublin Bombing |work=D\u00e1il Debates, Volume 83 |publisher=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann |date=5 June 1941 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922035553/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}</ref> He followed up with his \"they are our people\" speech, made in [[Castlebar]], County Mayo, on Sunday 20 April 1941 (Quoted in the Dundalk Democrat dated Saturday 26 April 1941):\n{{quote|In the past, and probably in the present, too, a number of them did not see eye to eye with us politically, but they are our people{{spaced ndash}}we are one and the same people{{spaced ndash}}and their sorrows in the present instance are also our sorrows; and I want to say to them that any help we can give to them in the present time we will give to them whole-heartedly, believing that were the circumstances reversed they would also give us their help whole-heartedly ...}}\n[[Frank Aiken]], the [[Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures|Irish Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures]] was in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] at the time.

A ''Luftwaffe'' pilot gave this description \"We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]] or [[Glasgow]].\" [[William Joyce]] \"Lord Haw-Haw\" announced that \"The F\u00fchrer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample.\" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from [[Joseph Goebbels]] were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that [[Adolf Hitler]], in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and [[Irish American]] politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[Eduard Hempel]], the German Minister to Ireland, visited the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish Ministry for External Affairs]] to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was \"clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.\" He stated that \"he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air\".\n\n===Recriminations===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThe government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. [[Tommy Henderson]], an Independent Unionist MP in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]], summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying \"The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.\"\n\n[[File:Belfast-Lough-2.png|thumb|left|A map showing the location of Belfast Lough]]\nUS journalist [[Ben Robertson (journalist)|Ben Robertson]] reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British.<ref name=\"ingersoll1940\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n213/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |pages=194}}</ref> One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In ''The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years'', Brian Barton wrote: \"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North.\" Barton insisted that Belfast was \"too far north\" to use radio guidance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOther writers, such as Tony Gray in ''The Lost Years'' state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of [[Belfast Lough]], would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: \"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany\", \"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population.\" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the [[IRA Army Council]] to [[IRA Abwehr World War II|support Germany]]. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However on 20 October 1941 the Garda captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and Sydenham aerodrome, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent raids'<ref>British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}} p397</ref><ref>Report by the Garda 23 October 1941 IMA G2/1722</ref>\n\n===Firemen return south===\nAfter three days, sometime after 6{{nbsp}}pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in [[Banbridge]]; others were entertained in the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] hall in [[Newry]]. In 1995 on the fiftieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War an invitation was received by the [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] for any survivors of that time to attend a function at [[Hillsborough Castle]] and meet [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Only four were known still to be alive; one, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Second major raid===\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-1945 H9464.jpg|thumb|Soldiers clearing rubble after the May air raid]]\nThere was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1{{nbsp}}am, ''Luftwaffe'' bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island. Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when \"203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs\"<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\">''Bombs on Belfast, The Blitz 1941'', Foreword Dr Ian Adamson (Colourpoint Books, 2011)</ref> were dropped. Over 150 people lost their lives in what became known as the 'Fire Blitz'.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nCasualties were lower than at Easter, partly because the sirens had sounded at 11.45{{nbsp}}pm while the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked more cautiously from a greater height. St George's Church in High Street was damaged by fire. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without waiting for an invitation.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Media depictions==\nThe 2017 film ''[[Zoo (2017 film)|Zoo]]'' depicts an air raid during the Belfast Blitz.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Blitz]]\n* [[Aerial bombing of cities]]\n* [[Harland and Wolff]]\n* [[Belfast]]\n* [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]\n* [[Bombing of Dublin in World War II]]\n* [[Ulster Defence Volunteers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Brian Barton (2015).

The first was on the night of 7{{ndash}}8 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on [[Easter Tuesday]], 15 April 1941. Two hundred [[bombers]] of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on [[London]], this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref name=bbrem>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm|title=The Belfast blitz is remembered|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2001|publisher=BBC News|quote=On 16 April 1941 Belfast was devastated as it bore the worst air raid of any city outside London [\u2026] It was one of the largest German strike forces used to date in the war and the ''Luftwaffe'' was heading for a city later described as the most poorly defended in the United Kingdom.}}</ref><ref name=membb>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a7713966.shtml|title=Memories of the Belfast Blitz|accessdate=19 January 2015|author= [[Belfast Central Library]]|work= WW2 People's War|publisher=BBC|quote=No city, save London, suffered more loss of life in one night\u2019s raid on the United Kingdom.}}</ref>\n\nThe third raid on Belfast took place over the evening and morning of 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941; 150 were killed.

Belfast made a considerable contribution towards the Allied war effort, producing many naval ships, aircraft and munitions; therefore, the city was deemed a suitable bombing target by the ''Luftwaffe''. Meanwhile, unlike Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State was no longer part of the UK.  Under the leadership of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], it had declared its [[Irish neutrality|neutrality]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Although it arrested German spies that its police and military intelligence services caught, the state never broke off diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers|Axis]] nations: the German Legation in [[Dublin]] remained open throughout the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keogh|first=Dermot|title=Eamon de Valera and Hitler: An Analysis of International Reaction to the Visit to the German Minister, May 1945|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/AAE/Article.pdf|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69\u201392|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Government===\nThe [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came.

There is no slacking in our loyalty.\"\n\nDawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, apparently refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts in 1939 that Belfast was regarded as \"a very definite German objective\", little was done outside providing shelters in the Harbour area.<ref>Barton, Brian, ''The Belfast Blitz: The City in the War Years'' 2015, p. 41-2.</ref>\n\n====Air-raid shelters====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nBelfast, the city with the highest population density per area in Britain at the time, also had the lowest proportion of public air-raid shelters. Prior to the \"Belfast Blitz\" there were only 200 public shelters in the city, although around 4,000 households had built their own private shelters. These private air-raid shelters were [[Air raid shelter#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelters]], constructed of sheets of [[corrugated galvanised iron]] covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them. \n\nNo searchlights were set up in the city at the time, and these only arrived on 10 April. There was no smokescreen ability, however there were some [[barrage balloon]]s positioned strategically for protection. Given Belfast's geographic position, it was considered to be at the fringe of the operational range of German bombers and hence there was no provision for night-fighter aerial cover. Indeed, on the night of the first raid, no [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft took to the air to intercept German planes. On the ground, there were only 22 anti-aircraft guns positioned around the city, six light and sixteen heavy, and on the first night only seven of these were manned and operational.\n\n====Children====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nFew children had been successfully evacuated. The \"Hiram Plan\" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.\n\n====German preparation====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nFrom papers recovered after the war, we know of a ''Luftwaffe'' reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:\n* [[Harland and Wolff]]\n* ''Die Tankstelle'' Conns Water\n* Short and Harland aircraft factory\n* The power station of Belfast\n* Rank & Co mill\n* Belfast waterworks\n* [[Victoria Barracks, Belfast|Victoria Barracks]]\n\n[[File:Johnmillerandrews.jpg|thumb|left|John Miller Andrews<br/>Prime Minister of Northern Ireland 1940\u201343. ''HMSO image'']]\n\n===Earlier raids===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThere had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]] or the cities of the [[North West England|northwest of England]].\nOn 24 March 1941, [[John MacDermott, Baron MacDermott|John MacDermott]], Minister for Security, wrote to Prime Minister John Andrews, expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected: \"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There <nowiki>[is]</nowiki> ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn.\" MacDermott would be proved right.\n\nThe first deliberate raid took place on the night of 7 April. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers, from ''Kampfgruppe 26'', flying at {{convert|7000|ft|m}}, dropped [[Incendiary bomb|incendiaries]], high explosive and parachute-mines. By British mainland blitz standards, casualties were light. Thirteen lost their lives, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft gun, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a {{convert|4.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} factory floor for manufacturing the [[fuselage]]s of [[Short Stirling]] bombers. The Royal Air Force announced that Squadron Leader J.W.C. Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over [[Downpatrick]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' crews returned to their base in Northern [[France]] and reported that Belfast's defences were, \"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient\". This raid overall causing relatively little damage but a lot was revealed about Belfast's inadequate defences.\n\n==Easter Tuesday Blitz==\n[[William Joyce]] (known as \"[[Lord Haw-Haw]]\") announced in radio broadcasts from Hamburg that there will be \"Easter eggs for Belfast\". {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Junkers Ju88.jpg|right|thumb|Junkers Ju-88]]\nOn [[Easter]] Tuesday, 15 April 1941, spectators watching a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match at [[Windsor Park]] noticed a lone [[Luftwaffe#World War I|Luftwaffe]] [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] Ju-88 aircraft circling overhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/belfastblitz//personal_peter.shtml|title=The most unprotected city in the UK|accessdate=19 January 2015|author=Peter Hughes|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nThat evening over 150 bombers left their bases in northern [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] and headed for [[Belfast]]. There were [[Heinkel He 111]]s, [[Junkers Ju 88]]s and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dorniers]]. At 10:40&nbsp;pm the [[Civil defense siren|air raid sirens sounded]]. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city. The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. Three vessels nearing completion at Harland and Wolff's were hit as was its power station. Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. When incendiaries were dropped, the city burned as water pressure was too low for effective firefighting.\n\nPublic buildings destroyed or badly damaged included Belfast City Hall's Banqueting Hall, the Ulster Hospital for Women and Children and Ballymacarrett library, (the last two being located on Templemore Avenue). Strand Public Elementary school, the LMS railway station, the adjacent Midland Hotel on York Road, and Salisbury Avenue tram depot were all hit. Churches destroyed or wrecked included Macrory Memorial Presbyterian in Duncairn Gardens; Duncairn Methodist, Castleton Presbyterian on York Road; St Silas's on the Oldpark Road; St James's on the [[Antrim Road]]; Newington Presbyterian on Limestone Road; Crumlin Road Presbyterian; Holy Trinity on Clifton Street and Clifton Street Presbyterian; York Street Presbyterian and York Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian; Newtownards Road Methodist and Rosemary Street Presbyterian (the last of which was not rebuilt).\n\nStreets heavily bombed in the city centre included High Street, Ann Street, Callender Street, Chichester Street, Castle Street, Tomb Street, Bridge Street (effectively obliterated), Rosemary Street, Waring Street, North Street, Victoria Street, Donegall Street, York Street, Gloucester Street, and East Bridge Street. In the east of the city, Westbourne and Newcastle Streets on the Newtownards Road, Thorndyke Street off the Albertbridge Road and Ravenscroft Avenue were destroyed or damaged. In the west and north of the city, streets heavily bombed included Percy Street, York Park, York Crescent, Eglinton Street, Carlisle Street, Ballyclare, Ballycastle and Ballynure Streets off the Oldpark Road; Southport Street, Walton Street, Antrim Road, Annadale Street, Cliftonville Road, Hillman Street, Atlantic Avenue, Hallidays Road, Hughenden Avenue, Sunningdale Park, Shandarragh Park, and Whitewell Road. Burke Street which ran between Annadale and Dawson streets in the New Lodge area, was completely wiped off the map with all its 20 houses flattened and all of the occupants killed.<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\"/>\n\nThere was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the [[anti-aircraft]] batteries ceased firing. But the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5{{nbsp}}am.\n\nFifty-five thousand houses were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. Outside of London, with some 900 dead, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during [[the Blitz]].<ref>Wills, (2007). ''That Neutral Island'', page 213.</ref> A stray bomber attacked [[Derry]], killing 15. Another attacked [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], killing five. By 4 am the entire city seemed to be in flames. At 4:15{{nbsp}}am John MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, managed to contact Basil Brooke (then Agriculture Minister), seeking permission to seek help from the Irish government. Brooke noted in his diary ''\"I gave him authority as it is obviously a question of expediency\"''. Since 1:45{{nbsp}}am all telephones had been cut. Fortunately, the [[Rail transport|railway]] telegraphy link between Belfast and Dublin was still operational. The telegram was sent at 4:35{{nbsp}}am,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} asking the Irish [[Taoiseach]], \u00c9amon de Valera for assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2011/0413/646678-radio-documentary-ww2-hidden-heroes-belfast-blitz-republic-firemen|title=Hidden Heroes of the Belfast Blitz|date=16 April 2011|website=rte.ie|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Human cost==\nOver 900 lives were lost, 1,500 people were injured, 400 of them seriously. Fifty-thousand houses, more than half the houses in the city, were damaged. Eleven churches, two hospitals and two schools were destroyed. These figures are based on newspaper reports of the time, personal recollections and other [[primary source]]s, such as:-<br>\nJimmy Doherty, an air raid warden (who later served in London during the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] blitz), who wrote a book on the Belfast blitz;<br>\nEmma Duffin, a nurse at the Queen's University Hospital, (who previously served during the [[World War I|Great War]]), who kept a [[diary]]; <br> \nand Major Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan, who produced a detailed report for the Dublin government. There are other diarists and narratives. Brian Barton of [[Queen's University, Belfast]], has written most on this topic.<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713203032/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/The_BlitzBelfast_during_the_second_World_War |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}</ref>\n\n===Instructions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThere were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on Hallidays Road received a direct hit, killing all those in it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate that their homes had not received a direct hit or caught fire. In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a mill. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another building, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets, killing all those who remained in their homes.\n\nMajor O'Sullivan reported that \"In the heavily 'blitzed' areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties.\"\n\nThat night almost 300 people, many from the Protestant [[Shankill Road, Belfast|Shankill area]], took refuge in the Clonard Monastery in the Catholic [[Falls Road (Belfast)|Falls Road]]. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy had been fitted out and opened to the public as an air-raid shelter. Prayers were said and hymns sung by the mainly Protestant women and children during the bombing.\n\n===Mortuary===\nThe mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. 150 corpses remained in the Falls Road baths for three days before they were buried in a mass grave, with 123 still unidentified. Two hundred and fifty-five corpses were laid out in St George's Market. Many bodies and body parts could not be identified.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/northernirelandi0000bart/page/46 Barton, (1995). ''Northern Ireland in the Second World War'', page 46.]</ref> Mass graves for the unclaimed bodies were dug in the [[Milltown Cemetery|Milltown]] and [[Belfast City Cemetery|Belfast City Cemeteries]].\n\n===Nurse Emma Duffin===\nNurse Emma Duffin, who had served in [[World War I]], contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:{{quote|(Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been ... made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.}}\n\n==Major Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nMajor Se\u00e1n O'Sullivan reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs \"fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.\" The most heavily bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road, north of the city centre. O'Sullivan felt that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how \"in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the [[Mater Infirmorum Hospital|Mater Hospital]] at 2&nbsp;pm, nine hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, ([[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], an Australian based at the Mater Hospital and father of actor [[Errol Flynn]]), head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of \"casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.\" O'Sullivan reported: \"There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead&nbsp;\u2013 heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc.\". His report concluded with: \"a second Belfast <!-- word(s) missing? --> would be too horrible to contemplate\".<ref name=\"multitext.ucc.ie\"/>\n\n===Refugees===\nTwo hundred and twenty thousand people fled from the city. Many \"arrived in [[Fermanagh]] having nothing with them only night shirts\". Ten thousand \"officially\" crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of [[Dromara]] saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In [[Newtownards]], Bangor, Larne, [[Carrickfergus]], Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nMajor O'Sullivan reported on a:{{quote|continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings... Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference.\n\nTrain after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line. At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets ... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.}}\n\nMoya Woodside<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 20750128|title = Woman in Wartime: The Mass-Observation Diary of Moya Woodside|journal = The Irish Review (1986\u2013)|issue = 42|pages = 58\u201371|last1 = Muldowney|first1 = Mary|year = 2010}}</ref> noted in her diary: \"Evacuation is taking on panic proportions.

In each station volunteers were asked for, as it was beyond their normal duties. In every instance, all stepped forward. They remained for three days, until they were sent back by the Northern Ireland government. By then 250 firemen from Clydeside had arrived.\n\n[[Taoiseach]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] formally protested to Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |title=The Dublin Bombing |work=D\u00e1il Debates, Volume 83 |publisher=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann |date=5 June 1941 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922035553/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0083/D.0083.194106050027.html |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}</ref> He followed up with his \"they are our people\" speech, made in [[Castlebar]], County Mayo, on Sunday 20 April 1941 (Quoted in the Dundalk Democrat dated Saturday 26 April 1941):\n{{quote|In the past, and probably in the present, too, a number of them did not see eye to eye with us politically, but they are our people{{spaced ndash}}we are one and the same people{{spaced ndash}}and their sorrows in the present instance are also our sorrows; and I want to say to them that any help we can give to them in the present time we will give to them whole-heartedly, believing that were the circumstances reversed they would also give us their help whole-heartedly ...}}\n[[Frank Aiken]], the [[Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures|Irish Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures]] was in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] at the time. He gave an interview saying: \"the people of Belfast are Irish people too\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tom Geraghty|author2=Trevor Whitehead|title=The Dublin Fire Brigade|date=2004|publisher=Dublin City Council|location=Dublin|isbn=978-0946841714|page=229}}<!--|accessdate=15 April 2015--></ref>\n\n===German response===\nInitial German radio broadcasts celebrated the raid. A ''Luftwaffe'' pilot gave this description \"We were in exceptional good humour knowing that we were going for a new target, one of England's last hiding places. Wherever [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] is hiding his war material we will go ... Belfast is as worthy a target as [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]] or [[Glasgow]].\" [[William Joyce]] \"Lord Haw-Haw\" announced that \"The F\u00fchrer will give you time to bury your dead before the next attack ... Tuesday was only a sample.\" However Belfast was not mentioned again by the Nazis. After the war, instructions from [[Joseph Goebbels]] were discovered ordering it not to be mentioned. It would appear that [[Adolf Hitler]], in view of de Valera's negative reaction, was concerned that de Valera and [[Irish American]] politicians might encourage the United States to enter the war. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[Eduard Hempel]], the German Minister to Ireland, visited the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish Ministry for External Affairs]] to offer sympathy and attempt an explanation. J.P. Walshe, assistant secretary, recorded that Hempel was \"clearly distressed by the news of the severe raid on Belfast and especially of the number of civilian casualties.\" He stated that \"he would once more tell his government how he felt about the matter and he would ask them to confine the operations to military objectives as far as it was humanly possible. He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air\".\n\n===Recriminations===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nThe government was blamed by some for inadequate precautions. [[Tommy Henderson]], an Independent Unionist MP in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]], summed up the feeling when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying \"The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh (ditch), below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good.\"\n\n[[File:Belfast-Lough-2.png|thumb|left|A map showing the location of Belfast Lough]]\nUS journalist [[Ben Robertson (journalist)|Ben Robertson]] reported that at night Dublin was the only city without a blackout between New York and Moscow, and between Lisbon and Sweden and that German bombers often flew overhead to check their bearings using its lights, angering the British.<ref name=\"ingersoll1940\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n213/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |pages=194}}</ref> One widespread criticism was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin and following the railway lines north. In ''The Blitz: Belfast in the War Years'', Brian Barton wrote: \"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North.\" Barton insisted that Belfast was \"too far north\" to use radio guidance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOther writers, such as Tony Gray in ''The Lost Years'' state that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of [[Belfast Lough]], would be easily located. Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] in particular guided the bombers. Barton wrote: \"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany\", \"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population.\" This view was probably influenced by the decision of the [[IRA Army Council]] to [[IRA Abwehr World War II|support Germany]]. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans, and information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on German aerial reconnaissance. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However on 20 October 1941 the Garda captured a comprehensive IRA report on captured member Helena Kelly giving a detailed analysis of damage inflicted on Belfast and highlighting prime targets such as Shortt and Harland aircraft factory and Sydenham aerodrome, describing them as 'the remaining and most outstanding objects of military significance, as yet unblitzed' and suggesting they should be 'bombed by the Luftwaffe as thoroughly as other areas in recent raids'<ref>British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}} p397</ref><ref>Report by the Garda 23 October 1941 IMA G2/1722</ref>\n\n===Firemen return south===\nAfter three days, sometime after 6{{nbsp}}pm, the fire crews from south of the border began taking up their hoses and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in [[Banbridge]]; others were entertained in the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] hall in [[Newry]]. In 1995 on the fiftieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War an invitation was received by the [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] for any survivors of that time to attend a function at [[Hillsborough Castle]] and meet [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Only four were known still to be alive; one, Tom Coleman, attended to receive recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Second major raid===\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-1945 H9464.jpg|thumb|Soldiers clearing rubble after the May air raid]]\nThere was a second massive air raid on Belfast on Sunday 4{{ndash}}5 May 1941, three weeks after that of Easter Tuesday. Around 1{{nbsp}}am, ''Luftwaffe'' bombers flew over the city, concentrating their attack on the Harbour Estate and Queen's Island. Nearby residential areas in east Belfast were also hit when \"203 metric tonnes of high explosive bombs, 80 land mines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs\"<ref name=\"Belfast 2011\">''Bombs on Belfast, The Blitz 1941'', Foreword Dr Ian Adamson (Colourpoint Books, 2011)</ref> were dropped. Over 150 people lost their lives in what became known as the 'Fire Blitz'.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nCasualties were lower than at Easter, partly because the sirens had sounded at 11.45{{nbsp}}pm while the ''Luftwaffe'' attacked more cautiously from a greater height. St George's Church in High Street was damaged by fire. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without waiting for an invitation.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Media depictions==\nThe 2017 film ''[[Zoo (2017 film)|Zoo]]'' depicts an air raid during the Belfast Blitz.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Blitz]]\n* [[Aerial bombing of cities]]\n* [[Harland and Wolff]]\n* [[Belfast]]\n* [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]\n* [[Bombing of Dublin in World War II]]\n* [[Ulster Defence Volunteers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Brian Barton (2015).
