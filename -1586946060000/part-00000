It is mainly used in the treatment of [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]]. [[Zanamivir]], used to treat [[influenzavirus|influenza (Flu)]], must be administered via inhaler.\n\nTo reduce deposition in the mouth and throat, and to reduce the need for precise synchronization of the start of inhalation with actuation of the device, [[metered-dose inhaler|MDI]]s are sometimes used with a complementary [[Asthma spacer|spacer]] or holding chamber device.\n\n==Types==\n===Metered-dose inhaler===\nThe most common type of inhaler is the pressurized [[metered-dose inhaler]] (MDI) which is made up of 3 standard components- a metal canister, plastic actuator, and a metering valve. H&T Presspart, based in Blackburn, UK, provide over 75% of the world's  can and actuator components to the pharmaceutical market. The metering valve is supplied by a number of companies including Aptar and Coster. In MDIs, medication is typically stored in solution in a pressurized canister that contains a propellant, although it may also be a suspension.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Hickey, A.J. |title=Pharmaceutical Inhalation Aerosol Technology |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=NY |year=2004 |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/pharmaceuticalin134anth|url-access=registration }}</ref> The MDI canister is attached to a plastic, hand-operated actuator. On activation, the metered-dose inhaler releases a fixed dose of medication in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol]] form. The correct procedure for using an MDI is to first fully exhale, place the mouth-piece of the device into the mouth, and having just started to inhale at a moderate rate, depress the canister to release the medicine. The aerosolized medication is drawn into the lungs by continuing to inhale deeply before holding the breath for 10 seconds to allow the aerosol to settle onto the walls of the [[bronchus|bronchittus]] and other airways of the lung.  Some inhalers are made to act instantly in case of an asthma attack, and others are made to act later.\n\n===Dry powder inhalers===\n[[File:Metered dose.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Dry powder inhaler]]s of the Turbohaler type, displaying no. of doses remaining (house key for scale)]]\n[[Dry powder inhaler]]s (DPI) release a metered or device-measured dose of powdered medication that is inhaled through a DPI device.\n\n===Nebulizers===\n[[Nebulizer]]s \u2014 supply the medication as an aerosol created from an aqueous formulation. Many babies, and younger children can use the nebulizer as a supplement to an inhaler. Many young children who are first diagnosed with asthma, will use a nebulizer.\n\n===Nasal===\nNasal inhalers contain [[decongestant]] drugs to relieve [[nasal congestion]] in the [[upper respiratory tract]].

In their place, inhalers now use [[hydrofluoroalkane]] (HFA).

These did not involve any special devices beyond the apparatus used for burning or heating to produce fumes. Early inhalation devices included one devised by John Mudge in 1778. It had a pewter mug with a hole allowing attachment of a flexible tube. Mudge used it for the treatment of coughs using opium. These devices evolved with modifications by Wolfe, Mackenzie (1872) and better mouth attachments such as by Beigel in 1866. Many of these early inhalers needed heat to vapourize the active chemical ingredient. The benefits of forced expiration and inspiration to treat asthma were noted by J. S. Monell in 1865. Chemicals used in inhalers included ammonia, chlorine, iodine, tar, balsams, turpentine camphor and numerous others in combinations.<ref>{{cite book| title=Inhalation in the treatment of disease: its therapeutics and practice| author=Cohen, J.

The device contained a rolled [[Candle wick|wick]] of [[polypropylene]] [[felt]] which held 15&nbsp;[[Litre#SI prefixes applied to the litre|milliliters]] of methoxyflurane.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of [[Procedural sedation and analgesia|conscious analgesia]] which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15&nbsp;milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly [[Amnesia|amnesic]] to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/>\n\nThe Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with [[bone fracture]]s and [[joint dislocation]]s,<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> and for dressing changes on [[burn]] patients.<ref name=Packer1969/> When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent [[adverse effect]] on [[Apgar score]]s.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> All [[vital signs]] remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and [[sedation]] until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the [[patient-controlled analgesia]] [[infusion pump]]s of today.<ref name=Major1966/><ref name=Dragon1967/><ref name=Firn1972/><ref name=Josephson1974/> The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the [[Penthrox inhaler]].<ref name=Babl2007/><ref name=Grindlay2009/><ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=McLennan2007/><ref name=Penthrox2009/><ref name=RADAR2010/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of medical inhalants]]\n* [[Decongestant]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Babl2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Babl FE, Jamison SR, Spicer M, Bernard S |title=Inhaled methoxyflurane as a prehospital analgesic in children (subscription required)|journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia|volume=18|issue=4|pages=404\u201310|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2006.00874.x|pmid=16842312}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Babl2007>{{cite journal|vauthors=Babl F, Barnett P, Palmer G, Oakley E, Davidson A |title=A pilot study of inhaled methoxyflurane for procedural analgesia in children (subscription required)|journal=Pediatric Anesthesia|volume=17|issue=2|pages=148\u201353|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.02037.x|pmid=17238886}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dragon1967>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dragon A, Goldstein I |title=Methoxyflurane: preliminary report on analgesic and mood modifying properties in dentistry (subscription required)|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1176\u201381|year=1967|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.1967.0358|pmid=5233333}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Firn1972>{{cite journal|author=Firn S|title=Methoxyflurane analgesia for burns dressings and other painful ward procedures in children (subscription required)|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|volume=44|issue=5|pages=517\u201322|year=1972|doi=10.1093/bja/44.5.517|pmid=5044082}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Grindlay2009>{{cite journal|vauthors=Grindlay J, Babl FE |title=Efficacy and safety of methoxyflurane analgesia in the emergency department and prehospital setting|journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=4\u201311|year=2009|pmid=19254307|doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2009.01153.x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Josephson1974>{{cite journal|vauthors=Josephson CA, Schwartz W |title=The Cardiff Inhaler and Penthrane.

These did not involve any special devices beyond the apparatus used for burning or heating to produce fumes. Early inhalation devices included one devised by John Mudge in 1778. It had a pewter mug with a hole allowing attachment of a flexible tube. Mudge used it for the treatment of coughs using opium. These devices evolved with modifications by Wolfe, Mackenzie (1872) and better mouth attachments such as by Beigel in 1866. Many of these early inhalers needed heat to vapourize the active chemical ingredient. The benefits of forced expiration and inspiration to treat asthma were noted by J. S. Monell in 1865. Chemicals used in inhalers included ammonia, chlorine, iodine, tar, balsams, turpentine camphor and numerous others in combinations.<ref>{{cite book| title=Inhalation in the treatment of disease: its therapeutics and practice| author=Cohen, J.

The 15&nbsp;milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly [[Amnesia|amnesic]] to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/>\n\nThe Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with [[bone fracture]]s and [[joint dislocation]]s,<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> and for dressing changes on [[burn]] patients.<ref name=Packer1969/> When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent [[adverse effect]] on [[Apgar score]]s.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> All [[vital signs]] remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and [[sedation]] until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the [[patient-controlled analgesia]] [[infusion pump]]s of today.<ref name=Major1966/><ref name=Dragon1967/><ref name=Firn1972/><ref name=Josephson1974/> The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the [[Penthrox inhaler]].<ref name=Babl2007/><ref name=Grindlay2009/><ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=McLennan2007/><ref name=Penthrox2009/><ref name=RADAR2010/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of medical inhalants]]\n* [[Decongestant]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Babl2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Babl FE, Jamison SR, Spicer M, Bernard S |title=Inhaled methoxyflurane as a prehospital analgesic in children (subscription required)|journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia|volume=18|issue=4|pages=404\u201310|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2006.00874.x|pmid=16842312}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Babl2007>{{cite journal|vauthors=Babl F, Barnett P, Palmer G, Oakley E, Davidson A |title=A pilot study of inhaled methoxyflurane for procedural analgesia in children (subscription required)|journal=Pediatric Anesthesia|volume=17|issue=2|pages=148\u201353|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.02037.x|pmid=17238886}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dragon1967>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dragon A, Goldstein I |title=Methoxyflurane: preliminary report on analgesic and mood modifying properties in dentistry (subscription required)|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1176\u201381|year=1967|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.1967.0358|pmid=5233333}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Firn1972>{{cite journal|author=Firn S|title=Methoxyflurane analgesia for burns dressings and other painful ward procedures in children (subscription required)|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|volume=44|issue=5|pages=517\u201322|year=1972|doi=10.1093/bja/44.5.517|pmid=5044082}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Grindlay2009>{{cite journal|vauthors=Grindlay J, Babl FE |title=Efficacy and safety of methoxyflurane analgesia in the emergency department and prehospital setting|journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=4\u201311|year=2009|pmid=19254307|doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2009.01153.x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Josephson1974>{{cite journal|vauthors=Josephson CA, Schwartz W |title=The Cardiff Inhaler and Penthrane.

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from Paoay, Ilocos Norte headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of Zambales has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of Zambales issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first gobernadorcillo and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of Labrador and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known and called before as ''San Isidro''\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n===Renaming===\nIn 1913, the mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz changed the town's\u00a0name to Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from San Isidro to Burgos in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\n===Spanish period===\nIn the first part of the 19th century, Mat\u00edas Guiang, a mighty sailor-explorer from the town of [[Paoay]], [[Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. Upon his return to the Ilocos region he told stories of his flourishing trade, he later decided to emigrate with his neighbors, relatives and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the westernmost part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the Agno River by tracing it.\n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]] and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most wealthy land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first [[Gobernadorcillo]] of the town. San Isidro de Potot was its incorporated name in honor of St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. The term \"Potot\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"clipped\", \"cut-off\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, Zambales (now,'''\u00a0'''Burgos, Pangasinan). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"Cazadores\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"hunters\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"tribunal\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], Zambales (now Pangasinan).\n\nIn San Isidro (now Burgos), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIn February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], Zambales (now Pangasinan) on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0'''[[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]], Pangasinan). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads cut-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"Juez de Cuchillo\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|principales]]\" and \"captains\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe small Spanish detachments in the northern towns of [[Zambales]] was defeated and around fifty Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\nWhen the Spanish troop had left, the town insurgents returned and established a local Katipunan Government.\n\n===American Occupation===\nThe Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. They went back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]], and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to [[Pangasinan]].\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. Dasol and Balincaguin seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0[[Apolinario Mabini]]). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n\n===World War II===\nDuring the Japanese Occupation in the year 1941-1945 was an era of terror and fear although the Japanese soldiers did not much disturbed the barrios of the town, this was due to Japanese high command to give compulsory contribution of rice and bamboos for their garrison.\n\nIn December 15, at the outbreak of World War II, for the second time the people felt danger and insecurity for their life and property that the Japanese soldiers were invading the country, while fighting the Japanese army, the people of the town looked after for their safety. Some went to caves nearby, others to the forests and still others made dug-outs, upon assuring their safety some families vacated their houses while those at home continued to live in fear.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902)\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron's feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n\n==Tourist destinations==\nThe town of Burgos may not be famous for many but this town is also a home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls that will surely be loved by many.\n*'''Cabongaoan White Sand Beach''': Cabongaoan Beach is a pristine beach located in the town of Burgos, Pangasinan. It lies in the coastal sitio of Cabongaoan in barangay Ilio-ilio.\n\n[[File:Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Cabongaoan Beach]]\n*'''Death Pool/Depth Pool (Lagoon)''': Cabongaoan Beach has another feature that makes it a cut above the rest of Pangasinan's beaches: the so-called \"Death Pool.\" This tidal pool on the rocky side of the beach gets filled with water when the waves crash against it. This tidal pool was also featured in the national television show ''[[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho]]''. As scary as its name may sound, it's perfectly safe to dive in and float around.\n*\n\n[[File:Death Pool, Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Death Pool]]\n*'''Sangbay Falls''': Located in Barangay San Vicente.

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from Paoay, Ilocos Norte headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of Zambales has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of Zambales issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first gobernadorcillo and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of Labrador and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==\n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. There seen to be no romance, no interesting incident, no glamour in connection with the naming of the town, judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its first name.\n===Renaming===\nIn 1913, the mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz changed the town's\u00a0name to Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from San Isidro to Burgos in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\n===Spanish period===\nIn the first part of the 19th century, Mat\u00edas Guiang, a mighty sailor-explorer from the town of [[Paoay]], [[Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. Upon his return to the Ilocos region he told stories of his flourishing trade, he later decided to emigrate with his neighbors, relatives and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the westernmost part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the Agno River by tracing it.\n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]] and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first [[Gobernadorcillo]] of the town. San Isidro de Potot was its incorporated name in honor of St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. The term \"Potot\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"clipped\", \"cut-off\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, Zambales (now,'''\u00a0'''Burgos, Pangasinan). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"Cazadores\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"hunters\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"tribunal\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], Zambales (now Pangasinan).\n\nIn San Isidro (now Burgos), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIn February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], Zambales (now Pangasinan) on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0'''[[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]], Pangasinan). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads cut-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"Juez de Cuchillo\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|principal\u00edas]]\" and \"captains\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe small Spanish detachments in the northern towns of [[Zambales]] was defeated and around fifty Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\nWhen the Spanish troop had left, the town insurgents returned and established a local Katipunan Government.\n\n===American Occupation===\nThe Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. They went back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]], and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to [[Pangasinan]].\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. Dasol and Balincaguin seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0[[Apolinario Mabini]]). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n\n===World War II===\nDuring the Japanese Occupation in the year 1941-1945 was an era of terror and fear although the Japanese soldiers did not much disturbed the barrios of the town, this was due to Japanese high command to give compulsory contribution of rice and bamboos for their garrison.\n\nIn December 15, at the outbreak of World War II, for the second time the people felt danger and insecurity for their life and property that the Japanese soldiers were invading the country, while fighting the Japanese army, the people of the town looked after for their safety. Some went to caves nearby, others to the forests and still others made dug-outs, upon assuring their safety some families vacated their houses while those at home continued to live in fear.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902)\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town's chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron's feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n\n==Tourist destinations==\nThe town of Burgos may not be famous for many but this town is also a home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls that will surely be loved by many.\n*'''Cabongaoan White Sand Beach''': Cabongaoan Beach is a pristine beach located in the town of Burgos, Pangasinan.
