{"title_page": "NATO Joint Military Symbology", "text_new": "{{short description|NATO standard for military map marking symbols}}\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2009}}\n[[File:Dywizja wiki niebieski.svg|thumb|right|200px|Symbol of the [[1st Legions Infantry Division (Poland)|Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division]] in modern NATO symbology]]\n\n'''NATO Joint Military Symbology''' is the [[NATO]] standard for military map marking symbols. Originally published in 1986 as Allied Procedural Publication 6 (APP-6), '''NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems''', the standard has evolved over the years and is currently in its fourth version (APP-6C). The symbols are designed to enhance [[NATO]]'s [[joint interoperability]] by providing a standard set of common symbols. APP-6 constituted a single system of joint military symbology for land, air, space and sea-based formations and units, which can be displayed for either automated map display systems or for manual map marking. It covers all of the joint services and can be used by them.\n\n==History==\nThe first basic military map symbols began to be used by western armies in the decades following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During [[World War I]], there was a degree of harmonisation between the British and French systems, including the adoption of the colour red for enemy forces and blue for allies; the British had previously used red for friendly troops because of the traditional red coats of British soldiers. However, the system now in use is broadly based on that devised by the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1917. The infantry symbol of a saltire in a rectangle was said to symbolise the crossed belts of an infantryman, while the single diagonal line for cavalry was said to represent the sabre belt. With the formation of NATO in 1949, the US Army system was standardized and adapted, with different shapes for friendly (blue rectangle), hostile (red diamond) and unknown (yellow [[quatrefoil]]) forces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hershey|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=Not Just Lines on a Map: A History of Military Mapping|url=http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Strategy & Tactics|volume=274|pages=22\u201327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107184638/http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|archive-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAPP-6A was promulgated in December 1999. The NATO standardization agreement that covers APP-6A is ''[[STANAG]] 2019'' (edition 4), promulgated in December 2000. APP-6A replaced ''APP-6'' (last version<!-- change 2 -->, July 1986), which had been promulgated in November 1984 (edition 3<!-- Also Edition 3 Amendment 1 (1990) --> of STANAG 2019 covered APP-6<!--\nNote:\nAPP-6 (1986) mentions that it \"replaces STANAG 2019 (Edition 2) ''Military Symbols'', which was designed for manual map marking.\"  Odds are that STANAG 2019 editions 1 or 2 promulgated [[Q-STAG]] 509 ''Military Symbols'', which dates back to the mid-1970s\n-->), and was replaced in turn by ''Joint Symbology APP-6(B)'' ([[APP-6B]]) in 2008 (STANAG 2019 edition 5, June 2008) and ''NATO Joint Military Symbology APP-6(C)'' ([[APP-6C]]) in 2011 (STANAG 2019 edition 6, May 2011).\n\nThe U.S. is the current custodian of APP-6A, which is equivalent to [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#MIL-STD-2525A|MIL-STD-2525A]].\n\n==Symbol sets==\nThe APP-6A standard provides common operational symbology along with details on their display and plotting to ensure the compatibility, and to the greatest extent possible, the interoperability of NATO land component ''command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence'' (C4I) systems, development, operations, and training. APP-6A addresses the efficient transmission of symbology information through the use of a standard methodology for symbol hierarchy, information taxonomy, and symbol identifiers.\n\nAPP-6A recognises five broad ''sets'' of symbols, each set using its own SIDC (Symbol identification coding) scheme:\n\n* Units, equipment, and installations\n* Military operations (tactical graphics)\n* METOC (meteorological and oceanographic)\n* Signals intelligence\n* MOOTW (military operations other than war)\n\n''Units, equipment, and installations'' consist of icons, generally framed, associated with a single point on the map. All sorts of graphical and textual modifiers may surround them, specifying categories, quantities, dates, direction of movement, etc.\n\n''Tactical graphics'' represent operational information that cannot be presented via icon-based symbols alone: unit boundaries, special area designations, and other unique markings related to battlespace geometry and necessary for battlefield planning and management. There are point, line and area symbols in this category.\n\n''Meteorological'' and ''oceanographic'' symbology is the only set not under the standard's control: rather, they are imported from the symbology established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]].\n\nThe ''signals intelligence'' and ''military operations other than war'' symbology sets stand apart from Units, Equipment, and Installations although they obey the same conventions (i.e., they consist of framed symbols associated to points on the map). They do not appear in APP-6A proper, having been introduced by MIL-STD-2525B.\n\n==Symbol composition==\nMost of the symbols designate specific points, and consist of a ''frame'' (a geometric border), a ''fill'', a constituent ''icon'', and optional symbol ''modifiers''. The latter are optional text fields or graphic indicators that provide additional information.\n\nThe frame provides a visual indication of the affiliation, battle dimension, and status of an operational object. The use of shape and colour is redundant, allowing the symbology to be used under less-than-ideal conditions such as a monochrome red display to preserve the operator's night vision. Nearly all symbols are highly stylised and can be drawn by persons almost entirely lacking in artistic skill; this allows one to draw a symbolic representation (a GRAPHREP, Graphical report) using tools as rudimentary as plain paper and pencil.\n\nThe frame serves as the base to which other symbol components and modifiers are added. In most cases a frame surrounds an icon. One major exception is equipment, which may be represented by icons alone (in which case the icons are coloured as the frame would be).\n\nThe fill is the area within a symbol. If the fill is assigned a colour, it provides an enhanced (redundant) presentation of information about the affiliation of the object. If colour is not used, the fill is transparent. A very few icons have fills of their own, which are not affected by affiliation.\n\nThe icons themselves, finally, can be understood as combinations of elementary glyphs that use simple composition rules, in a manner reminiscent of some ideographic writing systems such as [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]]. The standard, however, still attempts to provide an \"exhaustive\" listing of possible icons instead of laying out a dictionary of component glyphs. This causes operational problems when the need for an unforeseen symbol arises (particularly in MOOTW), a problem exacerbated by the administratively centralised maintenance of the symbology sets.\n\nWhen rendering symbols with the fill on, APP-6A calls for the frame and icon to be black or white (as appropriate for the display). When rendering symbols with the fill off, APP-6A calls for a monochrome frame and icon (usually black or in accordance with the affiliation colour). NATO symbols can also be rendered with fill off using a frame coloured according to affiliation and a black icon,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.ca/wiki/images/8/80/NATO_Map_Symbol_(Canadian)_Programmed_Instruction_Package_Jan_2000.pdf|title=NATO Map Symbol Programmed Instruction Package|date=Jan 2000|publisher=Canadian Forces School of Military Intelligence|page=6|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref> though this is not defined in any APP-6 standard.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Fill On.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill on\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome Colour.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome colour frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome B&W.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and bichrome frame and icon\n</gallery>\n\n==Affiliation==\n''Affiliation'' refers to the relationship of the tracker to the operational object being represented. The basic affiliation categories are ''unknown'', ''friend'', [[Neutral country|''neutral'']], and ''hostile''. In the ground unit domain, a yellow [[quatrefoil]] frame is used to denote unknown affiliation, a blue rectangle frame to denote friendly affiliation, a green square frame to denote neutral affiliation, and a red diamond frame to denote hostile affiliation.<ref name=\"APP1986\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/NATO_Symbols/APP-6.pdf|title=APP-6 Military Symbols For Land Based Symbols|last=Korkolis|first=M.|date=July 1986|website=alternatewars.com|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref>{{rp|11}} In the other domains (air and space, sea surface and subsurface, etc.), the same color scheme is used.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Instead, the original APP-6 described a series of \"colour representations\" with the purpose of distinguishing friendly and enemy elements.\n\n*Multi-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy)\n**Yellow for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n**Other colours to be established in a map legend\n*tri-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green or yellow for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy) and for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n*two colour representation: \n**Blue, Green, or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n*One colour representation:\n**Single line border for friendly icons\n**double line border for enemy icons, and unbordered icons were labeled with \"EN\" to the lower right corner\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit - B&W.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (B&W)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit - B&W (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (B&W)\n</gallery>\n\n==Battle dimension==\n''Battle dimension'' defines the primary mission area for the operational object within the battlespace. An object can have a mission area above the Earth's surface (i.e., in the air or outer space), on it, or below it. If the mission area of an object is on the surface, it can be either on land or sea. The subsurface dimension concerns those objects whose mission area is below the sea surface (e.g., submarines and sea mines). Some cases require adjudication; for example, an Army or Marine helicopter unit is a manoeuvring unit (i.e., a unit whose ground support assets are included) and is thus represented in the land dimension. Likewise, a landing craft whose primary mission is ferrying personnel or equipment to and from shore is a maritime unit and is represented in the sea surface dimension. A landing craft whose primary mission is to fight on land, on the other hand, is a ground asset and is represented in the\nland dimension.\n\nClosed frames are used to denote the land and sea surface dimensions, frames open at the bottom denote the air/space dimension, and frames open at the top denote the subsurface dimension.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Special Forces may operate in any dimension.\n\nThe full set of battle dimensions is, in ascending order of distance from Earth center:\n* SOF (F)\n* Sea subsurface (U)\n* Sea surface (S)\n* Ground (G)\n* Air (A)\n* Space (P)\n* Other (X)\n* Unknown (Z)\nThe mnemonic for this ordering is \"Fuss-Gap\".\n\nThe letter in parentheses is used by the symbol identification coding (SIDC) scheme \u2014 strings of 15 characters used to transmit symbols.\n\nThe space and air battle dimensions share a single frame shape. In the ground battle dimension, two different frames are used for the friendly (and assumed friendly) affiliations in order to distinguish between units and equipment. The SOF (special operations forces) are assigned their own battle dimension because they typically can operate across several domains (air, ground, sea surface and subsurface) in the course of a single mission; the frames are the same as for the ground (unit) battle dimension.<ref name=\"APP2005\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsymbs.com/APP-6ADRDCValcartierEdition121(Mod).pdf|title=Commented APP-6A - Military symbols for land based systems|last=Thibault|first=D.

This octagon is not actually shown when symbols are drawn or rendered but, with a few defined exceptions, all icons inside the frame would also fit inside these octagons. APP-6C modified some symbol frames from previous editions of the standard. From top to bottom, here is the symbol boundary shown inside the APP-6C frames of space elements, air elements, land units, land equipment and surface sea elements, and sub-surface sea elements.\n \n[[Image:NATO Map Symbol - Symbol Size boundary (APP-6C).svg|500px]]\n\n==Unit icons==\nThe icon is the innermost part of a symbol which, when displayed, provides an abstract pictorial or alphanumeric representation of an operational object. The icon portrays the role or mission performed by the object. APP-6A distinguishes between icons that must be framed or unframed and icons where framing is optional.<ref name=APP1986/>{{rp|39\u201343}}\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!Friendly unit symbol  || Hostile unit symbol  || Neutral unit symbol  || Unknown unit symbol  || Unit type\n|-\n|<div style=\"position:relative;

Neither the actual rank designated for a particular unit's commander, nor the rank held by the incumbent commander alters the appropriate symbol. For example, units are periodically commanded by an officer junior to the authorised commander grade, yet a company under the command of a Lieutenant (U.S.) or Captain (Commonwealth) is still indicated with two vertical ticks. Likewise, some peculiar types of companies and detachments are authorised a Major, Lieutenant Colonel (personnel services companies) or Colonel (some types of judge advocate detachments); the company or detachment is nevertheless indicated with, respectively, one vertical tick or three dots.\n\nWhile in Commonwealth armies, the regiment as a tactical formation does not normally exist, in some cases a regimental sized (i.e. larger than battalion and smaller than brigade) Task Force may exist where the operational requirement exists. These formations may be commanded by Colonels.\n\nNote that, for brigades and higher, the number of Xs corresponds to the number of stars in the United States military's insignia for the typical general officer grade commanding that size unit. For example, a division is capped with XX and is usually commanded by a major general the American insignia for which is two stars.\n\n==Status==\nThe ''status'' of a symbol refers to whether a warfighting object exists at the location identified (i.e., status is \"present\") or will in the future reside at that location (i.e., status is \"planned, anticipated, suspected,\" or \"on order\"). Regardless of affiliation, present status is indicated by a solid line and planned status by a dashed line. The frame is solid or dashed, unless the symbol icon is unframed, in which case the icon itself is drawn dashed. Planned status cannot be shown if the symbol is an unframed filled icon.\n\n==Symbol modifiers==\nAPP-6A stops with field AB. MIL-STD-2525B and 2525B Change 1 add a number of other modifiers.\n\n[[Image:APP-6A Field positions.svg|thumb|200px|Positions of the various graphic modifiers around the symbol (itself field A). MIL-STD-2525B Change 1 fails to specify where to place fields AD, AE, and AF.]]\n\n===Graphic modifiers===\n*''Echelon'' (field B) Identifies command level (see [[#Unit sizes|Unit sizes]], above).\n*''Task force'' (field D) Identifies a unit as a task force. It may be used alone or in combination with Echelon, like so: [[Image:Brigade Task Force.svg|19px]]<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n*''Frame shape modifier'' (field E) A short textual modifier that completes the affiliation, battle dimension, or exercise description of an object (\"U\", \"?\", \"X\", \"XU\", \"X?\", \"J\" or \"K\"). It is treated as a graphic modifier, however.\n*''Direction of movement'' (field Q) A fixed-length arrow that identifies the direction of movement or intended movement of an object. It emanates from the symbol's centre except in the ground domain, where it is hooked to a short offset, straight down from the symbol's base centre (see diagram).\n*''Mobility indicator'' (field R) Depicts the mobility of an object (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Mobility]], below). It is used only with equipment.\n*''Headquarters staff'' or ''offset location'' (field S) Identifies a unit as a headquarters, or indicates the object's actual location on the map when it has been shifted away in order to declutter the display. It goes straight down from the symbol's centre left, then angles towards the actual location (see diagram).\n*''Feint/dummy'' (field AB) Identifies a unit intended to draw the enemy's attention away from the area of the main attack, or a decoy designed to fool enemy intelligence. It consists of a dashed chevron, placed above the frame, like the echelon graphic modifier (the standard is unclear as to how the two combine graphically). See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Feints/Dummies]], below.\n*''Installation'' (field AC) Identifies a particular symbol as an installation. It sits atop the frame. See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Installations]], below.\n*''Auxiliary equipment'' (field AG) Indicates the presence of a towed sonar array (used exclusively in the sea surface or subsurface battle dimensions). It sits below the frame, like field R (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Auxiliary equipment]], below).\n*''Area of uncertainty'' (field AH) Indicates the area where an object is most likely to be, based on the object's last report and the reporting accuracy of the sensor that detected it. This can take various forms, such as an ellipse, a bounding box, or lines indicating probable bearing and distance.\n*''Dead reckoning trailer'' (field AI) Identifies where an object should be located at present, given its last reported course and speed. This can take the form of a dotted line (extending from the symbol to the dead-reckoned position) or a dotted circle (bounding the zone the object may have reached since, when the direction of movement is unknown or uncertain).\n*''Speed leader'' (field AJ) Depicts the speed and direction of movement of an object. It is identical to the Direction of Movement indicator except that its length is variable (and there is no arrow head).\n*''Pairing line'' (field AK) Connects two objects.\n\n====Feints/dummies and installations====\n'''Source:'''<ref name=APP2005/>{{rp|288}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n|-\n!

MIL-STD 2525A was the American standard for military symbols. The custodian of APP-6 is the United States. APP-6(A) remained unchanged as work on harmonizing it with ADatP-3, ''NATO Message Text Formatting System'' was carried out. In 1999, APP-6 was moved from the Army Service Board to the Joint Service Board. With this move, APP-6 was placed under the Information Exchange Requirements Harmonization/Message Text Format Working Group. The IERH/MTFWG then formed the Joint Symbology Panel to provide configuration management of APP-6 with the US custodian as the chairman. With the ratification and promulgation of APP-6(B) in 2008, the named was changed to ''NATO Military Symbology'' to better reflect the nature of the publication. In 2011, with the introduction of APP-6(C), the named was changed to ''NATO Joint Military Symbology''. The US military required new symbols to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the pace of change between APP-6 and MIL-STD-2525 remained uneven until 2009. In 2009, a new chairman for DOD Symbology Standardization Management Committee was appointed, and the two configuration management organizations began to work together. The two organizations held joint meetings with full participation on both sides. The goal of both groups is to develop comprehensive joint military symbology that is common to both organizations to the greatest extent possible. APP-6(C) began the process of changing the format of the publications and introduced new symbol identification codes.

Originally published in 1986 as Allied Procedural Publication 6 (APP-6), '''NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems''', the standard has evolved over the years and is currently in its fourth version (APP-6C). The symbols are designed to enhance [[NATO]]'s [[joint interoperability]] by providing a standard set of common symbols. APP-6 constituted a single system of joint military symbology for land, air, space and sea-based formations and units, which can be displayed for either automated map display systems or for manual map marking. It covers all of the joint services and can be used by them.\n\n==History==\nThe first basic military map symbols began to be used by western armies in the decades following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During [[World War I]], there was a degree of harmonisation between the British and French systems, including the adoption of the colour red for enemy forces and blue for allies; the British had previously used red for friendly troops because of the traditional red coats of British soldiers. However, the system now in use is broadly based on that devised by the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1917. The infantry symbol of a saltire in a rectangle was said to symbolise the crossed belts of an infantryman, while the single diagonal line for cavalry was said to represent the sabre belt. With the formation of NATO in 1949, the US Army system was standardized and adapted, with different shapes for friendly (blue rectangle), hostile (red diamond) and unknown (yellow [[quatrefoil]]) forces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hershey|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=Not Just Lines on a Map: A History of Military Mapping|url=http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Strategy & Tactics|volume=274|pages=22\u201327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107184638/http://strategyandtacticsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ST274-p22-27.pdf|archive-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAPP-6A was promulgated in December 1999. The NATO standardization agreement that covers APP-6A is ''[[STANAG]] 2019'' (edition 4), promulgated in December 2000. APP-6A replaced ''APP-6'' (last version<!-- change 2 -->, July 1986), which had been promulgated in November 1984 (edition 3<!-- Also Edition 3 Amendment 1 (1990) --> of STANAG 2019 covered APP-6<!--\nNote:\nAPP-6 (1986) mentions that it \"replaces STANAG 2019 (Edition 2) ''Military Symbols'', which was designed for manual map marking.\"  Odds are that STANAG 2019 editions 1 or 2 promulgated [[Q-STAG]] 509 ''Military Symbols'', which dates back to the mid-1970s\n-->), and was replaced in turn by ''Joint Symbology APP-6(B)'' ([[APP-6B]]) in 2008 (STANAG 2019 edition 5, June 2008) and ''NATO Joint Military Symbology APP-6(C)'' ([[APP-6C]]) in 2011 (STANAG 2019 edition 6, May 2011).\n\nThe U.S. is the current custodian of APP-6A, which is equivalent to [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#MIL-STD-2525A|MIL-STD-2525A]].\n\n==Symbol sets==\nThe APP-6A standard provides common operational symbology along with details on their display and plotting to ensure the compatibility, and to the greatest extent possible, the interoperability of NATO land component ''command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence'' (C4I) systems, development, operations, and training. APP-6A addresses the efficient transmission of symbology information through the use of a standard methodology for symbol hierarchy, information taxonomy, and symbol identifiers.\n\nAPP-6A recognises five broad ''sets'' of symbols, each set using its own SIDC (Symbol identification coding) scheme:\n\n* Units, equipment, and installations\n* Military operations (tactical graphics)\n* METOC (meteorological and oceanographic)\n* Signals intelligence\n* MOOTW (military operations other than war)\n\n''Units, equipment, and installations'' consist of icons, generally framed, associated with a single point on the map. All sorts of graphical and textual modifiers may surround them, specifying categories, quantities, dates, direction of movement, etc.\n\n''Tactical graphics'' represent operational information that cannot be presented via icon-based symbols alone: unit boundaries, special area designations, and other unique markings related to battlespace geometry and necessary for battlefield planning and management. There are point, line and area symbols in this category.\n\n''Meteorological'' and ''oceanographic'' symbology is the only set not under the standard's control: rather, they are imported from the symbology established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]].\n\nThe ''signals intelligence'' and ''military operations other than war'' symbology sets stand apart from Units, Equipment, and Installations although they obey the same conventions (i.e., they consist of framed symbols associated to points on the map). They do not appear in APP-6A proper, having been introduced by MIL-STD-2525B.\n\n==Symbol composition==\nMost of the symbols designate specific points, and consist of a ''frame'' (a geometric border), a ''fill'', a constituent ''icon'', and optional symbol ''modifiers''. The latter are optional text fields or graphic indicators that provide additional information.\n\nThe frame provides a visual indication of the affiliation, battle dimension, and status of an operational object. The use of shape and colour is redundant, allowing the symbology to be used under less-than-ideal conditions such as a monochrome red display to preserve the operator's night vision. Nearly all symbols are highly stylised and can be drawn by persons almost entirely lacking in artistic skill; this allows one to draw a symbolic representation (a GRAPHREP, Graphical report) using tools as rudimentary as plain paper and pencil.\n\nThe frame serves as the base to which other symbol components and modifiers are added. In most cases a frame surrounds an icon. One major exception is equipment, which may be represented by icons alone (in which case the icons are coloured as the frame would be).\n\nThe fill is the area within a symbol. If the fill is assigned a colour, it provides an enhanced (redundant) presentation of information about the affiliation of the object. If colour is not used, the fill is transparent. A very few icons have fills of their own, which are not affected by affiliation.\n\nThe icons themselves, finally, can be understood as combinations of elementary glyphs that use simple composition rules, in a manner reminiscent of some ideographic writing systems such as [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]]. The standard, however, still attempts to provide an \"exhaustive\" listing of possible icons instead of laying out a dictionary of component glyphs. This causes operational problems when the need for an unforeseen symbol arises (particularly in MOOTW), a problem exacerbated by the administratively centralised maintenance of the symbology sets.\n\nWhen rendering symbols with the fill on, APP-6A calls for the frame and icon to be black or white (as appropriate for the display). When rendering symbols with the fill off, APP-6A calls for a monochrome frame and icon (usually black or in accordance with the affiliation colour). NATO symbols can also be rendered with fill off using a frame coloured according to affiliation and a black icon,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.ca/wiki/images/8/80/NATO_Map_Symbol_(Canadian)_Programmed_Instruction_Package_Jan_2000.pdf|title=NATO Map Symbol Programmed Instruction Package|date=Jan 2000|publisher=Canadian Forces School of Military Intelligence|page=6|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref> though this is not defined in any APP-6 standard.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Fill On.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill on\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome Colour.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome colour frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry - Friendly - Monochrome B&W.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and monochrome frame and icon\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Mechanized Infantry.svg|Friendly mechanized infantry with fill off and bichrome frame and icon\n</gallery>\n\n==Affiliation==\n''Affiliation'' refers to the relationship of the tracker to the operational object being represented. The basic affiliation categories are ''unknown'', ''friend'', [[Neutral country|''neutral'']], and ''hostile''. In the ground unit domain, a yellow [[quatrefoil]] frame is used to denote unknown affiliation, a blue rectangle frame to denote friendly affiliation, a green square frame to denote neutral affiliation, and a red diamond frame to denote hostile affiliation.<ref name=\"APP1986\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/NATO_Symbols/APP-6.pdf|title=APP-6 Military Symbols For Land Based Symbols|last=Korkolis|first=M.|date=July 1986|website=alternatewars.com|access-date=Nov 14, 2018}}</ref>{{rp|11}} In the other domains (air and space, sea surface and subsurface, etc.), the same color scheme is used.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Instead, the original APP-6 described a series of \"colour representations\" with the purpose of distinguishing friendly and enemy elements.\n\n*Multi-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy)\n**Yellow for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n**Other colours to be established in a map legend\n*tri-colour representation: \n**Blue or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n**Green or yellow for man-made obstacles (friendly or enemy) and for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear events\n*two colour representation: \n**Blue, Green, or black for friendly icons\n**Red for enemy icons\n*One colour representation:\n**Single line border for friendly icons\n**double line border for enemy icons, and unbordered icons were labeled with \"EN\" to the lower right corner\n\n<gallery>\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (colour)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Friendly Unit - B&W.svg|APP-6 friendly unit (B&W)\nFile:NATO Map Symbol - Hostile Unit - B&W (Old).svg|APP-6 enemy unit (B&W)\n</gallery>\n\n==Battle dimension==\n''Battle dimension'' defines the primary mission area for the operational object within the battlespace. An object can have a mission area above the Earth's surface (i.e., in the air or outer space), on it, or below it. If the mission area of an object is on the surface, it can be either on land or sea. The subsurface dimension concerns those objects whose mission area is below the sea surface (e.g., submarines and sea mines). Some cases require adjudication; for example, an Army or Marine helicopter unit is a manoeuvring unit (i.e., a unit whose ground support assets are included) and is thus represented in the land dimension. Likewise, a landing craft whose primary mission is ferrying personnel or equipment to and from shore is a maritime unit and is represented in the sea surface dimension. A landing craft whose primary mission is to fight on land, on the other hand, is a ground asset and is represented in the\nland dimension.\n\nClosed frames are used to denote the land and sea surface dimensions, frames open at the bottom denote the air/space dimension, and frames open at the top denote the subsurface dimension.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Special Forces may operate in any dimension.\n\nThe full set of battle dimensions is, in ascending order of distance from Earth center:\n* SOF (F)\n* Sea subsurface (U)\n* Sea surface (S)\n* Ground (G)\n* Air (A)\n* Space (P)\n* Other (X)\n* Unknown (Z)\nThe mnemonic for this ordering is \"Fuss-Gap\".\n\nThe letter in parentheses is used by the symbol identification coding (SIDC) scheme \u2014 strings of 15 characters used to transmit symbols.\n\nThe space and air battle dimensions share a single frame shape. In the ground battle dimension, two different frames are used for the friendly (and assumed friendly) affiliations in order to distinguish between units and equipment. The SOF (special operations forces) are assigned their own battle dimension because they typically can operate across several domains (air, ground, sea surface and subsurface) in the course of a single mission; the frames are the same as for the ground (unit) battle dimension.<ref name=\"APP2005\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsymbs.com/APP-6ADRDCValcartierEdition121(Mod).pdf|title=Commented APP-6A - Military symbols for land based systems|last=Thibault|first=D.

This octagon is not actually shown when symbols are drawn or rendered but, with a few defined exceptions, all icons inside the frame would also fit inside these octagons. APP-6C modified some symbol frames from previous editions of the standard. From top to bottom, here is the symbol boundary shown inside the APP-6C frames of space elements, air elements, land units, land equipment and surface sea elements, and sub-surface sea elements.\n \n[[Image:NATO Map Symbol - Symbol Size boundary (APP-6C).svg|500px]]\n\n==Unit icons==\nThe icon is the innermost part of a symbol which, when displayed, provides an abstract pictorial or alphanumeric representation of an operational object. The icon portrays the role or mission performed by the object. APP-6A distinguishes between icons that must be framed or unframed and icons where framing is optional.<ref name=APP1986/>{{rp|39\u201343}}\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|-\n!Friendly unit symbol  || Hostile unit symbol  || Neutral unit symbol  || Unknown unit symbol  || Unit type\n|-\n|<div style=\"position:relative;

Neither the actual rank designated for a particular unit's commander, nor the rank held by the incumbent commander alters the appropriate symbol. For example, units are periodically commanded by an officer junior to the authorised commander grade, yet a company under the command of a Lieutenant (U.S.) or Captain (Commonwealth) is still indicated with two vertical ticks. Likewise, some peculiar types of companies and detachments are authorised a Major, Lieutenant Colonel (personnel services companies) or Colonel (some types of judge advocate detachments); the company or detachment is nevertheless indicated with, respectively, one vertical tick or three dots.\n\nWhile in Commonwealth armies, the regiment as a tactical formation does not normally exist, in some cases a regimental sized (i.e. larger than battalion and smaller than brigade) Task Force may exist where the operational requirement exists. These formations may be commanded by Colonels.\n\nNote that, for brigades and higher, the number of Xs corresponds to the number of stars in the United States military's insignia for the typical general officer grade commanding that size unit. For example, a division is capped with XX and is usually commanded by a major general the American insignia for which is two stars.\n\n==Status==\nThe ''status'' of a symbol refers to whether a warfighting object exists at the location identified (i.e., status is \"present\") or will in the future reside at that location (i.e., status is \"planned, anticipated, suspected,\" or \"on order\"). Regardless of affiliation, present status is indicated by a solid line and planned status by a dashed line. The frame is solid or dashed, unless the symbol icon is unframed, in which case the icon itself is drawn dashed. Planned status cannot be shown if the symbol is an unframed filled icon.\n\n==Symbol modifiers==\nAPP-6A stops with field AB. MIL-STD-2525B and 2525B Change 1 add a number of other modifiers.\n\n[[Image:APP-6A Field positions.svg|thumb|200px|Positions of the various graphic modifiers around the symbol (itself field A). MIL-STD-2525B Change 1 fails to specify where to place fields AD, AE, and AF.]]\n\n===Graphic modifiers===\n*''Echelon'' (field B) Identifies command level (see [[#Unit sizes|Unit sizes]], above).\n*''Task force'' (field D) Identifies a unit as a task force. It may be used alone or in combination with Echelon, like so: [[Image:Brigade Task Force.svg|19px]]<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n*''Frame shape modifier'' (field E) A short textual modifier that completes the affiliation, battle dimension, or exercise description of an object (\"U\", \"?\", \"X\", \"XU\", \"X?\", \"J\" or \"K\"). It is treated as a graphic modifier, however.\n*''Direction of movement'' (field Q) A fixed-length arrow that identifies the direction of movement or intended movement of an object. It emanates from the symbol's centre except in the ground domain, where it is hooked to a short offset, straight down from the symbol's base centre (see diagram).\n*''Mobility indicator'' (field R) Depicts the mobility of an object (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Mobility]], below). It is used only with equipment.\n*''Headquarters staff'' or ''offset location'' (field S) Identifies a unit as a headquarters, or indicates the object's actual location on the map when it has been shifted away in order to declutter the display. It goes straight down from the symbol's centre left, then angles towards the actual location (see diagram).\n*''Feint/dummy'' (field AB) Identifies a unit intended to draw the enemy's attention away from the area of the main attack, or a decoy designed to fool enemy intelligence. It consists of a dashed chevron, placed above the frame, like the echelon graphic modifier (the standard is unclear as to how the two combine graphically). See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Feints/Dummies]], below.\n*''Installation'' (field AC) Identifies a particular symbol as an installation. It sits atop the frame. See [[#Feints/dummies and installations|Installations]], below.\n*''Auxiliary equipment'' (field AG) Indicates the presence of a towed sonar array (used exclusively in the sea surface or subsurface battle dimensions). It sits below the frame, like field R (see [[#Mobility and auxiliary equipment|Auxiliary equipment]], below).\n*''Area of uncertainty'' (field AH) Indicates the area where an object is most likely to be, based on the object's last report and the reporting accuracy of the sensor that detected it. This can take various forms, such as an ellipse, a bounding box, or lines indicating probable bearing and distance.\n*''Dead reckoning trailer'' (field AI) Identifies where an object should be located at present, given its last reported course and speed. This can take the form of a dotted line (extending from the symbol to the dead-reckoned position) or a dotted circle (bounding the zone the object may have reached since, when the direction of movement is unknown or uncertain).\n*''Speed leader'' (field AJ) Depicts the speed and direction of movement of an object. It is identical to the Direction of Movement indicator except that its length is variable (and there is no arrow head).\n*''Pairing line'' (field AK) Connects two objects.\n\n====Feints/dummies and installations====\n'''Source:'''<ref name=APP2005/>{{rp|288}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black; background:white;\" cellpadding=\"3\"<!--- scale is 1:66.666...px --->\n|-\n!

MIL-STD 2525A was the American standard for military symbols. The custodian of APP-6 is the United States. APP-6(A) remained unchanged as work on harmonizing it with ADatP-3, ''NATO Message Text Formatting System'' was carried out. In 1999, APP-6 was moved from the Army Service Board to the Joint Service Board. With this move, APP-6 was placed under the Information Exchange Requirements Harmonization/Message Text Format Working Group. The IERH/MTFWG then formed the Joint Symbology Panel to provide configuration management of APP-6 with the US custodian as the chairman. With the ratification and promulgation of APP-6(B) in 2008, the named was changed to ''NATO Military Symbology'' to better reflect the nature of the publication. In 2011, with the introduction of APP-6(C), the named was changed to ''NATO Joint Military Symbology''. The US military required new symbols to support ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the pace of change between APP-6 and MIL-STD-2525 remained uneven until 2009. In 2009, a new chairman for DOD Symbology Standardization Management Committee was appointed, and the two configuration management organizations began to work together. The two organizations held joint meetings with full participation on both sides. The goal of both groups is to develop comprehensive joint military symbology that is common to both organizations to the greatest extent possible. APP-6(C) began the process of changing the format of the publications and introduced new symbol identification codes.

When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. The name Steubenville was derived from [[Fort Steuben]] to honor [[Baron von Steuben]] (the fort was named for the Baron).

Steubenville received a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]], which connected [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\nIn 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar]]s of the [[Third Order of St. Francis|Third Order Regular]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franciscan University of Steubenville |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=2006-11-07 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2514}}</ref> In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Franciscan University of Steubenville |accessdate=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118000741/http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded.

In 2009, the college expanded its service district by three Ohio counties, and was renamed again: [[Eastern Gateway Community College]].\n\nThe city gained international attention in late 2012 from the events surrounding the [[Steubenville High School rape case]], which occurred in August 2012. The case was first covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that December, followed by the computer hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] later that month, and the subsequent coverage of the trials in late 2013.

Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets (at $85 each) were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006.

When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. The name Steubenville was derived from [[Fort Steuben]] to honor [[Baron von Steuben]] (the fort was named for the Baron).

Steubenville received a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]], which connected [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\nIn 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar]]s of the [[Third Order of St. Francis|Third Order Regular]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franciscan University of Steubenville |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=2006-11-07 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2514}}</ref> In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Franciscan University of Steubenville |accessdate=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118000741/http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded.

Corporations such as [[Weirton Steel]] have had to reduce their workforce in order to become more efficient and competitive against other steel producers and lower steel prices worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe new Findlay Connector has been built in western [[Pennsylvania]] as a toll-access highway between [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] at [[Interstate 376]] and U.S. Route 22 in northwestern [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]]. Travel time between the Pittsburgh International Airport and the city of Steubenville is now approximately 25 minutes.\n\nSteubenville is located near two large [[shale]] formations - the [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus]] and Utica formations.\n\n==Culture==\n===Historic sites===\nFort Steuben, located downtown on South Third Street, is a reconstructed 18th century fort on its original location overlooking the Ohio River. Built in 1787 to protect the government surveyors of the [[Seven Ranges]] of the Northwest Territory, Fort Steuben housed 150 men of the 1st American Regiment. The non-profit organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Berkman Amphitheater. The Fort Steuben Visitors center is home to the Museum Shop and the Steubenville Convention & Visitors Bureau and is an official site on the Ohio River Scenic Byway.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAdjacent to the fort is the First Federal Land Office with its original logs from 1801. After the Ohio country was surveyed, it could be sold or given away as land grants; the settlers brought their deeds to be registered at the Land Office to David Hoge, the Registrar of Lands and Titles for the Northwest Territory.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n\"Ohio Valley Steelworker\" Statue was created by artist Dimitri Akis as a tribute to the [[Ohio Valley]] [[Steelworkers]].  The life-size figure carries a long-handled dipping ladle and is wearing the hooded fire-proof suit worn in the steel mills. The statue was located at the junction of Hwy 22 (University Blvd) and Hwy 7 (Dean Martin Blvd).  In the fall of 2014, the statue was moved to its new home, displayed on South Fourth Street at the site of the Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/611930/Steelworker-on-the-move.html?nav=5010|title=Steelworker on the Move|first=Dave|last=Gossett|date=13 November 2014|newspaper=Herald-Star|access-date=2014-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220062105/http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/611930/Steelworker-on-the-move.html?nav=5010|archive-date=2014-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere is a statue downtown commemorating [[Edwin Stanton]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[secretary of war]].

The 6th district is the longest US House district in Ohio and runs along the southeast state borders of Ohio.\n\n====Political corruption====\nSteubenville has had a reputation for [[political corruption]]. Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006. WTOV9]</ref>\n\nIn mid-2006, an attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands of tickets totaling $258,000.<ref name=\"HS_050407\">{{cite news | last = Law | first = Mark | title = Traffic camera case returns | publisher = Herald Star | date = 2007-05-04 | url = http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 | accessdate = 2007-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055147/http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Stern also gathered enough signatures from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the question of whether the city's ordinance authorizing the speed camera program should continue.
