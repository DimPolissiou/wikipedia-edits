beachfront neighborhood within Los Angeles, California. It is located within the urban region of western [[Los Angeles County]] known as the [[Westside Los Angeles|Westside]].\n\nVenice was founded in 1905 as a seaside resort town. It was an independent city until 1926, when it merged with Los Angeles. Venice is known for its canals, beaches, and the circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a  {{convert|2+1/2|mi|km|spell=in|adj=on}} pedestrian promenade that features [[Street performance|performers]], [[Fortune-telling|fortune-tellers]], artists and [[Hawker (trade)#North America|vendors]]. In the latter half of the 2010s, the neighborhood has faced severe gentrification that raised real-estate prices and pushed out many long-term inhabitants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-venice-density-20170719-story.html|title=They discover, they gentrify, they ruin: How 'progress' is wrecking Los Angeles neighborhoods|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|date=July 19, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\nIn 1839, a region called La Ballona that included the southern parts of Venice, was granted by the Mexican government to Machados and Talamantes, giving them title to [[Rancho La Ballona]].<ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb2h4nb1ph/?order=31&brand=calisphere diseno Rancho La Ballona]</ref><ref>[http://www.reisvalleyandmudville.com/images/toposantamonicasouth.jpg 1900 USGS topographic map]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://digarc.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/view/search/CHS-13060 Map of old Spanish and Mexican ranchos in Los Angeles County]</ref> Later this became part of [[Port Ballona]].\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Venice Pavilion and Ship Cafe, ca.1905-1913 (CHS-2776).jpg|right|thumb|Venice Pavilion and Ship Cafe, ca.1905\u20131913]]\n[[File:Venice-CA-1913-winwardave.jpg|thumb|right|Windward Avenue, 1913]]\n\nVenice, originally called \"Venice of America,\" was founded by wealthy developer [[Abbot Kinney]] in 1905 as a beach resort town, {{convert|14|mi|km}} west of Los Angeles. He and his partner Francis Ryan had bought two miles (3.24 km) of oceanfront property south of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] in 1891. They built a resort town on the north end of the property, called Ocean Park, which was soon annexed to Santa Monica. After Ryan died, Kinney and his new partners continued building south of Navy Street. After the partnership dissolved in 1904, Kinney, who had won the marshy land on the south end of the property in a coin flip with his former partners, began to build a seaside resort like the [[Venice|namesake Italian city]].<ref name=alexander>{{cite book|author1=Elayne Alexander|author2=Bryan L.

Kinney hired artist [[Felix Peano]] to design the columns of the buildings.{{r|alexander|p=22|q=Metal sculptor Felix Peano designed the columns and statues.}} Included in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] are several faces, modeled after Kinney himself and a local girl named [[Nettie Bouck]].<ref name=\"nellie\">{{cite web | url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peano-faces-venice-beach | title=Peano's Faces of Venice Beach \u2013 Los Angeles, California \u2013 Atlas Obscura | accessdate=April 17, 2018 | newspaper=Https}}</ref><ref name=\"MyUser_Betsysellsvenice.com_April_17_2018c\">{{cite web | url=http://www.betsysellsvenice.com/venice-vanguard-newsletter-september-2005/ | title=Venice Vanguard Newsletter \u2013 September 2005 \u2013 Betsy Sells Venice | accessdate=April 17, 2018 | newspaper=Betsysellsvenice.com | quote=These cast iron sculptures were done by Felix Peano, an Italian sculptor whose work achieved more than a modest degree of fame at the turn of the century. Peano was an intimate friend of Jack London and was well known in the San Francisco Bay area. He was employed by Abbot Kinney to add his embelishments to the dream called Venice of America.  The faces on the columns are classical in style, easily traceable to the influence of ancient Rome. Yet Peano did not go all the way back in time for his inspiration. He found it in a young girl of 17 who was living on the ocean front in 1904, watching Venice grow around her. \"It was almost an embarrassing moment,\" explains Nettie Bouck. \"Felix Peano was at our house, actually at that time it was the house of my future father-in-law, Mr. Bouck. I don\u00b4t know why. He just all of a sudden reached out and grabbed me. He was an Italian gentleman and very, very emotional. And he held my face, my hands, put his hands on my face and looked at it.\" Peano insisted that he would use those features in the work he was doing for Mr. Kinney. They showed up as the female face atop the Windward Avenue pillars. \"Well, it was not a likeness of me, but the face, the contours of my face, gave him the idea to use it for the heads on the columns. There was really no big story or history about it,\" insists Mrs. Bouck, \"except that he got a little bit over-enthusiastic I guess.\"}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venice, CA capital.jpg|thumb|Capital designed by Felix Peano, featuring faces of Abbot Kinney (L) and Nettie Bouck (R)]]\n\nTourists, mostly arriving on the \"Red Cars\" of the [[Pacific Electric Railway]] from Los Angeles and Santa Monica, then rode the [[Venice Miniature Railway]] and [[gondola]]s to tour the town. The biggest attraction was Venice's mile-long gently sloping beach. Cottages and housekeeping tents were available for rent.{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.venicenc.org/readpost.php?news_id=205|title=Be Proud of Venice's History|last=|first=|date=2017-01-12|website=Venice Neighborhood Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe population (3,119 residents in 1910) soon exceeded 10,000; the town drew 50,000 to 150,000 tourists on weekends.{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}\n\n===Amusement pier===\n[[File:Several people stroll by the Dance Hall on the Amusement Pier at Venice Beach, ca.1900-1920.jpg|thumb|right|People strolling by the dance hall on the amusement pier, 1920 or before]]\n[[File:Crowds outside at the Venice Beach Amusement Park in Venice, between Seventeenth Street and Thirty-fourth Street along the ocean front, ca.1900-1920 (examiner-m3800).jpg|thumb|right|Crowds between 17th and 34th streets, with roller coaster in background, 1920 or before]]\n\nAttractions on the Kinney Pier became more amusement-oriented by 1910, when a [[Venice Miniature Railway]], Aquarium, Virginia Reel, Whip, Racing Derby, and other rides and game booths were added. Since the business district was allotted only three one-block-long streets, and the City Hall was more than a mile away, other competing business districts developed. Unfortunately, this created a fractious political climate. Kinney, however, governed with an iron hand and kept things in check. When he died in November 1920, Venice became harder to govern. With the amusement pier burning six weeks later in December 1920, and Prohibition (which had begun the previous January), the town's tax revenue was severely affected.{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}\n\nThe Kinney family rebuilt their amusement pier quickly to compete with Ocean Park's Pickering Pleasure Pier and the new Sunset Pier. When it opened it had two roller coasters, a new Racing Derby, a Noah's Ark, a Mill Chutes, and many other rides. By 1925 with the addition of a third coaster, a tall Dragon Slide, [[Fun House]], and Flying Circus aerial ride, it was the finest amusement pier on the West Coast. Several hundred thousand tourists visited on weekends. In 1923, Charles Lick built the Lick Pier at Navy Street in Venice, adjacent to the Ocean Park Pier at Pier Avenue in Ocean Park. Another pier was planned for Venice in 1925 at Leona Street (now Washington Street).{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}\n\nFor the amusement of the public, Kinney hired aviators to do aerial stunts over the beach. One of them, movie aviator and Venice airport owner [[B. H. DeLay]], implemented the first lighted airport in the United States on DeLay Field (previously known as [[Ince Field]]). He also initiated the first aerial police in the nation, after a marine rescue attempt was thwarted. DeLay also performed many of the world's first aerial stunts for motion pictures in Venice.{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}\n\n===Politics===\nBy 1925, Venice's politics had become unmanageable. Its roads, water and sewage systems badly needed repair and expansion to keep up with its growing population. When it was proposed that Venice be annexed to Los Angeles, the board of trustees voted to hold an election.  Annexation was approved in the election in November 1925, and Venice was formally amalgamated with Los Angeles in 1926.<ref name=alexander/>{{rp|8}}\n\nLos Angeles annexed Venice, and many streets were paved in 1929 after a three-year court battle led by canal residents. Following their annexation to Los Angeles, its Parks and Recreation department intended to close Venice's three amusement piers, but had to wait until the first of the tidelands leases expired in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.westland.net/venicehistory/articles/myths.htm |title=Debunking Venice's Historic Myths|work=VENICE HISTORY SITE|first=Jeffrey|last=Stanton|access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Oil===\nIn 1929, oil was discovered south of Washington Street on the Venice Peninsula, now known as the [[Marina Peninsula]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. Within two years, 450 oil wells covered the area, and drilling waste clogged the remaining waterways. It was a short-lived boom that provided needed income to the community, which suffered during the [[Great Depression]]. Most of the wells were capped by the 1970s, and the last wells near the Venice Pavilion were capped in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-10-29-me-569-story.html|title=With Oil Wells Capped, Venice Beach Looks to Cleanup|last=Doherty|first=Shawn|date=October 29, 1991|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Neglect===\nLos Angeles had neglected Venice so long that, by the 1950s, it had become the \"Slum by the Sea.\" With the exception of new police and fire stations in 1930, the city spent little on improvements after annexation. The city did not pave Trolleyway (Pacific Avenue) until 1954 when county and state funds became available. Low rents for run-down bungalows attracted predominantly European immigrants (including a substantial number of [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors) and young [[counterculture]] artists, poets, and writers. The [[Beat Generation]] hung out at the Gas House on Ocean Front Walk and at Venice West Cafe on Dudley. Police raids were frequent during that era.<ref name=venicewest />\n\n===Past gang activity===\nThe [[Venice Shoreline Crips]] and the Latino [[Venice 13]] (V-13) were the two main gangs active in Venice.

commercial, and recreational beachfront neighborhood within Los Angeles, California. It is located within the urban region of western [[Los Angeles County]] known as the [[Westside Los Angeles|Westside]].\n\nVenice was founded in 1905 as a seaside resort town. It was an independent city until 1926, when it merged with Los Angeles. Venice is known for its canals, beaches, and the circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a  {{convert|2+1/2|mi|km|spell=in|adj=on}} pedestrian promenade that features [[Street performance|performers]], [[Fortune-telling|fortune-tellers]], artists and [[Hawker (trade)#North America|vendors]]. In the latter half of the 2010s, the neighborhood has faced severe gentrification that raised real-estate prices and pushed out many long-term inhabitants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-venice-density-20170719-story.html|title=They discover, they gentrify, they ruin: How 'progress' is wrecking Los Angeles neighborhoods|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|date=July 19, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\nIn 1839, a region called La Ballona that included the southern parts of Venice, was granted by the Mexican government to Machados and Talamantes, giving them title to [[Rancho La Ballona]].<ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb2h4nb1ph/?order=31&brand=calisphere diseno Rancho La Ballona]</ref><ref>[http://www.reisvalleyandmudville.com/images/toposantamonicasouth.jpg 1900 USGS topographic map]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://digarc.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/view/search/CHS-13060 Map of old Spanish and Mexican ranchos in Los Angeles County]</ref> Later this became part of [[Port Ballona]].\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Venice Pavilion and Ship Cafe, ca.1905-1913 (CHS-2776).jpg|right|thumb|Venice Pavilion and Ship Cafe, ca.1905\u20131913]]\n[[File:Venice-CA-1913-winwardave.jpg|thumb|right|Windward Avenue, 1913]]\n\nVenice, originally called \"Venice of America,\" was founded by wealthy developer [[Abbot Kinney]] in 1905 as a beach resort town, {{convert|14|mi|km}} west of Los Angeles. He and his partner Francis Ryan had bought two miles (3.24 km) of oceanfront property south of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] in 1891. They built a resort town on the north end of the property, called Ocean Park, which was soon annexed to Santa Monica. After Ryan died, Kinney and his new partners continued building south of Navy Street. After the partnership dissolved in 1904, Kinney, who had won the marshy land on the south end of the property in a coin flip with his former partners, began to build a seaside resort like the [[Venice|namesake Italian city]].<ref name=alexander>{{cite book|author1=Elayne Alexander|author2=Bryan L.

Kinney hired artist [[Felix Peano]] to design the columns of the buildings.{{r|alexander|p=22|q=Metal sculptor Felix Peano designed the columns and statues.}} Included in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] are several faces, modeled after Kinney himself and a local girl named [[Nettie Bouck]].<ref name=\"nellie\">{{cite web | url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peano-faces-venice-beach | title=Peano's Faces of Venice Beach \u2013 Los Angeles, California \u2013 Atlas Obscura | accessdate=April 17, 2018 | newspaper=Https}}</ref><ref name=\"MyUser_Betsysellsvenice.com_April_17_2018c\">{{cite web | url=http://www.betsysellsvenice.com/venice-vanguard-newsletter-september-2005/ | title=Venice Vanguard Newsletter \u2013 September 2005 \u2013 Betsy Sells Venice | accessdate=April 17, 2018 | newspaper=Betsysellsvenice.com | quote=These cast iron sculptures were done by Felix Peano, an Italian sculptor whose work achieved more than a modest degree of fame at the turn of the century. Peano was an intimate friend of Jack London and was well known in the San Francisco Bay area. He was employed by Abbot Kinney to add his embelishments to the dream called Venice of America.  The faces on the columns are classical in style, easily traceable to the influence of ancient Rome. Yet Peano did not go all the way back in time for his inspiration. He found it in a young girl of 17 who was living on the ocean front in 1904, watching Venice grow around her. \"It was almost an embarrassing moment,\" explains Nettie Bouck. \"Felix Peano was at our house, actually at that time it was the house of my future father-in-law, Mr. Bouck. I don\u00b4t know why. He just all of a sudden reached out and grabbed me. He was an Italian gentleman and very, very emotional. And he held my face, my hands, put his hands on my face and looked at it.\" Peano insisted that he would use those features in the work he was doing for Mr. Kinney. They showed up as the female face atop the Windward Avenue pillars. \"Well, it was not a likeness of me, but the face, the contours of my face, gave him the idea to use it for the heads on the columns. There was really no big story or history about it,\" insists Mrs. Bouck, \"except that he got a little bit over-enthusiastic I guess.\"}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venice, CA capital.jpg|thumb|Capital designed by Felix Peano, featuring faces of Abbot Kinney (L) and Nettie Bouck (R)]]\n\nTourists, mostly arriving on the \"Red Cars\" of the [[Pacific Electric Railway]] from Los Angeles and Santa Monica, then rode the [[Venice Miniature Railway]] and [[gondola]]s to tour the town. The biggest attraction was Venice's mile-long gently sloping beach. Cottages and housekeeping tents were available for rent.{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.venicenc.org/readpost.php?news_id=205|title=Be Proud of Venice's History|last=|first=|date=2017-01-12|website=Venice Neighborhood Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe population (3,119 residents in 1910) soon exceeded 10,000; the town drew 50,000 to 150,000 tourists on weekends.{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}\n\n===Amusement pier===\n[[File:Several people stroll by the Dance Hall on the Amusement Pier at Venice Beach, ca.1900-1920.jpg|thumb|right|People strolling by the dance hall on the amusement pier, 1920 or before]]\n[[File:Crowds outside at the Venice Beach Amusement Park in Venice, between Seventeenth Street and Thirty-fourth Street along the ocean front, ca.1900-1920 (examiner-m3800).jpg|thumb|right|Crowds between 17th and 34th streets, with roller coaster in background, 1920 or before]]\n\nAttractions on the Kinney Pier became more amusement-oriented by 1910, when a [[Venice Miniature Railway]], Aquarium, Virginia Reel, Whip, Racing Derby, and other rides and game booths were added. Since the business district was allotted only three one-block-long streets, and the City Hall was more than a mile away, other competing business districts developed. Unfortunately, this created a fractious political climate. Kinney, however, governed with an iron hand and kept things in check. When he died in November 1920, Venice became harder to govern. With the amusement pier burning six weeks later in December 1920, and Prohibition (which had begun the previous January), the town's tax revenue was severely affected.{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}\n\nThe Kinney family rebuilt their amusement pier quickly to compete with Ocean Park's Pickering Pleasure Pier and the new Sunset Pier. When it opened it had two roller coasters, a new Racing Derby, a Noah's Ark, a Mill Chutes, and many other rides. By 1925 with the addition of a third coaster, a tall Dragon Slide, [[Fun House]], and Flying Circus aerial ride, it was the finest amusement pier on the West Coast. Several hundred thousand tourists visited on weekends. In 1923, Charles Lick built the Lick Pier at Navy Street in Venice, adjacent to the Ocean Park Pier at Pier Avenue in Ocean Park. Another pier was planned for Venice in 1925 at Leona Street (now Washington Street).{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}\n\nFor the amusement of the public, Kinney hired aviators to do aerial stunts over the beach. One of them, movie aviator and Venice airport owner [[B. H. DeLay]], implemented the first lighted airport in the United States on DeLay Field (previously known as [[Ince Field]]). He also initiated the first aerial police in the nation, after a marine rescue attempt was thwarted. DeLay also performed many of the world's first aerial stunts for motion pictures in Venice.{{Citation needed|date = May 2017}}\n\n===Politics===\nBy 1925, Venice's politics had become unmanageable. Its roads, water and sewage systems badly needed repair and expansion to keep up with its growing population. When it was proposed that Venice be annexed to Los Angeles, the board of trustees voted to hold an election.  Annexation was approved in the election in November 1925, and Venice was formally amalgamated with Los Angeles in 1926.<ref name=alexander/>{{rp|8}}\n\nLos Angeles annexed Venice, and many streets were paved in 1929 after a three-year court battle led by canal residents. Following their annexation to Los Angeles, its Parks and Recreation department intended to close Venice's three amusement piers, but had to wait until the first of the tidelands leases expired in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.westland.net/venicehistory/articles/myths.htm |title=Debunking Venice's Historic Myths|work=VENICE HISTORY SITE|first=Jeffrey|last=Stanton|access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Oil===\nIn 1929, oil was discovered south of Washington Street on the Venice Peninsula, now known as the [[Marina Peninsula]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. Within two years, 450 oil wells covered the area, and drilling waste clogged the remaining waterways. It was a short-lived boom that provided needed income to the community, which suffered during the [[Great Depression]]. Most of the wells were capped by the 1970s, and the last wells near the Venice Pavilion were capped in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-10-29-me-569-story.html|title=With Oil Wells Capped, Venice Beach Looks to Cleanup|last=Doherty|first=Shawn|date=October 29, 1991|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Neglect===\nLos Angeles had neglected Venice so long that, by the 1950s, it had become the \"Slum by the Sea.\" With the exception of new police and fire stations in 1930, the city spent little on improvements after annexation. The city did not pave Trolleyway (Pacific Avenue) until 1954 when county and state funds became available. Low rents for run-down bungalows attracted predominantly European immigrants (including a substantial number of [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors) and young [[counterculture]] artists, poets, and writers. The [[Beat Generation]] hung out at the Gas House on Ocean Front Walk and at Venice West Cafe on Dudley. Police raids were frequent during that era.<ref name=venicewest />\n\n===Past gang activity===\nThe [[Venice Shoreline Crips]] and the Latino [[Venice 13]] (V-13) were the two main gangs active in Venice. V13 dates back to the 1950s, while the Shoreline Crips were founded in the early 1970s, making them one of the first [[Crips|Crip]] sets in Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} In the early 1990s, V-13 and the Shoreline Crips were involved in a fierce battle over [[crack cocaine]] sales territories.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Los Angeles Coast as a Public Place|journal=Geographical Review|volume=95|number=4|date=October 2005|pages=578\u2013593|jstor=30034261|doi=10.1111/j.1931-0846.2005.tb00382.x|last1=Davidson|first1=Ronald A.|last2=Entrikin|first2=J.

It is spoken on [[Baluan Island]] and on nearby [[Pam Islands|Pam Island]]. The number of speakers, according to the latest estimate based on the 2000 Census, is 2,000. Speakers on Baluan Island prefer to refer to their language with its native name Paluai.\n\nThe language is of the [[Agglutinative language|agglutinating]] type with comparatively little productive [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Basic [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] order is [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]].\n\n== Varieties and related languages ==\nThe Baluan Island and Pam Island varieties of the language are practically similar, apart from a number of lexical differences. The language is closely related to [[Lou language (Austronesian)|Lou]], spoken on [[Lou Island]]. Lou forms a dialect chain, with the varieties spoken on the far side of the island, facing Manus mainland, differing the most from Paluai and the ones on the side facing Baluan Island being the closest.\n\n[[File:Baluan bush house.JPG|thumb|Bush material house]]\n\nIn Manus Province, about 32 languages are spoken, all of which belong to the [[Admiralties]] branch, a higher-order subgroup of [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]], which belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] <nowiki/>branch of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]. Most of the languages of Manus Province are scarcely documented. A reference grammar of [[Loniu language|Loniu]] was published in 1994.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/145798/1/PL-C103.pdf |title=A grammar and lexicon of Loniu, Papua New Guinea |last=Hamel |first=Patricia J. |publisher=Pacific Linguistics |year=1994 |isbn=0-85883-410-3 |series=Series C - 103 |location=Canberra |doi=10.15144/pl-c103}}</ref>\n\nThere is a minority of [[Titan language|Titan]] speakers on Baluan, relatively recent immigrants living in Mouk village. The Titan people have become well known through the work of [[Margaret Mead]]. Many speakers have at least a passive command of Titan and Lou. In addition, the creole language [[Tok Pisin]] is widely spoken on the island, and most people have at least a basic command of [[English language|English]].\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n=== Consonant phonemes ===\nThe table below shows the [[consonant]] phonemes in the language.\n\n[[File:Bride price.JPG|thumb|Yams exchanged at bride price]]\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!\n!colspan=2|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n![[Coronal consonant|Coronal]]\n!colspan=2|[[Dorsal consonant|Dorsal]]\n|-\n![[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|m}}||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|m\u02b7}}\n|{{IPA|n}}\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|\u014b}}||style=border-left:0|\n|-\n![[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|p}}||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|p\u02b7}}\n|{{IPA|t}}\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|k}}||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|(k\u02b7)}}\n|-\n![[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n|colspan=2|\n|{{IPA|s}}\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|(h)}}||style=border-left:0|\n|-\n![[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|colspan=2|\n|{{IPA|l}}\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|(j)}}||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|(w)}}\n|-\n![[Vibrant consonant|Vibrant]]\n|colspan=2|\n|{{IPA|(\u027e~r)}}\n|colspan=2|\n|}\n\nIn contrast to many of the [[Manus languages]], there are no [[bilabial trill]] or [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalised]] consonants. The consonant inventory is rather simple, with a labialised nasal and plosive in addition to bilabial, apico-alveolar and dorso-velar stops and nasals. There is just one fricative, /s/, with /h/ being a very marginal phoneme. /t/ has a tap or trill as a variant. The glides [j] and [w] are analysed as non-syllabic variants of /i/ and /u/, respectively.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Schokkin |first=Dineke |title=A grammar of Paluai, the language of Baluan Island, Papua New Guinea |date=2014 |degree=PhD |publisher=James Cook University |url=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/28026/}}</ref>\n\n=== Vowel phonemes ===\nThe vowels of Baluan-Pam are {{IPA|/i, u, \u026a, \u028a, e, o, \u0250/}}.\n\nThe vowel inventory consists of the standard five vowels most common in Oceanic languages,<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Oceanic languages|last = Lynch|first = John|publisher = Curzon|year = 2002|isbn = |location = Richmond, Surrey|pages = |last2 = Ross|first2 = Malcolm|last3 = Crowley|first3 = Terry}}</ref> with two additional near-close vowels: centralized front {{IPA|/\u026a/}} and centralized back {{IPA|/\u028a/]}}.\n\n=== Syllable structure ===\nThe [[syllable]] template is (C)V(C). Not many syllables start with a vowel. Due to loss of word-final consonants and consequently vowels, which is a feature of eastern Admiralties languages,<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Austronesian languages|last = Blust|first = Robert|publisher = Pacific Linguistics|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Canberra|pages = }}</ref> the language allows consonants in the syllable coda and has many monosyllabic words with CVC form.\n\n== Word classes ==\n\n=== Open classes ===\nThe two major [[Open word class|open]] word classes are [[noun]] and [[verb]] (with a major subclass of stative verbs), with [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]] as minor classes distinguished from both noun and verb and from each other. Verb to noun and verb to adjective derivations are very common, but not vice versa. Most [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] are headed by a verb complex, but nouns, adjectives, [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and some [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] can also function as predicate head. Only verbs, however, can take bound [[pronouns]] and be modified by [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|TAM]] particles.\n\n=== Closed classes ===\nThe major closed classes in the language, containing function words, are pronouns, [[demonstratives]], prepositions, numerals, [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]], and [[interrogative]] words. The pronominal system distinguishes singular, dual, paucal and plural [[Grammatical number|number]] and first, second and third [[Grammatical person|person]], but not [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. The range of adpositional forms is limited, since most spatial relations are expressed either by a directly possessed spatial noun, or by a [[Serial verb construction|serial]] verb construction containing a directional.\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n[[File:Coconut ladle.JPG|thumb|Ladle made from coconut shell]]\n\n=== Nominal morphology ===\nThe language does not have [[Grammatical case|case]] or number marking on nouns. The only nominal morphology in the language functions to indicate possession. A distinction is made within nominal possessive constructions between direct and indirect possession. This correlates with, but does not coincide completely with, a [[semantic]] distinction between [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] and alienable possession. With direct possession, a [[suffix]] indicating person and number of the possessor is added directly to the noun stem. With indirect possession, this suffix is added to a postposed possessive particle ''ta-''. Most kinship terms and body part terms either can or must be used in a direct possessive construction. In addition, spatial nouns, referring to concepts such as \"inside\", \"on top of\" and \"behind\", are obligatorily used in a direct possessive construction.\n\n=== Verbal morphology ===\nVerbal derivational morphology is limited to the [[causative]] prefix ''pe-'', the [[Applicative voice|applicative]] suffix ''-ek'', and [[reduplication]].\n\n==== Causative ====\nThe causative ''pe-'' makes transitive an [[Transitivity (grammar)|intransitive]] verb. Causatives can be productively formed, but only with stative verbs. A causative adds an extra \"causer\" A argument, demoting the original S argument of the intransitive verb to O position. Examples are ''mat'' <nowiki/>'die, <nowiki/>be dead' \u2192 {{lang|blq|pemat}} 'kill'.\n\n==== Applicative ====\nThe applicative in this language is a [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]]-rearranging rather than a valency-increasing device. It promotes an [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] Oblique constituent of a verb to O position. The original O is not demoted, but rather follows the promoted constituent as a second object. The applicative is typically encountered in one specific [[discourse]]/[[Information structure|information]] structure context. It is used as an [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphorical]] device to refer back to an item mentioned just before, usually in the previous clause, as in the example below:\n:(1) {{lang|blq|ope l\u00eap suep a ope yilek ponat}}\n::[wo]=pe l\u00eap [suep] a [wo]=pe yil-ek=\u00d8 [ponat]\n::2sg=PFV take hoe and 2sg=PFV dig-APPL=3sg.ZERO soil\n::\u2018You will take a hoe and you will dig the ground with it.\u2019 [lit. \u2018dig-with (it) the ground\u2019]\n\n==== Reduplication ====\nWith transitive verbs, full or partial reduplication can be used as an intransitivising device. With intransitive verbs, reduplication adds aspectual meanings such as [[Grammatical aspect|continuous]] aspect. A second function of reduplication within the verb class is to derive [[nominalization]]s.\n\n== Pronouns ==\n\n=== Paradigms ===\nThere are four pronominal paradigms: free subject forms, bound subject forms, object forms and possessive forms. They are formally very similar. Pronouns distinguish singular, dual, paucal and plural number, and have a [[clusivity]] distinction. Dual refers to two entities, paucal refers to a few (any number between three and about ten), and plural refers to many. Inclusive pronouns include the addressee (\"we, including you\"), whereas exclusive ones exclude them (\"we, but not you\"). Below, the paradigm for the free forms is given.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n!First person\n!Second person\n!Third person\n|-\n|Singular\n|\n|wong\n|wo\n|yi\n|-\n|Dual \n|Inclusive\n|tau\n|au\n|u\n|-\n|\n|Exclusive\n|wui\n|\n|\n|-\n|Paucal\n|Inclusive\n|tare\n|are\n|ire\n|-\n|\n|Exclusive\n|wure\n|\n|\n|-\n|Plural\n|Inclusive\n|tap\n|ap\n|ip\n|-\n|\n|Exclusive\n|ep\n|\n|\n|}\n\n== Directional system ==\n\n=== Forms in the paradigm ===\n\n[[File:Sailing outrigger canoe.JPG|thumb|Navigating the outrigger canoe]]\n\nThe language has a system of [[Directionality (grammar)|directionals]] composed of ten members, eight of which are specified with regard to an absolute [[Linguistic frame of reference|frame of reference]] (FoR).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Space in language and cognition: explorations in cognitive diversity|last = Levinson|first = Stephen C.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Grammars of space: explorations in cognitive diversity|last = Levinson|first = Stephen C.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = |last2 = Wilkins|first2 = David}}</ref> An absolute FoR is based on fixed bearings, such as where the sun rises or sets or wind directions. In Baluan-Pam the FoR is based on a land-sea axis; a distinction is made between 1) seaward movement, 2) landward movement, and 3) movement parallel to the shore. Therefore, going inland always means going up, and going towards the shore always means going down. In addition, since motion parallel to the shore (i.e. intersecting the land\u2013sea axis) usually means moving on more or less the same level, this has obtained a secondary meaning of \u2018moving on a horizontal level\u2019. At sea, the system is extrapolated: thus, for moving towards the shore the same directionals are used as for moving inland, and for moving out to sea the same directionals are used as for moving towards the shore when on land.\n\nThe directionals are organised along two dimensions: absolute FoR and [[deixis]]. The table below shows the paradigm.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!down, seaward (on land);\nout to sea (on water)\n!up, landward (on land);\ntoward the shore (on water)\n!parallel to shore\n!not specified\n|-\n|away from deictic centre\n|suwot\n|sot\n|wot\n|la, lak\n|-\n|toward deictic centre\n|si\n|sa, sak\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>\n|me\n|-\n|not deictically anchored\n|suwen\n|sen\n|wen\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>\n|}\n\nThe deixis distinction cross-cuts with the FoR distinction, so that five terms are specified for FoR and for deixis, three are specified for FoR only, and two are specified for deixis but not FoR. There is no dedicated term for motion toward the deictic centre parallel to the shore, and no unspecified term that is not deictically anchored (such a term would not add any information to a lexical verb of motion).\n\n=== Use of directionals ===\nThe directional paradigm provides a very precise reference structure with ample use in discourse. For virtually all actions that in some sense involve motion (including perception-based actions such as seeing/looking, speaking or listening), the direction of the action has to be specified with a directional. In Paluai, this is done by a SVC, in which a directional either precedes or follows the main verb.

It is spoken on [[Baluan Island]] and on nearby [[Pam Islands|Pam Island]]. The number of speakers, according to the latest estimate based on the 2000 Census, is 2,000. Speakers on Baluan Island prefer to refer to their language with its native name Paluai.\n\nThe language is of the [[Agglutinative language|agglutinating]] type with comparatively little productive [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Basic [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] order is SVO.\n\n== Varieties and related languages ==\nThe Baluan Island and Pam Island varieties of the language are practically similar, apart from a number of lexical differences. The language is closely related to [[Lou language (Austronesian)|Lou]], spoken on [[Lou Island]]. Lou forms a dialect chain, with the varieties spoken on the far side of the island, facing Manus mainland, differing the most from Paluai and the ones on the side facing Baluan Island being the closest.\n\n[[File:Baluan bush house.JPG|thumb|Bush material house]]\n\nIn Manus Province, about 32 languages are spoken, all of which belong to the [[Admiralties]] branch, a higher-order subgroup of [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]], which belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] <nowiki/>branch of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]. Most of the languages of Manus Province are scarcely documented. A reference grammar of [[Loniu language|Loniu]] was published in 1994.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/145798/1/PL-C103.pdf |title=A grammar and lexicon of Loniu, Papua New Guinea |last=Hamel |first=Patricia J. |publisher=Pacific Linguistics |year=1994 |isbn=0-85883-410-3 |series=Series C - 103 |location=Canberra |doi=10.15144/pl-c103}}</ref>\n\nThere is a minority of [[Titan language|Titan]] speakers on Baluan, relatively recent immigrants living in Mouk village. The Titan people have become well known through the work of [[Margaret Mead]]. Many speakers have at least a passive command of Titan and Lou. In addition, the creole language [[Tok Pisin]] is widely spoken on the island, and most people have at least a basic command of [[English language|English]].\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n=== Consonant phonemes ===\nThe table below shows the [[consonant]] phonemes in the language.\n\n[[File:Bride price.JPG|thumb|Yams exchanged at bride price]]\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!\n!colspan=2|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n![[Coronal consonant|Coronal]]\n!colspan=2|[[Dorsal consonant|Dorsal]]\n|-\n![[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|m}}||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|m\u02b7}}\n|{{IPA|n}}\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|\u014b}}||style=border-left:0|\n|-\n![[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|p}}||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|p\u02b7}}\n|{{IPA|t}}\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|k}}||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|(k\u02b7)}}\n|-\n![[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n|colspan=2|\n|{{IPA|s}}\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|(h)}}||style=border-left:0|\n|-\n![[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|colspan=2|\n|{{IPA|l}}\n|style=border-right:0|{{IPA|(j)}}||style=border-left:0|{{IPA|(w)}}\n|-\n![[Vibrant consonant|Vibrant]]\n|colspan=2|\n|{{IPA|(\u027e~r)}}\n|colspan=2|\n|}\n\nIn contrast to many of the [[Manus languages]], there are no [[bilabial trill]] or [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalised]] consonants. The consonant inventory is rather simple, with a labialised nasal and plosive in addition to bilabial, apico-alveolar and dorso-velar stops and nasals. There is just one fricative, /s/, with /h/ being a very marginal phoneme. /t/ has a tap or trill as a variant. The glides [j] and [w] are analysed as non-syllabic variants of /i/ and /u/, respectively.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Schokkin |first=Dineke |title=A grammar of Paluai, the language of Baluan Island, Papua New Guinea |date=2014 |degree=PhD |publisher=James Cook University |url=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/28026/}}</ref>\n\n=== Vowel phonemes ===\nThe vowels of Baluan-Pam are {{IPA|/i, u, \u026a, \u028a, e, o, \u0250/}}.\n\nThe vowel inventory consists of the standard five vowels most common in Oceanic languages,<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Oceanic languages|last = Lynch|first = John|publisher = Curzon|year = 2002|isbn = |location = Richmond, Surrey|pages = |last2 = Ross|first2 = Malcolm|last3 = Crowley|first3 = Terry}}</ref> with two additional near-close vowels: centralized front {{IPA|/\u026a/}} and centralized back {{IPA|/\u028a/]}}.\n\n=== Syllable structure ===\nThe [[syllable]] template is (C)V(C). Not many syllables start with a vowel. Due to loss of word-final consonants and consequently vowels, which is a feature of eastern Admiralties languages,<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Austronesian languages|last = Blust|first = Robert|publisher = Pacific Linguistics|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Canberra|pages = }}</ref> the language allows consonants in the syllable coda and has many monosyllabic words with CVC form.\n\n== Word classes ==\n\n=== Open classes ===\nThe two major [[Open word class|open]] word classes are [[noun]] and [[verb]] (with a major subclass of stative verbs), with [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]] as minor classes distinguished from both noun and verb and from each other. Verb to noun and verb to adjective derivations are very common, but not vice versa. Most [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] are headed by a verb complex, but nouns, adjectives, [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and some [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] can also function as predicate head. Only verbs, however, can take bound [[pronouns]] and be modified by [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|TAM]] particles.\n\n=== Closed classes ===\nThe major closed classes in the language, containing function words, are pronouns, [[demonstratives]], prepositions, numerals, [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]], and [[interrogative]] words. The pronominal system distinguishes singular, dual, paucal and plural [[Grammatical number|number]] and first, second and third [[Grammatical person|person]], but not [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. The range of adpositional forms is limited, since most spatial relations are expressed either by a directly possessed spatial noun, or by a [[Serial verb construction|serial]] verb construction containing a directional.\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n[[File:Coconut ladle.JPG|thumb|Ladle made from coconut shell]]\n\n=== Nominal morphology ===\nThe language does not have [[Grammatical case|case]] or number marking on nouns. The only nominal morphology in the language functions to indicate possession. A distinction is made within nominal possessive constructions between direct and indirect possession. This correlates with, but does not coincide completely with, a [[semantic]] distinction between [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] and alienable possession. With direct possession, a [[suffix]] indicating person and number of the possessor is added directly to the noun stem. With indirect possession, this suffix is added to a postposed possessive particle ''ta-''. Most kinship terms and body part terms either can or must be used in a direct possessive construction. In addition, spatial nouns, referring to concepts such as \"inside\", \"on top of\" and \"behind\", are obligatorily used in a direct possessive construction.\n\n=== Verbal morphology ===\nVerbal derivational morphology is limited to the [[causative]] prefix ''pe-'', the [[Applicative voice|applicative]] suffix ''-ek'', and [[reduplication]].\n\n==== Causative ====\nThe causative ''pe-'' makes transitive an [[Transitivity (grammar)|intransitive]] verb. Causatives can be productively formed, but only with stative verbs. A causative adds an extra \"causer\" A argument, demoting the original S argument of the intransitive verb to O position. Examples are ''mat'' <nowiki/>'die, <nowiki/>be dead' \u2192 {{lang|blq|pemat}} 'kill'.\n\n==== Applicative ====\nThe applicative in this language is a [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]]-rearranging rather than a valency-increasing device. It promotes an [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] Oblique constituent of a verb to O position. The original O is not demoted, but rather follows the promoted constituent as a second object. The applicative is typically encountered in one specific [[discourse]]/[[Information structure|information]] structure context. It is used as an [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphorical]] device to refer back to an item mentioned just before, usually in the previous clause, as in the example below:\n:(1) {{lang|blq|ope l\u00eap suep a ope yilek ponat}}\n::[wo]=pe l\u00eap [suep] a [wo]=pe yil-ek=\u00d8 [ponat]\n::2sg=PFV take hoe and 2sg=PFV dig-APPL=3sg.ZERO soil\n::\u2018You will take a hoe and you will dig the ground with it.\u2019 [lit. \u2018dig-with (it) the ground\u2019]\n\n==== Reduplication ====\nWith transitive verbs, full or partial reduplication can be used as an intransitivising device. With intransitive verbs, reduplication adds aspectual meanings such as [[Grammatical aspect|continuous]] aspect. A second function of reduplication within the verb class is to derive [[nominalization]]s.\n\n== Pronouns ==\n\n=== Paradigms ===\nThere are four pronominal paradigms: free subject forms, bound subject forms, object forms and possessive forms. They are formally very similar. Pronouns distinguish singular, dual, paucal and plural number, and have a [[clusivity]] distinction. Dual refers to two entities, paucal refers to a few (any number between three and about ten), and plural refers to many. Inclusive pronouns include the addressee (\"we, including you\"), whereas exclusive ones exclude them (\"we, but not you\"). Below, the paradigm for the free forms is given.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n!First person\n!Second person\n!Third person\n|-\n|Singular\n|\n|wong\n|wo\n|yi\n|-\n|Dual \n|Inclusive\n|tau\n|au\n|u\n|-\n|\n|Exclusive\n|wui\n|\n|\n|-\n|Paucal\n|Inclusive\n|tare\n|are\n|ire\n|-\n|\n|Exclusive\n|wure\n|\n|\n|-\n|Plural\n|Inclusive\n|tap\n|ap\n|ip\n|-\n|\n|Exclusive\n|ep\n|\n|\n|}\n\n== Directional system ==\n\n=== Forms in the paradigm ===\n\n[[File:Sailing outrigger canoe.JPG|thumb|Navigating the outrigger canoe]]\n\nThe language has a system of [[Directionality (grammar)|directionals]] composed of ten members, eight of which are specified with regard to an absolute [[Linguistic frame of reference|frame of reference]] (FoR).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Space in language and cognition: explorations in cognitive diversity|last = Levinson|first = Stephen C.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Grammars of space: explorations in cognitive diversity|last = Levinson|first = Stephen C.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = |last2 = Wilkins|first2 = David}}</ref> An absolute FoR is based on fixed bearings, such as where the sun rises or sets or wind directions. In Baluan-Pam the FoR is based on a land-sea axis; a distinction is made between 1) seaward movement, 2) landward movement, and 3) movement parallel to the shore. Therefore, going inland always means going up, and going towards the shore always means going down. In addition, since motion parallel to the shore (i.e. intersecting the land\u2013sea axis) usually means moving on more or less the same level, this has obtained a secondary meaning of \u2018moving on a horizontal level\u2019. At sea, the system is extrapolated: thus, for moving towards the shore the same directionals are used as for moving inland, and for moving out to sea the same directionals are used as for moving towards the shore when on land.\n\nThe directionals are organised along two dimensions: absolute FoR and [[deixis]]. The table below shows the paradigm.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!down, seaward (on land);\nout to sea (on water)\n!up, landward (on land);\ntoward the shore (on water)\n!parallel to shore\n!not specified\n|-\n|away from deictic centre\n|suwot\n|sot\n|wot\n|la, lak\n|-\n|toward deictic centre\n|si\n|sa, sak\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>\n|me\n|-\n|not deictically anchored\n|suwen\n|sen\n|wen\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>\n|}\n\nThe deixis distinction cross-cuts with the FoR distinction, so that five terms are specified for FoR and for deixis, three are specified for FoR only, and two are specified for deixis but not FoR. There is no dedicated term for motion toward the deictic centre parallel to the shore, and no unspecified term that is not deictically anchored (such a term would not add any information to a lexical verb of motion).\n\n=== Use of directionals ===\nThe directional paradigm provides a very precise reference structure with ample use in discourse. For virtually all actions that in some sense involve motion (including perception-based actions such as seeing/looking, speaking or listening), the direction of the action has to be specified with a directional. In Paluai, this is done by a SVC, in which a directional either precedes or follows the main verb.
