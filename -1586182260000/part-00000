Aside from a temporary deployment with the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1935\u201336, she spent the bulk of the 1930s assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] or the [[North America and West Indies Station]]. When [[World War II]] began in September 1939, the cruiser was assigned to patrol [[South America]]n waters against German [[commerce raider]]s. ''Exeter'' was one of three British [[cruiser]]s that fought the German [[pocket battleship]], the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}, later that year in the [[Battle of the River Plate]]. She was severely damaged during the battle, and she was in the [[shipyard]] for over a year.\n\nAfter her repairs were completed, the ship spent most of 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was transferred to the [[Far East]] after the start of the [[Pacific War]] in December. ''Exeter'' was generally assigned to escorting convoys to and from [[Singapore]] during the [[Malayan Campaign]], and she continued on those duties in early February 1942 as the Japanese prepared to [[Dutch East Indies campaign|invade the Dutch East Indies]]. Later that month, she was assigned to the Striking Force of the joint [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] (ABDACOM), and she took on a more active role in the defence of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The culmination of this was her engagement in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] later in the month as the Allies attempted to intercept several [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] invasion convoys. ''Exeter'' was crippled early in the battle, and she did not play much of a role as she withdrew. Two days later, she attempted to escape approaching Japanese forces, but she was intercepted and sunk by Japanese ships at the beginning of March in the [[Second Battle of the Java Sea]].\n\nMost of her crewmen survived the sinking and were rescued by the Japanese. About a quarter of them died during Japanese captivity. Her wreck was discovered in early 2007, and it was declared a war grave, but by 2016 her remains had been destroyed by illegal [[Marine salvage|salvagers]].\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:HMS Exeter (68) at anchor in Balboa harbor on 24 April 1934.jpg|thumb|left|Oblique aerial view of ''Exeter'' at anchor with awnings rigged, [[Balboa, Panama]], 24 April 1934]]\n''Exeter'' was ordered two years after her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|York|90|2}} and her design incorporated improvements in the light of experience with the latter. Her [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was increased by {{convert|1|ft|cm|0|spell=in}} to compensate for increases in topweight, and her boiler uptakes were trunked backwards from the boiler rooms, allowing for straight [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s further removed from the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] rather than the raked funnels on ''York'' to ensure adequate dispersal of the flue gases. As the {{convert|8|in|mm|0|spell=in|adj=on}} [[gun turret]]s had proved not strong enough to accommodate the [[aircraft catapult]] originally intended, ''Exeter'' was given a pair of fixed catapults angled out from amidships in a \"V\" shape, with the associated [[crane (machine)|crane]] placed to starboard. Consequently, the bridge was lowered (that of ''York'' being tall to give a view over the intended aircraft), and was of a [[streamlined]], enclosed design that was incorporated into later cruisers.<ref>Raven & Roberts, pp. 139, 141</ref>\n\n''Exeter'' was slightly lighter than expected and displaced {{convert|8390|LT|t|lk=on}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard load]] and {{convert|10620|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[overall length]] of {{convert|575|ft|1|in|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|58|ft|m|1}}<ref>Raven & Roberts, pp. 141, 414</ref> and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|17|ft|m|1}} light load <ref>Warships In Profile, p. 23</ref> and {{convert|20|ft|3|in|m|1}}<ref>Whitley, p. 94</ref> deep load. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]] sets, each driving one shaft, using provided by eight [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s. The turbines developed a total of {{convert|80000|shp|lk=on}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}. The ship could carry {{convert|1900|LT|t|0}} of [[fuel oil]] which gave her a range of {{convert|10000|nmi|lk=in|-1}} at {{convert|14|kn}}.<ref>Lenton, p. 53</ref> The ship's complement was 628 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]].<ref name=r12/>\n\nThe main armament of the ''York''-class ships consisted of six [[BL 8 inch Mk VIII naval gun|BL {{cvt|8|in|0|adj=on|spell=in}} Mk VIII guns]] in three twin-[[gun turret]]s, designated \"A\", \"B\", and \"Y\" from fore to aft. \"A\" and \"B\" were [[superfiring]] forward of the superstructure and \"Y\" was aft of it. Defence against aircraft was provided by four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0|spell=in}} Mk V]] [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]] in single mounts [[amidships]] and a pair of [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|two-pounder ({{cvt|40|mm|1}})]] light AA guns (\"pom-poms\") in single mounts. The ships also fitted with two triple [[torpedo tube]] above-water mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.<ref name=r12>Raven & Roberts, p. 414</ref>\n\nThe cruisers lacked a full-length [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|armour belt]]. The sides of ''Exeter''{{'}}s [[Engine room|boiler and engine room]]s and the sides of the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s were protected by {{convert|3|in}} of armour. The transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s at the end of her propulsion machinery rooms were {{convert|3.5|in}} thick. The top of the magazines were protected by {{convert|5.5|in|mm}} of armour and their ends were {{convert|4.375|in|mm|0}} thick. The lower deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of {{convert|1.5|in|mm}}.<ref name=r12/>\n\n===Modifications===\nIn 1932 ''Exeter'' had her side plating extended to enclose her open main deck as far back as the fore funnel.<ref name=r6>Raven & Roberts, p. 266</ref> During that same refit, her pair of fixed catapults were finally installed for her [[Fairey IIIF]] [[floatplane]]s.<ref>Whitley, p. 92</ref> In 1934\u20131935, two quadruple mounts for [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers {{convert|0.5|in|abbr=on|1}}]] [[antiaircraft]] [[machinegun]]s replaced the pair of two-pounder \"pom-poms\" originally installed.<ref>Lenton, pp. 53\u201354</ref>\n\n[[File:British Warships of the Second World War A3555.jpg|thumb|''Exeter'' at anchor, early 1941]]\nWhile under repair in 1940\u20131941 after her battle with the ''Admiral Graf Spee'', the Royal Navy decided to upgrade her armament and fire-control systems. The [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was rebuilt and enlarged to accommodate a second [[High-Angle Control System]] aft of the [[Director-Control Tower]] (DCT) on top of the bridge, her single four-inch AA guns were replaced with twin-gun mounts for [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|Mark XVI guns of the same calibre]] and a pair of octuple mounts for two-pounder \"pom-poms\" were added abreast her aft [[superstructure]].<ref>Friedman, p. 118</ref> Enclosures (\"tubs\") for single [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{convert|20|mm|1|adj=on}} Oerlikon guns]] were added to the roof of both 'B' and 'Y' turrets,<ref name=w5>Whitley, p. 95</ref> but these weapons were never installed, because of shortages in production, and lighter tripod-mounted machine guns were substituted. The pole [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s were replaced by stronger [[tripod mast]]s because the [[Type 279 radar|Type 279]] [[early-warning radar]] had separate transmitting and receiving [[aerial (radio)|aerial]]s, one at each masthead. In addition, a Type 284 [[fire-control radar]] was fitted to the DCT.<ref>Lenton, p. 54</ref>\n\n==Construction and career==\n''Exeter'', the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy,<ref>Colledge, p. 119</ref> was [[laid down]] on 1 August 1928, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 18 July 1929 and completed on 27 July 1931. The ship was then assigned to the [[2nd Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Cruiser Squadron]] of the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]], where she served between 1931 and 1933. In 1934 she was assigned to the [[North America and West Indies Station|America and West Indies Station]] and remained there, aside from a temporary deployment to the Mediterranean during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Abyssinian crisis]] of 1935\u20131936, until 1939.<ref>Whitley, pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n====Battle of the River Plate====\n{{main|Battle of the River Plate}}\n[[File:Exeter'sDamage1939.jpg|thumb|Damage received by ''Exeter'' during the Battle of the River Plate]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], she formed part of the South American [[Division (naval)|Division]] with the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Cumberland|57|2}}, under [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Henry Harwood]]. The ship, commanded by [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[F. S. Bell|Frederick Bell]], was assigned to Force G to hunt for German commerce raiders off the eastern coast of South America on 6 October 1939. Two months later, Harwood ordered ''Exeter'' and the [[light cruiser]] {{HMNZS|Achilles|70|2}} to rendezvous with his own {{HMS|Ajax|22|2}} off the mouth of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], while HMS ''Cumberland'' was refitting in the [[Falkland Islands]].<ref>Rohwer, pp. 6, 11</ref> The two other ships arrived on 12 December, and then the ''Admiral Graf Spee'' spotted the ''Exeter'' during the following morning.<ref>Stephen, pp. 16, 18</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Hans Langsdorff]] decided to engage the British and closed at full speed. The British doctrine on how to engage ships like the ''Admiral Graf Spee'' had been developed by Harwood in 1936 and specified that the British force act as two divisions. Following this procedure, ''Exeter'' operated as a division on her own while ''Achilles'' and ''Ajax'' formed the other, splitting the fire of the German ship. They were only partially successful as the German ship concentrated her main armament of six {{convert|283|mm|in|adj=on}} guns on ''Exeter'', and her secondary armament of eight {{convert|149|mm|in|adj=on}} guns on the light cruisers. Langsdorff opened fire on ''Exeter'' at 06:18 with [[Explosive material#High explosives|high-explosive]] shells and she returned fire two minutes later at a range of {{convert|18700|yd}}. The German ship [[wikt:straddle|straddled]] the British cruiser with her third [[salvo]]; shrapnel from the near misses killed the crew of the starboard torpedo tubes, started fires amidships and damaged both [[Supermarine Walrus]] seaplanes. After eight salvos from ''Exeter'', ''Admiral Graf Spee'' scored a direct hit on 'B' turret that knocked it out of action and shrapnel from the hit killed all of the bridge personnel except three. Bell, wounded in the face, transferred to the aft conning position to continue the battle. His ship was hit twice more shortly afterwards, but her powerplant was not damaged and she remained seaworthy, although her aircraft had to be jettisoned.<ref name=\"Stephen, pp. 18\u201319\">Stephen, pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nAt 06:30, Langsdorff switched his fire to the light cruisers, but only inflicted shrapnel damage on them before some of ''Exeter''{{'}}s torpedoes forced him to turn away at 06:37 to evade them. Her second torpedo attack at 06:43 was also unsuccessful. In the meanwhile, Langsdorff had switched his main guns back to the heavy cruiser and scored several more hits. They knocked out 'A' turret, started a fire amidships that damaged the ship's fire-control and navigation circuits, and caused a seven-degree [[List (watercraft)|list]] with flooding.<ref name=\"Stephen, pp. 18\u201319\"/> After \"Y\" turret had temporarily been disabled, Bell said, \"I'm going to ram the --------. It will be the end of us but it will sink him too\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/15/a5776815.shtml |title=WW2 People's War \u2013 HMS Exeter- a Royal Marine's Story |website=BBC |date=16 September 2005  |author=Aidan Toase |accessdate= 6 June 2016}}</ref> The turret was repaired and she remained in action until flooding disabled the machinery for \"Y\" turret at 07:30. At 11:07, Bell informed Harwood that ''Exeter'' had a single eight-inch and a four-inch gun available in local control, and that she could make {{convert|18|kn}}. Harwood ordered Bell to head to the Falklands for repair.<ref>Stephen, pp. 20\u201323</ref>\n\nThe ship was hit by a total of seven 283&nbsp;mm shells that killed 61 of her crew and wounded another 23. In return, the cruiser had hit ''Admiral Graf Spee'' three times; one shell penetrated her main armour belt and narrowly missed detonating in one of her engine rooms, but the most important one disabled her oil-purification equipment. Without it, the ship was unlikely to be able to reach Germany. Several days later, unable to be repaired and apparently confronted by powerful Royal Navy reinforcements (including HMS ''Cumberland''), the ''Admiral Graf Spee'' was scuttled by her captain in the harbour of [[Montevideo]].<ref>Stephens, pp. 21\u201327</ref>\n\n''Exeter'' made for [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Port Stanley]] for emergency repairs which took until January 1940.<ref name=w5/> She was repaired and modernised at [[HM Dockyard, Devonport]] between 14 February 1940 and 10 March 1941;<ref>Raven & Roberts, p. 430</ref> Captain [[W.N.T. Beckett]] was appointed to relieve Bell on 12 December 1940. Then, on 10 March 1941, the very day that ''Exeter'' was due to be recommissioned, Beckett died at Saltash Hospital from complications following exploratory surgery to repair poison gas injuries that he had received earlier in his career. His replacement was Captain [[Oliver Gordon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Napier Thomason Beckett \u2013 The Dreadnought Project|url=http://www.dreadnoughtproject.org/tfs/index.php/Walter_Napier_Thomason_Beckett|website=www.dreadnoughtproject.org|accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n====To the Far East====\nUpon returning to the fleet, ''Exeter'' primarily spent time on \u2018working up' exercises,<ref>ADM 53/114251, ADM 53/114251 + ADM 199/655, ADM 53/114252 and https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1186.html</ref> however she also conducted several patrols in northern waters, one on which she stopped in Iceland to refuel.<ref>ADM 199/396, ADM 53/114252, ADM 53/114253 and https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1186.html</ref> On 22 May she departed from Britain (for the last time as it would turn out), escorting Convoy WS-8B to Aden (Yemen) via Freetown and Durban, South Africa<ref>ADM 53/114254 and https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1186.html</ref> (the beginning of which occurred at the very same time as the hunt for the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||6}}.<ref>Rohwer, p. 74</ref> was taking place).

''Exeter'' then spent several days in a graving dock and after undocking (on the 29th)<ref>ADM 53/114258 and https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1186.htm</ref> conducted exercises off Colombo and visited the [[Maldives]].<ref>ADM 53/114259 and https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1186.html</ref>\n\nUpon return to Trincomalee (Ceylon) from the Maldives on 14 November, ''Exeter'' then departed for Calcutta on the 16th to cover a small two-ship convoy that left Calcutta for Rangoon (Burma) on the 26th and 27th.<ref name=\"uboat.net\">{{Cite web | url=https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1186.html | title=HMS Exeter (68) of the Royal Navy - British Heavy cruiser of the York class - Allied Warships of WWII - uboat.net}}</ref> After the successful completion of that duty she was then tasked to escort another ship from Calcutta to Rangoon on 6 December. However, during that convoy, on 8 December, ''Exeter'' was ordered to urgently proceed to Singapore<ref>ADM 53/114260 + ADM 199/408 and https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1186.html</ref> to reinforce [[Force Z]], as the [[Pacific War]] had just begun. ''Exeter'' arrived at Singapore during the afternoon of 10 December,<ref>Middlebrook & Mahoney, p. 268 (paperback version) in Battleship The Loss of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse</ref> too late to support {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}} and {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} as they had both been sunk earlier that day,<ref>Gill, pp. 480\u2013482</ref> but some of the survivors from these two ships were treated in ''Exeter''{{'}}s [[sick bay]].<ref name=\"coxp109\">Cox, p. 109</ref>\n\n''Exeter'' thus returned to Colombo the next day (11 December)<ref name=\"uboat.net\"/> and spent the next two months \u2013 until almost mid-February 1942 \u2013 escorting convoys (primarily from Bombay and Colombo)<ref>https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1186.html and https://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-06CA-Exeter.htm</ref> bound for Singapore \u2013 which fell to the Japanese on 15 February.<ref>Various ADM\u2019s and https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/1186.html and https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryofBritain/The-Fall-of-Singapore/ and https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/the-fall-of-singapore/</ref> During this time, in early 1942, ''Exeter'' was attached to the newly formed ABDA Command,<ref name=\"naval-history.net\"/> ([[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]]) which came into being in early January in Singapore, but soon shifted its headquarters to Java in the Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia).\n\n====The Gaspar Strait sortie====\n\n[[File:Battle of Java Sea - HMS Exeter under Attack.jpg|thumb|left|''Exeter'' under air attack on 15 February 1942]]\nOn 13 February, Allied reconnaissance aircraft spotted Japanese invasion convoys north of [[Bangka Island]] and the new commander of ABDA naval forces, [[Vice Admiral]] [[Conrad Helfrich]] of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], was ordered to assemble the Allied Striking Force of ''Exeter'' and three Dutch and one Australian light cruisers at [[Oosthaven]] on the morning of 14 February. Escorted by six American and three Dutch [[destroyer]]s, the force departed that afternoon. The Dutch [[Rear Admiral]] [[Karel Doorman]], commanding the force, took his ships through the [[Gaspar Strait]] and then northwest towards Bangka Island. While passing through the strait, the Dutch destroyer {{HNLMS|Van Ghent|1926|2}} struck a rock in poor visibility and another Dutch destroyer was tasked to take off her crew.<ref>Gill, pp. 565, 571\u201372</ref> The Japanese spotted the Allied ships around 08:00 and repeatedly attacked them. The first was a group of seven [[Nakajima B5N]] \"Kate\" [[torpedo bomber]]s from the [[light carrier]] {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ry\u016bj\u014d||2}} that attacked ''Exeter'' with bombs around 10:30. The blast from a near miss badly damaged her [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]], but the ship was only damaged by shrapnel. They were followed shortly afterwards by a group of 23 [[Mitsubishi G3M]] \"Nell\" bombers from the [[Genzan Air Group]] that inflicted no damage as they dropped their bombs from high altitude. Another group of six B5Ns attacked without effect at 11:30.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 123</ref>\n\nThe repeated aerial attacks persuaded Doorman that further progress was unwise in the face of Japanese aerial supremacy and he ordered his ships to reverse course and head for [[Tanjung Priok]] at 12:42.<ref>Gill, p. 573</ref> The attacks continued as 27 G3Ms of the [[Mihoro Air Group]] then bombed from high altitude. Seven more B5Ns attacked fruitlessly at 14:30; a half-dozen more followed an hour later. The final attack was made by 17 [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" bombers of the [[Kanoya Air Group]] shortly before dark. The Japanese attacks were almost entirely ineffectual, with no ship reporting anything more than shrapnel damage. In return, allied anti-aircraft fire was moderately effective with most of the attacking bombers damaged by shrapnel. In addition, one G4M crashed while attempting to land, and another was badly damaged upon landing.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 124</ref>\n\n====First Battle of the Java Sea====\n{{main|Battle of the Java Sea}}\nOn 25 February, Helfrich ordered all available warships to join Doorman's Eastern Striking Force at [[Surabaya]]. The ''Exeter'' and the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Perth|D29|2}}, escorted by three British destroyers, {{HMS|Jupiter|F85|2}}, {{HMS|Encounter|H10|2}}, and {{HMS|Electra|H27|2}}, set sail at once, leaving behind one Australian cruiser and two destroyers that were short of fuel.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 233</ref> After they had arrived the following day, Doorman's entire force of five cruisers and nine destroyers departed Surabaya at 18:30 to patrol off Eastern Java in hopes of intercepting the oncoming invasion convoy which had been spotted earlier that morning. The Japanese were further north than he anticipated and his ships found nothing.<ref>Gill, pp. 607\u2013608</ref> His own ships were located at 09:35 on the following morning, 27 February, and were continuously tracked by the Japanese. Doorman ordered a return to Surabaya at 10:30, and his ships were attacked by eight bombers from the Kanoya Air Group at 14:37. They claimed to have made two hits on the ''Jupiter'', but actually they missed the British destroyer.

Aside from a temporary deployment with the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1935\u201336, she spent the bulk of the 1930s assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] or the [[North America and West Indies Station]]. When [[World War II]] began in September 1939, the cruiser was assigned to patrol [[South America]]n waters against German [[commerce raider]]s. ''Exeter'' was one of three British [[cruiser]]s that fought the German [[pocket battleship]], the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}, later that year in the [[Battle of the River Plate]]. She was severely damaged during the battle, and she was in the [[shipyard]] for over a year.\n\nAfter her repairs were completed, the ship spent most of 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was transferred to the [[Far East]] after the start of the [[Pacific War]] in December. ''Exeter'' was generally assigned to escorting convoys to and from [[Singapore]] during the [[Malayan Campaign]], and she continued on those duties in early February 1942 as the Japanese prepared to [[Dutch East Indies campaign|invade the Dutch East Indies]]. Later that month, she was assigned to the Striking Force of the joint [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] (ABDACOM), and she took on a more active role in the defence of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The culmination of this was her engagement in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] later in the month as the Allies attempted to intercept several [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] invasion convoys. ''Exeter'' was crippled early in the battle, and she did not play much of a role as she withdrew. Two days later, she attempted to escape approaching Japanese forces, but she was intercepted and sunk by Japanese ships at the beginning of March in the [[Second Battle of the Java Sea]].\n\nMost of her crewmen survived the sinking and were rescued by the Japanese. About a quarter of them died during Japanese captivity. Her wreck was discovered in early 2007, and it was declared a war grave, but by 2016 her remains had been destroyed by illegal [[Marine salvage|salvagers]].\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:HMS Exeter (68) at anchor in Balboa harbor on 24 April 1934.jpg|thumb|left|Oblique aerial view of ''Exeter'' at anchor with awnings rigged, [[Balboa, Panama]], 24 April 1934]]\n''Exeter'' was ordered two years after her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|York|90|2}} and her design incorporated improvements in the light of experience with the latter. Her [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was increased by {{convert|1|ft|cm|0|spell=in}} to compensate for increases in topweight, and her boiler uptakes were trunked backwards from the boiler rooms, allowing for straight [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s further removed from the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] rather than the raked funnels on ''York'' to ensure adequate dispersal of the flue gases. As the {{convert|8|in|mm|0|spell=in|adj=on}} [[gun turret]]s had proved not strong enough to accommodate the [[aircraft catapult]] originally intended, ''Exeter'' was given a pair of fixed catapults angled out from amidships in a \"V\" shape, with the associated [[crane (machine)|crane]] placed to starboard. Consequently, the bridge was lowered (that of ''York'' being tall to give a view over the intended aircraft), and was of a [[streamlined]], enclosed design that was incorporated into later cruisers.<ref>Raven & Roberts, pp. 139, 141</ref>\n\n''Exeter'' was slightly lighter than expected and displaced {{convert|8390|LT|t|lk=on}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard load]] and {{convert|10620|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[overall length]] of {{convert|575|ft|1|in|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|58|ft|m|1}}<ref>Raven & Roberts, pp. 141, 414</ref> and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|17|ft|m|1}} light load <ref>Warships In Profile, p. 23</ref> and {{convert|20|ft|3|in|m|1}}<ref>Whitley, p. 94</ref> deep load. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]] sets, each driving one shaft, using provided by eight [[Admiralty 3-drum boiler]]s. The turbines developed a total of {{convert|80000|shp|lk=on}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}. The ship could carry {{convert|1900|LT|t|0}} of [[fuel oil]] which gave her a range of {{convert|10000|nmi|lk=in|-1}} at {{convert|14|kn}}.<ref>Lenton, p. 53</ref> The ship's complement was 628 officers and [[naval rating|ratings]].<ref name=r12/>\n\nThe main armament of the ''York''-class ships consisted of six [[BL 8 inch Mk VIII naval gun|BL {{cvt|8|in|0|adj=on|spell=in}} Mk VIII guns]] in three twin-[[gun turret]]s, designated \"A\", \"B\", and \"Y\" from fore to aft. \"A\" and \"B\" were [[superfiring]] forward of the superstructure and \"Y\" was aft of it. Defence against aircraft was provided by four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0|spell=in}} Mk V]] [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft (AA) guns]] in single mounts [[amidships]] and a pair of [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|two-pounder ({{cvt|40|mm|1}})]] light AA guns (\"pom-poms\") in single mounts. The ships also fitted with two triple [[torpedo tube]] above-water mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.<ref name=r12>Raven & Roberts, p. 414</ref>\n\nThe cruisers lacked a full-length [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|armour belt]]. The sides of ''Exeter''{{'}}s [[Engine room|boiler and engine room]]s and the sides of the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s were protected by {{convert|3|in}} of armour. The transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s at the end of her propulsion machinery rooms were {{convert|3.5|in}} thick. The top of the magazines were protected by {{convert|5.5|in|mm}} of armour and their ends were {{convert|4.375|in|mm|0}} thick. The lower deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of {{convert|1.5|in|mm}}.<ref name=r12/>\n\n===Modifications===\nIn 1932 ''Exeter'' had her side plating extended to enclose her open main deck as far back as the fore funnel.<ref name=r6>Raven & Roberts, p. 266</ref> During that same refit, her pair of fixed catapults were finally installed for her [[Fairey IIIF]] [[floatplane]]s.<ref>Whitley, p. 92</ref> In 1934\u20131935, two quadruple mounts for [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers {{convert|0.5|in|abbr=on|1}}]] [[antiaircraft]] [[machinegun]]s replaced the pair of two-pounder \"pom-poms\" originally installed.<ref>Lenton, pp. 53\u201354</ref>\n\n[[File:British Warships of the Second World War A3555.jpg|thumb|''Exeter'' at anchor, early 1941]]\nWhile under repair in 1940\u20131941 after her battle with the ''Admiral Graf Spee'', the Royal Navy decided to upgrade her armament and fire-control systems. The [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] was rebuilt and enlarged to accommodate a second [[High-Angle Control System]] aft of the [[Director-Control Tower]] (DCT) on top of the bridge, her single four-inch AA guns were replaced with twin-gun mounts for [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|Mark XVI guns of the same calibre]] and a pair of octuple mounts for two-pounder \"pom-poms\" were added abreast her aft [[superstructure]].<ref>Friedman, p. 118</ref> Enclosures (\"tubs\") for single [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{convert|20|mm|1|adj=on}} Oerlikon guns]] were added to the roof of both 'B' and 'Y' turrets,<ref name=w5>Whitley, p. 95</ref> but these weapons were never installed, because of shortages in production, and lighter tripod-mounted machine guns were substituted. The pole [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s were replaced by stronger [[tripod mast]]s because the [[Type 279 radar|Type 279]] [[early-warning radar]] had separate transmitting and receiving [[aerial (radio)|aerial]]s, one at each masthead. In addition, a Type 284 [[fire-control radar]] was fitted to the DCT.<ref>Lenton, p. 54</ref>\n\n==Construction and career==\n''Exeter'', the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy,<ref>Colledge, p. 119</ref> was [[laid down]] on 1 August 1928, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 18 July 1929 and completed on 27 July 1931. The ship was then assigned to the [[2nd Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Cruiser Squadron]] of the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]], where she served between 1931 and 1933. In 1934 she was assigned to the [[North America and West Indies Station|America and West Indies Station]] and remained there, aside from a temporary deployment to the Mediterranean during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Abyssinian crisis]] of 1935\u20131936, until 1939.<ref>Whitley, pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n====Battle of the River Plate====\n{{main|Battle of the River Plate}}\n[[File:Exeter'sDamage1939.jpg|thumb|Damage received by ''Exeter'' during the Battle of the River Plate]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], she formed part of the South American [[Division (naval)|Division]] with the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Cumberland|57|2}}, under [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Henry Harwood]]. The ship, commanded by [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[F. S. Bell|Frederick Bell]], was assigned to Force G to hunt for German commerce raiders off the eastern coast of South America on 6 October 1939. Two months later, Harwood ordered ''Exeter'' and the [[light cruiser]] {{HMNZS|Achilles|70|2}} to rendezvous with his own {{HMS|Ajax|22|2}} off the mouth of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], while HMS ''Cumberland'' was refitting in the [[Falkland Islands]].<ref>Rohwer, pp. 6, 11</ref> The two other ships arrived on 12 December, and then the ''Admiral Graf Spee'' spotted the ''Exeter'' during the following morning.<ref>Stephen, pp. 16, 18</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Hans Langsdorff]] decided to engage the British and closed at full speed. The British doctrine on how to engage ships like the ''Admiral Graf Spee'' had been developed by Harwood in 1936 and specified that the British force act as two divisions. Following this procedure, ''Exeter'' operated as a division on her own while ''Achilles'' and ''Ajax'' formed the other, splitting the fire of the German ship. They were only partially successful as the German ship concentrated her main armament of six {{convert|283|mm|in|adj=on}} guns on ''Exeter'', and her secondary armament of eight {{convert|149|mm|in|adj=on}} guns on the light cruisers. Langsdorff opened fire on ''Exeter'' at 06:18 with [[Explosive material#High explosives|high-explosive]] shells and she returned fire two minutes later at a range of {{convert|18700|yd}}. The German ship [[wikt:straddle|straddled]] the British cruiser with her third [[salvo]]; shrapnel from the near misses killed the crew of the starboard torpedo tubes, started fires amidships and damaged both [[Supermarine Walrus]] seaplanes. After eight salvos from ''Exeter'', ''Admiral Graf Spee'' scored a direct hit on 'B' turret that knocked it out of action and shrapnel from the hit killed all of the bridge personnel except three. Bell, wounded in the face, transferred to the aft conning position to continue the battle. His ship was hit twice more shortly afterwards, but her powerplant was not damaged and she remained seaworthy, although her aircraft had to be jettisoned.<ref name=\"Stephen, pp. 18\u201319\">Stephen, pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nAt 06:30, Langsdorff switched his fire to the light cruisers, but only inflicted shrapnel damage on them before some of ''Exeter''{{'}}s torpedoes forced him to turn away at 06:37 to evade them. Her second torpedo attack at 06:43 was also unsuccessful. In the meanwhile, Langsdorff had switched his main guns back to the heavy cruiser and scored several more hits. They knocked out 'A' turret, started a fire amidships that damaged the ship's fire-control and navigation circuits, and caused a seven-degree [[List (watercraft)|list]] with flooding.<ref name=\"Stephen, pp. 18\u201319\"/> After \"Y\" turret had temporarily been disabled, Bell said, \"I'm going to ram the --------. It will be the end of us but it will sink him too\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/15/a5776815.shtml |title=WW2 People's War \u2013 HMS Exeter- a Royal Marine's Story |website=BBC |date=16 September 2005  |author=Aidan Toase |accessdate= 6 June 2016}}</ref> The turret was repaired and she remained in action until flooding disabled the machinery for \"Y\" turret at 07:30. At 11:07, Bell informed Harwood that ''Exeter'' had a single eight-inch and a four-inch gun available in local control, and that she could make {{convert|18|kn}}. Harwood ordered Bell to head to the Falklands for repair.<ref>Stephen, pp. 20\u201323</ref>\n\nThe ship was hit by a total of seven 283&nbsp;mm shells that killed 61 of her crew and wounded another 23. In return, the cruiser had hit ''Admiral Graf Spee'' three times; one shell penetrated her main armour belt and narrowly missed detonating in one of her engine rooms, but the most important one disabled her oil-purification equipment. Without it, the ship was unlikely to be able to reach Germany. Several days later, unable to be repaired and apparently confronted by powerful Royal Navy reinforcements (including HMS ''Cumberland''), the ''Admiral Graf Spee'' was scuttled by her captain in the harbour of [[Montevideo]].<ref>Stephens, pp. 21\u201327</ref>\n\n''Exeter'' made for [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Port Stanley]] for emergency repairs which took until January 1940.<ref name=w5/> She was repaired and modernised at [[HM Dockyard, Devonport]] between 14 February 1940 and 10 March 1941;<ref>Raven & Roberts, p. 430</ref> Captain [[W.N.T.

Escorted by six American and three Dutch [[destroyer]]s, the force departed that afternoon. The Dutch [[Rear Admiral]] [[Karel Doorman]], commanding the force, took his ships through the [[Gaspar Strait]] and then northwest towards Bangka Island. While passing through the strait, the Dutch destroyer {{HNLMS|Van Ghent|1926|2}} struck a rock in poor visibility and another Dutch destroyer was tasked to take off her crew.<ref>Gill, pp. 565, 571\u201372</ref> The Japanese spotted the Allied ships around 08:00 and repeatedly attacked them. The first was a group of seven [[Nakajima B5N]] \"Kate\" [[torpedo bomber]]s from the [[light carrier]] {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ry\u016bj\u014d||2}} that attacked ''Exeter'' with bombs around 10:30. The blast from a near miss badly damaged her [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]], but the ship was only damaged by shrapnel. They were followed shortly afterwards by a group of 23 [[Mitsubishi G3M]] \"Nell\" bombers from the [[Genzan Air Group]] that inflicted no damage as they dropped their bombs from high altitude. Another group of six B5Ns attacked without effect at 11:30.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 123</ref>\n\nThe repeated aerial attacks persuaded Doorman that further progress was unwise in the face of Japanese aerial supremacy and he ordered his ships to reverse course and head for [[Tanjung Priok]] at 12:42.<ref>Gill, p. 573</ref> The attacks continued as 27 G3Ms of the [[Mihoro Air Group]] then bombed from high altitude. Seven more B5Ns attacked fruitlessly at 14:30; a half-dozen more followed an hour later. The final attack was made by 17 [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" bombers of the [[Kanoya Air Group]] shortly before dark. The Japanese attacks were almost entirely ineffectual, with no ship reporting anything more than shrapnel damage. In return, allied anti-aircraft fire was moderately effective with most of the attacking bombers damaged by shrapnel. In addition, one G4M crashed while attempting to land, and another was badly damaged upon landing.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 124</ref>\n\n====First Battle of the Java Sea====\n{{main|Battle of the Java Sea}}\nOn 25 February, Helfrich ordered all available warships to join Doorman's Eastern Striking Force at [[Surabaya]]. The ''Exeter'' and the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Perth|D29|2}}, escorted by three British destroyers, {{HMS|Jupiter|F85|2}}, {{HMS|Encounter|H10|2}}, and {{HMS|Electra|H27|2}}, set sail at once, leaving behind one Australian cruiser and two destroyers that were short of fuel.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 233</ref> After they had arrived the following day, Doorman's entire force of five cruisers and nine destroyers departed Surabaya at 18:30 to patrol off Eastern Java in hopes of intercepting the oncoming invasion convoy which had been spotted earlier that morning. The Japanese were further north than he anticipated and his ships found nothing.<ref>Gill, pp. 607\u2013608</ref> His own ships were located at 09:35 on the following morning, 27 February, and were continuously tracked by the Japanese. Doorman ordered a return to Surabaya at 10:30, and his ships were attacked by eight bombers from the Kanoya Air Group at 14:37. They claimed to have made two hits on the ''Jupiter'', but actually they missed the British destroyer. Just as his leading ships were entering harbour, he received reports of enemy ships {{convert|90|mi}} to the north and Doorman ordered his ships to turn about to intercept them.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 238</ref>\n\nAware of Doorman's movements, the Japanese commander, Rear Admiral [[Takeo Takagi]], detached the convoy's two escorting destroyer [[flotilla]]s, each consisting of a light cruiser and seven destroyers, to intercept the Allied ships in conjunction with his own pair of heavy cruisers ({{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nachi||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Haguro||2}}) which were escorted by a pair of destroyers.<ref>Grove, pp. 86\u201389</ref> His heavy cruisers opened fire at long range at 15:47 with little effect. The light cruisers and destroyers closed to ranges between {{convert|13000|and|15000|yd}} and began firing [[Type 93 torpedo|Type 93 \"Long Lance\" torpedoes]] beginning at 16:03.<ref>Dull, pp. 76\u201378</ref> All of these torpedoes failed to damage their targets, although one torpedo hit ''Exeter'' and failed to detonate at 16:35.<ref name=g3>Grove, p. 93</ref> Three minutes later, ''Haguro'' changed the course of the battle when one of her shells penetrated the British ship's [[starboard]] aft twin four-inch gun mount before detonating in the aft [[Fire room|boiler room]],<ref>Lacroix & Wells, p. 298</ref> knocking six of her boilers off-line<ref name=g3/> and killing 14 of her crew. The ship [[wikt:sheer#Verb|sheered]] out of line to avoid another torpedo and slowed, followed by all of the trailing cruisers.<ref>Shores, Cull & Izawa 1993, p. 239</ref> ''Perth'' laid a [[smoke screen]] to protect ''Exeter''<ref>Grove, p. 94</ref> and the Allied ships sorted themselves into separate groups as they attempted to disengage. ''Exeter'' was escorted by one Dutch and all three British destroyers in one group and the other cruisers and the American destroyers formed the other group. The Japanese did not initially press their pursuit as they manoeuvered to use their torpedoes against the crippled ''Exeter'', which could only make {{convert|5|kn}}, and her escorts.<ref>Dull, pp. 80\u201382</ref>\n \nThe Japanese began launching torpedoes beginning at 17:20 at ranges of {{convert|10000|to|18500|yd}}, but they all missed. For some reason, two Japanese destroyers continued to close before firing their torpedoes at {{convert|6500|yd}} and ''Encounter'' and ''Electra'' pulled out of line to counter-attack. They engaged {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asagumo|1937|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Minegumo|1937|2}} at close range as they closed. ''Asagumo'' was damaged by ''Electra'', but the Japanese ship sank the British destroyer at 17:46. Meanwhile, the ''Exeter'' continued south to Surabaya, escorted by ''Encounter'' and the Dutch destroyer {{HNLMS|Witte de With|1928|2}}. Doorman's repeated, unsuccessful, and ultimately fatal attempts to reach the transports concentrated the Japanese on the task of protecting the transports and allowed the damaged British cruiser to reach harbour.<ref>Dull, pp. 82\u201386</ref>\n\n====Second Battle of the Java Sea====\n{{main|Second Battle of the Java Sea}}\n[[File:Exeter sinking.jpg|thumb|left|''Exeter'' sinking after the Second Battle of the Java Sea]]\nThe following day, after making temporary repairs and refuelling, the  ''Exeter'', escorted by ''Encounter'' and the American destroyer {{USS|Pope|DD-225|2}}, was ordered to steam to [[Colombo]], via the [[Sunda Strait]].

Three principal variants of the Lansen were built for [[attack aircraft|attack]] (A 32A), [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] (J 32B), and [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] (S 32C). During its long operational life, the Saab 32 also served as an [[electronic warfare]] platform and target-tug aircraft.\n\n==Development==\nIn Autumn 1946, the Saab company began internal studies aimed at developing a replacement aircraft for the [[Saab 18|Saab B 18/S 18]] as Sweden's standard attack aircraft.<ref name = \"saab 1017\">''Saab'' 30 December 1960. p. 1017.</ref> In 1948, Saab was formally approached by the Swedish Government with a request to investigate the development of a [[turbojet]]-powered [[attack aircraft|strike]] aircraft to replace a series of 1940s vintage attack, reconnaissance and night-fighter aircraft then in the [[Swedish Air Force|Flygvapnet]]: the B 18/S 18, [[Saab 21|J 21R/A 21R]] and J 30 ([[de Havilland Mosquito]]). Out of several differing design studies performed, including a twin-engine aircraft intended to be powered by a pair of [[de Havilland Ghost]] turbojet engines, Saab settled on a single-engine design, which was initially designated the ''P1150''.<ref name = \"GG 134\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 134.</ref>\n\nOn 20 December 1948, a phase one contract for the design and mock-up of the proposed aircraft was issued, formally initiating development work upon the ''P1150''.<ref name = \"saab 1017\"/><ref name=\"saab 2015\">[http://saab.com/sv/region/brazil/about-saab/Stories/saab-brazil-stories/2015/saab-32-lansen/ \"Saab 32 Lansen.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126193910/http://saab.com/sv/region/brazil/about-saab/Stories/saab-brazil-stories/2015/saab-32-lansen/ |date=2016-01-26 }} ''Saab'', 14 December 2015.</ref> The requirements laid out by the Swedish Air Force for the ''P1150'' were demanding: it had to be able to attack anywhere along Sweden's 2,000&nbsp;km (1,245&nbsp;miles) of coastline within one hour of launch from a central location. It had to be capable of being launched in any weather conditions and at day or night.<ref name = \"GG 134\" />  In response, Saab elected to develop a twin-seat aircraft with a low-mounted wing, and equipped with advanced electronics.<ref name = \"saab 2015\" /> The ''P1150'' would break new grounds for the Swedish Air Force, being their first two-seat jet aircraft, and the first to carry a built-in search radar.<ref name = \"wag 53\">Wagner 2009, p. 53.</ref>\n\nSaab had initially envisaged powering the ''P1150'' with the indigenously produced [[STAL Dovern]] turbojet engine. However, both timescale and technical difficulties encountered during the development of the Dovern resulted in the Swedish government electing to substitute the intended Dovern engine with the license-built [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] Series 100 turbojet engine, designated RM.5, instead.<ref name = \"saab 1017\" /><ref name = \"GG 134\" /> The single Avon engine provided the Saab A 32A with a thrust to weight ratio of about 0.3, and enabled the aircraft to be roughly 10,000lb heavier than the twin engine Saab 18 it replaced; the later-produced J 32B interceptor and S 32C reconnaissance variants received the upgraded and significantly more powerful RM6A Avon engine instead.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 134\u201336.</ref>\n\nOn 3 November 1952, the first ''P1150'' prototype conducted its first flight.<ref name = \"GG 134\"/><ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1952/1952%20-%203206.html \"700&nbsp;m.p.h. Saab.\"] ''Flight International'', 7 November 1952. p. 580.</ref> The design of the prototypes had initially featured both [[Flap (aircraft)|Fowler flaps]] and a leading edge slot; this slot was discarded as unnecessary after trials with the prototypes and never appeared on subsequent production aircraft. Triangular fences were added near the wing roots during flight testing in order to improve airflow when the aircraft was being flown at a high [[angle of attack]].<ref name = \"saab 1017\"/><ref name = \"GG 135\"/> A small batch of ''P1150'' prototypes completed design and evaluation trials with series production of the newly designated ''Saab 32 Lansen'' beginning in 1953. Development work on the project was recorded as having involved more than 2,000,000 [[man-hour]]s in total.<ref name = \"saab 1017\"/>\n\nIn Development 1955, the first production A 32A Lansen attack aircraft were delivered to the Swedish Air Force; deliveries of this variant proceeded through to mid 1958, at which point manufacturing activity switched to the other two variants of the Lansen, the J 32B and S 32C. These two models differed substantially from the first, the J 32 B being fitted with a new engine for greater flight performance along with new navigation and [[fire control]] systems.<ref name = \"saab 1017\" /><ref>{{Citation | title = Aviation Week | volume = 66 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1957 | page = 73}}.</ref>  On 7 January 1957, the first J 32 B Lansen conducted its maiden flight; on 26 March 1957, the first S 32C Lansen performed its first flight. Production of the Lansen continued until May 1960.<ref name = \"saab 1017\" />\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Saab J 32E Lansen (32612) 1.JPG|thumb|A J 32E Lansen on static display]]\nThe Saab 32 Lansen had a simple general arrangement, being one of the first aircraft in the world to be specifically developed to fly attack missions.<ref name = \"GG 134\"/> \n\nIts basic design features it was designed from came from Switzerland. It included drawings on Messerschmitts [[Messerschmitt P.1101]], [[Messerschmitt P.1110]], [[Messerschmitt P.1111]] and [[Messerschmitt P.1112]]. SAAB's project manager Frid W\u00e4nstr\u00f6m retrieved these secret papers from Switzerland to Sweden in 1945. The documents came from engineers from Messerschmitt who fled to Switzerland at the end of the Second World War. Among them were the engineer and aerodynamicist Hermann Behrbohm, who came to be part of Saab's core in the team around [[Saab 29 Tunnan]] and upcoming aircraft types like the The Saab 32 Lansen and [[Saab 35 Draken]].\n\nFrom the outset, it was designed to provide good support for the installation of [[electronic warfare]] and weapons systems. The aircraft could be armed with a total of four 20&nbsp;mm cannon, as well as wing pylons for various calibers of rockets and assorted bombs. The J 32 variant carried four 30&nbsp;mm [[ADEN cannon]]s while the A 32 (\"A\" stands for attack) had an armament of four 20&nbsp;mm [[Bofors]] m/49 cannon hidden under flaps in the nose.<ref name = \"GG 136\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 136.</ref> The J 32 differed substantially from the other variant, Saab describing it as \"to all intents a new aircraft\", being fitted with a more powerful engine and newer armaments and different radar.<ref name = \"saab 2015\"/>\n\nThe Lansen's nose also contained the [[Ericsson]] mapping and navigation [[radar]], the forward antenna of which was housed in a large blister fairing underneath the fuselage, directly forward of the main [[landing gear]]; this radar worked in conjunction with the [[Rb 04]]C anti-ship missile, one of the earliest [[cruise missile]]s in western service. The attack variant of the Lansen could carry up to two RB04 missiles, one underneath each wing.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 135\u201336.</ref>{{#tag:ref |The RB 04 missile would use the Lansen's radar for target lock-on and for the missile's initial programming; after launch it would use its own active terminal homing with no further reliance on the aircraft's radar.<ref name = \"GG 136\"/>|group= Nb}} On the reconnaissance variant of the Lansen, up to six cameras can be installed in the place of the four cannon,{{#tag:ref |The initial camera configuration included two SKa 17 cameras with 5.1 inch lenses and two SKa 18 with 36.2 inch lenses. In 1962, the configuration was updated to a single SKa 15 camera with a 3.9 inch lens, three SKa 16 cameras with 3.9 inch lenses, and two Ska 23 cameras with 23.6 inch lenses.<ref name = \"wag 55\" />|group= Nb}} the camera bodies required the installation of chin blisters on the upper fuselage of the nose; the Lansen could also carry up to 12 M62 flash bombs for night photography.<ref>Wagner 2009, pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\n[[File:RR Avon.jpg|thumb|left|Rolls-Royce Avon engine]]\nThe fuselage of the Lansen was produced with a sleek, [[streamliner|streamlined]] airframe with clean lines. The Lansen was the first aircraft on which every mould line had been a result of mathematical calculation, made possible via an early application of [[computer]] technology.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 134\u201335.</ref> The wing had a 10 per cent laminar profile and a 35\u00b0 sweep. [[hydraulic]]ally-boosted [[aileron]]s and large [[Fowler flap]]s on the wings comprised the main flight control surfaces, as did the hydraulically-assisted [[elevator]]s of the powered tailplane; a total of four [[air brake (aeronautics)|airbrake]]s were also present on the sides of the rear fuselage.<ref name = \"GG 135\"/> The Lansen had a [[Tricycle landing gear|tricycle undercarriage]] with a single wheel on all of the [[landing gear]].<ref name = \"wag 54\"/> Other wing features include one-section stall fences on the outer-thirds of the wing, a [[pitot tube]] on the right wingtip, and three underwing [[hardpoint]]s.<ref name = \"wag 54\"/> To test the 35\u00b0 sweepback design of the Lansen's wing, a half-scale wing was mounted on a [[Saab 91 Safir|Saab Safir]], designated Saab 202 Safir.{{citation needed | date = March 2014}}\n\nThe Lansen was powered by an [[afterburner|afterburning]] [[Rolls-Royce Avon|Svenska Flygmotor RM5]] [[turbojet]] engine, which was a license-produced Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3/Mk.109 engine manufactured by [[Volvo Aero|Svenska Flygmotor]].<ref>Wagner 2009, pp. 53\u201354.</ref> For easy maintenance access to the engine, the aircraft's entire aft fuselage was detachable.<ref name = \"GG 135\"/> The air intakes for the engine were located just forwards and above the wing. The two-man pilot and navigator crew were contained in a pressurised cockpit equipped with a single-piece clamshell canopy; a second windscreen separates the cockpit in between the pilot and navigator to protect the latter in case of inadvertent jettisoning of the canopy.<ref name = \"GG 135\"/><ref name = \"wag 54\">Wagner 2009, p. 54.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nOn 25 October 1953, a SAAB 32 Lansen attained a [[Mach number|Mach]]  number of at least 1.12 while in a shallow dive, exceeding the [[supersonic|sound barrier]].<ref name = \"GG 135\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 135.</ref> In December 1955, deliveries of the A 32A attack variant formally commenced, allowing the swift retirement of the last piston-powered B 18 bomber from Swedish service shortly thereafter. According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, the A 32A proved to be extremely effective, both in terms of serviceability and the accuracy of its armaments.<ref name = \"GG 136\"/> Between 1958 and 1960, a total of 54 S32 C reconnaissance aircraft were manufactured.<ref name = \"wag 55\">Wagner 2009, p. 55.</ref> The last Lansen to be built was delivered to the Flygvapnet on 2 May 1960.<ref name = \"GG 136\"/>\n\n[[File:LansenV\u00e4xj\u00f6AirShow2012 1.jpg|thumb|left|A J 32B Lansen at [[V\u00e4xj\u00f6]] Air Show 2012.

The wings and the tail was removed and a small cabin was added on top of the fuselage. Where engine outlet earlier had been, there was now a square pipe, which lead the air down to the ground. The type was only tested and evaluated at F21 until 1971, when the project was cancelled. The project was cancelled due to low efficiency and a very high fuel-consumption.

Three principal variants of the Lansen were built for [[attack aircraft|attack]] (A 32A), [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] (J 32B), and [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] (S 32C). During its long operational life, the Saab 32 also served as an [[electronic warfare]] platform and target-tug aircraft.\n\n==Development==\nIn Autumn 1946, the Saab company began internal studies aimed at developing a replacement aircraft for the [[Saab 18|Saab B 18/S 18]] as Sweden's standard attack aircraft.<ref name = \"saab 1017\">''Saab'' 30 December 1960. p. 1017.</ref> In 1948, Saab was formally approached by the Swedish Government with a request to investigate the development of a [[turbojet]]-powered [[attack aircraft|strike]] aircraft to replace a series of 1940s vintage attack, reconnaissance and night-fighter aircraft then in the [[Swedish Air Force|Flygvapnet]]: the B 18/S 18, [[Saab 21|J 21R/A 21R]] and J 30 ([[de Havilland Mosquito]]). Out of several differing design studies performed, including a twin-engine aircraft intended to be powered by a pair of [[de Havilland Ghost]] turbojet engines, Saab settled on a single-engine design, which was initially designated the ''P1150''.<ref name = \"GG 134\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 134.</ref>\n\nOn 20 December 1948, a phase one contract for the design and mock-up of the proposed aircraft was issued, formally initiating development work upon the ''P1150''.<ref name = \"saab 1017\"/><ref name=\"saab 2015\">[http://saab.com/sv/region/brazil/about-saab/Stories/saab-brazil-stories/2015/saab-32-lansen/ \"Saab 32 Lansen.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126193910/http://saab.com/sv/region/brazil/about-saab/Stories/saab-brazil-stories/2015/saab-32-lansen/ |date=2016-01-26 }} ''Saab'', 14 December 2015.</ref> The requirements laid out by the Swedish Air Force for the ''P1150'' were demanding: it had to be able to attack anywhere along Sweden's 2,000&nbsp;km (1,245&nbsp;miles) of coastline within one hour of launch from a central location. It had to be capable of being launched in any weather conditions and at day or night.<ref name = \"GG 134\" />  In response, Saab elected to develop a twin-seat aircraft with a low-mounted wing, and equipped with advanced electronics.<ref name = \"saab 2015\" /> The ''P1150'' would break new grounds for the Swedish Air Force, being their first two-seat jet aircraft, and the first to carry a built-in search radar.<ref name = \"wag 53\">Wagner 2009, p. 53.</ref>\n\nSaab had initially envisaged powering the ''P1150'' with the indigenously produced [[STAL Dovern]] turbojet engine. However, both timescale and technical difficulties encountered during the development of the Dovern resulted in the Swedish government electing to substitute the intended Dovern engine with the license-built [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] Series 100 turbojet engine, designated RM.5, instead.<ref name = \"saab 1017\" /><ref name = \"GG 134\" /> The single Avon engine provided the Saab A 32A with a thrust to weight ratio of about 0.3, and enabled the aircraft to be roughly 10,000lb heavier than the twin engine Saab 18 it replaced; the later-produced J 32B interceptor and S 32C reconnaissance variants received the upgraded and significantly more powerful RM6A Avon engine instead.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 134\u201336.</ref>\n\nOn 3 November 1952, the first ''P1150'' prototype conducted its first flight.<ref name = \"GG 134\"/><ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1952/1952%20-%203206.html \"700&nbsp;m.p.h. Saab.\"] ''Flight International'', 7 November 1952. p. 580.</ref> The design of the prototypes had initially featured both [[Flap (aircraft)|Fowler flaps]] and a leading edge slot; this slot was discarded as unnecessary after trials with the prototypes and never appeared on subsequent production aircraft. Triangular fences were added near the wing roots during flight testing in order to improve airflow when the aircraft was being flown at a high [[angle of attack]].<ref name = \"saab 1017\"/><ref name = \"GG 135\"/> A small batch of ''P1150'' prototypes completed design and evaluation trials with series production of the newly designated ''Saab 32 Lansen'' beginning in 1953. Development work on the project was recorded as having involved more than 2,000,000 [[man-hour]]s in total.<ref name = \"saab 1017\"/>\n\nIn Development 1955, the first production A 32A Lansen attack aircraft were delivered to the Swedish Air Force; deliveries of this variant proceeded through to mid 1958, at which point manufacturing activity switched to the other two variants of the Lansen, the J 32B and S 32C. These two models differed substantially from the first, the J 32 B being fitted with a new engine for greater flight performance along with new navigation and [[fire control]] systems.<ref name = \"saab 1017\" /><ref>{{Citation | title = Aviation Week | volume = 66 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1957 | page = 73}}.</ref>  On 7 January 1957, the first J 32 B Lansen conducted its maiden flight; on 26 March 1957, the first S 32C Lansen performed its first flight. Production of the Lansen continued until May 1960.<ref name = \"saab 1017\" />\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Saab J 32E Lansen (32612) 1.JPG|thumb|A J 32E Lansen on static display]]\nThe Saab 32 Lansen had a simple general arrangement, being one of the first aircraft in the world to be specifically developed to fly attack missions.<ref name = \"GG 134\"/> \n\nIts basic design features it was designed from came from Switzerland. It included drawings on Messerschmitts [[Messerschmitt P.1101]], [[Messerschmitt P.1110]], [[Messerschmitt P.1111]] and [[Messerschmitt P.1112]]. SAAB's project manager Frid W\u00e4nstr\u00f6m retrieved these secret papers from Switzerland to Sweden in 1945. The documents came from engineers from Messerschmitt who fled to Switzerland at the end of the Second World War. Among them were the engineer and aerodynamicist Hermann Behrbohm, who came to be part of Saab's core in the team around [[Saab 29 Tunnan]] and upcoming aircraft types like the The Saab 32 Lansen and [[Saab 35 Draken]].\n\nFrom the outset, it was designed to provide good support for the installation of [[electronic warfare]] and weapons systems. The aircraft could be armed with a total of four 20&nbsp;mm cannon, as well as wing pylons for various calibers of rockets and assorted bombs. The J 32 variant carried four 30&nbsp;mm [[ADEN cannon]]s while the A 32 (\"A\" stands for attack) had an armament of four 20&nbsp;mm [[Bofors]] m/49 cannon hidden under flaps in the nose.<ref name = \"GG 136\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 136.</ref> The J 32 differed substantially from the other variant, Saab describing it as \"to all intents a new aircraft\", being fitted with a more powerful engine and newer armaments and different radar.<ref name = \"saab 2015\"/>\n\nThe Lansen's nose also contained the [[Ericsson]] mapping and navigation [[radar]], the forward antenna of which was housed in a large blister fairing underneath the fuselage, directly forward of the main [[landing gear]]; this radar worked in conjunction with the [[Rb 04]]C anti-ship missile, one of the earliest [[cruise missile]]s in western service. The attack variant of the Lansen could carry up to two RB04 missiles, one underneath each wing.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 135\u201336.</ref>{{#tag:ref |The RB 04 missile would use the Lansen's radar for target lock-on and for the missile's initial programming; after launch it would use its own active terminal homing with no further reliance on the aircraft's radar.<ref name = \"GG 136\"/>|group= Nb}} On the reconnaissance variant of the Lansen, up to six cameras can be installed in the place of the four cannon,{{#tag:ref |The initial camera configuration included two SKa 17 cameras with 5.1 inch lenses and two SKa 18 with 36.2 inch lenses.

The Lansen was the first aircraft on which every mould line had been a result of mathematical calculation, made possible via an early application of [[computer]] technology.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 134\u201335.</ref> The wing had a 10 per cent laminar profile and a 35\u00b0 sweep. [[hydraulic]]ally-boosted [[aileron]]s and large [[Fowler flap]]s on the wings comprised the main flight control surfaces, as did the hydraulically-assisted [[elevator]]s of the powered tailplane; a total of four [[air brake (aeronautics)|airbrake]]s were also present on the sides of the rear fuselage.<ref name = \"GG 135\"/> The Lansen had a [[Tricycle landing gear|tricycle undercarriage]] with a single wheel on all of the [[landing gear]].<ref name = \"wag 54\"/> Other wing features include one-section stall fences on the outer-thirds of the wing, a [[pitot tube]] on the right wingtip, and three underwing [[hardpoint]]s.<ref name = \"wag 54\"/> To test the 35\u00b0 sweepback design of the Lansen's wing, a half-scale wing was mounted on a [[Saab 91 Safir|Saab Safir]], designated Saab 202 Safir.{{citation needed | date = March 2014}}\n\nThe Lansen was powered by an [[afterburner|afterburning]] [[Rolls-Royce Avon|Svenska Flygmotor RM5]] [[turbojet]] engine, which was a license-produced Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3/Mk.109 engine manufactured by [[Volvo Aero|Svenska Flygmotor]].<ref>Wagner 2009, pp. 53\u201354.</ref> For easy maintenance access to the engine, the aircraft's entire aft fuselage was detachable.<ref name = \"GG 135\"/> The air intakes for the engine were located just forwards and above the wing. The two-man pilot and navigator crew were contained in a pressurised cockpit equipped with a single-piece clamshell canopy; a second windscreen separates the cockpit in between the pilot and navigator to protect the latter in case of inadvertent jettisoning of the canopy.<ref name = \"GG 135\"/><ref name = \"wag 54\">Wagner 2009, p. 54.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nOn 25 October 1953, a SAAB 32 Lansen attained a [[Mach number|Mach]]  number of at least 1.12 while in a shallow dive, exceeding the [[supersonic|sound barrier]].<ref name = \"GG 135\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 135.</ref> In December 1955, deliveries of the A 32A attack variant formally commenced, allowing the swift retirement of the last piston-powered B 18 bomber from Swedish service shortly thereafter. According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, the A 32A proved to be extremely effective, both in terms of serviceability and the accuracy of its armaments.<ref name = \"GG 136\"/> Between 1958 and 1960, a total of 54 S32 C reconnaissance aircraft were manufactured.<ref name = \"wag 55\">Wagner 2009, p. 55.</ref> The last Lansen to be built was delivered to the Flygvapnet on 2 May 1960.<ref name = \"GG 136\"/>\n\n[[File:LansenV\u00e4xj\u00f6AirShow2012 1.jpg|thumb|left|A J 32B Lansen at [[V\u00e4xj\u00f6]] Air Show 2012.

The wings and the tail was removed and a small cabin was added on top of the fuselage. Where engine outlet earlier had been, there was now a square pipe, which lead the air down to the ground. The type was only tested and evaluated at F21 until 1971, when the project was cancelled. The project was cancelled due to low efficiency and a very high fuel-consumption. There was also a problem with the welding in the pipe. The naming of the version is pretty simple, J32S (S stands for Sn\u00f6 [Snow]) and J16 simply because half of the aircraft was removed in order to create the J32S.\n\n==Surviving aircraft==\nOne aircraft has been restored to flying condition and takes part in air force shows.\n\nAdditionally, eight non flying airframes are on static display at various museums and (former) air force bases, including one in the United States. \n* #32070: Gate guardian at [[Skaraborg Air Force Wing]] (F 7) in S\u00e5ten\u00e4s.\n* #32085: In a museum at former [[H\u00e4lsinge Air Force Wing]] (F 15) in S\u00f6derhamn.\n* #32127: On display by the drive way to the civilian terminal in Halmstad.

According to Lynne, this song was the quickest he had ever written, in thirty minutes, originally as 'filler' for the group's ''Face the Music'' album. The song placed in the top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic in early 1976. The song became a hit again in the UK in 1978 when it featured on ''[[The ELO EP]]''.

According to Lynne, this song was the quickest he had ever written, in thirty minutes, originally as 'filler' for the group's ''Face the Music'' album. The song placed in the top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic in early 1976. The song became a hit again in the UK in 1978 when it featured on ''[[The ELO EP]]''.
