By creating the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, he converted the automobile from an expensive curiosity into an accessible conveyance that would profoundly impact the landscape of the 20th century. \n\nHis introduction of the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] automobile revolutionized transportation and American [[industry]]. As the owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with \"[[Fordism]]\": mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a [[Franchising|franchise]] system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the [[Ford Foundation]] and arranged for his family to control the company permanently.\n\nFord was also widely known for his [[pacifism]] during the first years of [[World War I]], and for promoting [[antisemitic]] content, including ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', through his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' and the book ''[[The International Jew]]'', having an alleged influence on the development of [[Nazism]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in [[Greenfield Township, Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp www.hfmgv.org The Henry Ford Museum: ''The Life of Henry Ford''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024223215/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp |date=October 24, 2008 }}</ref> His father, [[William Ford (businessman)|William Ford]] (1826\u20131905), was born in [[County Cork]], Ireland, to a family that was originally from [[Somerset]], [[England]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ford.ie/AboutFord/CompanyInformation/HistoryOfFord |title=The history of Ford in Ireland Family Crest and Name History}}</ref> His mother, Mary Ford (n\u00e9e Litogot; 1839\u20131876), was born in Michigan as the youngest child of [[Belgian Americans|Belgian]] immigrants; her parents died when she was a child and she was adopted by neighbors, the O'Herns. Henry Ford's siblings were Margaret Ford (1867\u20131938); Jane Ford (c. 1868\u20131945); William Ford (1871\u20131917) and Robert Ford (1873\u20131934).\n\nHis father gave him a pocket watch in his early teens. At 15, Ford dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors dozens of times, gaining the reputation of a watch repairman.<ref>Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 22\u201324; Nevins and Hill, ''Ford TMC'', 58.</ref> At twenty, Ford walked four miles to their [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church every Sunday.<ref>Evans, Harold \"They Made America\" Little, Brown and Company. New York</ref>\n\nFord was devastated when his mother died in 1876. His father expected him to eventually take over the family farm, but he despised farm work. He later wrote, \"I never had any particular love for the farm\u2014it was the mother on the farm I loved.\"<ref>Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 24; Edward A. Guest \"Henry Ford Talks About His Mother,\" ''American Magazine'', July 1923, 11\u201315, 116\u201320.</ref>\n\nIn 1879, Ford left home to work as an apprentice [[machinist]] in Detroit, first with James F. Flower & Bros., and later with the [[Detroit Dry Dock]] Co. In 1882, he returned to Dearborn to work on the family farm, where he became adept at operating the [[Westinghouse Farm Engine|Westinghouse portable steam engine]]. He was later hired by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] to service their steam engines. During this period Ford also studied bookkeeping at [[Goldsmith, Bryant & Stratton Business College]] in Detroit.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LIDyU91YMHAC |title=The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century |last=Watts |first=Steven |publisher=Random House, Inc. |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-307-55897-8 |page=28}}</ref>\n\nFord stated two major events occurred in 1875, when he was 12.  He received a watch, and he witnessed the operation of a [[Nichols and Shepard]] road engine, \"...the first vehicle other than horse-drawn that I had ever seen.\"  In his farm workshop, Ford built a \"steam wagon or tractor\" and a steam car, but thought \"steam was not suitable for light vehicles,\" as \"the boiler was dangerous.\"  Ford also stated, he \"did not see the use of experimenting with electricity, due to the expense of [[trolley wires]], and \"no storage battery was in sight of a weight that was practical.\"  Then in 1885, Ford had the opportunity to repair an [[Otto engine]], and built a four-cycle model in 1887, with a one-inch [[bore (engine)|bore]] and a three-inch [[stroke (engine)|stroke]].  In 1890, Ford started work on a [[two cylinder]] engine.  Ford stated, \"In 1892, I completed my first motor car, powered by a two cylinder four [[horsepower]] motor, with a two-and-half-inch bore and a six-inch stroke, which was connected to a [[countershaft]] by a belt, and then to the rear wheel by a chain.  The belt was shifted by a [[clutch|clutch lever]] to control speeds at 10 or 20 [[miles per hour]], augmented by a [[throttle]].  Other features included 28-inch wire bicycle wheels with rubber tires, a foot brake, a 3-gallon gasoline tank, and later, a water jacket around the cylinders for cooling.  Ford stated that \"in the spring of 1893 the machine was running to my partial satisfaction and giving an opportunity further to test out the design and material on the road.\"  Between 1895 and 1896, Ford drove that machine about 1000 miles.  Ford then started a second car in 1896, eventually building 3 cars in his home workshop.<ref name=\"Ford\">{{Cite book |title=My Life and Work |last=Ford |first=Henry |date=2019 |isbn=9781545549117 |location=Columbia |pages=12\u201317}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Henry Ford 1888.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Ford in 1888<br />\n(aged 25)]]\nFord married [[Clara Jane Bryant]] (1866\u20131950) on April 11, 1888, and supported himself by farming and running a sawmill.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Widow of Automobile Pioneer, Victim of Coronary Occlusion, Survived Him Three Years |date=September 29, 1950 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> They had one child: [[Edsel Ford]] (1893\u20131943).<ref>{{Cite news |title=Edsel Ford Dies in Detroit at 49.

After his promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, he had enough time and money to devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines. These experiments culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle which he named the [[Ford Quadricycle]]. He test-drove it on June 4. After various test drives, Ford brainstormed ways to improve the Quadricycle.<ref>[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html The Showroom of Automotive History: 1896 Quadricycle<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615125140/http://hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html |date=June 15, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1896, Ford attended a meeting of Edison executives, where he was introduced to [[Thomas Edison]]. Edison approved of Ford's automobile experimentation. Encouraged by Edison, Ford designed and built a second vehicle, completing it in 1898.<ref name=\"birth\">Ford R.

Murphy, Ford resigned from the Edison Company and founded the [[Detroit Automobile Company]] on August 5, 1899.<ref name=birth/> However, the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than Ford wanted. Ultimately, the company was not successful and was dissolved in January 1901.<ref name=birth/>\n\nWith the help of [[C. Harold Wills]], Ford designed, built, and successfully raced a 26-horsepower automobile in October 1901. With this success, Murphy and other stockholders in the Detroit Automobile Company formed the [[Henry Ford Company]] on November 30, 1901, with Ford as chief engineer.<ref name=birth/> In 1902, Murphy brought in [[Henry M. Leland]] as a consultant; Ford, in response, left the company bearing his name. With Ford gone, Murphy renamed the company the [[Cadillac Automobile Company]].<ref name=birth/>\n\nTeaming up with former racing cyclist [[Tom Cooper (driver)|Tom Cooper]], Ford also produced the 80+ horsepower racer \"999\" which [[Barney Oldfield]] was to drive to victory in a race in October 1902. Ford received the backing of an old acquaintance, [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]], a Detroit-area coal dealer.<ref name=birth/> They formed a partnership, \"Ford & Malcomson, Ltd.\" to manufacture automobiles. Ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile, and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by [[John F. Dodge|John]] and [[Horace E. Dodge]] to supply over $160,000 in parts.<ref name=birth/> Sales were slow, and a crisis arose when the Dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment.\n\n===Ford Motor Company===\n[[File:Ford Edison Firestone1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Ford with [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Harvey Firestone]]. [[Fort Myers, Florida]], February 11, 1929.]]\n\nIn response, Malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the Dodge Brothers to accept a portion of the new company.<ref name=birth/> Ford & Malcomson was reincorporated as the [[Ford Motor Company]] on June 16, 1903,<ref name=birth/> with $28,000 capital. The original investors included Ford and Malcomson, the Dodge brothers, Malcomson's uncle [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S. Gray]], Malcolmson's secretary [[James Couzens]], and two of Malcomson's lawyers, John W. Anderson and [[Horace Rackham]]. Ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], driving {{convert|1|mi|km}} in 39.4 seconds and setting a new [[land speed record]] at {{convert|91.3|mph|km/h|abbr=off}}. Convinced by this success, the race driver [[Barney Oldfield]], who named this new Ford model \"[[Ford 999|999]]\" in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day, took the car around the country, making the Ford brand known throughout the United States. Ford also was one of the early backers of the [[Indianapolis 500]].\n\n====Model T====\nThe [[Model T]] was introduced on October 1, 1908. It had the steering wheel on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|825|1908|r=-1}}}} today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.<ref>Richard Bak, ''Henry and Edsel: The Creation of the Ford Empire'' (2003) pp. 54\u201363</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/ |title=The Life of Henry Ford |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011005164558/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/ |archive-date=October 5, 2001 |access-date=November 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFord created a huge publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in North America. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed\u2014several years posted 100% gains on the previous year. Always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs, in 1913 Ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants, which enabled an enormous increase in production. Although Ford is often credited with the idea, contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees [[Clarence Avery]], [[Peter E. Martin]], [[Charles E. Sorensen]], and [[C. Harold Wills]].<ref>Nevins (1954) 1:387\u2013415</ref> (See [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]])\n\n[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913]]\n\nSales passed 250,000 in 1914. By 1916, as the price dropped to $360 for the basic touring car, sales reached 472,000.<ref>Lewis 1976, pp. 41\u201359</ref> (Using the consumer price index, this price was equivalent to $7,828 in 2015 dollars.)\n[[File:1924-1925 Ford - T Roadster, Coimbatore (1).jpg|thumb|A 1926 Ford T Roadster on display in India]]\nBy 1918, half of all cars in the United States were Model Ts. All new cars were black; as Ford wrote in his autobiography, \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black\".<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p72\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA72#v=onepage p. 72].</ref> Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of its quicker drying time, Model Ts were available in other colors, including red. The design was fervently promoted and defended by Ford, and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034. This record stood for the next 45 years. This record was achieved in 19 years from the introduction of the first Model T (1908).\n\nPresident [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|Woodrow Wilson]] asked Ford to run as a Democrat for the [[United States Senate]] from Michigan in 1918. Although the nation was at war, Ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed [[League of Nations]].<ref>Watts, pp. 243\u201348</ref> Ford was defeated in a close election by the Republican candidate, [[Truman Newberry]], a former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]].\n\nHenry Ford turned the presidency of Ford Motor Company over to his son Edsel Ford in December 1918. Henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son. Ford started another company, Henry Ford and Son, and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company; the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value. (He was determined to have full control over strategic decisions.) The ruse worked, and Ford and Edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors, thus giving the family sole ownership of the company.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) vol. 2</ref>\n\nIn 1921, Ford also purchased [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln Motor Co.]], founded by Cadillac founder [[Henry Leland]] and his son Wilfred during World War I. The company went into receivership and the Lelands agreed to a Ford buyout, although they were soon expelled from it. Despite this acquisition of a premium car make, Henry displayed relatively little enthusiasm for luxury automobiles in contrast to Edsel, who actively sought to expand Ford into the upscale market. The original Lincoln Model L the Lelands had introduced in 1920 was also kept in production for a decade untouched, until it became too outdated and was replaced by the modernized Model K in 1931.\n\nBy the mid-1920s, [[General Motors]] was rapidly rising as the leading American automobile manufacturer. GM president [[Alfred Sloan]] established the company's \"price ladder\" whereby GM would offer an automobile for \"every purse and purpose\" in contrast to Ford's lack of interest in anything outside the low end market. Although Henry Ford was against replacing the Model T, now 16 years old, Chevrolet was mounting a bold new challenge as the make had been established under Sloan's price ladder as GM's entry-level division. Ford also resisted the increasingly popular idea of payment plans for cars. With Model T sales starting to slide, Ford was forced to relent and approve work on a successor model, shutting down production for 18 months. During this time, Ford constructed a massive new assembly plant at River Rouge for the new Model A, which launched in 1927.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:409\u201336</ref>\n\nIn addition to its price ladder, GM also quickly established itself at the forefront of automotive styling under [[Harley Earl]]'s Arts & Color Department, another area of automobile design that Henry Ford did not entirely appreciate or understand and Ford would not have a true equivalent of the GM styling department for many years.\n\n====Model A and Ford's later career====\nBy 1926, flagging sales of the Model T finally convinced Ford to make a new model. He pursued the project with a great deal of interest in the design of the engine, chassis, and other mechanical necessities, while leaving the body design to his son. Although Ford fancied himself an engineering genius, he had little formal training in mechanical engineering and could not even read a blueprint. A talented team of engineers performed most of the actual work of designing the Model A (and later the flathead V8) with Ford supervising them closely and giving them overall direction. Edsel also managed to prevail over his father's initial objections in the inclusion of a sliding-shift transmission.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956p223\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=223}}.</ref>\n\nThe result was the successful [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]], introduced in December 1927 and produced through 1931, with a total output of more than 4&nbsp;million. Subsequently, the Ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor General Motors (and still in use by automakers today). Not until the 1930s did Ford overcome his objection to finance companies, and the Ford-owned [[Universal Credit Corporation]] became a major car-financing operation. Henry Ford still resisted many technological innovations such as hydraulic brakes and all-metal roofs, which Ford vehicles did not adopt until 1935-36. For 1932 however, Ford dropped a bombshell with the flathead Ford V8, the first low-price eight cylinder engine. The flathead V8, variants of which were used in Ford vehicles for 20 years, was the result of a secret project launched in 1930 and Henry had originally considered a radical X-8 engine before agreeing to a conventional design. It gave Ford a reputation as a performance make well-suited for hot-rodding.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:459\u201378</ref>\n\nFord did not believe in accountants; he amassed one of the world's largest fortunes without ever having his company [[audit]]ed under his administration. Without an accounting department, Ford had no way of knowing exactly how much money was being taken in and spent each month and the company's bills and invoices were reportedly guessed at by weighing them on a scale.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Not until 1956 would Ford be a publicly traded company.\n\nAlso at Edsel's insistence, Ford launched Mercury in 1939 as a mid-range make to challenge Dodge and Buick, although Henry also displayed relatively little enthusiasm for it.\n\n====Labor philosophy====\n=====The five-dollar wage=====\n[[File:Timehenryford.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, January 14, 1935]]\nFord was a pioneer of \"[[welfare capitalism]]\", designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] that had many departments hiring 300 men per year to fill 100 slots. Efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:508\u201340</ref>\n\nFord astonished the world in 1914 by offering a $5 per day wage (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1914|r=-1}}}} today), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers.<ref>Using the [[consumer price index]], this was equivalent to $111.10 per day in 2008 dollars.</ref> A [[Cleveland, Ohio]], newspaper editorialized that the announcement \"shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression.\"<ref>Lewis, ''Public Image'' p. 71</ref> The move proved extremely profitable; instead of constant turnover of employees, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to Ford, bringing their [[human capital]] and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs.<ref>Nevins, ''Ford'' 1:528\u201341</ref><ref>Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 178\u201394</ref> Ford announced his $5-per-day program on January 5, 1914, raising the minimum daily pay from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying male workers.\n\nDetroit was already a high-wage city, but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers.<ref>Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 193\u201394</ref> Ford's policy proved, however, that paying people more would enable Ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy. He viewed the increased wages as profit-sharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_pp126-130\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA126#v=onepage pp. 126\u201330].</ref> It may have been [[James Couzens|Couzens]] who convinced Ford to adopt the $5-day wage.<ref>Lewis, ''Public Image,'' 69\u201370</ref>\n\nReal profit-sharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more, and, importantly, conducted their lives in a manner of which Ford's \"Social Department\" approved. They frowned on heavy drinking, gambling, and (what today are called) [[deadbeat parent|deadbeat dads]]. The Social Department used 50 investigators, plus support staff, to maintain employee standards; a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this \"profit-sharing.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nFord's incursion into his employees' private lives was highly controversial, and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects. By the time he wrote his 1922 memoir, he spoke of the Social Department and of the private conditions for profit-sharing in the past tense, and admitted that <blockquote>paternalism has no place in industry. Welfare work that consists in prying into employees' private concerns is out of date. Men need counsel and men need help, often special help; and all this ought to be rendered for decency's sake. But the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside. Without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p130\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA130#v=onepage p. 130].</ref></blockquote>\n\n=====The five-day workweek=====\nIn addition to raising the wages of his workers, Ford also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The decision was made in 1922, when Ford and Crowther described it as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week,<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p126\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA126#v=onepage p. 126].</ref> but in 1926 it was announced as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week.<ref>Samuel Crowther [http://geowords.com/e_/e_readings/ford2.htm Henry Ford: \"Why I Favor Five Days' Work With Six Days' Pay\"], ''World's Work,'' October 1926 pp. 613\u201316</ref> (Apparently the program started with Saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off.) On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August.<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week/print |title=Archived copy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325165437/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week/print |archive-date=March 25, 2018 |access-date=December 1, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nFord had made the decision to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time, and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business, since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods. However, altruistic concerns also played a role, with Ford explaining \"It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege.\"<ref name=history/>\n\n=====Labor unions=====\nFord was adamantly against [[trade union|labor unions]]. He explained his views on unions in Chapter 18 of ''My Life and Work''.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_pp253-266\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA253#v=onepage pp. 253\u201366].</ref> He thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who, despite their ostensible good motives, would end up doing more harm than good for workers. {{Anchor|No_prosperity_without_productivity}} Most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment, but Ford saw this as self-defeating because, in his view, productivity was necessary for economic prosperity to exist.\n\nHe believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether within the same corporation or in others. Ford also believed that union leaders had a [[perverse incentive]] to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis as a way to maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.\n\nTo forestall union activity, Ford promoted [[Harry Bennett]], a former [[United States Navy|Navy]] boxer, to head the Service Department. Bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing.<ref>Harris, J: ''Henry Ford'', pp. 91\u201392. Moffa Press, 1984.</ref> The most famous incident, on May 26, 1937, involved Bennett's security men beating with clubs members of the [[United Automobile Workers]], including [[Walter Reuther]].<ref name=\"Wallace\">Wallace, Max.

But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a ''de facto'' basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir<ref name=\"Sorensen1956p261\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=261}}.</ref> makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.\n\nThe Ford Motor Company was the last Detroit automaker to recognize the UAW, despite pressure from the rest of the automotive industry and even the US government. A sit-down strike by the UAW union in April 1941 closed the [[River Rouge Plant]]. Sorensen recounted<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp266-272\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=266\u201372}}.</ref> that a distraught Henry Ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate, but his wife Clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business. In her view, it would not be worth the chaos it would create. Ford complied with his wife's ultimatum, and even agreed with her in retrospect. Overnight, the Ford Motor Company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable UAW contract terms. The contract was signed in June 1941.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp266-272\" /> About a year later, Ford told Walter Reuther, \"It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett ever did when he got the UAW into this plant.\" Reuther inquired, \"What do you mean?\" Ford replied, \"Well, you've been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd. Now you're in here and we've given you a union shop and more than you got out of them. That puts you on our side, doesn't it? We can fight General Motors and Wall Street together, eh?\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/puttingworldtoge0000dick/page/63 |title=Putting the world together : my father Walter Reuther, the liberal warrior |last=Reuther. |first=Dickmeyer, Elisabeth |date=2004 |publisher=LivingForce Pub |isbn=978-0-9753792-1-9 |location=Lake Orion, Mich. |page=[https://archive.org/details/puttingworldtoge0000dick/page/63 63] |oclc=57172289}}</ref>\n\n===Ford Airplane Company===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nFord, like other automobile companies, entered the aviation business during [[World War I]], building Liberty engines.

It used a new alloy called [[Alclad]] that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of [[duralumin]]. The plane was similar to [[Fokker]]'s V.VII-3m, and some say that Ford's engineers surreptitiously measured the Fokker plane and then copied it. The Trimotor first flew on June 11, 1926, and was the first successful U.S. passenger airliner, accommodating about 12 passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion. Several variants were also used by the [[U.S. Army]]. Ford has been honored by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for changing the aviation industry. 199 Trimotors were built before it was discontinued in 1933, when the Ford Airplane Division shut down because of poor sales during the [[Great Depression]].\n\n====Willow Run====\n{{Main|Willow Run}}{{clear}}\n\n===Peace and war===\n====World War I era====\nFord opposed war, which he viewed as a terrible waste,<ref name=\"Ford-Bio-A&E\">Henry Ford, Biography (March 25, 1999).

He and about 170 other prominent peace leaders traveled there. Ford's Episcopalian pastor, Reverend Samuel S. Marquis, accompanied him on the mission. Marquis headed Ford's Sociology Department from 1913 to 1921. Ford talked to President Wilson about the mission but had no government support. His group went to neutral Sweden and the Netherlands to meet with peace activists.

His [[Ford River Rouge Complex|River Rouge Plant]] became the world's largest industrial complex, pursuing [[vertical integration]] to such an extent that it could produce its own steel. Ford's goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade. He believed in the global expansion of his company. He believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace, and he used the assembly line process and production of the Model T to demonstrate it.<ref>Watts 236\u201340</ref>\n\nHe opened Ford assembly plants in Britain and Canada in 1911, and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries. In 1912, Ford cooperated with [[Giovanni Agnelli]] of [[Fiat]] to launch the first Italian automotive assembly plants. The first plants in Germany were built in the 1920s with the encouragement of [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Commerce Department, which agreed with Ford's theory that international trade was essential to world peace.<ref>Wilkins</ref> In the 1920s, Ford also opened plants in Australia, India, and France, and by 1929, he had successful dealerships on six continents. Ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] jungle called [[Fordl\u00e2ndia]]; it was one of his few failures.\n\n[[File:Ford Bron Mezhlauk.jpg|thumb|border|right|upright|After signing the contract for technical assistance in building Nizhny Novgorod (Gorky) Automobile Plant.

They saw the size, tempo, standardization, and philosophy of production demonstrated at the Ford Works as a national service\u2014an \"American thing\" that represented the [[culture of the United States]]. Both supporters and critics insisted that Fordism epitomized American capitalist development, and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the United States. As one German explained, \"Automobiles have so completely changed the American's mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car. It is difficult to remember what life was like before Mr. Ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation\".<ref>Nolan, p. 31.</ref> For many Germans, Ford embodied the essence of successful Americanism.\n\nIn ''My Life and Work'', Ford predicted that if greed, racism, and short-sightedness could be overcome, then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on (what today would be called) colonial or [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]] models and would truly benefit all peoples.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_pp242-244\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA242#v=onepage pp. 242\u201344].</ref> His ideas in this passage were vague, but they were idealistic.\n\n==Racing==\n[[File:Henry Ford and Barney Oldfield with Old 999, 1902.jpg|thumb|Ford (standing) launched [[Barney Oldfield]]'s career in 1902]]\n\nFord maintained an interest in auto racing from 1901 to 1913 and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver, later turning the wheel over to hired drivers. He entered stripped-down [[Model T]]s in races, finishing first (although later disqualified) in an \"ocean-to-ocean\" (across the United States) race in 1909, and setting a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) oval speed record at Detroit Fairgrounds in 1911 with driver Frank Kulick. In 1913, Ford attempted to enter a reworked Model T in the [[Indianapolis 500]] but was told rules required the addition of another {{convert|1,000|lb|kg}} to the car before it could qualify. Ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently, citing dissatisfaction with the sport's rules, demands on his time by the booming production of the Model Ts, and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity.\n\nIn ''My Life and Work'' Ford speaks (briefly) of racing in a rather dismissive tone, as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p50\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA50#v=onepage p. 50].</ref> Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.\n\nNevertheless, Ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years, and he was inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1996.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9KOHEPbBBbIC&pg=PA33&dq=henry+ford+Motorsports+Hall+of+Fame+of+America+in+1996#v=snippet&q=Hall%20of%20fame%20henry%20ford |title=The Intellectual Devotional Modern Culture: Revive Your Mind, Complete Your Education, and Converse Confidently with the Culturati |last=Kidder |first=David S. |last2=Oppenheim |first2=Noah D. |date=October 14, 2008 |publisher=Rodale |isbn=978-1-60529-793-4 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Later career and death==\nWhen Edsel Ford, President of Ford Motor Company, died of cancer in May 1943, the elderly and ailing Henry Ford decided to assume the presidency.

But for the previous 20 years, though he had long been without any official executive title, he had always had ''de facto'' control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different.

By creating the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, he converted the automobile from an expensive curiosity into an accessible conveyance that would profoundly impact the landscape of the 20th century. \n\nHis introduction of the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] automobile revolutionized transportation and American [[industry]]. As the owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with \"[[Fordism]]\": mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a [[Franchising|franchise]] system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the [[Ford Foundation]] and arranged for his family to control the company permanently.\n\nFord was also widely known for his [[pacifism]] during the first years of [[World War I]], and for promoting [[antisemitic]] content, including ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', through his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' and the book ''[[The International Jew]]'', having an alleged influence on the development of [[Nazism]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in [[Greenfield Township, Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp www.hfmgv.org The Henry Ford Museum: ''The Life of Henry Ford''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024223215/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp |date=October 24, 2008 }}</ref> His father, [[William Ford (businessman)|William Ford]] (1826\u20131905), was born in [[County Cork]], Ireland, to a family that was originally from [[Somerset]], [[England]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ford.ie/AboutFord/CompanyInformation/HistoryOfFord |title=The history of Ford in Ireland Family Crest and Name History}}</ref> His mother, Mary Ford (n\u00e9e Litogot; 1839\u20131876), was born in Michigan as the youngest child of [[Belgian Americans|Belgian]] immigrants; her parents died when she was a child and she was adopted by neighbors, the O'Herns. Henry Ford's siblings were Margaret Ford (1867\u20131938); Jane Ford (c. 1868\u20131945); William Ford (1871\u20131917) and Robert Ford (1873\u20131934).\n\nHis father gave him a pocket watch in his early teens. At 15, Ford dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors dozens of times, gaining the reputation of a watch repairman.<ref>Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 22\u201324; Nevins and Hill, ''Ford TMC'', 58.</ref> At twenty, Ford walked four miles to their [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church every Sunday.<ref>Evans, Harold \"They Made America\" Little, Brown and Company. New York</ref>\n\nFord was devastated when his mother died in 1876. His father expected him to eventually take over the family farm, but he despised farm work. He later wrote, \"I never had any particular love for the farm\u2014it was the mother on the farm I loved.\"<ref>Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 24; Edward A. Guest \"Henry Ford Talks About His Mother,\" ''American Magazine'', July 1923, 11\u201315, 116\u201320.</ref>\n\nIn 1879, Ford left home to work as an apprentice [[machinist]] in Detroit, first with James F. Flower & Bros., and later with the [[Detroit Dry Dock]] Co. In 1882, he returned to Dearborn to work on the family farm, where he became adept at operating the [[Westinghouse Farm Engine|Westinghouse portable steam engine]]. He was later hired by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] to service their steam engines. During this period Ford also studied bookkeeping at [[Goldsmith, Bryant & Stratton Business College]] in Detroit.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LIDyU91YMHAC |title=The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century |last=Watts |first=Steven |publisher=Random House, Inc. |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-307-55897-8 |page=28}}</ref>\n\nFord stated two major events occurred in 1875, when he was 12.  He received a watch, and he witnessed the operation of a [[Nichols and Shepard]] road engine, \"...the first vehicle other than horse-drawn that I had ever seen.\"  In his farm workshop, Ford built a \"steam wagon or tractor\" and a steam car, but thought \"steam was not suitable for light vehicles,\" as \"the boiler was dangerous.\"  Ford also stated, he \"did not see the use of experimenting with electricity, due to the expense of [[trolley wires]], and \"no storage battery was in sight of a weight that was practical.\"  Then in 1885, Ford had the opportunity to repair an [[Otto engine]], and built a four-cycle model in 1887, with a one-inch [[bore (engine)|bore]] and a three-inch [[stroke (engine)|stroke]].  In 1890, Ford started work on a [[two cylinder]] engine.  Ford stated, \"In 1892, I completed my first motor car, powered by a two cylinder four [[horsepower]] motor, with a two-and-half-inch bore and a six-inch stroke, which was connected to a [[countershaft]] by a belt, and then to the rear wheel by a chain.  The belt was shifted by a [[clutch|clutch lever]] to control speeds at 10 or 20 [[miles per hour]], augmented by a [[throttle]].  Other features included 28-inch wire bicycle wheels with rubber tires, a foot brake, a 3-gallon gasoline tank, and later, a water jacket around the cylinders for cooling.  Ford stated that \"in the spring of 1893 the machine was running to my partial satisfaction and giving an opportunity further to test out the design and material on the road.\"  Between 1895 and 1896, Ford drove that machine about 1000 miles.  Ford then started a second car in 1896, eventually building 3 cars in his home workshop.<ref name=\"Ford\">{{Cite book |title=My Life and Work |last=Ford |first=Henry |date=2019 |isbn=9781545549117 |location=Columbia |pages=12\u201317}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Henry Ford 1888.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Ford in 1888<br />\n(aged 25)]]\nFord married [[Clara Jane Bryant]] (1866\u20131950) on April 11, 1888, and supported himself by farming and running a sawmill.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Widow of Automobile Pioneer, Victim of Coronary Occlusion, Survived Him Three Years |date=September 29, 1950 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> They had one child: [[Edsel Ford]] (1893\u20131943).<ref>{{Cite news |title=Edsel Ford Dies in Detroit at 49.

These experiments culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle which he named the [[Ford Quadricycle]]. He test-drove it on June 4.

Ultimately, the company was not successful and was dissolved in January 1901.<ref name=birth/>\n\nWith the help of [[C.

With this success, Murphy and other stockholders in the Detroit Automobile Company formed the [[Henry Ford Company]] on November 30, 1901, with Ford as chief engineer.<ref name=birth/> In 1902, Murphy brought in [[Henry M.

Ford also was one of the early backers of the [[Indianapolis 500]].\n\n====Model T====\nThe [[Model T]] was introduced on October 1, 1908. It had the steering wheel on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|825|1908|r=-1}}}} today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.<ref>Richard Bak, ''Henry and Edsel: The Creation of the Ford Empire'' (2003) pp. 54\u201363</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/ |title=The Life of Henry Ford |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011005164558/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/ |archive-date=October 5, 2001 |access-date=November 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFord created a huge publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in North America. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed\u2014several years posted 100% gains on the previous year. Always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs, in 1913 Ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants, which enabled an enormous increase in production. Although Ford is often credited with the idea, contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees [[Clarence Avery]], [[Peter E. Martin]], [[Charles E. Sorensen]], and [[C. Harold Wills]].<ref>Nevins (1954) 1:387\u2013415</ref> (See [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]])\n\n[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913]]\n\nSales passed 250,000 in 1914. By 1916, as the price dropped to $360 for the basic touring car, sales reached 472,000.<ref>Lewis 1976, pp. 41\u201359</ref> (Using the consumer price index, this price was equivalent to $7,828 in 2015 dollars.)\n[[File:1924-1925 Ford - T Roadster, Coimbatore (1).jpg|thumb|A 1926 Ford T Roadster on display in India]]\nBy 1918, half of all cars in the United States were Model Ts. All new cars were black; as Ford wrote in his autobiography, \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black\".<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p72\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA72#v=onepage p. 72].</ref> Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of its quicker drying time, Model Ts were available in other colors, including red. The design was fervently promoted and defended by Ford, and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034. This record stood for the next 45 years. This record was achieved in 19 years from the introduction of the first Model T (1908).\n\nPresident [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|Woodrow Wilson]] asked Ford to run as a Democrat for the [[United States Senate]] from Michigan in 1918. Although the nation was at war, Ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed [[League of Nations]].<ref>Watts, pp. 243\u201348</ref> Ford was defeated in a close election by the Republican candidate, [[Truman Newberry]], a former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]].\n\nHenry Ford turned the presidency of Ford Motor Company over to his son Edsel Ford in December 1918. Henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son. Ford started another company, Henry Ford and Son, and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company; the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value. (He was determined to have full control over strategic decisions.) The ruse worked, and Ford and Edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors, thus giving the family sole ownership of the company.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) vol. 2</ref>\n\nIn 1921, Ford also purchased [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln Motor Co.]], founded by Cadillac founder [[Henry Leland]] and his son Wilfred during World War I. The company went into receivership and the Lelands agreed to a Ford buyout, although they were soon expelled from it. Despite this acquisition of a premium car make, Henry displayed relatively little enthusiasm for luxury automobiles in contrast to Edsel, who actively sought to expand Ford into the upscale market. The original Lincoln Model L the Lelands had introduced in 1920 was also kept in production for a decade untouched, until it became too outdated and was replaced by the modernized Model K in 1931.\n\nBy the mid-1920s, [[General Motors]] was rapidly rising as the leading American automobile manufacturer. GM president [[Alfred Sloan]] established the company's \"price ladder\" whereby GM would offer an automobile for \"every purse and purpose\" in contrast to Ford's lack of interest in anything outside the low end market. Although Henry Ford was against replacing the Model T, now 16 years old, Chevrolet was mounting a bold new challenge as the make had been established under Sloan's price ladder as GM's entry-level division. Ford also resisted the increasingly popular idea of payment plans for cars. With Model T sales starting to slide, Ford was forced to relent and approve work on a successor model, shutting down production for 18 months. During this time, Ford constructed a massive new assembly plant at River Rouge for the new Model A, which launched in 1927.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:409\u201336</ref>\n\nIn addition to its price ladder, GM also quickly established itself at the forefront of automotive styling under [[Harley Earl]]'s Arts & Color Department, another area of automobile design that Henry Ford did not entirely appreciate or understand and Ford would not have a true equivalent of the GM styling department for many years.\n\n====Model A and Ford's later career====\nBy 1926, flagging sales of the Model T finally convinced Ford to make a new model. He pursued the project with a great deal of interest in the design of the engine, chassis, and other mechanical necessities, while leaving the body design to his son. Although Ford fancied himself an engineering genius, he had little formal training in mechanical engineering and could not even read a blueprint. A talented team of engineers performed most of the actual work of designing the Model A (and later the flathead V8) with Ford supervising them closely and giving them overall direction. Edsel also managed to prevail over his father's initial objections in the inclusion of a sliding-shift transmission.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956p223\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=223}}.</ref>\n\nThe result was the successful [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]], introduced in December 1927 and produced through 1931, with a total output of more than 4&nbsp;million. Subsequently, the Ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor General Motors (and still in use by automakers today). Not until the 1930s did Ford overcome his objection to finance companies, and the Ford-owned [[Universal Credit Corporation]] became a major car-financing operation. Henry Ford still resisted many technological innovations such as hydraulic brakes and all-metal roofs, which Ford vehicles did not adopt until 1935-36. For 1932 however, Ford dropped a bombshell with the flathead Ford V8, the first low-price eight cylinder engine. The flathead V8, variants of which were used in Ford vehicles for 20 years, was the result of a secret project launched in 1930 and Henry had originally considered a radical X-8 engine before agreeing to a conventional design. It gave Ford a reputation as a performance make well-suited for hot-rodding.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:459\u201378</ref>\n\nFord did not believe in accountants; he amassed one of the world's largest fortunes without ever having his company [[audit]]ed under his administration. Without an accounting department, Ford had no way of knowing exactly how much money was being taken in and spent each month and the company's bills and invoices were reportedly guessed at by weighing them on a scale.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Not until 1956 would Ford be a publicly traded company.\n\nAlso at Edsel's insistence, Ford launched Mercury in 1939 as a mid-range make to challenge Dodge and Buick, although Henry also displayed relatively little enthusiasm for it.\n\n====Labor philosophy====\n=====The five-dollar wage=====\n[[File:Timehenryford.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, January 14, 1935]]\nFord was a pioneer of \"[[welfare capitalism]]\", designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] that had many departments hiring 300 men per year to fill 100 slots. Efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:508\u201340</ref>\n\nFord astonished the world in 1914 by offering a $5 per day wage (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1914|r=-1}}}} today), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers.<ref>Using the [[consumer price index]], this was equivalent to $111.10 per day in 2008 dollars.</ref> A [[Cleveland, Ohio]], newspaper editorialized that the announcement \"shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression.\"<ref>Lewis, ''Public Image'' p. 71</ref> The move proved extremely profitable; instead of constant turnover of employees, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to Ford, bringing their [[human capital]] and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs.<ref>Nevins, ''Ford'' 1:528\u201341</ref><ref>Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 178\u201394</ref> Ford announced his $5-per-day program on January 5, 1914, raising the minimum daily pay from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying male workers.\n\nDetroit was already a high-wage city, but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers.<ref>Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 193\u201394</ref> Ford's policy proved, however, that paying people more would enable Ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy. He viewed the increased wages as profit-sharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_pp126-130\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA126#v=onepage pp. 126\u201330].</ref> It may have been [[James Couzens|Couzens]] who convinced Ford to adopt the $5-day wage.<ref>Lewis, ''Public Image,'' 69\u201370</ref>\n\nReal profit-sharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more, and, importantly, conducted their lives in a manner of which Ford's \"Social Department\" approved. They frowned on heavy drinking, gambling, and (what today are called) [[deadbeat parent|deadbeat dads]]. The Social Department used 50 investigators, plus support staff, to maintain employee standards; a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this \"profit-sharing.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nFord's incursion into his employees' private lives was highly controversial, and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects. By the time he wrote his 1922 memoir, he spoke of the Social Department and of the private conditions for profit-sharing in the past tense, and admitted that <blockquote>paternalism has no place in industry. Welfare work that consists in prying into employees' private concerns is out of date. Men need counsel and men need help, often special help; and all this ought to be rendered for decency's sake. But the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside. Without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p130\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA130#v=onepage p. 130].</ref></blockquote>\n\n=====The five-day workweek=====\nIn addition to raising the wages of his workers, Ford also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The decision was made in 1922, when Ford and Crowther described it as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week,<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p126\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA126#v=onepage p. 126].</ref> but in 1926 it was announced as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week.<ref>Samuel Crowther [http://geowords.com/e_/e_readings/ford2.htm Henry Ford: \"Why I Favor Five Days' Work With Six Days' Pay\"], ''World's Work,'' October 1926 pp. 613\u201316</ref> (Apparently the program started with Saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off.) On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August.<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week/print |title=Archived copy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325165437/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week/print |archive-date=March 25, 2018 |access-date=December 1, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nFord had made the decision to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time, and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business, since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods. However, altruistic concerns also played a role, with Ford explaining \"It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege.\"<ref name=history/>\n\n=====Labor unions=====\nFord was adamantly against [[trade union|labor unions]]. He explained his views on unions in Chapter 18 of ''My Life and Work''.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_pp253-266\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA253#v=onepage pp. 253\u201366].</ref> He thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who, despite their ostensible good motives, would end up doing more harm than good for workers. {{Anchor|No_prosperity_without_productivity}} Most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment, but Ford saw this as self-defeating because, in his view, productivity was necessary for economic prosperity to exist.\n\nHe believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether within the same corporation or in others. Ford also believed that union leaders had a [[perverse incentive]] to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis as a way to maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.\n\nTo forestall union activity, Ford promoted [[Harry Bennett]], a former [[United States Navy|Navy]] boxer, to head the Service Department. Bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing.<ref>Harris, J: ''Henry Ford'', pp. 91\u201392. Moffa Press, 1984.</ref> The most famous incident, on May 26, 1937, involved Bennett's security men beating with clubs members of the [[United Automobile Workers]], including [[Walter Reuther]].<ref name=\"Wallace\">Wallace, Max. (2003). ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. New York: St. Martin's Press.</ref> While Bennett's men were beating the UAW representatives, the supervising police chief on the scene was Carl Brooks, an alumnus of Bennett's Service Department, and [Brooks] \"did not give orders to intervene.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wallace|2003|p=311}}</ref> The following day photographs of the injured UAW members appeared in newspapers, later becoming known as [[The Battle of the Overpass]].\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel\u2014who was president of the company\u2014thought Ford had to come to some sort of [[collective bargaining]] agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a ''de facto'' basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir<ref name=\"Sorensen1956p261\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=261}}.</ref> makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.\n\nThe Ford Motor Company was the last Detroit automaker to recognize the UAW, despite pressure from the rest of the automotive industry and even the US government. A sit-down strike by the UAW union in April 1941 closed the [[River Rouge Plant]]. Sorensen recounted<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp266-272\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=266\u201372}}.</ref> that a distraught Henry Ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate, but his wife Clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business. In her view, it would not be worth the chaos it would create. Ford complied with his wife's ultimatum, and even agreed with her in retrospect. Overnight, the Ford Motor Company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable UAW contract terms. The contract was signed in June 1941.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp266-272\" /> About a year later, Ford told Walter Reuther, \"It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett ever did when he got the UAW into this plant.\" Reuther inquired, \"What do you mean?\" Ford replied, \"Well, you've been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd. Now you're in here and we've given you a union shop and more than you got out of them. That puts you on our side, doesn't it? We can fight General Motors and Wall Street together, eh?\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/puttingworldtoge0000dick/page/63 |title=Putting the world together : my father Walter Reuther, the liberal warrior |last=Reuther. |first=Dickmeyer, Elisabeth |date=2004 |publisher=LivingForce Pub |isbn=978-0-9753792-1-9 |location=Lake Orion, Mich. |page=[https://archive.org/details/puttingworldtoge0000dick/page/63 63] |oclc=57172289}}</ref>\n\n===Ford Airplane Company===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nFord, like other automobile companies, entered the aviation business during [[World War I]], building Liberty engines. After the war, it returned to auto manufacturing until 1925, when Ford acquired the [[Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company|Stout Metal Airplane Company]].\n\n[[File:Ford 4ATF.jpg|thumb|left|Ford 4-AT-F (EC-RRA) of the Spanish Republican Airline, [[L.A.P.E.]]]]\nFord's most successful aircraft was the [[Ford Trimotor|Ford 4AT Trimotor]], often called the \"Tin Goose\" because of its corrugated metal construction. It used a new alloy called [[Alclad]] that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of [[duralumin]]. The plane was similar to [[Fokker]]'s V.VII-3m, and some say that Ford's engineers surreptitiously measured the Fokker plane and then copied it. The Trimotor first flew on June 11, 1926, and was the first successful U.S. passenger airliner, accommodating about 12 passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion. Several variants were also used by the [[U.S. Army]]. Ford has been honored by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for changing the aviation industry. 199 Trimotors were built before it was discontinued in 1933, when the Ford Airplane Division shut down because of poor sales during the [[Great Depression]].\n\n====Willow Run====\n{{Main|Willow Run}}{{clear}}\n\n===Peace and war===\n====World War I era====\nFord opposed war, which he viewed as a terrible waste,<ref name=\"Ford-Bio-A&E\">Henry Ford, Biography (March 25, 1999).

In 1915, the pacifist [[Rosika Schwimmer]] gained favor with Ford, who agreed to fund a [[Peace Ship]] to Europe, where World War I was raging. He and about 170 other prominent peace leaders traveled there. Ford's Episcopalian pastor, Reverend Samuel S. Marquis, accompanied him on the mission. Marquis headed Ford's Sociology Department from 1913 to 1921. Ford talked to President Wilson about the mission but had no government support. His group went to neutral Sweden and the Netherlands to meet with peace activists.

He entered stripped-down [[Model T]]s in races, finishing first (although later disqualified) in an \"ocean-to-ocean\" (across the United States) race in 1909, and setting a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) oval speed record at Detroit Fairgrounds in 1911 with driver Frank Kulick. In 1913, Ford attempted to enter a reworked Model T in the [[Indianapolis 500]] but was told rules required the addition of another {{convert|1,000|lb|kg}} to the car before it could qualify. Ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently, citing dissatisfaction with the sport's rules, demands on his time by the booming production of the Model Ts, and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity.\n\nIn ''My Life and Work'' Ford speaks (briefly) of racing in a rather dismissive tone, as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p50\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA50#v=onepage p. 50].</ref> Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.\n\nNevertheless, Ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years, and he was inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1996.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9KOHEPbBBbIC&pg=PA33&dq=henry+ford+Motorsports+Hall+of+Fame+of+America+in+1996#v=snippet&q=Hall%20of%20fame%20henry%20ford |title=The Intellectual Devotional Modern Culture: Revive Your Mind, Complete Your Education, and Converse Confidently with the Culturati |last=Kidder |first=David S. |last2=Oppenheim |first2=Noah D. |date=October 14, 2008 |publisher=Rodale |isbn=978-1-60529-793-4 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Later career and death==\nWhen Edsel Ford, President of Ford Motor Company, died of cancer in May 1943, the elderly and ailing Henry Ford decided to assume the presidency. By this point, Ford, nearing 80 years old, had had several cardiovascular events (variously cited as heart attacks or strokes) and was mentally inconsistent, suspicious, and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp100_266_et_al\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=100, 266, 271\u201372, 310\u201314}}</ref>\n\nMost of the directors did not want to see him as president. But for the previous 20 years, though he had long been without any official executive title, he had always had ''de facto'' control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different. The directors elected him,<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp325\u2013326\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=325\u201326}}.</ref> and he served until the end of the war. During this period the company began to decline, losing more than $10&nbsp;million a month (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000000|1943|r=-4}}}} today). The administration of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production,<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp324\u2013333\" /> but the idea never progressed.\n\n[[File:Henry Ford grave Ford Cemetery Detroit.JPG|thumb|right|Ford grave, Ford Cemetery]]\nHis health failing, Ford ceded the company Presidency to his grandson, [[Henry Ford II]], in September 1945 and retired.

The grand house, made of Savannah-gray brick, had marble steps, air conditioning, and an [[elevator]]. It sat on 55 acres of manicured lawns and flowering gardens. The house became the center of social gatherings with visitations by the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and the DuPonts. It remains the centerpiece of The Ford Plantation today.<ref>http://www.fordplantation.com</ref> Ford converted the 1870s-era rice mill into his personal research laboratory and powerhouse and constructed a tunnel from there to the new home, providing it with steam. He contributed substantially to the community, building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing numerous local residents.\n\n===Preserving Americana===\nFord had an interest in \"[[Americana]]\". In the 1920s, Ford began work to turn [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]], Massachusetts, into a themed historical village. He moved the schoolhouse supposedly referred to in the nursery rhyme, \"[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]\", from [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]], Massachusetts, and purchased the historic [[Wayside Inn]]. This plan never saw fruition. Ford repeated the concept of collecting historic structures with the creation of [[Greenfield Village]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], Michigan. It may have inspired the creation of [[Old Sturbridge Village]] as well.

Doubleday passed it on to New American Library, which published it in 1966. Crichton used the pen name John Lange because he planned to become a doctor and did not want his patients to worry he would use them for his plots. The name came from a fairy tale writer called [[Andrew Lang]].

Carr is sent to [[Nice, France]], where he has notable political connections, but is mistaken for an assassin and finds his life in jeopardy. Crichton wrote the book while traveling through Europe on a travel fellowship. He visited the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Monaco Grand Prix]], and then decided, \"any idiot should be able to write a [[potboiler]] set in Cannes and Monaco\", and wrote it in eleven days.

It defined basic computer jargon and assured readers that they could master the machine when it inevitably arrived. In his words, being able to program a computer is liberation; \"In my experience, you assert control over a computer\u2014show it who's the boss\u2014by making it do something unique.

He also makes predictions for computer games, dismissing them as \"the [[hula hoop]]s of the '80s\", and saying \"already there are indications that the mania for twitch games may be fading.\" In a section of the book called \"Microprocessors, or how I flunked biostatistics at Harvard\", Crichton again seeks his revenge on the teacher who had given him abnormally low grades in college.

The book was adapted into the [[Rising Sun (film)|1993 film]] directed by [[Philip Kaufman]] and starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Wesley Snipes]], released the same year as the adaption of ''Jurassic Park''.\n===''Disclosure''===\nHis next novel, ''[[Disclosure (novel)|Disclosure]]'', published in 1994, addresses the theme of sexual harassment previously explored in his 1972 ''Binary''. Unlike that novel however, Crichton centers on sexual politics in the workplace, emphasizing an array of paradoxes in traditional gender functions by featuring a male protagonist who is being sexually harassed by a female executive. As a result, the book has been criticized harshly by feminist commentators and accused of anti-feminism. Crichton, anticipating this response, offered a rebuttal at the close of the novel which states that a \"role-reversal\" story uncovers aspects of the subject that would not be seen as easily with a female protagonist. The novel was made into a [[Disclosure (film)|film]] the same year, directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Demi Moore]].\n===''ER''===\nCrichton was the creator and an executive producer of the television drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' based on his 1974 pilot script ''24 Hours''.  [[Steven Spielberg]] helped develop the show, serving as an executive producer on season one and offering advice (he insisted on [[Julianna Margulies]] becoming a regular, for example). It was also through Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment that [[John Wells (TV producer)|John Wells]] was contacted to be the show's executive producer.

The book continues Crichton's overall theme of the failure of humans in human-machine interaction, given that the plane worked perfectly and the accident would not have occurred had the pilot reacted properly.\n===''Twister''===\nHe also wrote ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' (1996) with [[Anne-Marie Martin]], his wife at the time. \n===''Timeline''===\nIn 1999, Crichton published ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'', a science fiction novel which tells the story of a team of historians and [[archaeologist]]s studying a site in the [[Dordogne]] region of France, where the medieval towns of Castelgard and La Roque stood. They [[time travel]] back to 1357 to uncover some startling truths. The novel, which continues Crichton's long history of combining technical details and action in his books, addresses [[quantum physics]] and time travel directly and received a warm welcome from medieval scholars, who praised his depiction of the challenges in studying the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>Linda Bingham, \"Crossing the Timeline: Michael Crichton's Bestseller as Social Criticism and History,\" in: ''Falling into Medievalism'', ed.

According to ''The New York Times'',\n\n{{quote|All the Crichton books depend to a certain extent on a little frisson of fear and suspense: that's what kept you turning the pages. But a deeper source of their appeal was the author's extravagant care in working out the clockwork mechanics of his experiments\u2014the DNA replication in ''Jurassic Park,'' the time travel in ''Timeline,'' the submarine technology in ''Sphere.'' The novels have embedded in them little lectures or mini-seminars on, say, the Bernoulli principle, voice-recognition software or medieval jousting etiquette&nbsp;...\n\nThe best of the Crichton novels have about them a boys' adventure quality. They owe something to the Saturday-afternoon movie serials that Mr. Crichton watched as a boy and to the adventure novels of Arthur Conan Doyle (from whom Mr. Crichton borrowed the title ''The Lost World'' and whose example showed that a novel could never have too many dinosaurs). These books thrive on yarn spinning, but they also take immense delight in the inner workings of things (as opposed to people, women especially), and they make the world\u2014or the made-up world, anyway\u2014seem boundlessly interesting.

A notable recurring theme in Crichton's plots is the [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] failure of [[complex system]]s and their safeguards, whether biological (''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]''), militaristic/organizational (''[[The Andromeda Strain]]''), technological (''[[Airframe (novel)|Airframe]]''), or [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] (''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]''). This theme of the inevitable breakdown of \"perfect\" systems and the failure of \"[[fail-safe]] measures\" strongly can be seen in the poster for ''Westworld'', whose slogan was, \"Where nothing can possibly go worng\" {{sic}}, and in the discussion of [[chaos theory]] in ''Jurassic Park''.  His 1973 movie ''Westworld'' contains one of the earlier references to a [[computer virus]] and the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a movie.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070909/synopsis: IMDB synopsis of ''Westworld''.

In ''[[A Case of Need]]'', one of his pseudonymous [[whodunit]] stories, Crichton used first-person narrative to portray the hero, a Bostonian pathologist, who is running against the clock to clear a friend's name from medical malpractice in a girl's death from a hack-job abortion.\n\nCrichton has used the literary technique known as the [[false document]]. ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' is a \"recreation\" of the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic'' [[Beowulf]]'' presented as a scholarly translation of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s 10th century manuscript. ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' and'' [[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]] ''incorporate fictionalized scientific documents in the form of diagrams, computer output, [[DNA sequence]]s, footnotes and bibliography. ''[[The Terminal Man]]'' and ''[[State of Fear]]'' include authentic published scientific works which illustrate the premise point.\n\nCrichton often employs the premise of diverse experts or specialists assembled to tackle a unique problem requiring their individual talents and knowledge. The premise was used for ''The Andromeda Strain'', ''Sphere'', ''Jurassic Park'', and to a lesser extent, ''Timeline''. Sometimes the individual characters in this dynamic work in the private sector and are suddenly called upon by the government to form an immediate response team once some incident or discovery triggers their mobilization. This premise or plot device has been imitated and used by other authors and screenwriters in several books, movies and television shows since.\n\nAt the prose level, a Crichton trademark is the single-word paragraph. A dramatic question is answered by a single word on its own.\n\n== Video games ==\n''[[Amazon (video game)|Amazon]]'' is a [[graphical adventure]] game created by Crichton and produced by John Wells. [[Trillium Corporation|Trillium]] released it in the United States in 1984, and the game runs on [[Apple II]], [[Atari]] 8-bit, Atari ST, [[Commodore 64]], and [[DOS]]. ''Amazon'' sold more than 100,000 copies, making it a significant commercial success at the time. It featured plot elements similar to those previously used in ''Congo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=48|title=Home of the Underdogs}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Crichton founded Timeline Computer Entertainment with [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)|David Smith]]. Despite signing a multi-title publishing deal with [[Eidos Interactive]], only one game was ever published, ''[[Timeline (video game)|Timeline]]''. Released on November 10, 2000, for the PC, the game received negative reviews.\n\n== Works ==\n=== Prose ===\n====Novels====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Title !!

Crichton was on the ''for the motion'' side with [[Richard Lindzen]] and [[Philip Stott]] against [[Gavin Schmidt]], [[Richard Somerville]], and Brenda Ekwurzel. Before the debate, the audience was largely on the 'against the motion' side (57% vs. 30%, with 13% undecided).<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\">{{cite web |url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/559-global-warming-is-not-a-crisis |title=Global Warming Is Not a Crisis |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=Intelligence Squared |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> At the end of the debate, there was a notable shift in the audience vote to prefer 'for the motion' side (46% vs. 42%, with 12% undecided), leaving the debate with the conclusion that Crichton's group won.<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\" /> Schmidt later described the debate in a [[RealClimate]] blog posting, \"Crichton went with the crowd-pleasing condemnation of private jet-flying liberals (very popular, even among the private jet-flying Eastsiders present) and the apparent hypocrisy of people who think that global warming is a problem using any energy at all.\" While those against the motion had presented the agreed scientific consensus of [[IPCC]] reports, the audience was \"apparently more convinced by the entertaining narratives from Crichton and Stott (not so sure about Lindzen) than they were by our drier fare. Entertainment-wise it's hard to blame them. Crichton is extremely polished and Stott has a touch of the revivalist preacher about him. Comparatively, we were pretty dull.\" Even though Crichton inspired a lot of blog responses and it was considered one of his best rhetorical performances, reception to his message was mixed.<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/03/adventures-on-the-east-side/ |title=RealClimate: Adventures on the East Side |author=Gavin Schmidt |date=March 15, 2007 |publisher=RealClimate |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the debate, although he admitted that man must have at some point contributed to [[global warming]] but not necessarily caused it, Crichton argued that most of the media and attention of the general public are being dedicated to the uncertain anthropogenic global warming scares instead of the more urgent issues like poverty. He also suggested that private jets be banned as they add more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for the benefit of the few who could afford them.{{or|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Other speeches ===\n; Mediasaurus: The Decline of Conventional Media\nIn a speech delivered at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] in Washington, D.C. on April 7, 1993, Crichton predicted the decline of mainstream media.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.04/mediasaurus_pr.html |title=Mediasaurus |author=Michael Crichton |date=April 1993 |work=Wired}}</ref>\n\n; Ritual Abuse, Hot Air, and Missed Opportunities: Science Views Media\nThe AAAS invited Crichton to address scientists' concerns about how they are portrayed in the media, delivered to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Anaheim, California on January 25, 1999.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ritual Abuse, Hot Air, and Missed Opportunities|journal=Science|volume=283|issue=5407|pages=1461\u20131463|doi=10.1126/science.283.5407.1461|year=1999|last1=Crichton|first1=M.|bibcode=1999Sci...283.1461C}}</ref>\n\n; Environmentalism as Religion\nThis was not the first discussion of environmentalism as a religion, but it caught on and was widely quoted.

He used this term to describe the phenomenon of experts believing news articles on topics outside of their fields of expertise, even after acknowledging that articles written in the same publication that are within the experts' fields of expertise are error-ridden and full of misunderstanding.

On the positive side, Crichton does emphasize the little-appreciated fact that while most of the world has been warming the past few decades, most of Antarctica has seen a cooling trend.

Doubleday passed it on to New American Library, which published it in 1966. Crichton used the pen name John Lange because he planned to become a doctor and did not want his patients to worry he would use them for his plots. The name came from a fairy tale writer called [[Andrew Lang]].

Carr is sent to [[Nice, France]], where he has notable political connections, but is mistaken for an assassin and finds his life in jeopardy. Crichton wrote the book while traveling through Europe on a travel fellowship. He visited the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Monaco Grand Prix]], and then decided, \"any idiot should be able to write a [[potboiler]] set in Cannes and Monaco\", and wrote it in eleven days. He later described the book as \"no good\".<ref name=\"israel\" />\n\nHis third John Lange novel, ''[[Easy Go]]'' (1968), is the story of Harold Barnaby, a brilliant [[Egyptologist]] who discovers a concealed message while translating [[hieroglyphics]] informing him of an unnamed pharaoh whose tomb is yet to be discovered.

''Eaters of the Dead'' is narrated as a scientific commentary on an old manuscript and was inspired by two sources. The first three chapters retell [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s personal account of his journey north and his experiences in encountering the [[Rus' people|Rus']], the early Ukrainian peoples, whilst the remainder is based upon the story of [[Beowulf]], culminating in battles with the 'mist-monsters', or 'wendol', a relict group of [[Neanderthals]].\n\n===''Coma'' and ''First Great Train Robbery''===\nCrichton wrote and directed the suspense film ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'' (1978), adapted from the 1977 novel of the same name by [[Robin Cook (novelist)|Robin Cook]], a friend of his. There are other similarities in terms of [[genre]] and the fact that both Cook and Crichton had medical degrees, were of similar age, and wrote about similar subjects. The film was a popular success.\n\nCrichton then wrote and directed an adaptation of his own book, ''[[The First Great Train Robbery]]'' (1978) starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. The film would go on to be nominated for Best Cinematography Award by the [[British Society of Cinematographers]], also garnering an [[Edgar Allan Poe Award]] for Best Motion Picture by the Mystery Writers Association of America.\n\nIn 1979 it was announced that Crichton would direct a movie version of his novel ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' for the newly formed [[Orion Pictures]].<ref>Orion: A Humanistic Production Kilday, Gregg.

His initial storyline began with American scientists discovering a 300-year-old spaceship underwater with stenciled markings in English.

The novel begins as a science fiction story, but rapidly changes into a psychological thriller, ultimately exploring the nature of the human imagination. The novel was adapted into the [[Sphere (1998 film)|1998 film]] directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and starring [[Dustin Hoffman]].\n\nIn 1987 Crichton was still hoping to make a film of ''Congo'' with Connery and Crichton himself directing, but this production did not work out.<ref>An author of pleasurable fear: Michael Crichton takes fiction where you wouldn't want to go Gorner, Peter.

The book, written like a glossary, with entries such as \"Afraid of Computers (everybody is)\", \"Buying a Computer\", and \"Computer Crime\", was intended to introduce the idea of personal computers to a reader who might be faced with the hardship of using them at work or at home for the first time. It defined basic computer jargon and assured readers that they could master the machine when it inevitably arrived. In his words, being able to program a computer is liberation; \"In my experience, you assert control over a computer\u2014show it who's the boss\u2014by making it do something unique. That means programming it. ... If you devote a couple of hours to programming a new machine, you'll feel better about it ever afterwards\".<ref>Crichton, Michael. ''[[Electronic Life]]'', Knopf, 1983, p. 44. {{ISBN|0-394-53406-9}}</ref> \n\nIn the book, Crichton predicts a number of events in the history of computer development, that computer networks would increase in importance as a matter of convenience, including the sharing of information and pictures that we see online today which the telephone never could. He also makes predictions for computer games, dismissing them as \"the [[hula hoop]]s of the '80s\", and saying \"already there are indications that the mania for twitch games may be fading.\" In a section of the book called \"Microprocessors, or how I flunked biostatistics at Harvard\", Crichton again seeks his revenge on the teacher who had given him abnormally low grades in college. Within the book, Crichton included many self-written demonstrative [[Applesoft BASIC|Applesoft]] (for [[Apple II]]) and [[Microsoft BASICA|BASICA]] (for [[IBM PC]] compatibles) programs.\n\nCrichton started a company selling a computer program he had originally written to help him create budgets for his movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelcrichton.com/programmer/|title=Programmer|publisher=michaelcrichton.com}}</ref>\n\n'''''<big>Travels</big>'''''\n\nA book of autobiographical writings, ''[[Travels (book)|Travels]]'' was published in 1988.\n\nIn 1988, Crichton was a visiting writer at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref name=\"WEBSITEBIO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelcrichton.net/aboutmichaelcrichton-biography.html|title=Biography|website=MichaelCrichton.net}}</ref>\n===''Jurassic Park''===\n[[File:Jurassic Park for kids in Kletno PL.jpg|thumb|right|Crichton's novel ''Jurassic Park'', and its sequels, were made into films that became a major part of popular culture, with related parks established in places as far afield as [[Kletno]], Poland.]]\n\nIn 1990, Crichton published the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]''. Crichton utilized the presentation of \"[[False document|fiction as fact]]\", used in his previous novels, ''Eaters of the Dead'' and ''The Andromeda Strain''. In addition, [[chaos theory]] and its philosophical implications are used to explain the collapse of an amusement park in a \"biological preserve\" on [[Isla Nublar]], a fictional island to the west of Costa Rica.

Unlike that novel however, Crichton centers on sexual politics in the workplace, emphasizing an array of paradoxes in traditional gender functions by featuring a male protagonist who is being sexually harassed by a female executive. As a result, the book has been criticized harshly by feminist commentators and accused of anti-feminism. Crichton, anticipating this response, offered a rebuttal at the close of the novel which states that a \"role-reversal\" story uncovers aspects of the subject that would not be seen as easily with a female protagonist. The novel was made into a [[Disclosure (film)|film]] the same year, directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Demi Moore]].\n===''ER''===\nCrichton was the creator and an executive producer of the television drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' based on his 1974 pilot script ''24 Hours''.

They [[time travel]] back to 1357 to uncover some startling truths. The novel, which continues Crichton's long history of combining technical details and action in his books, addresses [[quantum physics]] and time travel directly and received a warm welcome from medieval scholars, who praised his depiction of the challenges in studying the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>Linda Bingham, \"Crossing the Timeline: Michael Crichton's Bestseller as Social Criticism and History,\" in: ''Falling into Medievalism'', ed.

According to ''The New York Times'',\n\n{{quote|All the Crichton books depend to a certain extent on a little frisson of fear and suspense: that's what kept you turning the pages. But a deeper source of their appeal was the author's extravagant care in working out the clockwork mechanics of his experiments\u2014the DNA replication in ''Jurassic Park,'' the time travel in ''Timeline,'' the submarine technology in ''Sphere.'' The novels have embedded in them little lectures or mini-seminars on, say, the Bernoulli principle, voice-recognition software or medieval jousting etiquette&nbsp;...\n\nThe best of the Crichton novels have about them a boys' adventure quality. They owe something to the Saturday-afternoon movie serials that Mr. Crichton watched as a boy and to the adventure novels of Arthur Conan Doyle (from whom Mr. Crichton borrowed the title ''The Lost World'' and whose example showed that a novel could never have too many dinosaurs). These books thrive on yarn spinning, but they also take immense delight in the inner workings of things (as opposed to people, women especially), and they make the world\u2014or the made-up world, anyway\u2014seem boundlessly interesting.

A notable recurring theme in Crichton's plots is the [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] failure of [[complex system]]s and their safeguards, whether biological (''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]''), militaristic/organizational (''[[The Andromeda Strain]]''), technological (''[[Airframe (novel)|Airframe]]''), or [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] (''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]''). This theme of the inevitable breakdown of \"perfect\" systems and the failure of \"[[fail-safe]] measures\" strongly can be seen in the poster for ''Westworld'', whose slogan was, \"Where nothing can possibly go worng\" {{sic}}, and in the discussion of [[chaos theory]] in ''Jurassic Park''.  His 1973 movie ''Westworld'' contains one of the earlier references to a [[computer virus]] and the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a movie.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070909/synopsis: IMDB synopsis of ''Westworld''.

In ''[[A Case of Need]]'', one of his pseudonymous [[whodunit]] stories, Crichton used first-person narrative to portray the hero, a Bostonian pathologist, who is running against the clock to clear a friend's name from medical malpractice in a girl's death from a hack-job abortion.\n\nCrichton has used the literary technique known as the [[false document]]. ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' is a \"recreation\" of the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic'' [[Beowulf]]'' presented as a scholarly translation of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s 10th century manuscript. ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' and'' [[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]] ''incorporate fictionalized scientific documents in the form of diagrams, computer output, [[DNA sequence]]s, footnotes and bibliography. ''[[The Terminal Man]]'' and ''[[State of Fear]]'' include authentic published scientific works which illustrate the premise point.\n\nCrichton often employs the premise of diverse experts or specialists assembled to tackle a unique problem requiring their individual talents and knowledge. The premise was used for ''The Andromeda Strain'', ''Sphere'', ''Jurassic Park'', and to a lesser extent, ''Timeline''. Sometimes the individual characters in this dynamic work in the private sector and are suddenly called upon by the government to form an immediate response team once some incident or discovery triggers their mobilization. This premise or plot device has been imitated and used by other authors and screenwriters in several books, movies and television shows since.\n\nAt the prose level, a Crichton trademark is the single-word paragraph. A dramatic question is answered by a single word on its own.\n\n== Video games ==\n''[[Amazon (video game)|Amazon]]'' is a [[graphical adventure]] game created by Crichton and produced by John Wells. [[Trillium Corporation|Trillium]] released it in the United States in 1984, and the game runs on [[Apple II]], [[Atari]] 8-bit, Atari ST, [[Commodore 64]], and [[DOS]]. ''Amazon'' sold more than 100,000 copies, making it a significant commercial success at the time. It featured plot elements similar to those previously used in ''Congo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=48|title=Home of the Underdogs}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Crichton founded Timeline Computer Entertainment with [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)|David Smith]]. Despite signing a multi-title publishing deal with [[Eidos Interactive]], only one game was ever published, ''[[Timeline (video game)|Timeline]]''. Released on November 10, 2000, for the PC, the game received negative reviews.\n\n== Works ==\n=== Prose ===\n====Novels====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Title !!

Crichton was on the ''for the motion'' side with [[Richard Lindzen]] and [[Philip Stott]] against [[Gavin Schmidt]], [[Richard Somerville]], and Brenda Ekwurzel. Before the debate, the audience was largely on the 'against the motion' side (57% vs. 30%, with 13% undecided).<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\">{{cite web |url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/559-global-warming-is-not-a-crisis |title=Global Warming Is Not a Crisis |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=Intelligence Squared |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> At the end of the debate, there was a notable shift in the audience vote to prefer 'for the motion' side (46% vs. 42%, with 12% undecided), leaving the debate with the conclusion that Crichton's group won.<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\" /> Schmidt later described the debate in a [[RealClimate]] blog posting, \"Crichton went with the crowd-pleasing condemnation of private jet-flying liberals (very popular, even among the private jet-flying Eastsiders present) and the apparent hypocrisy of people who think that global warming is a problem using any energy at all.\" While those against the motion had presented the agreed scientific consensus of [[IPCC]] reports, the audience was \"apparently more convinced by the entertaining narratives from Crichton and Stott (not so sure about Lindzen) than they were by our drier fare. Entertainment-wise it's hard to blame them. Crichton is extremely polished and Stott has a touch of the revivalist preacher about him. Comparatively, we were pretty dull.\" Even though Crichton inspired a lot of blog responses and it was considered one of his best rhetorical performances, reception to his message was mixed.<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/03/adventures-on-the-east-side/ |title=RealClimate: Adventures on the East Side |author=Gavin Schmidt |date=March 15, 2007 |publisher=RealClimate |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the debate, although he admitted that man must have at some point contributed to [[global warming]] but not necessarily caused it, Crichton argued that most of the media and attention of the general public are being dedicated to the uncertain anthropogenic global warming scares instead of the more urgent issues like poverty. He also suggested that private jets be banned as they add more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for the benefit of the few who could afford them.{{or|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Other speeches ===\n; Mediasaurus: The Decline of Conventional Media\nIn a speech delivered at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] in Washington, D.C. on April 7, 1993, Crichton predicted the decline of mainstream media.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.04/mediasaurus_pr.html |title=Mediasaurus |author=Michael Crichton |date=April 1993 |work=Wired}}</ref>\n\n; Ritual Abuse, Hot Air, and Missed Opportunities: Science Views Media\nThe AAAS invited Crichton to address scientists' concerns about how they are portrayed in the media, delivered to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Anaheim, California on January 25, 1999.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ritual Abuse, Hot Air, and Missed Opportunities|journal=Science|volume=283|issue=5407|pages=1461\u20131463|doi=10.1126/science.283.5407.1461|year=1999|last1=Crichton|first1=M.|bibcode=1999Sci...283.1461C}}</ref>\n\n; Environmentalism as Religion\nThis was not the first discussion of environmentalism as a religion, but it caught on and was widely quoted.

He used this term to describe the phenomenon of experts believing news articles on topics outside of their fields of expertise, even after acknowledging that articles written in the same publication that are within the experts' fields of expertise are error-ridden and full of misunderstanding.
