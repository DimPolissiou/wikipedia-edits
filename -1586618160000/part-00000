MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

MacArthur does not reject all forms of psychological theories and techniques, though he considers some psychology and [[psychiatry]] as contrary to the Bible.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ganz and MacArthur|title=PsychoBabble: The Failure of Modern Psychology--and the Biblical Alternative|publisher=Crossway|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nHe has argued that \"True psychology (i.e. \"the study of the soul\") can be done only by Christians, since only Christians have the resources for understanding and transforming the soul. The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought. Modern psychology and the Bible cannot be blended without serious compromise to or utter abandonment of the principle of Scripture's sufficiency.\"<ref>{{Citation|author=John F MacArthur|title=THE PSYCHOLOGY EPIDEMIC AND ITS CURE|journal=The Master's Seminary Journal|volume=2:1|year=1991|pages=3\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHis stance has caused several controversies, the most notable of which was the first time an employee of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical church]] had ever been sued for malpractice.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

They finished their first ever season in the [[Regional League Northern Division]] in 7th place out of 11 teams. In 2014, after 6 years in the third tier division, Sukhothai got the promotion to [[2015 Thai Division 1 League]].\n\nIn 2015, the newly promotion team Sukhothai had a successful campaign in [[Thai Division 1 League]] with the finishing in the unexpected third place of the final standing. Sukhothai has promoted to [[2016 Thai League]].\n\nIn 2019, Sukhothai academy's top prospect, Jasraj Sangha, was offered a contract with the first team, but declined the offer, later stating that it was a \"late notice\".\n\n===Top League===\nIn 2016, the first year in the top league, Sukhothai created the overachieved run by finishing in the seventh place of the table. Sukhothai also qualified for [[2017 AFC Champions League]] after being one of co-winner of [[2016 Thai FA Cup|FA Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://massradio9950.com/main/%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%A2-%E0%B8%AA%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9F/|title=\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22 \u0e2a\u0e42\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e42\u0e02\u0e17\u0e31\u0e22\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e1f\u0e0b\u0e35 \u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e1a\u0e19\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e49\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e309\u0e27\u0e31\u0e149\u0e2d\u0e33\u0e40\u0e20\u0e2d\u0e09\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e41\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e1b\u0e4c\u0e1f\u0e38\u0e15\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e25\u0e16\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07 FA CUP 2016|work=}}</ref>\n\n==Main rivalry==\nSukhothai's main neighboring rivals are with [[Phitsanulok F.C.|Phitsanulok]] and [[Kamphaengphet F.C.|Kamphaengphet]].\n\n==Stadium and locations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
