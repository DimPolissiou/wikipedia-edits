Each circuit comprises several congregations in a geographical area. These are held either in Assembly Halls owned by Jehovah's Witnesses, or in rented facilities, such as public auditoriums. Once a year, Jehovah's Witnesses gather at larger assemblies called \"Regional Conventions\" which are usually three days long (Friday to Sunday). These conventions consist primarily of Bible-based sermons, including demonstrations and experiences of their preaching work. They also often feature video presentations and live, full-costume dramatic plays re-enacting biblical accounts\u2014such as [[Moses]] and the [[Plagues of Egypt]], and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]\u2014or contemporary settings based on biblical principles. Every few years, \"International Conventions\" are held in selected cities, with visiting delegates from other countries.

Between 1924 and 1957, the organization operated a radio station, WBBR, from New York. Since 2011, the Witnesses have engaged in \"public witnessing\" in metropolitan districts and fairs using tables, carts, and literature displays.

Their primary journal, ''The Watchtower'' <!---and ''Awake!'', are--->is published simultaneously in nearly two hundred languages and, along with ''Awake!'', available in audio and electronic formats.

He said they typically spoke of their conversion experience as a steady progression of mental states in which Witnesses \"'work for' their conversion by a methodical confrontation with intellectual obstacles and by a deliberate programme of self-reform. Conversion is not represented as something which ''happened'' to them; it is framed as something that they ''achieved''.\" Beckford noted that those he interviewed regarded sudden, emotional upheavals in religious consciousness as suspect: \"Experiences which smack of sudden or idiosyncratic illumination/revelation cannot be reconcilable with either the tenor of God's historical practice or the nature of his special covenant with the Watchtower Society.\"\n\nHe also found a striking contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to \"a spiritual guide ... the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming\". Beckford cited an interview \"representative of many\" in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society's teachings until he was \"talked into making a serious study of the scriptures ... I had plenty of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) showed me how the facts of the Bible could not be faulted\".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Beckford | first = James A. |  title = Accounting for Conversion | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 29 | issue = June 1978 | pages =251\u2013256 | publisher = London School of Economics and Political Science | location = London | date = June 1978 |  jstor =589892 }}</ref>\n\n==Ministers and ordination==\nJehovah's Witnesses consider as \"[[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]]\" all adherents who have been approved to engage in formal evangelizing.

He said they typically spoke of their conversion experience as a steady progression of mental states in which Witnesses \"'work for' their conversion by a methodical confrontation with intellectual obstacles and by a deliberate programme of self-reform. Conversion is not represented as something which ''happened'' to them; it is framed as something that they ''achieved''.\" Beckford noted that those he interviewed regarded sudden, emotional upheavals in religious consciousness as suspect: \"Experiences which smack of sudden or idiosyncratic illumination/revelation cannot be reconcilable with either the tenor of God's historical practice or the nature of his special covenant with the Watchtower Society.\"\n\nHe also found a striking contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to \"a spiritual guide ... the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming\". Beckford cited an interview \"representative of many\" in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society's teachings until he was \"talked into making a serious study of the scriptures ... I had plenty of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) showed me how the facts of the Bible could not be faulted\".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Beckford | first = James A. |  title = Accounting for Conversion | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 29 | issue = June 1978 | pages =251\u2013256 | publisher = London School of Economics and Political Science | location = London | date = June 1978 |  jstor =589892 }}</ref>\n\n==Ministers and ordination==\nJehovah's Witnesses consider as \"[[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]]\" all adherents who have been approved to engage in formal evangelizing.

If the sin is known generally by the entire congregation or the community, an announcement is made informing the congregation that the person has been reproved.

He should not hurt or mistreat his family in any way. The father should be hard-working in providing necessities to his family. He must also provide for them in a spiritual capacity. This includes religious instruction for the family, and taking the lead in preaching activities. Parental discipline for children should not be in a harsh, cruel way. Children are instructed to obey their parents.\n\nMarried couples are encouraged to speak with local elders if they are having problems.

During the Civil War, in 1862, the tower was damaged and the lens, etc., removed, but by 1863 the lighthouse had been refitted and the light reexhibited. A third-order lens was placed in use temporarily until the first-order lens, \"injured by the rebels\" could be repaired and restored in 1867.\n* The lighthouse is now a black and white diagonally checkered tower, 169 feet above ground and 156 feet above water and shows a group flashing white electric light every 15 seconds of 80,000 candela, visible 19 miles, from a first-order lens.\n|salign    = right\n|source    = United States Coast Guard<ref name=\"Historic\"/>\n}}\n|}\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Core Banks - Aug 2017 - 08.jpg\n|height  = 230\n|caption = Panorama of the view from the top of the lighthouse \n}}\n\n==References==\n[[Image:USCGCape Lookout.jpg|thumb|U.S. Coast Guard Archive]]\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Cape Lookout Lighthouse}}\n* [http://www.nps.gov/calo/ Cape Lookout National Seashore]\n* [http://www.carolinalights.com/north-carolina-lighthouses/cape-lookout-lighthouse Cape Lookout on CarolinaLights.com]\n* [https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo41602 Cape Lookout: Cape Lookout Lighthouse: Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina] [[National Park Service]]\n\n{{Lighthouses of North Carolina}}\n{{Outer Banks}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina}}\n\n[[Category:Lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Lighthouses completed in 1857]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Carteret County, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Outer Banks]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Carteret County, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Reportedly haunted locations in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Carteret County, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:1857 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "2606:a000:1206:43f4:c40d:1b89:c5d:7c5c", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I changed the spelling of some words so they can be clear.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Lookout_Lighthouse"}

It resulted in the defeat of the Sui and was one of the pivotal factors in the collapse of the dynasty, which led to its overthrow by the [[Tang dynasty]] in AD 618.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Sui dynasty]] united [[China]] in AD 589, defeating the [[Chen dynasty]] and ending the division of the country that spanned almost 300 years. After the unification of China, Sui asserted its position as an overlord of neighbouring countries. However, in [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], [[Pyeongwon of Goguryeo|Pyeongwon]] and his successor [[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] insisted on maintaining an equal relationship with the Sui dynasty.\n\n[[Emperor Wen of Sui|Wendi]] of Sui was displeased with the challenge from Goguryeo, which continued small scale raiding into Sui's northern border. Wendi sent diplomatic papers in 596 after Sui envoys spotted Goguryeo diplomats in the [[yurt]] of the Eastern Turk [[Khanate]], demanding Goguryeo cancel any military alliance with the Turks, stop the annual raiding of Sui border regions, and acknowledge Sui as their overlord. After receiving this message, [[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] launched a joint preemptive [[Battle of Linyuguan|invasion]] with the [[Malgal]] against the Chinese along the border in present-day [[Hebei]] province; It was the following year, 597.\n\n==Course of the war==\n\n===First Invasion of 598===\n[[File:598 Goguryeo-Sui war.png|thumb|350px|1st Goguryeo-Sui War, 598]]\nWendi ordered his fifth and youngest son, [[Yang Liang]] (assisted by the co-prime minister [[Gao Jiong]]), and Admiral Zhou Luohou (\u5468\u7f85\u777a), to invade and conquer Goguryeo with an army and navy totaling 300,000, mostly composed of horse archers.\n\nYang Liang's army faced the early rainy season when it reached Goguryeo. The unseasonably heavy rain made the army's progress almost impossible and hampered the transport of provisions. Constant attacks by Goguryeo forces and illness inflicted heavy casualties. Coming to the conclusion that the army could not achieve the objective on its own, Yang decided to combine with Zhou's naval fleet and proceed.\n\nZhou's navy also came across their own challenges, contending with rough seas, losing many ships despite staying close to the coastline. Whenever they anchored, Goguryeo detachments were present to attack the Sui sailors, and Sui fleet suffered a devastating loss.\n\n===Second Invasion of 612===\n[[File:612 Sui-Goguryeo war.png|thumb|350px|2nd Goguryeo-Sui War, 612]]\n====Preparations====\n[[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Yangdi]], when he won the throne in 604, built the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] connecting the north and south of China. The south, economic base of China, and the north, political base of China, were connected by the canal, allowing transportation of troops for the massive military campaign.<ref>{{cite web |title=China's Grand Canal |author=John M. Jackson |url=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jojacks2/words/grandcanal.htm |accessdate=2004-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040412021950/http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jojacks2/words/grandcanal.htm |archivedate=2004-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the construction of the canal, Yangdi ordered the enlisting of soldiers in 611. He instructed them to gather in present-day [[Beijing]]. The force gathered by year's end was one of the greatest in civilization according to the ''[[Book of Sui]]'', which states that 1,133,000 troops were mobilized and that the support troops multiple times that number. The army began to depart in early 612, and due to its size, it took 40 days for all of them to depart. The long line of soldiers stretched for about 300 kilometers. The strength and losses may have been deflated by later Chinese historians.\n\n====Campaign in Manchuria====\n[[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] gave up the buffer zone that he had acquired after the war of 598, as the area was not suitable to face such a vast army. The Goguryeo troops retreated behind what is now known as the [[Liao River]]. A fortunate event for Goguryeo was that the river melted much sooner than usual. By the time [[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Yangdi]] arrived, the ice had all melted. Undaunted, Yangdi ordered the construction of three bridges across the river. The bridges however, were too short to reach the opposite bank in another fortunate turn of events for the defenders, and Goguryeo's attack successfully held off the first assault. After the extension of the bridges however, the Sui forces succeeded in crossing the river, and the army surrounded the fortresses of Goguryeo.\n\nYangdi ordered his generals before the campaigns not to make individual decisions regarding the movement of troops, but to report to him to receive instruction. This order hampered Sui strategy throughout the campaign. During the strategically important campaign against [[Yodong fortress]], the general commanding the siege had to send a messenger to the emperor for the approval of the surrender. By the time the messenger returned, Goguryeo's troops were again ready to defend the fortress. Exploiting this flaw in the Sui system, Yodong and other castles of Goguryeo continued to hold on. By June, five months after the start of the campaign, not a single castle, fortress, or citadel has fallen to Sui. Yangdi felt that a fundamental change in strategy was needed to seize control of Korea.\n\n====Campaign against Pyongyang====\nThe new strategy was to keep the fortresses of Goguryeo in [[Manchuria]] at bay, while sending a contingent of army and navy to take [[Pyongyang]], Goguryeo's capital. An army contingent, allegedly with a strength of 305,000, and a naval fleet of some 120,000 were dispatched.\n\n====Naval assault====\nThe Sui navy reached the bay of the [[Daedong River]] before the army. Seeing that the Sui army had not arrived yet, Go Geonmu, commander of the defence army of Goguryeo at Pyeongyang and brother of King Yeongyang, sent what few troops remained in the capital to engage the Sui navy in battle. After an engagement, feigning defeat, Goguryeo troops retreated into the city. The Sui naval commander, [[Lai Huni]], considering this was a chance to add to his merit, led a host of more than 40,000 to lay assault against Pyeongyang.\n\nWhen the Sui soldiers reached one of the outer castles, however, they found the wall empty and the gate open. Upon entering the castle, Lai, considering the engagement in the outskirts a decisive move of Goguryeo that failed, looted and destroyed the art and fortune of the outer castle.\n\nOnce the looting of the castle started, the death-defying corps of Goguryeo, consisting of 500 troops, ambushed the Sui troops. Confused and disoriented, Lai ran to the fleet at the sea, his legion reduced to mere thousands. Disheartened by his failure.\n\n====Sui army's campaign====\nThe army contingent, led by generals [[Yu Zhongwen]] and [[Yuwen Shu]], had their own problems. While the supply could be transported safely within China, once it reached Goguryeo territory, there was a danger of ambush by Goguryeo forces. Yangdi solved the problem by instructing each soldiers to carry food for himself, which greatly increased each soldier's burden. Many resorted to discarding the food. By the time it had reached the [[Yalu River]], the army's shortage of provisions was acute.\n\nYeongyang decided to assess the strength of the Sui army by ordering his Commander Field Marshal [[Eulji Mundeok]] to fake a surrender and peace negotiation terms with the Sui generals. Generals Wu and Yuwen had their own secret order from Yangdi to seize Yeongyang or Eulji Mundeok if they should fall into their hands. However, the generals' advisers, notably the Assistant Director of the Right of the Department of State Affairs, [[Liu Shilong]] (\u5289\u58eb\u9f8d), convinced them it would be unwise to arrest negotiators from the opposing camp. They ultimately let Eulji return to Goguryeo and Yu Zhongwen later regretted his decision, attempting to lure Eulji Mundeok back. He sent a message that he wished to discuss things further but Eulji Mundeok, aware of Wu's intentions, did not comply.\n\nThe two generals argued about the next course of action, with Yu Zhongwen arguing strongly that Eulji Mundeok should be pursued. They did agree that the Goguryeo capital should be captured. Accordingly, the Sui troops began advancing south towards [[Pyeongyang]]. Eulji Mundeok maneuvered the Goguryeo troops so that they engaged the Sui army seven times a day, each time faking defeat and retreat. The strategy would draw the Sui army deeper south with the perception of victory. The Sui army eventually advanced to about 20&nbsp;km from Pyeongyang. Yu Zhongwen later recognized that his advancing troops were suffering from exhaustion, and that fortifications of Pyeongyang made for an impossible campaign.\n\nYu was caught in a dilemma and could not decide on advance or retreat. Eulji Mundeok sent him for the occasion a poem:\n<blockquote> Your divine plans have plumbed the heavens; Your subtle reckoning has spanned the earth. You win every battle, your military merit is great. Why then not be content and stop the war?<ref name=cummings>{{cite book |title=Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History |url=https://archive.org/details/koreasplaceinsun00bruc |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-393-04011-1 |date=March 1997 |publisher=W W Norton & Co Inc |edition=1st  |first=Bruce |last=Cumings}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=yKN_q-TqYYgC&printsec=frontcover updated 2005 version with Google preview]).</ref></blockquote> When no response came, Eulji sent a representative. The plan now was to offer Emperor Yeongyang to Yangdi escort to submission if the Sui army would withdraw. Seizing this opportunity to retreat, Yu withdrew his troops towards Sui.\n\n====Battle of Salsu River====\n{{Main article|Battle of Salsu}}\n\nWhen Sui army had reached [[Battle of Salsu|Salsu]] (thought to be present-day [[Chongchon River]]), Goguryeo charged the remaining Sui army. Eulji Mundeok defended fortresses against the Sui army and navy for several months and destroyed the Sui troops while retreating into Goguryeo territory. An attack at Salsu (Chongchon River) inflicted massive casualties on the Sui forces. When the Sui army had reached Salsu, Eulji Mundeok's force slaughtering them. The historical text records that Sui soldiers had to run almost 200 kilometers that day to escape death. The Battle of Salsu contributed to the massive overall casualty figure for Sui during the campaign. Emperor Yang crossed the Liao River to attack Goguryeo, initially, with 305,000 men. Only 2,800 returned.<ref name=ZZTJ181>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[s:zh:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377181|vol. 181]].</ref><ref name=SGSG20>''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', vol. 20 {{cite web |url=http://147.46.181.118/IMAGE/SNUG0020.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182732/http://147.46.181.118/IMAGE/SNUG0020.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}.</ref>\n\n===Third Invasion of 613===\nYangdi invaded Liaodong again the following year (613), but was again obliged to retreat without success. While Yangdi was away, [[Yang Xuangan]], the son of Yangdi's prime minister [[Yang Su]], fomented rebellion against Yangdi. Fearing attack from two fronts, Yangdi was forced to retreat and use his army to put down Yang Xuangan's rebellion.\n\n===Fourth Invasion of 614===\nAfter crushing the revolt, Yangdi invaded [[Goguryeo]] again in 614. Though he managed to breach Goguryeo's first line of defence without capturing the frontier fortress, he could not advance far beyond Liao River due to Goguryeo's constant attacks and obstruction to his supply lines. Yeongyang, seeing a chance to end these exhausting wars, offered peace and returned Yang Xuangan's associate Husi Zheng (\u659b\u65af\u653f), who had fled to Goguryeo after Yang Xuangan's rebellion, to Sui. Perceiving the little success in Goguryeo and the increasing internal discontent in China, Yangdi accepted Yeongyang's offer of peace and withdrew Sui troops from Goguryeo's territory. However, the king of Goguryeo never showed up to swear allegiance, infuriating Emperor Yang, who had to be dissuaded with difficulty from launching another invasion against Goguryeo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whiting|first1=Marvin C.|title=Imperial Chinese Military History: 8000 BC-1912 AD|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595221349|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJQiAz3qTCgC&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=9 November 2016|language=en|quote=The King of Koguryo offered to submit and the Chinese army straggled home thinking they had won.

Peasants, farmers, soldiers, aristocrats, and landlords rose up against the emperor along with many of the dynasty's military officers. Yangdi moved the capital to the south in [[Yangzhou]], but the revolts were too widespread. [[Yuwen Shu|Yuwen Shu's]] son, [[Yuwen Huaji]], became a powerful Sui general who led a successful coup against Yangdi and personally murdered him. This would complete the [[transition from Sui to Tang]], as the Duke of Tang was able to proclaim himself emperor of [[Tang Dynasty|a new dynasty]].\n\n==Notes and references==\n* Asmolov, Konstantin V. \"The System of Military Activity of Kogury\u00f4.\" ''Korea Journal'' 32:2 (Summer 1992): 103-116.\n* Gabriel, Richard A. and Boose, Donald W. \"The Korean Way of War: Salsu River.\" In Richard A.

Whenever they anchored, Goguryeo detachments were present to attack the Sui sailors, and Sui fleet suffered a devastating loss.\n\n===Second Invasion of 612===\n[[File:612 Sui-Goguryeo war.png|thumb|350px|2nd Goguryeo-Sui War, 612]]\n====Preparations====\n[[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Yangdi]], when he won the throne in 604, built the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] connecting the north and south of China. The south, economic base of China, and the north, political base of China, were connected by the canal, allowing transportation of troops for the massive military campaign.<ref>{{cite web |title=China's Grand Canal |author=John M. Jackson |url=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jojacks2/words/grandcanal.htm |accessdate=2004-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040412021950/http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jojacks2/words/grandcanal.htm |archivedate=2004-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the construction of the canal, Yangdi ordered the enlisting of soldiers in 611. He instructed them to gather in present-day [[Beijing]]. The force gathered by year's end was one of the greatest in civilization according to the ''[[Book of Sui]]'', which states that 1,133,000 troops were mobilized and that the support troops multiple times that number. The army began to depart in early 612, and due to its size, it took 40 days for all of them to depart. The long line of soldiers stretched for about 300 kilometers. The strength and losses may have been deflated by later Chinese historians.\n\n====Campaign in Manchuria====\n[[Yeongyang of Goguryeo|Yeongyang]] gave up the buffer zone that he had acquired after the war of 598, as the area was not suitable to face such a vast army. The Goguryeo troops retreated behind what is now known as the [[Liao River]]. A fortunate event for Goguryeo was that the river melted much sooner than usual. By the time [[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Yangdi]] arrived, the ice had all melted. Undaunted, Yangdi ordered the construction of three bridges across the river. The bridges however, were too short to reach the opposite bank in another fortunate turn of events for the defenders, and Goguryeo's attack successfully held off the first assault. After the extension of the bridges however, the Sui forces succeeded in crossing the river, and the army surrounded the fortresses of Goguryeo.\n\nYangdi ordered his generals before the campaigns not to make individual decisions regarding the movement of troops, but to report to him to receive instruction. This order hampered Sui strategy throughout the campaign. During the strategically important campaign against [[Yodong fortress]], the general commanding the siege had to send a messenger to the emperor for the approval of the surrender. By the time the messenger returned, Goguryeo's troops were again ready to defend the fortress. Exploiting this flaw in the Sui system, Yodong and other castles of Goguryeo continued to hold on. By June, five months after the start of the campaign, not a single castle, fortress, or citadel has fallen to Sui. Yangdi felt that a fundamental change in strategy was needed to seize control of Korea.\n\n====Campaign against Pyongyang====\nThe new strategy was to keep the fortresses of Goguryeo in [[Manchuria]] at bay, while sending a contingent of army and navy to take [[Pyongyang]], Goguryeo's capital. An army contingent, allegedly with a strength of 305,000, and a naval fleet of some 120,000 were dispatched.\n\n====Naval assault====\nThe Sui navy reached the bay of the [[Daedong River]] before the army. Seeing that the Sui army had not arrived yet, Go Geonmu, commander of the defence army of Goguryeo at Pyeongyang and brother of King Yeongyang, sent what few troops remained in the capital to engage the Sui navy in battle. After an engagement, feigning defeat, Goguryeo troops retreated into the city. The Sui naval commander, [[Lai Huni]], considering this was a chance to add to his merit, led a host of more than 40,000 to lay assault against Pyeongyang.\n\nWhen the Sui soldiers reached one of the outer castles, however, they found the wall empty and the gate open. Upon entering the castle, Lai, considering the engagement in the outskirts a decisive move of Goguryeo that failed, looted and destroyed the art and fortune of the outer castle.\n\nOnce the looting of the castle started, the death-defying corps of Goguryeo, consisting of 500 troops, ambushed the Sui troops. Confused and disoriented, Lai ran to the fleet at the sea, his legion reduced to mere thousands. Disheartened by his failure.\n\n====Sui army's campaign====\nThe army contingent, led by generals [[Yu Zhongwen]] and [[Yuwen Shu]], had their own problems. While the supply could be transported safely within China, once it reached Goguryeo territory, there was a danger of ambush by Goguryeo forces. Yangdi solved the problem by instructing each soldiers to carry food for himself, which greatly increased each soldier's burden. Many resorted to discarding the food. By the time it had reached the [[Yalu River]], the army's shortage of provisions was acute.\n\nYeongyang decided to assess the strength of the Sui army by ordering his Commander Field Marshal [[Eulji Mundeok]] to fake a surrender and peace negotiation terms with the Sui generals. Generals Wu and Yuwen had their own secret order from Yangdi to seize Yeongyang or Eulji Mundeok if they should fall into their hands. However, the generals' advisers, notably the Assistant Director of the Right of the Department of State Affairs, [[Liu Shilong]] (\u5289\u58eb\u9f8d), convinced them it would be unwise to arrest negotiators from the opposing camp. They ultimately let Eulji return to Goguryeo and Yu Zhongwen later regretted his decision, attempting to lure Eulji Mundeok back. He sent a message that he wished to discuss things further but Eulji Mundeok, aware of Wu's intentions, did not comply.\n\nThe two generals argued about the next course of action, with Yu Zhongwen arguing strongly that Eulji Mundeok should be pursued. They did agree that the Goguryeo capital should be captured. Accordingly, the Sui troops began advancing south towards [[Pyeongyang]]. Eulji Mundeok maneuvered the Goguryeo troops so that they engaged the Sui army seven times a day, each time faking defeat and retreat. The strategy would draw the Sui army deeper south with the perception of victory. The Sui army eventually advanced to about 20&nbsp;km from Pyeongyang. Yu Zhongwen later recognized that his advancing troops were suffering from exhaustion, and that fortifications of Pyeongyang made for an impossible campaign.\n\nYu was caught in a dilemma and could not decide on advance or retreat. Eulji Mundeok sent him for the occasion a poem:\n<blockquote> Your divine plans have plumbed the heavens; Your subtle reckoning has spanned the earth. You win every battle, your military merit is great. Why then not be content and stop the war?<ref name=cummings>{{cite book |title=Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History |url=https://archive.org/details/koreasplaceinsun00bruc |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-393-04011-1 |date=March 1997 |publisher=W W Norton & Co Inc |edition=1st  |first=Bruce |last=Cumings}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=yKN_q-TqYYgC&printsec=frontcover updated 2005 version with Google preview]).</ref></blockquote> When no response came, Eulji sent a representative. The plan now was to offer Emperor Yeongyang to Yangdi escort to submission if the Sui army would withdraw. Seizing this opportunity to retreat, Yu withdrew his troops towards Sui.\n\n====Battle of Salsu River====\n{{Main article|Battle of Salsu}}\n\nWhen Sui army had reached [[Battle of Salsu|Salsu]] (thought to be present-day [[Chongchon River]]), Goguryeo charged the remaining Sui army. Eulji Mundeok defended fortresses against the Sui army and navy for several months and destroyed the Sui troops while retreating into Goguryeo territory. An attack at Salsu (Chongchon River) inflicted massive casualties on the Sui forces. When the Sui army had reached Salsu, Eulji Mundeok's force slaughtering them. The historical text records that Sui soldiers had to run almost 200 kilometers that day to escape death. The Battle of Salsu contributed to the massive overall casualty figure for Sui during the campaign. Emperor Yang crossed the Liao River to attack Goguryeo, initially, with 305,000 men. Only 2,800 returned.<ref name=ZZTJ181>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[s:zh:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377181|vol. 181]].</ref><ref name=SGSG20>''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', vol. 20 {{cite web |url=http://147.46.181.118/IMAGE/SNUG0020.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182732/http://147.46.181.118/IMAGE/SNUG0020.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}.</ref>\n\n===Third Invasion of 613===\nYangdi invaded Liaodong again the following year (613), but was again obliged to retreat without success. While Yangdi was away, [[Yang Xuangan]], the son of Yangdi's prime minister [[Yang Su]], fomented rebellion against Yangdi. Fearing attack from two fronts, Yangdi was forced to retreat and use his army to put down Yang Xuangan's rebellion.\n\n===Fourth Invasion of 614===\nAfter crushing the revolt, Yangdi invaded [[Goguryeo]] again in 614. Though he managed to breach Goguryeo's first line of defence without capturing the frontier fortress, he could not advance far beyond Liao River due to Goguryeo's constant attacks and obstruction to his supply lines. Yeongyang, seeing a chance to end these exhausting wars, offered peace and returned Yang Xuangan's associate Husi Zheng (\u659b\u65af\u653f), who had fled to Goguryeo after Yang Xuangan's rebellion, to Sui. Perceiving the little success in Goguryeo and the increasing internal discontent in China, Yangdi accepted Yeongyang's offer of peace and withdrew Sui troops from Goguryeo's territory. However, the king of Goguryeo never showed up to swear allegiance, infuriating Emperor Yang, who had to be dissuaded with difficulty from launching another invasion against Goguryeo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whiting|first1=Marvin C.|title=Imperial Chinese Military History: 8000 BC-1912 AD|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595221349|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJQiAz3qTCgC&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=9 November 2016|language=en|quote=The King of Koguryo offered to submit and the Chinese army straggled home thinking they had won.

Peasants, farmers, soldiers, aristocrats, and landlords rose up against the emperor along with many of the dynasty's military officers. Yangdi moved the capital to the south in [[Yangzhou]], but the revolts were too widespread. [[Yuwen Shu|Yuwen Shu's]] son, [[Yuwen Huaji]], became a powerful Sui general who led a successful coup against Yangdi and personally murdered him. This would complete the [[transition from Sui to Tang]], as the Duke of Tang was able to proclaim himself emperor of [[Tang Dynasty|a new dynasty]].\n\n==Notes and references==\n* Asmolov, Konstantin V. \"The System of Military Activity of Kogury\u00f4.\" ''Korea Journal'' 32:2 (Summer 1992): 103-116.\n* Gabriel, Richard A. and Boose, Donald W. \"The Korean Way of War: Salsu River.\" In Richard A.

This process is known as '''self-maintenance'''.\n\n==Theories and hypotheses==\n\n=== The beginning ===\n[[August Weismann]] was responsible for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of [[Darwinian]] evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program to make room for the next generation in order to sustain the turnover that is necessary for evolution.<ref>{{cite book|author=Weismann A.|title=Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|year=1889}} Work that describes Weismann's theory about making room for the young.</ref>  The idea that the ageing characteristic was selected (an adaptation) because of its deleterious effect was largely discounted for much of the 20th century, but a theoretical model suggests that altruistic ageing could evolve if there is little migration among populations.<ref name=\"Yang_altruistic_aging\">{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jiang-Nan | name-list-format = vanc |year=2013|title=Viscous populations evolve altruistic programmed ageing in ability conflict in a changing environment |url=http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v15/2825.html |journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research |volume=15 |pages=527\u2013543 }}</ref> Weismann later abandoned his theory and later followed up with his \"programmed death\" theory.\n\n===Mutation accumulation===\nThe first modern theory of [[mammal]] ageing was formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952. This theory formed in the previous decade with [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and his [[selection shadow]] concept. The development of human civilization has shifted the selective shadow as the conditions that humans now live in include improved quality of victuals, living conditions, and healthcare. This improved healthcare includes modern medicine such as antibiotics and new medical technology.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\">{{Cite journal|last=Flatt|first=Thomas|last2=Partridge|first2=Linda|date=2018-08-20|title=Horizons in the evolution of aging|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|journal=BMC Biology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=93|doi=10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|issn=1741-7007|pmc=6100731|pmid=30124168}}</ref> Their idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect, as nature is a highly competitive place. Almost all animals die in the wild from predators, disease, or accidents, which lowers the average age of death. Therefore, there is not much reason why the body should remain fit for the long haul because [[selection pressure]] is low for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would have died anyway. Evolution has not had an opportunity to select against deadly diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Metabolic diseases come along due to the low demand for physical activity in modern civilization compared to times where humans had to forage in the wild for survival.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\"/> With the selective shadow now shifted, humans must deal with these new selective pressures.\n\nMedawar's theory is referred to as ''Mutation Accumulation.'' This theory is based on the idea that random, germline mutations occur that are detrimental to overall health and survival later in life. Overall, senescence would occur through a summation of deleterious mutations, and would explain the overall phenotypic damage we associate with ageing.\n\n===Antagonistic pleiotropy===\n{{main|Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis}}\nMedawar's theory was critiqued and later further developed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in 1957. Williams noted that senescence may be causing many deaths even if animals are not 'dying of old age.'<ref name=\"williams\" /> He began his hypothesis with the idea that ageing can cause earlier senescence due to the competitive nature of life. Even a small amount of ageing can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care and ageing is not cost-free.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter AJ, Nguyen AQ | title = Antagonistic pleiotropy as a widespread mechanism for the maintenance of polymorphic disease alleles | journal = BMC Medical Genetics | volume = 12 | pages = 160 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22151998 | pmc = 3254080 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2350-12-160 }}</ref>\n\nWilliams eventually proposed his own hypothesis called antagonistic ''[[pleiotropy]]''. Pleiotropy, alone, means one mutation that cause multiple effects on [[phenotype]].<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/03374-X |chapter=Senescence: Genetic Theories |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences |pages=13897\u2013902 |year=2001 |last1=Curtsinger |first1=J.W. |isbn=978-0-08-043076-8 }}</ref> Antagonistic pleiotropy on the other hand deals with one gene that creates two traits with one being beneficial and the other being detrimental. In essence, this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but accumulate a cost later on.<ref name=\"williams\" />\n\nAlthough antagonistic pleiotropy is a prevailing theory today, this is largely by default, and has not been well verified. Research has shown that this is not true for all genes and may be thought of as partial validation of the theory, but it cuts the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.\n\nIn breeding experiments, [[Michael R. Rose]] selected [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this would surely reduce their [[fertility]]. His team found that they were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artifact.<ref name=\"pmid28564485\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leroi AM, Chippindale AK, Rose MR | title = Long-term laboratory evolution of a genetic life-history tradeoff in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. 1.

The body uses resources derived from the environment for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance, and the body must compromise when there is a finite supply of resources. The theory states that this compromise causes the body to reallocate energy to the repair function that causes the body to gradually deteriorate with age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirkwood TB | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = 5635 | pages = 301\u20134 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 593350 | doi = 10.1038/270301a0 | bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }} Origin of the disposable soma theory.</ref>\n\nA caveat to this theory suggests that this reallocation of energy is based on time instead of limiting resources. This concept focuses on the evolutionary pressure to reproduce in a set, optimal time period that is dictated by age and ecological niche. The way that this is successful is through the allocation of time and energy in damage repair at the cellular level resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer [[gestation]]. This concept stems from a comparative analysis of genomic stability in mammalian cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C | title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853\u20136 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22071624 | doi = 10.4161/cc.10.22.18302 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Heuvel J, English S, Uller T | title = Disposable Soma Theory and the Evolution of Maternal Effects on Ageing | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = e0145544 | date = 2016-01-11 | pmid = 26752635 | pmc = 4709080 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145544 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1145544V | veditors = Criscuolo F }}</ref>\n\n<!-- This paragraph should just be removed.

One such theory is the free radical or rate of living theory which relies on the assumption that the speed at which an organism is able to metabolize oxygen is directly correlated to the release of destructive atoms which break down the cell.  The destructive atoms, known as free radicals, are released during oxygen basal metabolism and collide with healthy cells material causing breakdown, and eventual cell death.  All organisms have this oxygen basal metabolism, however it is the rate at which oxygen is broken down that determines the rate at which cells die.

Longer-lived species possess many mechanisms for offsetting damage due to causes such as oxidation, telomere shortening, and other deteriorative processes. Shorter-lived species, having earlier ages of sexual maturity, have less need for longevity and thus did not evolve or retain the more-effective repair mechanisms. Damage therefore accumulates more rapidly, resulting in earlier manifestations and shorter lifespan. Since there are a wide variety of ageing manifestations that appear to have very different causes, it is likely that there are many different maintenance and repair functions.\n\n=== Selective Shadowing ===\nSelective Shadowing is ideally one of the evolutionary theories of aging which reveals that selection of an individual generally decreases once they essentially pass the sexual mature phase. As a result, this forms a shadow without the account of sexual fitness, which is no longer considered as an individual ages. Essentially this supports the idea that the force of natural selection declines as a function of age, which was first introduced by Peter B. Medewar and J.B.S Haldane. \"The key conceptual insight that allowed Medawar, Williams, and others, to develop the evolutionary theory of aging is based on the notion that the force of natural selection, a measure of how effectively selection acts on survival rate or [[Fecundity selection|fecundity]] as a function of age, declines with progressive age.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=W.D.|date=1966-09|title=The moulding of senescence by natural selection|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-5193(66)90184-6|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=12\u201345|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(66)90184-6|issn=0022-5193}}</ref>\n\nMedewar developed a model that highlights this, showing the decrease in the survival rate of a population as an individual ages, however the reproduction rate stays constant. The reproduction probability typically peaks during sexual maturity and decreases as an individual ages, while the rest of the population decreases with age as they enter the selection shadow. The model also supports Medewars' theory that due to dangerous and unpredicted conditions in the environment such as diseases, climate changes and predators, many individuals die not too long after sexual maturation. Consequently, the probability of an individual surviving and suffering from age related effects is relatively low. In the same way, many beneficial mutations are selected against if they have a positive effect on an individual later on in life. For instance if a beneficial or deleterious mutation occurs only after an individual's reproductive phase, then it will not affect fitness, which therefore can not be selected against. Subsequently, these later mutations and effects are considered to be in the \"shadow region\" of selection.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Flatt|first=Thomas|last2=Schmidt|first2=Paul S.|date=2009-10|title=Integrating evolutionary and molecular genetics of aging|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.010|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects|volume=1790|issue=10|pages=951\u2013962|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.010|issn=0304-4165}}</ref>\n\n\n== Natural selection ==\n\n===Group selection===\n{{Main|Group selection}}\nGroup selection is based on the idea that all members of a given group will either succeed or fail together depending on the circumstance.

Intrinsic mortality is thought to be a result of ageing from insider factors, whereas extrinsic is a direct result of environmental factors. An example would be that bats have fewer predators, and therefore have a low extrinsic mortality. Birds are warm-blooded and are similar in size to many small mammals, yet often live 5\u201310 times as long. They have less predation pressure than ground-dwelling mammals, and have a lower extrinsic mortality.\n\nWhen examining the body-size vs. lifespan relationship, one also observes that predatory mammals tend to live longer than prey mammals in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or nature reserve. The explanation for the long lifespans of primates (such as humans, monkeys, and apes) relative to body size is that their intelligence, and they would have a lower intrinsic mortality. \n[[File:Bathtub_curve.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bathtub_curve.svg|thumb|244x244px|Constant Failure Rate over Time]]\n\n==Diseases ==\n\n=== Progeroid Syndromes ===\nProgeroid syndromes are genetic diseases that are linked to premature aging.

This theory formed in the previous decade with [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and his [[selection shadow]] concept. The development of human civilization has shifted the selective shadow as the conditions that humans now live in include improved quality of victuals, living conditions, and healthcare. This improved healthcare includes modern medicine such as antibiotics and new medical technology.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\">{{Cite journal|last=Flatt|first=Thomas|last2=Partridge|first2=Linda|date=2018-08-20|title=Horizons in the evolution of aging|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|journal=BMC Biology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=93|doi=10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|issn=1741-7007|pmc=6100731|pmid=30124168}}</ref> Their idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect, as nature is a highly competitive place. Almost all animals die in the wild from predators, disease, or accidents, which lowers the average age of death. Therefore, there is not much reason why the body should remain fit for the long haul because [[selection pressure]] is low for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would have died anyway. Evolution has not had an opportunity to select against deadly diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Metabolic diseases come along due to the low demand for physical activity in modern civilization compared to times where humans had to forage in the wild for survival.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\"/> With the selective shadow now shifted, humans must deal with these new selective pressures.\n\nMedawar's theory is referred to as ''Mutation Accumulation.'' This theory is based on the idea that random, germline mutations occur that are detrimental to overall health and survival later in life. Overall, senescence would occur through a summation of deleterious mutations, and would explain the overall phenotypic damage we associate with ageing.\n\n===Antagonistic pleiotropy===\n{{main|Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis}}\nMedawar's theory was critiqued and later further developed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in 1957. Williams noted that senescence may be causing many deaths even if animals are not 'dying of old age.'<ref name=\"williams\" /> He began his hypothesis with the idea that ageing can cause earlier senescence due to the competitive nature of life. Even a small amount of ageing can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care and ageing is not cost-free.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter AJ, Nguyen AQ | title = Antagonistic pleiotropy as a widespread mechanism for the maintenance of polymorphic disease alleles | journal = BMC Medical Genetics | volume = 12 | pages = 160 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22151998 | pmc = 3254080 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2350-12-160 }}</ref>\n\nWilliams eventually proposed his own hypothesis called antagonistic ''[[pleiotropy]]''.

Research has shown that this is not true for all genes and may be thought of as partial validation of the theory, but it cuts the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.\n\nIn breeding experiments, [[Michael R. Rose]] selected [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this would surely reduce their [[fertility]]. His team found that they were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artifact.<ref name=\"pmid28564485\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leroi AM, Chippindale AK, Rose MR | title = Long-term laboratory evolution of a genetic life-history tradeoff in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. 1.

The body uses resources derived from the environment for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance, and the body must compromise when there is a finite supply of resources. The theory states that this compromise causes the body to reallocate energy to the repair function that causes the body to gradually deteriorate with age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirkwood TB | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = 5635 | pages = 301\u20134 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 593350 | doi = 10.1038/270301a0 | bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }} Origin of the disposable soma theory.</ref>\n\nA caveat to this theory suggests that this reallocation of energy is based on time instead of limiting resources. This concept focuses on the evolutionary pressure to reproduce in a set, optimal time period that is dictated by age and ecological niche. The way that this is successful is through the allocation of time and energy in damage repair at the cellular level resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer [[gestation]].

One such theory is the free radical or rate of living theory which relies on the assumption that the speed at which an organism is able to metabolize oxygen is directly correlated to the release of destructive atoms which break down the cell.  The destructive atoms, known as free radicals, are released during oxygen basal metabolism and collide with healthy cells material causing breakdown, and eventual cell death.  All organisms have this oxygen basal metabolism, however it is the rate at which oxygen is broken down that determines the rate at which cells die.  For Instance, a fly has an incredible metabolic rate, so because of this they expend oxygen quickly causing cell hastened cell death which can explain their life span of only 2-3 weeks.\n}}<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Lin MT, Beal MF |date=2003-01-01|title=The oxidative damage theory of aging |journal=Clinical Neuroscience Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=5|pages=305\u2013315|doi=10.1016/S1566-2772(03)00007-0 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=McDonald | first = Roger B. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biology of aging|isbn=978-0-8153-4567-1|edition= Second|location=Boca Raton|oclc=1056201427}}</ref>\n\n===Programmed maintenance theories===\nTheories, such as Weismann's \"programmed death\" theory, suggest that deterioration and death due to ageing are a purposeful result of an organism's evolved design, and are referred to as theories of programmed ageing or adaptive ageing.\n\nThe programmed maintenance theory based on [[evolvability]]<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Goldsmith T |year=2009|title=Mammal aging: active and passive mechanisms |journal=Journal of Bioscience Hypotheses|volume=2|issue=2|pages=59\u201364|doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.12.002}} Article compares programmed and non-programmed maintenance theories of ageing in light of empirical evidence.</ref> suggests that the repair mechanisms are controlled by a common control mechanism capable of sensing conditions, such as caloric restriction, and may be responsible for lifespan in particular species.

Longer-lived species possess many mechanisms for offsetting damage due to causes such as oxidation, telomere shortening, and other deteriorative processes. Shorter-lived species, having earlier ages of sexual maturity, have less need for longevity and thus did not evolve or retain the more-effective repair mechanisms. Damage therefore accumulates more rapidly, resulting in earlier manifestations and shorter lifespan. Since there are a wide variety of ageing manifestations that appear to have very different causes, it is likely that there are many different maintenance and repair functions.\n\n== Natural selection ==\n\n===Group selection===\n{{Main|Group selection}}\nGroup selection is based on the idea that all members of a given group will either succeed or fail together depending on the circumstance.

An example would be that bats have fewer predators, and therefore have a low extrinsic mortality. Birds are warm-blooded and are similar in size to many small mammals, yet often live 5\u201310 times as long. They have less predation pressure than ground-dwelling mammals, and have a lower extrinsic mortality.\n\nWhen examining the body-size vs. lifespan relationship, one also observes that predatory mammals tend to live longer than prey mammals in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or nature reserve. The explanation for the long lifespans of primates (such as humans, monkeys, and apes) relative to body size is that their intelligence, and they would have a lower intrinsic mortality. \n[[File:Bathtub_curve.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bathtub_curve.svg|thumb|244x244px|Constant Failure Rate over Time]]\n\n==Diseases ==\n\n=== Progeroid Syndromes ===\nProgeroid syndromes are genetic diseases that are linked to premature aging.

{"title_page": "Geoff Crammond", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=November 2017}}\n{{BLP sources|date=May 2010}}\n'''Geoff Crammond''' is a [[computer game designer]] and [[Game programmer|programmer]] who specialises in motor [[racing game]]s. A former defence industry systems engineer,<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2000/08/12/feat.html Forbes - August 2000 - Feature]</ref> he claims to have had little interest in motor racing before programming his first racing game (Formula 3) back in 1984, but he holds a [[physics]] degree, which may explain the realism of some of his programming. As a consequence of that project he became a big fan of Formula One motor racing. At the end of the 80s, this interest, plus the ever improving capabilities of home computers, inspired him to specialise in programming Formula One racing simulations.\n\n== Games ==\nOne of his early releases was ''Aviator'', a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] simulator marketed for the [[BBC Micro]] by [[Acornsoft]]. Although displayed in only four colours and has few of the features of modern simulators for more powerful computers, Aviator was of unparalleled quality at the time of its release (c. 1983), with a realistic flight model that included g-forces that could tear the wings off in a dive. This would be accompanied by a continuous high pitched beep. The wings could be restored by removing the physical pressure on the airframe which was causing the flight envelope to be exceeded. Generally, this could be achieved by returning the joystick to a neutral centre position. The landscape was crudely rendered, and was basically a plane. Some scenic features were drawn as [[vector graphics]], including low hills, fields, a lake, a suspension bridge over a river, and a small town which comprised a cluster of three buildings. Bonus points could be earned for flying under the bridge or along the main street of the town at a lower altitude than the buildings. Double points were earned for performing these stunts upside down. The game also had a shoot-'em-up mode in which alien vessels were seeded in the fields, feeding on the crops and growing until they could become airborne, at which point they headed for the town. The player could destroy the aliens on the ground as they fed, or (for reduced points) tackle them in the air (the aliens were agile but could not return fire). If an alien reached the town, the game was lost. A minor bug permitted the plane to be landed upside down without consequence, so long as the landing gear had been deployed.\n\nAlthough better known for his [[Formula One]] simulation games on the [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Amiga]] platforms, his first motor racing simulator was ''[[REVS (computer game)|REVS]]'', a [[Formula Three]] simulator that debuted on the BBC Micro platform in 1984. The BBC version of ''Revs'' featured just one track, the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] circuit, but the realistic implementation of motor racing physics and artificial intelligence of the computer controlled components gave the game enormous depth and replayability.\n\nA [[Commodore 64]] version of the game, entitled ''Revs Plus'', was released in 1986, which added the [[Brands Hatch]] track to the game. An enhanced edition of the BBC version was later released called 'REVS 4 Tracks' which included Brands Hatch, [[Donington Park]], [[Oulton Park]] and [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]] race tracks. Later the [[Commodore 64]] version added the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] to this list to continue the \"4 Tracks\" theme as Brands Hatch had already been included with the initial ''REVS Plus'' release. The N\u00fcrburgring was chosen as its new layout had recently been completed and computer based design data was available. This gives an idea of just how accurate REVS was as a simulation rather than 'just' a game.\n\n''[[The Sentinel (computer game)|The Sentinel]]'' was published by [[Firebird (software label)|Firebird]] on the BBC Micro in 1986. It was a 3D puzzle game, featuring ten thousand levels, in which the player had to manoeuvre his way through a landscape of cliffs, trees and boulders to topple the ominous Sentinel. The game was a critical and commercial success. Conversions for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64|C64]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]] and PC soon followed. A sequel, ''[[Sentinel Returns]]'', was published by [[Psygnosis]] in 1998 on the PC and [[PlayStation]] platforms.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ST Stunt Car Racer.png|right|thumb|250px|Stunt Car Racer (Atari ST/Amiga)]] -->\nCrammond's attention returned to motor racing simulators. ''[[Stunt Car Racer]]'' was a slightly offbeat driving simulation, rewarding the player for performing outrageous stunts on a number of elevated, roller-coaster-like courses. Although less serious in tone than his previous simulators, the game nevertheless used an impressive physics engine to offer a realistic driving experience. The game enjoyed cult status among many Amiga and Atari ST gamers. Ever since the early 1990s, Crammond's primary focus has been on developing the award-winning Formula One Grand Prix series of games. The first game in the series, ''[[Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond)|F1GP]]'' (aka ''World Circuit'' in the USA), was released by [[MicroProse]] on the Amiga in 1991 and is essentially the spiritual successor to ''Revs''. Around this time ''[[Amiga Power]]'' magazine began referring to him as Sir Geoff, a running gag which has caught on with many others. The game was an instant success, earning a conversion to the Atari ST and PC platforms, but the inevitable sequel, ''[[Grand Prix 2 (game)|Grand Prix 2]]'', remained in development for three years before eventually being released on the PC in 1996.\n\n''[[Grand Prix 3]]'' was released on the PC in 2000 and was well received by fans and critics alike.<ref>http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/grand-prix-3</ref> Crammond's series now had considerable competition from other developers, particularly Psygnosis/[[Sony]], who were licensed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] to produce the official Formula One gaming titles. ''[[Grand Prix 4]]'' was released on the PC in 2002 and is generally regarded as the most accurate game in the series. After ''Grand Prix 4'' there were rumours that Crammond's next game would be Stunt Car Racer Pro, an updated version of his classic game. The rumours were later confirmed with an announcement that he was co-operating with [[Lost Toys]] studios. Lost Toys studios were closed in late 2003. At the beginning of 2005, the game was rumoured to be cancelled.\n\nCrammond's most recent game release is still GP4 (2002), which is still supported by fans with annual [[game mod|mods]], in spite of MicroProse's closure in 2001.\n\nFollowing that, Crammond kept a low profile, but continues to engage in various programming projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/geoffcrammond.pdf|title=In the Chair with...
