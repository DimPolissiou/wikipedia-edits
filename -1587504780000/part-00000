Released in 1977, it produced the hit singles \"[[All You Get from Love Is a Love Song]]\", \"[[Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft]]\" and \"[[Sweet, Sweet Smile]]\". The Carpenters' \"Sweet, Sweet Smile\" (written by Robert [[Otha Young]] and [[Juice Newton]]) was picked up by Country radio and put the duo in the top ten of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Country chart in the spring of 1978.\n\nThis album was a considerable departure for the siblings and contained experimental material such as the [[Klaatu (band)|Klaatu]] cover \"Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft\" single\u2014which reached no. 32 in the US but was a top ten hit in much of the world (and prompted numerous letters to the Carpenters asking when [[World Contact Day]] was scheduled).<ref name=\"fromRichard\">[http://richardandkarencarpenter.com/Album_Passage.htm Carpenters: Passage album, 1977<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Coincidentally, the album's release predated [[Steven Spielberg]]'s similarly themed film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' by one month.

[[Cuticula]]]]\n\nThe shape of an egg resembles a [[prolate spheroid]] with one end larger than the other and has cylindrical symmetry along the long axis.\n\nAn egg is surrounded by a thin, hard shell. Thin membranes exist inside the shell. The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the [[chalaza]]e (from the Greek word \u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1, meaning 'hailstone' or 'hard lump').\n\n=== Air cell ===\nThe larger end of the egg contains an air cell that forms when the contents of the egg cool down and contract after it is laid. Chicken eggs are graded according to the size of this air cell, measured during [[candling]]. A very fresh egg has a small air cell and receives a grade of AA. As the size of the air cell increases and the quality of the egg decreases, the grade moves from AA to A to B. This provides a way of testing the age of an egg: as the air cell increases in size due to air being drawn through pores in the shell as water is lost, the egg becomes less dense and the larger end of the egg will rise to increasingly shallower depths when the egg is placed in a bowl of water. A very old egg will float in the water and should not be eaten.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{cite book | last = McGee | first = H.| title = On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen |location=New York|publisher= Scribners|year = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-684-80001-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Shell ===\n{{Main|Eggshell}}\nEggshell color is caused by [[pigment]] deposition during egg formation in the [[oviduct]] and may vary according to [[species]] and [[breed]], from the more common white or brown to pink or speckled blue-green.

Clear initially, upon cooking it turns white. In chickens, it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen [[oviduct]] during the passage of the egg.<ref>Ornithology, Volume 1994 By Frank B. Gill p. 361</ref> It forms around both [[Fertilisation#Fertilisation in animals|fertilized]] and unfertilized yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition during the growth of the [[embryo]].\n\nEgg white consists primarily of approximately 90 percent water into which is dissolved 10 percent [[protein]]s (including [[albumin]]s, [[mucoprotein]]s, and [[globulin]]s). Unlike the yolk, which is high in [[lipid]]s (fats), egg white contains almost no fat and the [[carbohydrate]] content is less than one percent. Egg white has many uses in food and many other applications, including the preparation of [[vaccine]]s, such as [[Influenza vaccine|those for influenza]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How Influenza (Flu) Vaccines Are Made|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/how-fluvaccine-made.htm|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=7 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121200238/http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/how-fluvaccine-made.htm|archive-date=21 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Yolk ===\n{{Main|Egg yolk}}\nThe [[Egg yolk|yolk]] in a newly laid egg is round and firm. As the yolk ages, it absorbs water from the albumen, which increases its size and causes it to stretch and weaken the [[vitelline membrane]] (the clear casing enclosing the yolk). The resulting effect is a flattened and enlarged yolk shape.\n\nYolk color is dependent on the diet of the hen. If the diet contains yellow or orange plant [[pigments]] known as [[xanthophyll]]s, then they are deposited in the yolk, coloring it. [[Lutein]] is the most abundant pigment in egg yolk.<ref>F.

[[Tea egg]]s, a common snack sold from street-side carts in China, are steeped in a brew from a mixture of various spices, soy sauce, and black tea leaves to give flavor.\n\n=== Storage ===\nCareful storage of edible eggs is extremely important, as an improperly handled egg may contain elevated levels of ''[[Salmonella]]'' [[bacteria]] that may cause severe [[food poisoning]]. In the US, eggs are washed. This cleans the shell, but erodes its [[wikt:cuticle|cuticle]].<ref name=\"Anatomy\">{{cite web|title=Anatomy of an Egg|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/eggs/eggcomposition.html|website=Science of Cooking|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite news|last1=Arumugam|first1=Nadia|title=Why American Eggs Would Be Illegal In A British Supermarket, And Vice Versa|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2012/10/25/why-american-eggs-would-be-illegal-in-a-british-supermarket-and-vice-versa/3/#368c25d752cf|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=Forbes|date=25 October 2012}}</ref> The USDA thus recommends refrigerating eggs to prevent the growth of ''Salmonella''.<ref name=\"usda-eggs\"/>\n\nRefrigeration also preserves the taste and texture, however, intact eggs (unwashed and unbroken) may be left unrefrigerated for several months without spoiling.<ref>[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Sustainable-Farming/1977-11-01/Fresh-Eggs.aspx How to Store Fresh Eggs] Mother Earth News, November/December (1977)</ref> In Europe, eggs are not usually washed, and the shells are dirtier, however the cuticle is undamaged, and they do not require refrigeration.<ref name=Forbes/> In the UK in particular, hens are immunized against salmonella and generally, their eggs are safe for 21 days.<ref name=Forbes/>\n\n=== Preservation ===\n[[File:Salty egg.JPG|thumb|upright|220px|Salted duck egg.]]\nThe simplest method to preserve an egg is to treat it with [[salt]].

After the process is completed, the yolk becomes a dark green, cream-like substance with a strong odor of sulfur and ammonia, while the white becomes a dark brown, transparent jelly with a comparatively mild, distinct flavor.

[[Tofu]] also acts as a partial binding agent, since it is high in lecithin due to its [[soy]] content. [[Applesauce]] may be used, as well as [[arrowroot]] and [[banana]]. Extracted [[lecithin|soybean lecithin]], in turn, often is used in packaged foods as an inexpensive substitute for egg-derived lecithin. [[Legumes|Leguminous]] broths, such as [[chickpea]] brine or [[green pea|green pea canning liquid]], also known as [[aquafaba]], can replace egg whites in desserts such as meringues and mousses.\n\nOther [[egg substitute]]s are made from just the white of the egg for those who worry about the high cholesterol and fat content in eggs. These products usually have added vitamins and minerals, as well as vegetable-based emulsifiers and thickeners, such as [[xanthan gum]] or [[guar gum]]. These allow the product to maintain the nutrition and several culinary properties of real eggs, making possible foods such as [[Hollandaise sauce]], [[custard]], [[mayonnaise]], and most baked goods with these substitutes.\n\n== Nutritional value ==\n{{nutritional value\n| name           = Chicken egg<br />whole, hard-boiled\n| kJ             = 647\n| water          = 75 g\n| protein        = 12.6 g\n| fat            = 10.6 g\n| carbs          = 1.12 g\n| iron_mg        = 1.2\n| calcium_mg     = 50\n| magnesium_mg   = 10\n| phosphorus_mg  = 172\n| potassium_mg   = 126\n| sodium_mg      = 124\n| zinc_mg        = 1.0\n| vitA_ug        = 149\n| pantothenic_mg = 1.4\n| folate_ug      = 44\n| thiamin_mg     = 0.066\n| riboflavin_mg  = 0.5\n| niacin_mg      = 0.064\n| vitB6_mg       = 0.121\n| vitB12_ug      = 1.11\n| vitK_ug        = 0.3\n| tryptophan     = 0.153 g\n| threonine      = 0.604 g\n| isoleucine     = 0.686 g\n| leucine        = 1.075 g\n| lysine         = 0.904 g\n| methionine     = 0.392 g\n| cystine        = 0.292 g\n| phenylalanine  = 0.668 g\n| tyrosine       = 0.513 g\n| valine         = 0.767 g\n| arginine       = 0.755 g\n| histidine      = 0.298 g\n| alanine        = 0.700 g\n| aspartic acid  = 1.264 g\n| glutamic acid  = 1.644 g\n| glycine        = 0.423 g\n| proline        = 0.501 g\n| serine         = 0.936 g\n| vitD_iu        = 87\n| vitE_mg        = 1.03\n| choline_mg     = 294\n| opt2n          = [[Cholesterol]]\n| opt2v          = 373 mg\n| right          = 1\n| source_usda    = 1\n| note           = For edible portion only.<br />Refuse: 12% (shell).<br />An egg just large enough to be classified as \"large\" in the U.S. yields 50 grams of egg without shell.

[[Cuticula]]]]\n\nThe shape of an egg resembles a [[prolate spheroid]] with one end larger than the other and has cylindrical symmetry along the long axis.\n\nAn egg is surrounded by a thin, hard shell. Thin membranes exist inside the shell. The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the [[chalaza]]e (from the Greek word \u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1, meaning 'hailstone' or 'hard lump').\n\n=== Air cell ===\nThe larger end of the egg contains an air cell that forms when the contents of the egg cool down and contract after it is laid. Chicken eggs are graded according to the size of this air cell, measured during [[candling]]. A very fresh egg has a small air cell and receives a grade of AA. As the size of the air cell increases and the quality of the egg decreases, the grade moves from AA to A to B. This provides a way of testing the age of an egg: as the air cell increases in size due to air being drawn through pores in the shell as water is lost, the egg becomes less dense and the larger end of the egg will rise to increasingly shallower depths when the egg is placed in a bowl of water. A very old egg will float in the water and should not be eaten.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{cite book | last = McGee | first = H.| title = On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen |location=New York|publisher= Scribners|year = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-684-80001-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Shell ===\n{{Main|Eggshell}}\nEggshell color is caused by [[pigment]] deposition during egg formation in the [[oviduct]] and may vary according to [[species]] and [[breed]], from the more common white or brown to pink or speckled blue-green.

Clear initially, upon cooking it turns white. In chickens, it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen [[oviduct]] during the passage of the egg.<ref>Ornithology, Volume 1994 By Frank B. Gill p. 361</ref> It forms around both [[Fertilisation#Fertilisation in animals|fertilized]] and unfertilized yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition during the growth of the [[embryo]].\n\nEgg white consists primarily of approximately 90 percent water into which is dissolved 10 percent [[protein]]s (including [[albumin]]s, [[mucoprotein]]s, and [[globulin]]s). Unlike the yolk, which is high in [[lipid]]s (fats), egg white contains almost no fat and the [[carbohydrate]] content is less than one percent. Egg white has many uses in food and many other applications, including the preparation of [[vaccine]]s, such as [[Influenza vaccine|those for influenza]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How Influenza (Flu) Vaccines Are Made|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/how-fluvaccine-made.htm|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=7 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121200238/http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/how-fluvaccine-made.htm|archive-date=21 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Yolk ===\n{{Main|Egg yolk}}\nThe [[Egg yolk|yolk]] in a newly laid egg is round and firm. As the yolk ages, it absorbs water from the albumen, which increases its size and causes it to stretch and weaken the [[vitelline membrane]] (the clear casing enclosing the yolk). The resulting effect is a flattened and enlarged yolk shape.\n\nYolk color is dependent on the diet of the hen. If the diet contains yellow or orange plant [[pigments]] known as [[xanthophyll]]s, then they are deposited in the yolk, coloring it. [[Lutein]] is the most abundant pigment in egg yolk.<ref>F.

[[Tea egg]]s, a common snack sold from street-side carts in China, are steeped in a brew from a mixture of various spices, soy sauce, and black tea leaves to give flavor.\n\n=== Storage ===\nCareful storage of edible eggs is extremely important, as an improperly handled egg may contain elevated levels of ''[[Salmonella]]'' [[bacteria]] that may cause severe [[food poisoning]]. In the US, eggs are washed. This cleans the shell, but erodes its [[wikt:cuticle|cuticle]].<ref name=\"Anatomy\">{{cite web|title=Anatomy of an Egg|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/eggs/eggcomposition.html|website=Science of Cooking|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite news|last1=Arumugam|first1=Nadia|title=Why American Eggs Would Be Illegal In A British Supermarket, And Vice Versa|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2012/10/25/why-american-eggs-would-be-illegal-in-a-british-supermarket-and-vice-versa/3/#368c25d752cf|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=Forbes|date=25 October 2012}}</ref> The USDA thus recommends refrigerating eggs to prevent the growth of ''Salmonella''.<ref name=\"usda-eggs\"/>\n\nRefrigeration also preserves the taste and texture, however, intact eggs (unwashed and unbroken) may be left unrefrigerated for several months without spoiling.<ref>[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Sustainable-Farming/1977-11-01/Fresh-Eggs.aspx How to Store Fresh Eggs] Mother Earth News, November/December (1977)</ref> In Europe, eggs are not usually washed, and the shells are dirtier, however the cuticle is undamaged, and they do not require refrigeration.<ref name=Forbes/> In the UK in particular, hens are immunized against salmonella and generally, their eggs are safe for 21 days.<ref name=Forbes/>\n\n=== Preservation ===\n[[File:Salty egg.JPG|thumb|upright|220px|Salted duck egg.]]\nThe simplest method to preserve an egg is to treat it with [[salt]].

After the process is completed, the yolk becomes a dark green, cream-like substance with a strong odor of sulfur and ammonia, while the white becomes a dark brown, transparent jelly with a comparatively mild, distinct flavor.

[[Tofu]] also acts as a partial binding agent, since it is high in lecithin due to its [[soy]] content. [[Applesauce]] may be used, as well as [[arrowroot]] and [[banana]]. Extracted [[lecithin|soybean lecithin]], in turn, often is used in packaged foods as an inexpensive substitute for egg-derived lecithin. [[Legumes|Leguminous]] broths, such as [[chickpea]] brine or [[green pea|green pea canning liquid]], also known as [[aquafaba]], can replace egg whites in desserts such as meringues and mousses.\n\nOther [[egg substitute]]s are made from just the white of the egg for those who worry about the high cholesterol and fat content in eggs. These products usually have added vitamins and minerals, as well as vegetable-based emulsifiers and thickeners, such as [[xanthan gum]] or [[guar gum]]. These allow the product to maintain the nutrition and several culinary properties of real eggs, making possible foods such as [[Hollandaise sauce]], [[custard]], [[mayonnaise]], and most baked goods with these substitutes.\n\n== Nutritional value ==\n{{nutritional value\n| name           = Chicken egg<br />whole, hard-boiled\n| kJ             = 647\n| water          = 75 g\n| protein        = 12.6 g\n| fat            = 10.6 g\n| carbs          = 1.12 g\n| iron_mg        = 1.2\n| calcium_mg     = 50\n| magnesium_mg   = 10\n| phosphorus_mg  = 172\n| potassium_mg   = 126\n| sodium_mg      = 124\n| zinc_mg        = 1.0\n| vitA_ug        = 149\n| pantothenic_mg = 1.4\n| folate_ug      = 44\n| thiamin_mg     = 0.066\n| riboflavin_mg  = 0.5\n| niacin_mg      = 0.064\n| vitB6_mg       = 0.121\n| vitB12_ug      = 1.11\n| vitK_ug        = 0.3\n| tryptophan     = 0.153 g\n| threonine      = 0.604 g\n| isoleucine     = 0.686 g\n| leucine        = 1.075 g\n| lysine         = 0.904 g\n| methionine     = 0.392 g\n| cystine        = 0.292 g\n| phenylalanine  = 0.668 g\n| tyrosine       = 0.513 g\n| valine         = 0.767 g\n| arginine       = 0.755 g\n| histidine      = 0.298 g\n| alanine        = 0.700 g\n| aspartic acid  = 1.264 g\n| glutamic acid  = 1.644 g\n| glycine        = 0.423 g\n| proline        = 0.501 g\n| serine         = 0.936 g\n| vitD_iu        = 87\n| vitE_mg        = 1.03\n| choline_mg     = 294\n| opt2n          = [[Cholesterol]]\n| opt2v          = 373 mg\n| right          = 1\n| source_usda    = 1\n| note           = For edible portion only.<br />Refuse: 12% (shell).<br />An egg just large enough to be classified as \"large\" in the U.S. yields 50 grams of egg without shell.
