It gives a fictional account of the last days of [[Marie Antoinette]] in power seen through the eyes of Sidonie Laborde, a young servant who reads aloud to the queen. The film stars [[Diane Kruger]] as the Queen, [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]], and [[Virginie Ledoyen]]. It opened the [[62nd Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2012 and has subsequently been screened at other festivals. Its release date was 21 March 2012 in France.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1789, on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]] still live their routines, relatively unconcerned by the increasing turmoil in [[Paris]] a mere twenty miles away. The routines are seen through the eyes of the young Sidonie Laborde, who serves Queen [[Marie Antoinette]].\n\nWhen news about the [[storming of the Bastille]] reaches the Court, most aristocrats and servants desert the Palace and abandon the Royal Family, fearing that the government is falling. But Sidonie, a true believer in the monarchy, refuses to flee. She feels secure under the protection of the Royal Family. She does not know these are the last three days she will spend by the Queen's side.\n\nThe Queen orders Sidonie to disguise herself as [[Yolande de Polastron|Yolande Martine Gabrielle de Polastron]], [[Duchess of Polignac]], and serve as bait so that the latter can safely flee to Switzerland. This Sidonie does, despite a prior warning from one of the Queen's ladies in waiting.  Sidonie is stripped naked and then redressed in a green gown. The coach carrying Sidonie is also occupied by the real Duchess and her husband, dressed as her servants. They treat her with disdain during the journey but she plays her role convincingly enough to enable the party to safely cross the border. As the film ends, she remarks that she has no connections other than her position as reader to the Queen, and soon she will be a nobody.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as Sidonie Laborde\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as [[Marie Antoinette|Marie-Antoinette, Queen of France]]\n* [[Virginie Ledoyen]] as [[Yolande de Polastron|Gabrielle de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac]]\n* [[Xavier Beauvois]] as [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]\n* [[Gr\u00e9gory Gadebois]] as [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis, comte de Provence]]\n* [[Francis Leplay]] as [[Charles X of France|Charles, comte d'Artois]]\n* [[No\u00e9mie Lvovsky]] as [[Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan]]\n* [[Vladimir Consigny]] as Paolo\n* [[Julie-Marie Parmentier]] as Honorine\n* [[Michel Robin]] as Nicolas Moreau\n* [[Lolita Chammah]] as Louison\n* [[Marthe Caufman]] as Alice\n* [[Jacques Boudet]] as Monsieur de la Tour du Pin\n* [[Martine Chevallier]] as Madame de la Tour du Pin\n* [[Jacques Nolot]] as Monsieur de Jolivet\n* [[Serge Renko]] as Marquis de la Chesnaye\n* [[Anne Beno\u00eet]] as [[Rose Bertin]]\n* [[Dominique Reymond]] as Madame\n* [[Jean-Chr\u00e9tien Sibertin-Blanc]] as Monsieur de Polignac\n* [[Jacques Herlin]] as Marquis de Vaucouleurs\n* [[Pierre Rochefort]] as Le valet Antonin\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Farewell, My Queen'' was directed by [[Beno\u00eet Jacquot]] and based on a script by him, [[Chantal Thomas]], and [[Gilles Taurand]].

The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them.]]\n\nA '''Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)''' (also known as '''post-wall waveguide''' or '''laminated waveguide''') is a synthetic [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular electromagnetic waveguide]] formed in a [[dielectric]] substrate by densely arraying metallized posts or [[Via (electronics)|via-hole]]s which connect the upper and lower metal plates of the substrate. The waveguide can be easily fabricated with low-cost mass-production using [[Through-hole technology|through-hole techniques]] where the post walls consists of [[via fence]]s. SIW is known to have similar guided wave and mode characteristics to conventional rectangular waveguide with equivalent [[guide wavelength]].\n\nSince the emergence of new communication technologies in the 1990s, there has been an increasing need for high-performance millimeter-wave systems. These need to be reliable, low-cost, compact, and compatible with high-frequencies. Unfortunately, above 10&nbsp;GHz, the well known [[microstrip]] and [[coplanar waveguide|coplanar lines]] technologies cannot be used because they have high insertion and radiation losses at these frequencies. The [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular waveguide]] topology can overcome these issues as it offers an excellent immunity against radiation losses and presents low insertion losses. But in their classical form, rectangular waveguide is not compatible with the miniaturization required by modern applications.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ke Wu|last2=Desiandes|first2=D.|last3=Cassivi|first3=Y.|date=2003|title=The substrate integrated circuits - a new concept for high-frequency electronics and optoelectronics|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1246173/|journal=6th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Service, 2003.

Using a single substrate guarantees a limited volume and a simplicity of manufacture, while the rectangular cross-section of the line provides the advantages of the waveguide topology in terms of losses.\n\n== Principles of SIW ==\n\n[[File:SIW horizontal.png|alt=Horizontal cross-section of a classical substrate integrated waveguide.|thumb|Horizontal cross-section of a classical substrate integrated waveguide. The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them.

The effective width <math>a_e</math>, computed from <math>a</math>, <math>d</math> and <math>s</math>,with is also presented.]]\n\n=== Geometry ===\n\nA classical SIW is composed of a thin dielectric substrate covered on both faces by a metallic layer. The substrate embeds two parallel rows of metallic [[via (electronics)|via-holes]] delimiting the wave propagation area. The organization of the vias and the geometric parameters are described in the attached figure.\n\nThe width of a SIW is the distance <math>a</math> between its two vias rows, which is defined from center-to-center. An [[#Effective width|effective width]] <math>a_e</math> may be used to characterize more precisely the wave propagation. The distance between two successive vias of the same row is <math>s</math>, and the vias diameter is denoted by <math>d</math>.\n\n=== Transverse magnetic propagation modes ===\n\nIn classical rectangular waveguide, the general formulation of propagation involves a superposition of [[Transverse mode|transverse electric]] (TE) and [[Transverse mode|transverse magnetic]] (TM) modes. Each of these is associated with particular fields and currents. In the case of TM modes, the current in the vertical walls is longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the propagation axis, usually denoted as <math>z</math>. Then, given the vertical geometry of the vias, it is impossible for such modes to appear in SIW's: the electrical current cannot propagate from via to via. Only TE modes are able to propagate through SIW.\n\nEach mode appears above a precise cut-off frequency determined by the waveguide dimensions and the filling medium. For TM modes, decreasing the waveguide thickness (usually denoted as <math>b</math>) increases the cut-off frequency with <math>1/b</math>. In the case of SIW, the thickness is so low that the cut-off frequency of TM modes is much higher than the dominant mode.\n\n=== Effective width ===\n\nOne of the objectives of the SIW geometry is to reproduce the characteristic propagation modes of rectangular waveguides inside a thin template. The width <math>a</math> of the waveguide is an essential parameter of those modes. In the typical SIW geometry, <math>a</math> is the distance between the two vias rows from center-to-center (see figure). Due to the vias geometry, this distance cannot be utilized directly; because of the space between successive vias and their circular shape, the signal inside the guide does not behave exactly as it would in a perfectly rectangular waveguide of the same width.\n\nTo apply waveguide theory to SIWs, an effective width <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>can be used. Its takes into account the shape of the vias and the space in-between. Its value lies between <math>a + d</math> and <math>a - d</math>.\n\nA common simple definition is<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Georgiadis|first2=A.|last3=Wu|first3=K.|date=2011|title=Review of substrate-integrated waveguide circuits and antennas|url=https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463|journal=IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation|language=en|volume=5|issue=8|pages=909|doi=10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Cassivi|first=Y.|last2=Perregrini|first2=L.|last3=Arcioni|first3=P.|last4=Bressan|first4=M.|last5=Wu|first5=K.|last6=Conciauro|first6=G.|date=September 2002|title=Dispersion characteristics of substrate integrated rectangular waveguide|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1031925/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=12|issue=9|pages=333\u2013335|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2002.803188|issn=1531-1309}}</ref>\n\n<math>a_\\text{eff} = a - \\frac{d^2}{0.95 s}</math>\n\nand a more refined definition used for large values of <math>d/a</math> is,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Feng Xu|last2=Ke Wu|date=January 2005|title=Guided-wave and leakage characteristics of substrate integrated waveguide|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1381676/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques|volume=53|issue=1|pages=66\u201373|doi=10.1109/TMTT.2004.839303|issn=0018-9480}}</ref><br /><math>a_\\text{eff} = a - 1.08 \\frac{d^2}{s} + 0.1 \\frac{d^2}{a}.</math>\n\nUsing this effective width, the propagation constant of a SIW will be similar to that of a classical rectangular waveguide whose width is <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>.

The goal of such transitions between two different topologies of TL is to excite the correct transmission mode in the SIW cavity with the minimum loss of power and on the broadest possible frequency range.\n\nRapidly after the presentation of the concept of SIW by [[Ke Wu]], two different transitions were mainly used<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. First, the tapered transition allowing to convert a microstrip line into a SIW and secondly a transition between a coplanar line and a SIW (see attached figure). The tapered transition from microstrip to SIW is useful for thin substrates. In this case, the radiation losses associated with microstrip lines are not too significant. This transition is massively used and different optimizing process have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayas-Sanchez|first=Jose E.|last2=Gutierrez-Ayala|first2=Vladimir|date=2008|title=A general EM-based design procedure for single-layer substrate integrated waveguide interconnects with microstrip transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632999/|journal=2008 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=983\u2013986|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2008.4632999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Dominic|date=2010|title=Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5517884/|journal=2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|pages=704\u2013707|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517884}}</ref> But this is not applicable to thick substrates where leakages are important. In that situation, a coplanar excitation of the SIW is recommended. The drawback of the coplanar transition is the narrower bandwidth.\n\nThese two kinds of transitions involve lines that are embedded in the same substrate, which is not the case for coaxial lines. There exists no direct transition between a coaxial line and a SIW: an other planar line have to be used to convert properly the coaxial TEM propagation modes to the TE modes in SIW.\n\nSeveral studies have been carried out to optimize the transition between topologies without being able to determine a universal rule making it possible to draw the absolute transition. The architecture, the frequency range, the used materials, etc. are examples of parameters that make specific the design procedure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Georgiadis|first2=A.|last3=Wu|first3=K.|date=2011|title=Review of substrate-integrated waveguide circuits and antennas|url=https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463|journal=IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation|language=en|volume=5|issue=8|pages=909|doi=10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xiao-Ping|last2=Wu|first2=Ke|date=2009|title=Low-loss ultra-wideband transition between conductor-backed coplanar waveguide and substrate integrated waveguide|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5165705/|journal=2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=349\u2013352|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165705}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sunho|last2=Jung|first2=Sangwoon|last3=Lee|first3=Hai-Young|date=2008|title=Ultra-Wideband CPW-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide Transition Using an Elevated-CPW Section|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4666756/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=18|issue=11|pages=746\u2013748|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2008.2005230|issn=1531-1309}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taringou|first=Farzaneh|last2=Bornemann|first2=Jens|date=2011|title=New substrate-integrated to coplanar waveguide transition|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6101767/|journal=2011 41st European Microwave Conference|pages=428\u2013431|doi=10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101767}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align    = center   \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = SIW tapered transition.svg\n| caption1 = Transition from microstrip to SIW\n| width1   = 200\n| image2   = SIW transition CPWG.svg\n| caption2 = Transition from a coplanar line to a SIW\n| width2   = 200\n| footer   = Examples of transitions from coplanar and microstrip lines to SIW.

This loss is generated by different phenomena and each of them is represented by a term <math>\\alpha</math>. The most common terms are the following:<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/waveguide-loss|title=Microwaves101 {{!}} Waveguide Loss|website=www.microwaves101.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n*<math>\\alpha_C</math> : the loss due to the external metal conductivity\n*<math>\\alpha_D\n</math> : the loss due to loss tangent of the dielectric medium filling the waveguide\n*<math>\\alpha_G</math> : the loss due to conductivity of the dielectric medium filling the waveguide\n*<math>\\alpha_R</math> : the loss due to radiation.\n\nThis decomposition is valid for all kind of [[Transmission line|transmission lines]]. However, for [[Rectangular waveguide|rectangular waveguides]], the attenuation due to radiations and substrate [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] is negligible. Indeed, usually, the substrate is an insulator such that <math>\\alpha_G \\simeq 0</math>. In the same way, if the wall thickness is much thicker than the skin depth of the signal, no radiation will appear. This is in fact one of the advantages of closed waveguides compared to open lines such as microstrips.\n\nThe SIWs show comparable or lower losses compared the other traditional planar structures like microstrip or coplanar lines especially at high frequencies.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the substrate is thick enough, the losses are dominated by the dielectric behavior of the substrate.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Attenuation due to conduction currents ===\nPart of the signal attenuation is due to the [[Current density|surface current density]] flowing through the metallic walls of the waveguide. These currents are induced by the propagating [[Electromagnetic field|electromagnetic fields]]. These losses may also be named ohmic losses for obvious reasons. They are linked to the finite conductivity of the metals: the better the conduction, the lower the losses.

The waveguide can be easily fabricated with low-cost mass-production using [[Through-hole technology|through-hole techniques]] where the post walls consists of [[via fence]]s. SIW is known to have similar guided wave and mode characteristics to conventional rectangular waveguide with equivalent [[guide wavelength]].\n\nSince the emergence of new communication technologies in the 1990s, there has been an increasing need for high-performance millimeter-wave systems. These need to be reliable, low-cost, compact, and compatible with high-frequencies. Unfortunately, above 10&nbsp;GHz, the well known [[microstrip]] and [[coplanar waveguide|coplanar lines]] technologies cannot be used because they have high insertion and radiation losses at these frequencies. The [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular waveguide]] topology can overcome these issues as it offers an excellent immunity against radiation losses and presents low insertion losses.

The effective width <math>a_e</math>, computed from <math>a</math>, <math>d</math> and <math>s</math>,with is also presented.]]\n\n=== Geometry ===\n\nA classical SIW is composed of a thin dielectric substrate covered on both faces by a metallic layer. The substrate embeds two parallel rows of metallic [[via (electronics)|via-holes]] delimiting the wave propagation area. The organization of the vias and the geometric parameters are described in the attached figure.\n\nThe width of a SIW is the distance <math>a</math> between its two vias rows, which is defined from center-to-center. An [[#Effective width|effective width]] <math>a_e</math> may be used to characterize more precisely the wave propagation. The distance between two successive vias of the same row is <math>s</math>, and the vias diameter is denoted by <math>d</math>.\n\n=== Transverse magnetic propagation modes ===\n\nIn classical rectangular waveguide, the general formulation of propagation involves a superposition of [[Transverse mode|transverse electric]] (TE) and [[Transverse mode|transverse magnetic]] (TM) modes. Each of these is associated with particular fields and currents. In the case of TM modes, the current in the vertical walls is longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the propagation axis, usually denoted as <math>z</math>. Then, given the vertical geometry of the vias, it is impossible for such modes to appear in SIW's: the electrical current cannot propagate from via to via. Only TE modes are able to propagate through SIW.\n\nEach mode appears above a precise cut-off frequency determined by the waveguide dimensions and the filling medium. For TM modes, decreasing the waveguide thickness (usually denoted as <math>b</math>) increases the cut-off frequency with <math>1/b</math>. In the case of SIW, the thickness is so low that the cut-off frequency of TM modes is much higher than the dominant mode.\n\n=== Effective width ===\n\nOne of the objectives of the SIW geometry is to reproduce the characteristic propagation modes of rectangular waveguides inside a thin template. The width <math>a</math> of the waveguide is an essential parameter of those modes. In the typical SIW geometry, <math>a</math> is the distance between the two vias rows from center-to-center (see figure). Due to the vias geometry, this distance cannot be utilized directly; because of the space between successive vias and their circular shape, the signal inside the guide does not behave exactly as it would in a perfectly rectangular waveguide of the same width.\n\nTo apply waveguide theory to SIWs, an effective width <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>can be used. Its takes into account the shape of the vias and the space in-between. Its value lies between <math>a + d</math> and <math>a - d</math>.\n\nA common simple definition is<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Georgiadis|first2=A.|last3=Wu|first3=K.|date=2011|title=Review of substrate-integrated waveguide circuits and antennas|url=https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463|journal=IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation|language=en|volume=5|issue=8|pages=909|doi=10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Cassivi|first=Y.|last2=Perregrini|first2=L.|last3=Arcioni|first3=P.|last4=Bressan|first4=M.|last5=Wu|first5=K.|last6=Conciauro|first6=G.|date=September 2002|title=Dispersion characteristics of substrate integrated rectangular waveguide|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1031925/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=12|issue=9|pages=333\u2013335|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2002.803188|issn=1531-1309}}</ref>\n\n<math>a_\\text{eff} = a - \\frac{d^2}{0.95 s}</math>\n\nand a more refined definition used for large values of <math>d/a</math> is,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Feng Xu|last2=Ke Wu|date=January 2005|title=Guided-wave and leakage characteristics of substrate integrated waveguide|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1381676/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques|volume=53|issue=1|pages=66\u201373|doi=10.1109/TMTT.2004.839303|issn=0018-9480}}</ref><br /><math>a_\\text{eff} = a - 1.08 \\frac{d^2}{s} + 0.1 \\frac{d^2}{a}.</math>\n\nUsing this effective width, the propagation constant of a SIW will be similar to that of a classical rectangular waveguide whose width is <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>.

The goal of such transitions between two different topologies of TL is to excite the correct transmission mode in the SIW cavity with the minimum loss of power and on the broadest possible frequency range.\n\nRapidly after the presentation of the concept of SIW by [[Ke Wu]], two different transitions were mainly used<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. First, the tapered transition allowing to convert a microstrip line into a SIW and secondly a transition between a coplanar line and a SIW (see attached figure). The tapered transition from microstrip to SIW is useful for thin substrates. In this case, the radiation losses associated with microstrip lines are not too significant. This transition is massively used and different optimizing process have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayas-Sanchez|first=Jose E.|last2=Gutierrez-Ayala|first2=Vladimir|date=2008|title=A general EM-based design procedure for single-layer substrate integrated waveguide interconnects with microstrip transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632999/|journal=2008 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=983\u2013986|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2008.4632999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Dominic|date=2010|title=Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5517884/|journal=2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|pages=704\u2013707|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517884}}</ref> But this is not applicable to thick substrates where leakages are important. In that situation, a coplanar excitation of the SIW is recommended. The drawback of the coplanar transition is the narrower bandwidth.\n\nThese two kinds of transitions involve lines that are embedded in the same substrate, which is not the case for coaxial lines. There exists no direct transition between a coaxial line and a SIW: an other planar line have to be used to convert properly the coaxial TEM propagation modes to the TE modes in SIW.\n\nSeveral studies have been carried out to optimize the transition between topologies without being able to determine a universal rule making it possible to draw the absolute transition. The architecture, the frequency range, the used materials, etc. are examples of parameters that make specific the design procedure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Georgiadis|first2=A.|last3=Wu|first3=K.|date=2011|title=Review of substrate-integrated waveguide circuits and antennas|url=https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463|journal=IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation|language=en|volume=5|issue=8|pages=909|doi=10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xiao-Ping|last2=Wu|first2=Ke|date=2009|title=Low-loss ultra-wideband transition between conductor-backed coplanar waveguide and substrate integrated waveguide|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5165705/|journal=2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=349\u2013352|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165705}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sunho|last2=Jung|first2=Sangwoon|last3=Lee|first3=Hai-Young|date=2008|title=Ultra-Wideband CPW-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide Transition Using an Elevated-CPW Section|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4666756/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=18|issue=11|pages=746\u2013748|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2008.2005230|issn=1531-1309}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taringou|first=Farzaneh|last2=Bornemann|first2=Jens|date=2011|title=New substrate-integrated to coplanar waveguide transition|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6101767/|journal=2011 41st European Microwave Conference|pages=428\u2013431|doi=10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101767}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align    = center   \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = SIW tapered transition.svg\n| caption1 = Transition from microstrip to SIW\n| width1   = 200\n| image2   = SIW transition CPWG.svg\n| caption2 = Transition from a coplanar line to a SIW\n| width2   = 200\n| footer   = Examples of transitions from coplanar and microstrip lines to SIW.

Following the sack of Constantinople in 1208, relics were dispersed to many locations. One story holds that a monk, [[St Regulus|St. Rule]], Rule gathered together the relics and came to Scotland, where he founded a Christian settlement on the east coast. However, it is possible that they were originally in the collection of [[Acca of Hexham|Acca, bishop of Hexham]], who brought them to Pictish country around 732, when he founded a see on the site of St Andrews.\n\n== St Andrew as patron saint of Scotland ==\n\n[[File:Little Camino Badge designed by Corina Chichi.jpg|thumb|right|Little Camino Badge designed by Corina Alexandra Cristea]]The story surrounding St Andrew and Scotland says that in the 8th century a [[Picts|Pictish]] king, Angus Macfergus, was retreating back into Scotland after a raid in [[Northumbria]] in the north of England. When he found himself surrounded by the much larger pursuing army, that night he prayed, and St Andrew appeared before him and promised him victory. The following day, a huge white cross appeared in the blue sky and this inspired Angus's army to win a great victory. The [[Flag of Scotland]], a white X on a blue background, dates from this event. From then on St Andrew increasingly became accepted as the patron saint of Scotland.\n\nAbout a century later, under rather similar circumstances, [[James the Just|St James]] rose to become the patron saint of [[Spain]]. The Christian kings were involved in the long \"reconquest\" of Spain and, at a battle in 844, the miraculous appearance of St James on horseback helped put the [[Moors]] to flight. Also, at this time, the relics of St James were discovered in a field and became the object of a local cult, which subsequently grew into a pilgrimage.\n\n== Start of pilgrimage tradition==\n\nThere are records going back as far as the 10th century of kings and princes coming to St Andrews as pilgrims to pray at the [[shrine]] which housed the relics of St Andrew, and sometimes ending their days there. This trend continued, and by the early 12th century the existing town was struggling to deal with the increasing numbers. The king, Alexander I of Scotland, recognised the need for a larger church and a system to cope with the visiting pilgrims.\n\n[[File:Prayers before open air mass in the cathedral during the New Dawn celebrations.jpg|thumb|right|Prayers before open air mass during New Dawn celebrations]]With royal encouragement and funds the newly elected bishop, Robert, started to build a great new cathedral complex with four main streets leading to it from the east, in a design that was probably an accidental imitation of the [[scallop]] shell, the badge of pilgrimage. The cathedral, dominated by the tower dedicated to St Rule, became one of the largest buildings in Europe. Whether by accident or deliberate one-upmanship, the internal length of St Andrews Cathedral was 108 metres, 12 metres longer than the cathedral at Santiago.\n\nAlexander's successor, [[David I of Scotland]], continued with royal support and, from this time onwards, royal protection was promised to the pilgrims. Numbers steadily increased. From the east, pilgrims arrived mainly from the continent at [[North Berwick]], where they took the ferry to the south coast of Fife, arriving at [[Earlsferry]] and travelling the last 15 miles on foot to St Andrews along a track the width of \"a donkey with two [[pannier]]s\". From the south, pilgrims arriving at modern [[South Queensferry]] were ferried across the [[Firth of Forth]] before proceeding to St Andrews, a journey of around 50 miles.\n\nPilgrimage began to fall off as wars wracked Scotland, and even more so with the coming of [[the Reformation]]. In 1559, [[John Knox]], the great [[Protestant]] reformer, preached a sermon in St Andrews urging the pillage and destruction of the cathedral. Fortunately, the relics were removed to safety, but the destruction and looting started that day, and eventually reduced the flourishing religious centre to the gaunt but massive ruins which still dominate the town today. The 500-year-old tradition of the pilgrimage to St Andrews was at an end.\n\n== Revival of pilgrimage tradition in Scotland ==\n\nThe last 100 years has also seen a remarkable rise of pilgrimage in Scotland. The early lead came from [[Presbyterian]] ministers with a renewed interest in the early Christian church and the [[Celts|Celtic]] saints. Ironically, these men were of the same religion as those who had destroyed the cathedral at St Andrews and wiped out pilgrimage to Scotland. The famous island of [[Iona]], with the abbey founded by [[St Columba]], was the first to be put back on the pilgrimage map under the guidance and leadership of the Reverend George Macleod. Then, following in his footsteps, other ministers and academics, like Dr Ian Bradley and the Reverend Andrew Patterson, helped promote other shrines and sites associated with early saints into a national network of walks.\n\n[[File:Little Camino Badge designed by Matjaz Vidmar.jpg|thumb|right|Little Camino Badge designed by Matjaz Vidmar]] Other churches followed, starting their own pilgrimage projects, and in 2012 some lay members of the diocese of Edinburgh and St Andrews decided to revive the ancient pilgrimage to St Andrews.<ref name=Dunlop>[http://www.sconews.co.uk/news/17615/walking-the-way-of-st-andrew/ Dunlop, Martin. \"Walking the Way of St Andrew\", ''Scottish Catholic Observer'', 30 March 2012]</ref> This [[ecumenical]] venture received the enthusiastic support of the [[Roman Catholic]] hierarchy and other church leaders.\n\nThe organisers were open in their respect for the hard work and faith which had revived the \"Camino\" to Santiago de Compostela in the late 20th century and made it the world-famous attraction it is today, so it was not surprising that they chose a similar pilgrimage model. The Way of St Andrews, quickly dubbed \"The Little Camino\", is therefore open to all, whatever their religion or belief, and pilgrims can make their way, normally by foot or bicycle, at their own speed, by special routes and ways from all over Scotland to St Andrews. There they can wander around the massive ruins and imagine what it must have been like in its bustling heyday before going off for a round of golf, a swim in the sea, or to sit in the local pubs, chatting to the university students in their red gowns, and enjoying beer and seafood.\n\nThe pilgrimage is \"volunteer-based\" and has received much support from the students of the [[University of Edinburgh]] who have helped with website design, social media and route research. A competition for a badge for the pilgrimage was launched. Contributions were placed on the website and the current favourite is a [[Scallop|scallop shell]] on a background of the Scottish flag designed by a student from [[Romania]].

Scotland offers great scenic diversity in a small area, and pilgrims can take their choice of routes, coastal, hillside or quiet roads through rural communities.

Its primary function is to develop a single worldwide program of conformity assessment which reduces [[Business risks|risk for business]] and its [[Customer|customers]] by assuring them that accredited [[wikt:certificate|certificate]]s may be relied upon.\n\nIAF members accredit certification or registration bodies that issue certificates attesting that an organization's management, products or personnel comply with a specified [[wikt:standard|standard]].\n\nAccreditation is an essential ingredient for competitiveness, access to new markets, productivity improvement, innovation of new products and environmental protection, as well as the health and safety of populations. An efficient and effective quality and standards infrastructure, underpinned by accreditation, is key to a country\u2019s growth, as well as being essential in creating a safer, cleaner, and more equitable and well-integrated world.\nAccreditation provides confidence in the quality, safety, and environmental credentials of goods, services, and processes. It is required for the effective operation of domestic markets, and its international recognition is important to enable access to foreign markets. Accreditation is a critical element in promoting and sustaining economic development as well as environmental and social well-being, as it provides confidence in metrology, standardization, and conformity assessment (which comprises testing, calibration, inspection, and certification).\n\nIAF has prepared an informative [http://www.compad.com.au/cms/iaf/workstation/upFiles/292851.IAF__Screen-ready_2009-02_Rev.pdf brochure] which provides general information about IAF, its activities, membership and programs.\n\n==Role of the IAF==\n\nThe primary purpose of IAF is two-fold. Firstly, to ensure that its accreditation body members only accredit bodies that are competent to do the work they undertake and are not subject to [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. The second purpose of the IAF is to establish [[Mutual recognition agreement|mutual recognition arrangements]] (MRAs), known as [[Multilateral Recognition Arrangement]]s (MLAs), between its accreditation body members which reduces risk to business and its customers by ensuring that an accredited certificate may be relied upon anywhere in the world. The MLA contributes to the freedom of world trade by eliminating technical barriers to trade. IAF works to find the most effective way of achieving a single system that will allow companies with an accredited conformity assessment certificate in one part of the world, to have that certificate recognized else where in the world. The objective of the MLA is that it will cover all accreditation bodies in all [[Country|countries]] in the world, thus eliminating the need for [[Supply chain|suppliers]] of products or services to be certified in each country where they sell their products or services.\n\nAccording to [http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/516141538488797114/Why-is-QI-important.pdf the World Bank], accreditation and the wider quality infrastructure, serve the needs of governments, businesses, and consumers. For governments, it provides a mechanism to support relevant trade and industrial policies and ensures enforcement of mandatory technical regulations.

The handloom weaving style unique to this region are famously known as Santipuri Sari (tant). After the partition of India, Bengal was split into two major regions.  West Bengal became a part of India and East Bengal became East Pakistan (Bangladesh).  Many skilled weavers from Dhaka, in current day Bangladesh, migrated into West Bengal and settled around the cities of Shantipur and Kalna (Ambika Kalna) of Bardhaman district.  Both are traditionally renowned centers for producing hand-woven fabrics sold throughout the country. Through government support for Indian handicrafts and arts, the weaving community slowly grew and thrived. Saris and finely woven feather-touch textiles are still being produced in the same traditional method today. One can find the patterns and colors found in ancient times still reflected in the garments produced in the vast textile belt of Shantipur, [[Phulia]], [[Samudragarh]], [[Dhatrigram]] and [[Kalna, India|Ambika Kalna]].  Each center produces superb fabrics in its own variation of the Shantipuri style of weaving. Shantipur is especially known for super-fine-weave dhotis and jacquards. These textiles are marketed through co-operatives and various commercial undertakings.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.indiaprofile.com/art-crafts/bengal-art.htm | title = A Traditional Panorama - Bengal Art|accessdate = 2007-09-08 | work = Arts and Crafts in India| publisher =  India Profile}}</ref>\n\n==Religious History==\nThe old and historical town Shantipur is famous for Ras Utsav and [[Holi|\"Dol utsav\"]] which is thought to have begun by Mathuresh Goswami, the great grandson of [[Advaita Acharya]] who was one of the main associates of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].\n[[File:Ras Leela of Lord Krishna.jpg|alt=Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|thumb|Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|border|right]]\nThe principle deity of the town is 'Radharaman' in the family of Baro Gosai descending from the lineage of Mathuresh Goswami. The deity was originally installed as a single statue of krishna named 'dol govinda' in Orissa by king indradyumna. When the king of [[Jessore District|Yessore]] (now in Bangladesh), [[Maharaja Pratapaditya|Pratapaditya]] attacked Orissa, the priest of the temple gave away the deity to his own guru Mathuresh Goswami to protect it in times of emergency. He brought the idol to his ancestral home in Shantipur where he reinstalled it in a new temple. A deity of [[Radha]] was later installed beside Dolgovinda and both of them renamed Radharaman.\n\n[[File:Rasyatra.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Procession showing Krishna|Rashyatra - celebrations of the loves of Krishna]]\n\nThe deity believed to be worshipped by [[Advaita Acharya]] himself is named Madan Gopal and is worshipped in the lineage of Krishna Mishra, the second son of [[Advaita Acharya]].\n\nOn the day of Rashyatra, the main festival of the town, all of them are taken out in a grand procession around the city accompanied with drums, kirtan and other celebration. Curiously, all the thrones are lit with the age-old Belgium glass candleholders and chandeliers, instead of electric lighting, even to this day. This gives Rashotsav a very ancient and historical look. On this day, as a continuation of a tradition introduced by Bara Goswamis near about 250 years ago, a young girl, called Rai-Raja (Rai is another name for Radha and Raja means king), dressed in expensive attire and gold ornaments is seated in a throne and paraded across the city to be worshipped as Radha.\n\n[[Kali Puja]] is another festival that the people of this place pays a lot of dedication .\n\nThere is a unique form of celebrating Kali worship in the form of hand painted image of the deity known as \"Pateshwari\" meaning drawing of the deity on a piece of cloth.

The handloom weaving style unique to this region are famously known as Santipuri Sari (tant). After the partition of India, Bengal was split into two major regions.  West Bengal became a part of India and East Bengal became East Pakistan (Bangladesh).  Many skilled weavers from Dhaka, in current day Bangladesh, migrated into West Bengal and settled around the cities of Shantipur and Kalna (Ambika Kalna) of Bardhaman district.  Both are traditionally renowned centers for producing hand-woven fabrics sold throughout the country. Through government support for Indian handicrafts and arts, the weaving community slowly grew and thrived. Saris and finely woven feather-touch textiles are still being produced in the same traditional method today. One can find the patterns and colors found in ancient times still reflected in the garments produced in the vast textile belt of Shantipur, [[Phulia]], [[Samudragarh]], [[Dhatrigram]] and [[Kalna, India|Ambika Kalna]].  Each center produces superb fabrics in its own variation of the Shantipuri style of weaving. Shantipur is especially known for super-fine-weave dhotis and jacquards. These textiles are marketed through co-operatives and various commercial undertakings.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.indiaprofile.com/art-crafts/bengal-art.htm | title = A Traditional Panorama - Bengal Art|accessdate = 2007-09-08 | work = Arts and Crafts in India| publisher =  India Profile}}</ref>\n\n==Religious History==\nThe old and historical town Shantipur is famous for Ras Utsav and [[Holi|\"Dol utsav\"]] which is thought to have begun by Mathuresh Goswami, the great grandson of [[Advaita Acharya]] who was one of the main associates of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].\n[[File:Ras Leela of Lord Krishna.jpg|alt=Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|thumb|Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|border|right]]\nThe principle deity of the town is 'Radharaman' in the family of Baro Gosai descending from the lineage of Mathuresh Goswami. The deity was originally installed as a single statue of krishna named 'dol govinda' in Orissa by king indradyumna. When the king of [[Jessore District|Yessore]] (now in Bangladesh), [[Maharaja Pratapaditya|Pratapaditya]] attacked Orissa, the priest of the temple gave away the deity to his own guru Mathuresh Goswami to protect it in times of emergency. He brought the idol to his ancestral home in Shantipur where he reinstalled it in a new temple. A deity of [[Radha]] was later installed beside Dolgovinda and both of them renamed Radharaman.\n\n[[File:Rasyatra.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Procession showing Krishna|Rashyatra - celebrations of the loves of Krishna]]\n\nThe deity believed to be worshipped by [[Advaita Acharya]] himself is named Madan Gopal and is worshipped in the lineage of Krishna Mishra, the second son of [[Advaita Acharya]].\n\nOn the day of Rashyatra, the main festival of the town, all of them are taken out in a grand procession around the city accompanied with drums, kirtan and other celebration. Curiously, all the thrones are lit with the age-old Belgium glass candleholders and chandeliers, instead of electric lighting, even to this day. This gives Rashotsav a very ancient and historical look. On this day, as a continuation of a tradition introduced by Bara Goswamis near about 250 years ago, a young girl, called Rai-Raja (Rai is another name for Radha and Raja means king), dressed in expensive attire and gold ornaments is seated in a throne and paraded across the city to be worshipped as Radha.\n\n[[Kali Puja]] is another festival that the people of this place pays a lot of dedication .\n\nThere is a unique form of celebrating Kali worship in the form of hand painted image of the deity known as \"Pateshwari\" meaning drawing of the deity on a piece of cloth. The deity is worshiped for 3 days during the \"[[Rash Utsav]].\" The second day of worship is marked by the sacrifice of a goat. It is then incorporated into the many festive meals and shared with the community until the festival ends.

In her mature years, she became the central figure of a movement of spiritual and monastic renewal borne out of an inner conviction and honed by [[Asceticism|ascetic]] practice. She was also at the centre of deep ecclesiastical controversy as she took on the pervasive laxity in her order against the background of the [[Protestant reformation]] sweeping over Europe and the [[Spanish Inquisition]] asserting church discipline in her home country. The consequences were to last well beyond her life. \n\nForty years after her death in 1622, Teresa was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. At the time she was considered a candidate for [[national patron saint]] of [[Spain]], but lost out to [[St. James the Apostle]]. She has since become one of the patron saints of Spain. \n\nHer written contributions, which include her autobiography, ''The Life of Teresa of Jesus'' and her seminal work ''[[The Interior Castle]]'', are today an integral part of [[Spanish Renaissance literature]]. Together with ''The [[Way of Perfection]]'', her works form part of the [[literary canon]] of [[Christian mysticism]] and [[Christian meditation]] practice, and continue to attract interest from people both within and outside the Catholic Church. \n\nHowever, not until 27 September 1970 did [[Pope Paul VI]] proclaim Teresa the first female ''Doctor of the Church'' in recognition of her centuries-long spiritual legacy to [[Catholicism]].<ref name=\"vatican\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19700927_it.html |title=27 settembre 1970: Proclamazione di Santa Teresa d'\u00c1vila Dottore della Chiesa - Paolo VI |website=Vatican.va |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/first_female_doctor_of_the_church_to_be_honored_this_week/|title=First female Doctor of the Church to be honored this week|website=Catholic News Agency}}</ref>\n\nOther associations with Teresa beyond her writings continue to exert a wide influence. A ''[[Santo (art)|Santero]]'' image of the [[Immaculate Conception of El Viejo]], said to have been sent by her with a brother emigrating to [[Peru]], was [[canonically crowned]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on December 28, 1989 at the [[Patronages of the Immaculate Conception#Nicaragua|Shrine of El Viejo]] in [[Nicaragua]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corazones.org/maria/america/nica_inmaculada_viejo.htm |title=Inmaculada del Viejo |work=Corazones.org |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref> Another Catholic tradition holds that Saint Teresa is personally associated with devotion to the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]], a statue she may have owned.<ref>Jansen, G., ''Life Everlasting: Catholic Devotions and Mysteries for the Everyday Seeker'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[TarcherPerigee]], 2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dI0oDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA248 p. 248].</ref>{{rp|248}} Since her death, her reputation has grown, leading to multiple portrayals. She continues to be widely noted as an inspiration to philosophers, theologians, historians, neurologists, fiction writers and artists, as well as to countless ordinary people interested in [[Christian spirituality]] and [[mysticism]]. \n\nSpeaking to pilgrims from Avila in October 1981, [[Pope John Paul II]] said: \"It is necessary for the rich legacy left by Teresa of Jesus to be deeply reconsidered so that it can effect a renewal of the inner life of your nation and thereby influence the renewal of life in the entire church in all its aspects. The giant figure of the Great Teresa should act as a strong encouragement in that direction not only on a local or national scale but also on a universal scale\".<ref>[[Pope John Paul II]] addressing pilgrims from Avila at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] on 8 October 1981.</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book|title=Teresa of Avila|series=Continuum Compact Series Outstanding Christian Thinkers|author=Rowan Williams|edition=reprint|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|date= 2004|isbn= 9780826473417|url=https://books.google.co.uk/booksid=mte4aBUVFiAC&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=230|access-date=2019-04-14|author-link=Rowan Williams}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Schillinger Liesl|title=The Original Flying Nun - Review of Cathleen Medwick's Teresa of Avila: The Progress of a Soul.

Her paternal grandfather, [[Juan S\u00e1nchez de Toledo]], was a [[marrano]] or [[Converso]], a Jew forced to convert to Christianity or emigrate. When Teresa's father was a child, Juan was condemned by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] for allegedly returning to the [[Jewish faith]], but he was later able to assume a Catholic identity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osservatoreromano.va/en/news/teresas-marrano-grandfather |title=Teresa's 'marrano' grandfather |last=Foa |first=Anna |date=March 2, 2015 |website=Osservatore Romano |access-date=}}</ref> Her father, [[:es:Alonso S\u00e1nchez de Cepeda|Alonso S\u00e1nchez de Cepeda]], was a successful wool merchant and one of the wealthiest men in \u00c1vila.

Teresa was fascinated by accounts of the lives of the saints and ran away from home at age seven with her brother Rodrigo to find [[martyrdom]] among [[the Moors]]. Her uncle stopped them on the road as he was returning to the town, having spotted them outside the town walls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/medwick-teresa.html|title=Teresa of Avila|website=archive.nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nWhen Teresa was eleven years old, her mother died, leaving her grief-stricken. This prompted her to embrace a deeper devotion to the [[Virgin Mary]] as her spiritual mother. Teresa was also enamored of popular fiction, which at the time was primarily medieval tales of [[knighthood]] and works about fashion, gardens and flowers.<ref name=\"St. Teresa's autobiography in the Gutenberg Project\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=David |title=The Life of St. Teresa of Jesus |date=27 September 1904 |publisher=Gutenberg/Thomas Baker |location=London |edition=3 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8120/8120-h/8120-h.htm#l1.0 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=625 |title=ST.

In 1536, aged 20,<ref name=SHMI>{{cite book|author=Fr. Paolo O. Pirlo, SHMI|year=1997|title=My First Book of Saints|chapter=St. Teresa of Avila|publisher=Sons of Holy Mary Immaculate - Quality Catholic Publications|page=241|isbn=971-91595-4-5}}</ref> much to the disappointment of her pious and austere father, she decided to enter the local easy-going Carmelite ''Convent of the Incarnation'', significantly built on top of land that had been used previously as a burial ground for Jews. She took up religious reading on contemplative prayer, especially [[Francisco de Osuna|Osuna]]\u2019s ''Third Spiritual Alphabet'' (1527). Her zeal for mortification caused her to become ill again and she spent almost a year in bed, causing huge worry to her community and family. She nearly died but she recovered, attributing her recovery to the miraculous intercession of St. Joseph. She began to experience instances of [[religious ecstasy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen Clissold|title=St. Teresa of Avila|place=London|publisher=Sheldon|date=1982|edition=2}}</ref>\n\n===Foundations of spirituality===\nHer reading of medieval mystics, consisted of directions for examinations of conscience and for spiritual self-concentration and inner contemplation known in mystical nomenclature as ''oratio recollectionis'' or ''oratio mentalis''. She also dipped into other mystical [[ascetic]] works such as the ''Tractatus de oratione et meditatione'' of [[Peter of Alcantara]], and perhaps some upon which [[Ignatius of Loyola]] based his ''[[Spiritual Exercises]]''\u2014possibly the ''Spiritual Exercises'' themselves.\n\nShe reported that, during her illness, she had risen from the lowest stage, \"recollection\", to the \"devotions of silence\" or even to the \"devotions of ecstasy\", which was one of perfect union with God (see {{slink||Mysticism}}). During this final stage, she said she frequently experienced a rich \"blessing of tears\". As the Catholic distinction between [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]] became clear to her, she came to understand the awful terror of sin and the inherent nature of [[original sin]]. She also became conscious of her own natural impotence in confronting sin and the necessity of absolute subjection to [[God]].\n\nAround the same time, she received a copy of the full Spanish translation of [[St. Augustine]]'s autobiographical work ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which helped her resolve and to tend to her own bouts of scruples. The text helped her realize that holiness was indeed possible and found solace in how such a great saint was once a sinner. In her Autobiography, she wrote that she 'was very fond of St. Augustine...for he was a sinner too.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Jesus |first1=Teresa |title=The Autobiography of St. Teresa of Avila: the Life of St. Teresa of Jesus |date=1997 |publisher=Tan Books and Publishers, Inc. |isbn=9780895556035}}</ref>\n\nAround 1556, friends suggested that her newfound knowledge was diabolical, not divine. She had begun to inflict [[mortification of the flesh|mortifications of the flesh]] upon herself. But her [[confession (sacrament)|confessor]], the [[Jesuit]] [[Francis Borgia]], reassured her of the divine inspiration of her thoughts. On [[St. Peter's Day]] in 1559, Teresa became firmly convinced that Jesus Christ presented Himself to her in bodily form, though invisible. These visions lasted almost uninterrupted for more than two years. In another vision, a [[seraph]] drove the fiery point of a golden lance repeatedly through her heart, causing an ineffable spiritual and bodily pain:\n\n{{quote|I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...}}<ref>Teresa wrote that it must be a [[cherub]] (''Deben ser los que llaman cherubines'')<!--sic-->, but Fr. Domingo B\u00e1\u00f1ez wrote in the margin that it seemed more like a seraph (''mas parece de los que se llaman seraphis''),<!--sic--> an identification that most editors have followed. {{cite book |author=Santa Teresa de \u00c1vila |title=Escritos de Santa Teresa |chapter=''Libro de su vida''}}</ref>\n\nThis vision was the inspiration for one of [[Bernini]]'s most famous works, the ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' at [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] in Rome.\n\nThe memory of this episode served as an inspiration throughout the rest of her life, and motivated her lifelong imitation of the life and suffering of Jesus, epitomized in the adage often associated with her: \"Lord, either let me suffer or let me die.\"\n\n===Embarrassment of raptures===\nTeresa, who became a celebrity in her town dispensing wisdom from behind the convent grille, was also known for her raptures which sometimes involved [[levitation]]. It was a source of embarrassment to her and she bade her sisters hold her down when this occurred. Subsequently, historians and  neurologists and psychiatrists like, [[Peter Fenwick (neuropsychologist)|Peter Fenwick]] and Javier Alvarez-Rodriguez among others, have taken an interest in her symptomatology. The fact that she wrote down virtually everything that happened to her during her religious life, means that an invaluable and exceedingly rare medical record from the 16th-century has been preserved.

Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of [[cloister]], designed to protect and strengthen spiritual practice and prayer, became so lax that it appeared to lose its purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, disturbed the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vacuous conversation. Such intrusions in the solitude essential to develop and sustain contemplative prayer so grieved Teresa that she longed to intervene.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ocd.pcn.net/hista.htm#The |title=HISTORY - discalced carmelite order - Contemplative Discalced Carmelite Nuns |website=Pcn.net |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe incentive to take the practical steps inspired by her inward motivation was supported by the [[Franciscan]] priest, [[Peter of Alcantara]], who met her early in 1560 and became her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual adviser]]. She resolved to found a \"reformed\" Carmelite convent, correcting the laxity which she had found at the Incarnation convent and elsewhere besides. Guimara de Ulloa, a woman of wealth and a friend, supplied the funds for the project.\n\nThe abject poverty of the new convent, established in 1562 and named [[Convento de San Jos\u00e9 (\u00c1vila)|St. Joseph's (San Jos\u00e9)]], at first caused a scandal among the citizens and authorities of \u00c1vila, and the small house with its chapel was in peril of suppression. However, powerful patrons, including the local bishop, coupled with the impression of well ordered subsistence and purpose, turned animosity into approval.\n\nIn March 1563, after Teresa had moved to the new convent house, she received [[Papal decree|papal sanction]] for her primary principles of absolute poverty and renunciation of ownership of property, which she proceeded to formulate into a \"constitution\". Her plan was the revival of the earlier, stricter monastic rules, supplemented by new regulations including the three disciplines of ceremonial [[flagellation]] prescribed for the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] every week, and the [[discalceation]] of the religious. For the first five years, Teresa remained in seclusion, mostly engaged in prayer and writing.\n\n[[File:TeresaAvila.jpg|left|thumb|Church window at the [[Iglesia-convento de Santa Teresa|Convent of St Teresa]]]]\n\n===Extended travels===\nIn 1567, Teresa received a [[letters patent|patent]] from the Carmelite General, Rubeo de Ravenna, to establish further houses of the new [[Religious order|order]]. This process required many visitations and long journeys across nearly all the provinces of Spain. She left a record of the arduous project in her ''Libro de las Fundaciones''. Between 1567 and 1571, reformed convents were established at [[Medina del Campo]], [[Malag\u00f3n]], [[Valladolid]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Pastrana, Spain|Pastrana]], [[Salamanca]], and [[Alba de Tormes]].\n\nAs part of the original patent, Teresa was given permission to set up two houses for [[Friar|men]] who wished to adopt the reforms. She convinced two Carmelite friars, [[John of the Cross]] and Father Anthony of Jesus to help with this. They founded the first monastery of Discalced Carmelite brothers in November 1568 at [[Duruelo]]. Another friend of Teresa, [[Jer\u00f3nimo Graci\u00e1n]], the [[Carmelite visitator]] of the older observance of [[Andalusia]] and apostolic commissioner, and later [[Provincial superior|provincial]] of the Teresian order, gave her powerful support in founding monasteries at [[Segovia]] (1571), [[Beas de Segura]] (1574), [[Seville]] (1575), and [[Caravaca de la Cruz]] ([[Murcia]], 1576). Meanwhile, John of the Cross promoted the inner life of the movement through his power as a teacher and preacher.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kavanaugh|first=Kieran|title=The Collected Works of St John of the Cross|year=1991|publisher=ICS Publications|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-935216-14-1|chapter=General Introduction: Biographical Sketch|pages=9\u201327|editor=Kieran Kavanaugh}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to reforms===\nIn 1576, unreformed members of the Carmelite order began to persecute Teresa, her supporters and her reforms. Following a number of resolutions adopted at the [[general chapter]] at [[Piacenza]], the governing body of the order forbade all further founding of reformed convents. The general chapter instructed her to go into \"voluntary\" retirement at one of her institutions.{{r|Kavanaugh}} She obeyed and chose St. Joseph's at Toledo.

As a result, in 1579, the cases before the [[inquisition]] against her, Father Gracian and others, were dropped.<ref name=Kavanaugh/> This allowed the reform to resume. An edict from [[Pope Gregory XIII]] allowed the appointment of a special provincial for the newer branch of the Carmelite religious, and a royal decree created a \"protective\" board of four assessors for the reform.{{r|Kavanaugh}}\n\nDuring the last three years of her life, Teresa founded convents at [[Villanueva de la Jara]] in northern [[Andalusia]] (1580), [[Palencia]] (1580), [[Soria]] (1581), [[Burgos]], and [[Granada]] (1582). In total, seventeen convents, all but one founded by her, and as many men's monasteries were owed to her reforms over twenty years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdsoar.org/bitstream/handle/11603/3898/Final%20Draft.pdf |title=The Compassionate Mother of Carmel: Teresa of Avila and the Carmelite Model for Twenty-First-Century Seekers |last=Salamony |first=Ryan |date=2017 |website=Goucher College Repository}}</ref>\n\n==Last days==\nHer final illness overtook her on one of her journeys from Burgos to Alba de Tormes. She died in 1582, just as [[Catholic Europe]] was making the switch from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]], which required the excision of the dates of 5\u201314 October from the calendar. She died either before midnight of 4 October or early in the morning of 15 October which is celebrated as her feast day. According to the liturgical calendar then in use, she died on the 15th in any case. Her last words were: \"My Lord, it is time to move on. Well then, may your will be done.

Nine months after her death the coffin was opened and her body was found to be [[Incorruptibility|intact]] but the clothing had rotted. Before the body was re-interred one of her hands was cut off, wrapped in a scarf and sent to \u00c1vila. Father Graci\u00e1n cut the little finger off the hand and - according to his own account - kept it with him until it was taken by the occupying [[Ottoman Turk]]s, from whom he had to redeem it with a few rings and 20 reales. The body was exhumed again on 25 November 1585 to be moved to \u00c1vila and found to be incorrupt. An arm was removed and left in Alba de Tormes at the nuns' request, to compensate for losing the main relic of Teresa, but the rest of the body was reburied in the Discalced Carmelite chapter house in \u00c1vila. The removal was done without the approval of the Duke of Alba de Tormes and he brought the body back in 1586, with [[Pope Sixtus V]] ordering that it remain in Alba de Tormes on pain of excommunication. A grander tomb on the original site was raised in 1598 and the body was moved to a new chapel in 1616.\n\nThe body still remains there, apart from the following parts:\n* Rome - right foot and part of the upper jaw\n* [[Lisbon]] - left hand\n* [[Ronda]], Spain - left eye and right hand (the latter was kept by [[Francisco Franco]] until his death after Francoist troops captured it from Republican troops during the [[Spanish Civil War]])\n* Museum of the Church of the Annunciation, Alba de Tormes - left arm and heart\n* Church of Our Lady of Loreto, [[Paris]], France - one finger\n* [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]] - one finger\n\n[[File:Ecstasy of Saint Teresa September 2015-2a.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' by [[Bernini]], Basilica of [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome]]|alt=|left|353x353px]]\n\n==Canonization==\nIn 1622, forty years after her death, she was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. The [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] exalted her to [[patron saint|patroness]] of Spain in 1627. The [[University of Salamanca]] had granted her the title ''[[Doctor ecclesiae]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"Doctor of the Church\") with a diploma in her lifetime but that title is distinct from the papal honour of [[Doctor of the Church]], which is always conferred posthumously. The latter was finally bestowed upon her by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 27 September 1970,<ref name=vatican/> along with [[Saint Catherine of Siena]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19701003.html |title=3 ottobre 1970: Proclamazione di Santa Caterina da Siena Dottore della Chiesa - Paolo VI |website=w2.vatican.va |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref> making them the first women to be awarded the distinction. Teresa is revered as the Doctor of Prayer. The mysticism in her works exerted a formative influence upon many theologians of the following centuries, such as [[Francis of Sales]], [[F\u00e9nelon]], and the [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royalists]]. In 1670 her coffin was plated in silver.\n\n[[File:Palau de Mafra - Est\u00e0tua - 1.jpg|thumb|Statue of Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila in [[Mafra National Palace]], [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]]]]\n\n==Mysticism==\nThe ultimate preoccupation of Teresa's mystical thought, as consistently reflected in her writings, is the ascent of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to God in four stages (see: ''The Autobiography'' Chs. 10-22):\n\n* The first, ''Devotion of the Heart'', consists of [[mental prayer]] and [[Contemplation (Christianity)|contemplation]]. It means the withdrawal of the soul from without, [[penitence]] and especially the devout [[Meditations on the Life of Christ|meditation]] on the passion of Christ (''Autobiography'' 11.20).\n\n* The second, ''Devotion of Peace'', is where human will is surrendered to God. This occurs by virtue of an uplifted awareness granted by God, while other faculties, such as memory, reason, and imagination, are not yet safe from worldly distraction. Although a partial distraction can happen, due to outer activity such as repetition of prayers or writing down spiritual things, the prevailing state is one of quietude (''Autobiography'' 14.1).\n\n* The third, ''Devotion of Union'', concerns the absorption-in-God. It is not only a heightened, but essentially, an [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] state. At this level, reason is also surrendered to God, and only the memory and imagination are left to ramble. This state is characterized by a blissful peace, a sweet slumber of at least the ''higher soul faculties'', that is a consciousness of being enraptured by the love of God.\n\n* The fourth, ''Devotion of Ecstasy'', is where the consciousness of being in the body disappears. Sensory faculties cease to operate. Memory and imagination also become absorbed in God, as though intoxicated. Body and spirit dwell in the throes of exquisite pain, alternating between a fearful fiery glow, in complete unconscious helplessness, and periods of apparent strangulation. Sometimes such ecstatic transports literally cause the body to be lifted into space.<ref name=\"Clissold\">{{cite book|author=Clissold Stephen|title=St Teresa of Avila|publisher=Sheldon Press|place=London|date=1982|pages=63\u201364|isbn = 0-85969-347-3}}</ref> This state may last as long as half an hour and tends to be followed by relaxation of a few hours of swoon-like weakness, attended by the absence of all faculties while in union with God. The subject awakens from this trance state in tears. it may be regarded as the culmination of mystical experience. Indeed, Teresa was said to have been observed [[levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on more than one occasion.{{r|Clissold}}\n\nTeresa is regarded as one of the foremost writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology as unique. Her writings on this theme, stem from her personal experiences, thereby manifesting considerable insight and analytical gifts. Her definitions have been used in the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. Teresa states: \"Contemplative prayer (''oraci\u00f3n mental)'', in my opinion is nothing other than a close sharing between friends. It means frequently taking time to be alone with Him whom we know loves us.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |date=1997 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm#2709}}</ref> Throughout her writings, Teresa returns to the image of watering one's garden as a metaphor for mystical prayer.\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Teresa de Jes\u00fas.jpg|thumb|upright|This is the one portrait of Teresa that is probably the most true to her appearance.

In her mature years, she became the central figure of a movement of spiritual and monastic renewal borne out of an inner conviction and honed by [[Asceticism|ascetic]] practice. She was also at the centre of deep ecclesiastical controversy as she took on the pervasive laxity in her order against the background of the [[Protestant reformation]] sweeping over Europe and the [[Spanish Inquisition]] asserting church discipline in her home country. The consequences were to last well beyond her life. \n\nForty years after her death in 1622, Teresa was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. At the time she was considered a candidate for [[national patron saint]] of [[Spain]], but lost out to [[St. James the Apostle]]. She has since become one of the patron saints of Spain. \n\nHer written contributions, which include her autobiography, ''The Life of Teresa of Jesus'' and her seminal work ''[[The Interior Castle]]'', are today an integral part of [[Spanish Renaissance literature]]. Together with ''The [[Way of Perfection]]'', her works form part of the [[literary canon]] of [[Christian mysticism]] and [[Christian meditation]] practice, and continue to attract interest from people both within and outside the Catholic Church. \n\nHowever, not until 27 September 1970 did [[Pope Paul VI]] proclaim Teresa the first female ''Doctor of the Church'' in recognition of her centuries-long spiritual legacy to [[Catholicism]].<ref name=\"vatican\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19700927_it.html |title=27 settembre 1970: Proclamazione di Santa Teresa d'\u00c1vila Dottore della Chiesa - Paolo VI |website=Vatican.va |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/first_female_doctor_of_the_church_to_be_honored_this_week/|title=First female Doctor of the Church to be honored this week|website=Catholic News Agency}}</ref>\n\nOther associations with Teresa beyond her writings continue to exert a wide influence. A ''[[Santo (art)|Santero]]'' image of the [[Immaculate Conception of El Viejo]], said to have been sent by her with a brother emigrating to [[Peru]], was [[canonically crowned]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on December 28, 1989 at the [[Patronages of the Immaculate Conception#Nicaragua|Shrine of El Viejo]] in [[Nicaragua]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corazones.org/maria/america/nica_inmaculada_viejo.htm |title=Inmaculada del Viejo |work=Corazones.org |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref> Another Catholic tradition holds that Saint Teresa is personally associated with devotion to the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]], a statue she may have owned.<ref>Jansen, G., ''Life Everlasting: Catholic Devotions and Mysteries for the Everyday Seeker'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[TarcherPerigee]], 2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dI0oDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA248 p. 248].</ref>{{rp|248}} Since her death, her reputation has grown, leading to multiple portrayals.

In 1536, aged 20,<ref name=SHMI>{{cite book|author=Fr. Paolo O.

She took up religious reading on contemplative prayer, especially [[Francisco de Osuna|Osuna]]\u2019s ''Third Spiritual Alphabet'' (1527). Her zeal for mortification caused her to become ill again and she spent almost a year in bed, causing huge worry to her community and family. She nearly died but she recovered, attributing her recovery to the miraculous intercession of St. Joseph. She began to experience instances of [[religious ecstasy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen Clissold|title=St. Teresa of Avila|place=London|publisher=Sheldon|date=1982|edition=2}}</ref>\n\n===Foundations of spirituality===\nHer reading of medieval mystics, consisted of directions for examinations of conscience and for spiritual self-concentration and inner contemplation known in mystical nomenclature as ''oratio recollectionis'' or ''oratio mentalis''. She also dipped into other mystical [[ascetic]] works such as the ''Tractatus de oratione et meditatione'' of [[Peter of Alcantara]], and perhaps some upon which [[Ignatius of Loyola]] based his ''[[Spiritual Exercises]]''\u2014possibly the ''Spiritual Exercises'' themselves.\n\nShe reported that, during her illness, she had risen from the lowest stage, \"recollection\", to the \"devotions of silence\" or even to the \"devotions of ecstasy\", which was one of perfect union with God (see {{slink||Mysticism}}). During this final stage, she said she frequently experienced a rich \"blessing of tears\". As the Catholic distinction between [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]] became clear to her, she came to understand the awful terror of sin and the inherent nature of [[original sin]]. She also became conscious of her own natural impotence in confronting sin and the necessity of absolute subjection to [[God]].\n\nAround the same time, she received a copy of the full Spanish translation of [[St. Augustine]]'s autobiographical work ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which helped her resolve and to tend to her own bouts of scruples. The text helped her realize that holiness was indeed possible and found solace in how such a great saint was once a sinner. In her Autobiography, she wrote that she 'was very fond of St. Augustine...for he was a sinner too.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Jesus |first1=Teresa |title=The Autobiography of St. Teresa of Avila: the Life of St. Teresa of Jesus |date=1997 |publisher=Tan Books and Publishers, Inc. |isbn=9780895556035}}</ref>\n\nAround 1556, friends suggested that her newfound knowledge was diabolical, not divine. She had begun to inflict [[mortification of the flesh|mortifications of the flesh]] upon herself. But her [[confession (sacrament)|confessor]], the [[Jesuit]] [[Francis Borgia]], reassured her of the divine inspiration of her thoughts. On [[St. Peter's Day]] in 1559, Teresa became firmly convinced that Jesus Christ presented Himself to her in bodily form, though invisible. These visions lasted almost uninterrupted for more than two years. In another vision, a [[seraph]] drove the fiery point of a golden lance repeatedly through her heart, causing an ineffable spiritual and bodily pain:\n\n{{quote|I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...}}<ref>Teresa wrote that it must be a [[cherub]] (''Deben ser los que llaman cherubines'')<!--sic-->, but Fr. Domingo B\u00e1\u00f1ez wrote in the margin that it seemed more like a seraph (''mas parece de los que se llaman seraphis''),<!--sic--> an identification that most editors have followed. {{cite book |author=Santa Teresa de \u00c1vila |title=Escritos de Santa Teresa |chapter=''Libro de su vida''}}</ref>\n\nThis vision was the inspiration for one of [[Bernini]]'s most famous works, the ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' at [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] in Rome.\n\nThe memory of this episode served as an inspiration throughout the rest of her life, and motivated her lifelong imitation of the life and suffering of Jesus, epitomized in the adage often associated with her: \"Lord, either let me suffer or let me die.\"\n\n===Embarrassment of raptures===\nTeresa, who became a celebrity in her town dispensing wisdom from behind the convent grille, was also known for her raptures which sometimes involved [[levitation]]. It was a source of embarrassment to her and she bade her sisters hold her down when this occurred. Subsequently, historians and  neurologists and psychiatrists like, [[Peter Fenwick (neuropsychologist)|Peter Fenwick]] and Javier Alvarez-Rodriguez among others, have taken an interest in her symptomatology. The fact that she wrote down virtually everything that happened to her during her religious life, means that an invaluable and exceedingly rare medical record from the 16th-century has been preserved. Examination of this record has led to the speculative conclusion that she may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]].<ref>Marcella Biro Barton (1982), \u201cSaint Teresa of Avila: Did she have Epilepsy?\u201d, ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]''.

Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of [[cloister]], designed to protect and strengthen spiritual practice and prayer, became so lax that it appeared to lose its purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, disturbed the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vacuous conversation. Such intrusions in the solitude essential to develop and sustain contemplative prayer so grieved Teresa that she longed to intervene.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ocd.pcn.net/hista.htm#The |title=HISTORY - discalced carmelite order - Contemplative Discalced Carmelite Nuns |website=Pcn.net |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe incentive to take the practical steps inspired by her inward motivation was supported by the [[Franciscan]] priest, [[Peter of Alcantara]], who met her early in 1560 and became her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual adviser]]. She resolved to found a \"reformed\" Carmelite convent, correcting the laxity which she had found at the Incarnation convent and elsewhere besides. Guimara de Ulloa, a woman of wealth and a friend, supplied the funds for the project.\n\nThe abject poverty of the new convent, established in 1562 and named [[Convento de San Jos\u00e9 (\u00c1vila)|St. Joseph's (San Jos\u00e9)]], at first caused a scandal among the citizens and authorities of \u00c1vila, and the small house with its chapel was in peril of suppression. However, powerful patrons, including the local bishop, coupled with the impression of well ordered subsistence and purpose, turned animosity into approval.\n\nIn March 1563, after Teresa had moved to the new convent house, she received [[Papal decree|papal sanction]] for her primary principles of absolute poverty and renunciation of ownership of property, which she proceeded to formulate into a \"constitution\". Her plan was the revival of the earlier, stricter monastic rules, supplemented by new regulations including the three disciplines of ceremonial [[flagellation]] prescribed for the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] every week, and the [[discalceation]] of the religious. For the first five years, Teresa remained in seclusion, mostly engaged in prayer and writing.\n\n[[File:TeresaAvila.jpg|left|thumb|Church window at the [[Iglesia-convento de Santa Teresa|Convent of St Teresa]]]]\n\n===Extended travels===\nIn 1567, Teresa received a [[letters patent|patent]] from the Carmelite General, Rubeo de Ravenna, to establish further houses of the new [[Religious order|order]]. This process required many visitations and long journeys across nearly all the provinces of Spain. She left a record of the arduous project in her ''Libro de las Fundaciones''. Between 1567 and 1571, reformed convents were established at [[Medina del Campo]], [[Malag\u00f3n]], [[Valladolid]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Pastrana, Spain|Pastrana]], [[Salamanca]], and [[Alba de Tormes]].\n\nAs part of the original patent, Teresa was given permission to set up two houses for [[Friar|men]] who wished to adopt the reforms. She convinced two Carmelite friars, [[John of the Cross]] and Father Anthony of Jesus to help with this. They founded the first monastery of Discalced Carmelite brothers in November 1568 at [[Duruelo]]. Another friend of Teresa, [[Jer\u00f3nimo Graci\u00e1n]], the [[Carmelite visitator]] of the older observance of [[Andalusia]] and apostolic commissioner, and later [[Provincial superior|provincial]] of the Teresian order, gave her powerful support in founding monasteries at [[Segovia]] (1571), [[Beas de Segura]] (1574), [[Seville]] (1575), and [[Caravaca de la Cruz]] ([[Murcia]], 1576). Meanwhile, John of the Cross promoted the inner life of the movement through his power as a teacher and preacher.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kavanaugh|first=Kieran|title=The Collected Works of St John of the Cross|year=1991|publisher=ICS Publications|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-935216-14-1|chapter=General Introduction: Biographical Sketch|pages=9\u201327|editor=Kieran Kavanaugh}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to reforms===\nIn 1576, unreformed members of the Carmelite order began to persecute Teresa, her supporters and her reforms. Following a number of resolutions adopted at the [[general chapter]] at [[Piacenza]], the governing body of the order forbade all further founding of reformed convents. The general chapter instructed her to go into \"voluntary\" retirement at one of her institutions.{{r|Kavanaugh}} She obeyed and chose St. Joseph's at Toledo. Meanwhile, her friends and associates were subjected to further attacks.<ref name=Kavanaugh>{{cite book |last=Kavanaugh |first=Kieran |title=The Collected Works of St John of the Cross |year=1991 |publisher=ICS Publications |location=Washington |isbn=978-0-935216-14-1 |chapter=General Introduction: Biographical Sketch |pages=9\u201327 |editor=Kieran Kavanaugh}}</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, her appeals by letter to King [[Philip II of Spain]] secured relief. As a result, in 1579, the cases before the [[inquisition]] against her, Father Gracian and others, were dropped.<ref name=Kavanaugh/> This allowed the reform to resume. An edict from [[Pope Gregory XIII]] allowed the appointment of a special provincial for the newer branch of the Carmelite religious, and a royal decree created a \"protective\" board of four assessors for the reform.{{r|Kavanaugh}}\n\nDuring the last three years of her life, Teresa founded convents at [[Villanueva de la Jara]] in northern [[Andalusia]] (1580), [[Palencia]] (1580), [[Soria]] (1581), [[Burgos]], and [[Granada]] (1582). In total, seventeen convents, all but one founded by her, and as many men's monasteries were owed to her reforms over twenty years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdsoar.org/bitstream/handle/11603/3898/Final%20Draft.pdf |title=The Compassionate Mother of Carmel: Teresa of Avila and the Carmelite Model for Twenty-First-Century Seekers |last=Salamony |first=Ryan |date=2017 |website=Goucher College Repository}}</ref>\n\n==Last days==\nHer final illness overtook her on one of her journeys from Burgos to Alba de Tormes. She died in 1582, just as [[Catholic Europe]] was making the switch from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]], which required the excision of the dates of 5\u201314 October from the calendar. She died either before midnight of 4 October or early in the morning of 15 October which is celebrated as her feast day. According to the liturgical calendar then in use, she died on the 15th in any case. Her last words were: \"My Lord, it is time to move on. Well then, may your will be done.

Nine months after her death the coffin was opened and her body was found to be [[Incorruptibility|intact]] but the clothing had rotted. Before the body was re-interred one of her hands was cut off, wrapped in a scarf and sent to \u00c1vila. Father Graci\u00e1n cut the little finger off the hand and - according to his own account - kept it with him until it was taken by the occupying [[Ottoman Turk]]s, from whom he had to redeem it with a few rings and 20 reales. The body was exhumed again on 25 November 1585 to be moved to \u00c1vila and found to be incorrupt. An arm was removed and left in Alba de Tormes at the nuns' request, to compensate for losing the main relic of Teresa, but the rest of the body was reburied in the Discalced Carmelite chapter house in \u00c1vila. The removal was done without the approval of the Duke of Alba de Tormes and he brought the body back in 1586, with [[Pope Sixtus V]] ordering that it remain in Alba de Tormes on pain of excommunication. A grander tomb on the original site was raised in 1598 and the body was moved to a new chapel in 1616.\n\nThe body still remains there, apart from the following parts:\n* Rome - right foot and part of the upper jaw\n* [[Lisbon]] - left hand\n* [[Ronda]], Spain - left eye and right hand (the latter was kept by [[Francisco Franco]] until his death after Francoist troops captured it from Republican troops during the [[Spanish Civil War]])\n* Museum of the Church of the Annunciation, Alba de Tormes - left arm and heart\n* Church of Our Lady of Loreto, [[Paris]], France - one finger\n* [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]] - one finger\n\n[[File:Ecstasy of Saint Teresa September 2015-2a.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' by [[Bernini]], Basilica of [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome]]|alt=|left|353x353px]]\n\n==Canonization==\nIn 1622, forty years after her death, she was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. The [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] exalted her to [[patron saint|patroness]] of Spain in 1627. The [[University of Salamanca]] had granted her the title ''[[Doctor ecclesiae]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"Doctor of the Church\") with a diploma in her lifetime but that title is distinct from the papal honour of [[Doctor of the Church]], which is always conferred posthumously. The latter was finally bestowed upon her by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 27 September 1970,<ref name=vatican/> along with [[Saint Catherine of Siena]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19701003.html |title=3 ottobre 1970: Proclamazione di Santa Caterina da Siena Dottore della Chiesa - Paolo VI |website=w2.vatican.va |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref> making them the first women to be awarded the distinction. Teresa is revered as the Doctor of Prayer. The mysticism in her works exerted a formative influence upon many theologians of the following centuries, such as [[Francis of Sales]], [[F\u00e9nelon]], and the [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royalists]]. In 1670 her coffin was plated in silver.\n\n[[File:Palau de Mafra - Est\u00e0tua - 1.jpg|thumb|Statue of Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila in [[Mafra National Palace]], [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]]]]\n\n==Mysticism==\nThe ultimate preoccupation of Teresa's mystical thought, as consistently reflected in her writings, is the ascent of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to God in four stages (see: ''The Autobiography'' Chs. 10-22):\n\n* The first, ''Devotion of the Heart'', consists of [[mental prayer]] and [[Contemplation (Christianity)|contemplation]]. It means the withdrawal of the soul from without, [[penitence]] and especially the devout [[Meditations on the Life of Christ|meditation]] on the passion of Christ (''Autobiography'' 11.20).\n\n* The second, ''Devotion of Peace'', is where human will is surrendered to God. This occurs by virtue of an uplifted awareness granted by God, while other faculties, such as memory, reason, and imagination, are not yet safe from worldly distraction. Although a partial distraction can happen, due to outer activity such as repetition of prayers or writing down spiritual things, the prevailing state is one of quietude (''Autobiography'' 14.1).\n\n* The third, ''Devotion of Union'', concerns the absorption-in-God. It is not only a heightened, but essentially, an [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] state. At this level, reason is also surrendered to God, and only the memory and imagination are left to ramble. This state is characterized by a blissful peace, a sweet slumber of at least the ''higher soul faculties'', that is a consciousness of being enraptured by the love of God.\n\n* The fourth, ''Devotion of Ecstasy'', is where the consciousness of being in the body disappears. Sensory faculties cease to operate. Memory and imagination also become absorbed in God, as though intoxicated. Body and spirit dwell in the throes of exquisite pain, alternating between a fearful fiery glow, in complete unconscious helplessness, and periods of apparent strangulation. Sometimes such ecstatic transports literally cause the body to be lifted into space.<ref name=\"Clissold\">{{cite book|author=Clissold Stephen|title=St Teresa of Avila|publisher=Sheldon Press|place=London|date=1982|pages=63\u201364|isbn = 0-85969-347-3}}</ref> This state may last as long as half an hour and tends to be followed by relaxation of a few hours of swoon-like weakness, attended by the absence of all faculties while in union with God. The subject awakens from this trance state in tears. it may be regarded as the culmination of mystical experience. Indeed, Teresa was said to have been observed [[levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on more than one occasion.{{r|Clissold}}\n\nTeresa is regarded as one of the foremost writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology as unique. Her writings on this theme, stem from her personal experiences, thereby manifesting considerable insight and analytical gifts. Her definitions have been used in the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. Teresa states: \"Contemplative prayer (''oraci\u00f3n mental)'', in my opinion is nothing other than a close sharing between friends. It means frequently taking time to be alone with Him whom we know loves us.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |date=1997 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm#2709}}</ref> Throughout her writings, Teresa returns to the image of watering one's garden as a metaphor for mystical prayer.\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Teresa de Jes\u00fas.jpg|thumb|upright|This is the one portrait of Teresa that is probably the most true to her appearance.
