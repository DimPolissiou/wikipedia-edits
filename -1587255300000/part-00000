From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Byblos- Jbeil.jpg|alt=|thumb|A restaurant in the historic quarter and souks of [[Byblos]] (also called Jbeil)]]\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the [[Beqaa Valley]] for its meat pastries (such as [[sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida ([[Sidon]]) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food.

Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Babylonian]], [[Phoenicia under Assyrian rule|Assyrian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDnQwCJXUowC|title=Lebanon a country study|date=1989|language=en}}</ref> More recently, Lebanese cuisine was influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Byblos- Jbeil.jpg|alt=|thumb|A restaurant in the historic quarter and souks of [[Byblos]] (also called Jbeil)]]\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the [[Beqaa Valley]] for its meat pastries (such as [[sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida ([[Sidon]]) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the [[tapas]] of [[Spain]], ''mezeluri'' of [[Romania]] and aperitivo of [[Italy]], ''[[mezze]]'' is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsNyprRS7EIC&pg=PA268|title=The Meal: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 2001|date=2002|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-24-8|page=268}}</ref><ref name=\"Cavendish\">{{Cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Marshall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA979|title=World and Its Peoples|date=September 2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=979}}</ref> This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s.

The assortments of dishes forming the mezze are generally consumed in small bites using a piece of Lebanese bread ([[khubz]], [[pita]]) or a fork.<ref name=\"Cavendish\" /> As a family, it is made up of three or four dishes, but in the restaurant, the mezze can range from twenty to sixty dishes, as the variant combinations and dishes involved are plenty.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jousiffe|first=Ann|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7IUAQAAIAAJ|title=Lebanon|date=1998|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-0-86442-350-4|language=en}}</ref>  \n\nA typical ''[[mezze]]'' will consist of an elaborate variety of thirty hot and cold dishes and may include: \n\n* Salads such as [[tabbouleh]] and [[fattoush]], together with dip such as [[hummus]], [[baba ghanoush]] or ''moutabal'', and [[kebbeh]],\n* Some patties such as the [[sambusac]],\n*[[Stuffed grape leaves]] and pickles,\n* Roasted nuts, olives and vegetables,\n* Condiments like [[toum]] and [[Tarator|taratour]], ideal for spread on [[sfiha]].<ref name=\"Cavendish\"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Rombauer|first=Irma S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcq2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46|title=Joy of Cooking: 2019 Edition Fully Revised and Updated|last2=Becker|first2=Marion Rombauer|last3=Becker|first3=Ethan|last4=Becker|first4=John|last5=Scott|first5=Megan|date=2019-11-12|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-5011-6971-7|page=46}}</ref>\n\nFamily cuisine offers also a range of dishes, such as stews (or yakhneh), which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with [[meat]] and rice vermicelli.
