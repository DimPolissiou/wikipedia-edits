In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behavior shared by the [[Taiwanese people|people of Taiwan]].{{sfnp|Hsiau|2005|pp=125\u2013129}}{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|pp=23\u201341}}\n\n==State cultural policy overview==\n{{Main article|Taiwanese Aborigines|History of Taiwan}}\n\n===Historical context===\n{{Main article|Taiwan under Japanese rule}}\nTaiwan's culture and cultural legacy has been largely shaped by the processes of [[imperialism]] and [[colonization]] as the structural and psychological effects of successive colonial projects have been integral to developing Taiwan's self-image and the evolution of both official and unofficial Taiwanese culture.{{sfnp|Yip|2004|pp=2\u20135}} For most of its colonized existence, Taiwan remained on the cultural margins, far from the centers of civil and cultural life of each regime, and with every regime change, Taiwan's cultural center shifted. At various times Taiwan's cultural center has been [[Taiwanese Aborigines|Indigenous Taiwan]], Amsterdam, [[Xiamen]] (Amoy), [[Qing dynasty|Qing]]-era Beijing, [[Imperial Japan]], postwar China and even, arguably, the United States.{{sfnp|Morris|2004|pp=7\u201331}}{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|pp=28\u201331}}\n[[File:Taiwan bunun dancer.jpg|thumb|[[Bunun people|Bunun]] dancer in traditional aboriginal dress]]\n\nBefore the [[Qing Empire]] ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895, Taiwan's culture was characterized by Qing frontier societies of [[Han Chinese|Han]] farmers and highland [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aborigines]]. Due to Taiwan's strategic location along East Asian trade routes, Taiwanese were also exposed to cosmopolitan influences and the effects of European commerce. By the middle of the Japanese era (1895\u20131945), Taiwan had begun to shift from local to contemporary global culture, under the guidance of Japanese style \"westernization\". Beginning during Japan's build up for war,{{sfnp|Wachman|1994|pp=6\u20137}} Japan invigorated its policies to Japanize Taiwan for mobilization against the Allies. Japan's effort taught Taiwan's elite, Japanese culture and language, but did not largely interfere in religious organization. When Japan's suppressive wartime policies were lifted following [[World War II]], Taiwanese were eager to continue with their prewar [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] activities.{{sfnp|Mendel|1970|pp=13\u201314}} Japan's colonial legacy has shaped many of the customs and mannerisms of Taiwanese. Japan's colonial legacy is still visible, due to Japan's massive effort in constructing Taiwan's economic infrastructure and industrial base, which is often cited as a major factor in Taiwan's rapid [[economic development]].{{sfnp|Gold|1986|pp=21\u201332}}\n\n==KMT era cultural policy==\n{{Main article|History of KMT cultural policy}}\nDuring the early postwar period the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] (KMT) suppressed Taiwanese cultural expression and barred Taiwanese from cosmopolitan life except in the spheres of science and technology.{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|p=29}} The authoritarian KMT dominated public cultural space and Chinese nationalist networks became a part of cultural institutions, leaving little resource for cultural autonomy to grow.{{sfnp|Phillips|2003|pp=10\u201315}}\n\nUnder the early KMT, Taiwan was realigned from a Japanese imperial center to a Chinese nationalist center, under the influence of KMT and American [[geo-political]] interests.{{sfnp|Gold|1994|p=47}} Although American cultural activities were modest, they played a significant role in Taiwan's developing cultural scene. The KMT claimed a loss of morale led to \"losing China\" and thus the state issued a series of ideological reforms aimed to \"retake\" China, which became the major state cultural program of the time.  The immediate preoccupation with losing China diverted long term investment in the humanities and social sciences. On another level, the state's main objective was to \"[[sinicization|sinicize]]\" the Taiwanese by teaching them [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Nationalist ideology through compulsory primary education.{{sfnp|Wachman|1994|pp=82\u201388}}\n\nBy the late 1940s the KMT had [[authoritarianism|eliminated dissent]] for its cultural policies. When Taiwanese had resumed the cultural activities, which were outlawed by the Japanese in 1937, the Nationalist attitude was that Taiwanese had been Japanese \"slaves\" and would therefore have to complete a period of moral and ideological tutelage before they could enjoy their full rights as citizens of the [[Republic of China]].{{sfnp|Kerr|1965|pp=72;266}} The [[February 28 Incident]] destroyed Taiwan's urban elite and the arrival of the mainlander elite ensured Nationalist domination of urban cultural centers.{{sfnp|Gates|1981|pp=266\u2013269}}\n\nIn 1953, Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] issued his first major opinion on culture to complete [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s [[Three Principles of the People]], which included prescribing Nationalist curriculum for education, building facilities for intellectual and physical recreation and the major state cultural program of promoting anti-communist propaganda.{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|p=30}} In regard to Taiwanese cultural life, the major thrust was for \"universalization\" of education in Mandarin, which was enforced by law. Despite the hard-line Chinese control over culture, the Soviet advances in technology led to a new Nationalist focus on building closer cooperation with American universities and developing engineering programs.{{sfnp|Wilson|1970|}} The American presence in Taiwan also encouraged Taiwanese to resume some politically, ethnically neutral cultural activities, which was expressed in a flourishing Taiwanese-language media market.{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|p=32}}  \n\nBetween the 1960s and the 1980s Taiwan's culture was described by its media as the contrast between Taiwan (Free China) and China (Communist China), often drawing from the official tropes of Taiwan as a bastion of traditional Chinese culture, which had preserved \"true\" Chinese values against the \"false\" Chinese values of post Communist China. At the same time, Taiwanese cultural expressions were brutally suppressed by Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT. In response to the [[Cultural Revolution]] of China, the government of Taiwan began promoting the [[Chinese Cultural Renaissance]]\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6587\u5316\u5fa9\u8208\u904b\u52d5), with a myriad of programs designed to promote traditional Chinese culture to counter the communist movement on the mainland which aimed at uprooting the \"[[Four Olds]]\". These programs involved subsidized publication of [[Chinese Classics]], the symbolic functions of the [[National Palace Museum]], promoting famous prewar scholars to prominent positions in government and academic institutions, textbook and curriculum design with a focus on the official view of \"traditional\" Chinese culture and involvement in social and community events and the exemplification of Confucian ideology intertwined with [[Sun Yat-sen]] thought.\n\n==Taiwanization==\n{{Main article|Taiwanization}}\n\n===After 1975===\n[[Bentuhua]] or [[Bentuhua|Taiwanization]]/[[Taiwanese localization]] has become, arguably, the most important symbol of cultural change over the past twenty years. Bentuhua describes the social and cultural movement by the people of Taiwan to identify with Taiwan's unique historical and cultural legacy. Bentuhua has often been associated with [[Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign]], [[Taiwan Independence]], and [[Taiwanese nationalism]].\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|100px|Yin and Yang symbol of [[Taoism]]]] [[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|100px|The ''[[Dharmachakra]]'' represents the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].]]\n\n{{Main article|Religion in Taiwan}}\n\nThe prevalent form of religious belief in [[Taiwan]] is a blend of [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese folk religion]], including [[ancestor worship]].<ref>[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/brief/info04_19.html TIO Gov Taiwan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526015030/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/brief/info04_19.html |date=26 May 2007 }}</ref> However, there are also large numbers of devotees to each of these belief systems.<ref name=\"taipei times\">[http://ecommerce.taipeitimes.com/yearbook2004/P351.htm taipei times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128153701/http://ecommerce.taipeitimes.com/yearbook2004/P351.htm |date=28 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\nChristian churches have been active in Taiwan for many years, a majority of which are Protestant (with 2.6% of the population identifying themselves as Protestant)<ref name=\"taipei times\"/> with Presbyterians playing a particularly significant role.

A notable Japanese influence exists due to the period when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. Taiwanese cuisine itself is often associated with influences from mid to southern provinces of China, most notably from the province of [[Fujian]], but influences from all of China can easily be found due to the large number of Chinese who immigrated to Taiwan at end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and when Taiwan was under Chinese rule (ROC). In the process, Taiwan developed a distinct style of cuisine.\n\n==Languages==\n{{Main article|Languages of Taiwan}}\nThe language with the most native speakers in Taiwan is [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], or \"Taiwanese\" for short, spoken by about 70% of the population. People who emigrated from [[mainland China]] after 1949 (about 13% of the population) mostly speak [[Mandarin Chinese]]. The [[Hakka people|Hakka]], who make about 13% of the population, speak the distinct [[Hakka language]]. The [[Formosan languages]] are the ethnic languages of the [[Taiwanese Aborigines]], comprising about 2.3% of the island's population.\n\n[[Standard Chinese]] is the official language and is almost universally spoken and understood. English is taught universally, starting in elementary school.\n\n[[Taiwanese Mandarin]], derived from Standard Chinese, is spoken at different levels according to the social class and situation of the speakers.\n\nSome terms have different meanings in Taiwan and mainland China, such as: \u571f\u8c46 (''t\u01d4d\u00f2u''), which means peanut in Taiwan, but potato in China. There also exist differences in official{{what|date=October 2016}} pronunciations of a few words such as \u5783\u573e, which is pronounced ''l\u00e8s\u00e8'' in Taiwan but ''l\u0101j\u012b'' in China, with the former being derived from [[Shanghainese]].\n\n==Art==\n{{Main article|Taiwanese art}}\nThe artistic heritage of Taiwan is extremely diverse. Stonecutters of the Changbin culture began to make art on Taiwan at least 30,000 years ago. Around 5,000 years ago jade and earthenware works started to appear. Art was first institutionalized in Taiwan during the Japanese Colonial period and the establishment of public schools dedicated to the fine arts. The Japanese introduced oil and watercolor paintings to Taiwan and Taiwanese artists were heavily influenced by their Japanese counterparts. As was typical of colonel rulers Japanese did not establish tertiary institutions for art education in Taiwan, all students wishing to pursue an advanced degree in the arts had to travel to Japan to do so. When the Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 they brought many of China's most prestigious artists with them. The Nationalists also established the first art colleges and universities in Taiwan. Along with Chinese influences the Nationalists also allowed the United States to establish a series of military bases in Taiwan, American [[pop culture]] and artistic ideas such as [[abstract expressionism]] were introduced to Taiwan by the Americans. Democratization in the late 1980s and the lifting of martial law granted Taiwanese artists freedom of expression for the first time in history. The economic boom of the '80s and \u201890s also saw the financial resources of Taiwanese museums and patrons increase significantly.<ref name=\"Taiwan Today\" >{{cite web |last1=Chung |first1=Oscar |title=Beauty in Diversity |url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?post=168600&unit=20,35&unitname=Taiwan-Review&postname=Beauty-in-Diversity |website=taiwantoday.tw |publisher=Taiwan Today |accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref> By 1990 Taiwan was Asia's biggest art market.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chow |first1=Vivienne |title=Taipei Was Asia's Biggest Market Hub 30 Years Ago.

While the most common teas are oolongs, especially Taiwanese oolongs such as Iron Goddess and Alpine Oolong. However, black teas and green teas are also popular. Many of the classical arts can be seen in the [[tea culture]], examples: [[calligraphy]], flower arts, incense arts, and such.\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Taipei KTV-Eingangshalle.jpg|thumb|200px|Entrance hall of a K-TV in Taipei]]\n\n[[Karaoke]] is incredibly popular in Taiwan, where it is termed KTV (karaoke television). This is an example of something the Taiwanese have drawn, on scale, from contemporary [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. [[Pachinko]] is another example. During typhoons, many young Taiwanese will spend the day singing karaoke or playing [[mahjong]]. Many people enjoy watching [[miniseries]] collectively called [[Taiwanese drama]].\n\nSince 1999, [[Taiwanese hot springs|hot springs]], known as ''w\u0113nqu\u00e1n'' in [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] and  ''[[onsen]]'' in Japanese, have been making a comeback thanks to efforts by the government.

Nearly all students attend some sort of ''buxiban'', whether for mathematics, computer skills, English, other foreign languages, or exam preparation (college, graduate school, [[TOEFL]], [[GRE]], [[SAT]], etc.). This is perpetuated by a [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] culture that measures merit through testing, with entrance into college, graduate school, and government service decided entirely on testing. This has also led to a remarkable respect for degrees, including PhDs and overseas Western degrees (US and Great Britain).\n\nEnglish teaching is a big business in Taiwan, with Taiwan, as part of its project to reinvigorate the [[Taiwan Miracle]], aiming to become a trilingual country\u2014fluent in Mandarin, Taiwanese, and English.\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{main article|Taiwanese Wave}}\n[[Mobile phone|Cell phones]] are very popular in Taiwan. Mobile penetration rate stands at just over 100%.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Because of their high use, phones in Taiwan have many functions and are becoming cheaper.\n\n[[Internet cafe]]s are very popular with teenagers. They often sell food. Many gamers eat while using the internet. Many parents and teachers are concerned with the amount of time youth spend in the internet cafes.\n\nOne of the best known figures in Taiwanese cinema is director [[Ang Lee]], who has also made movies in the West and has won an [[Academy Award]]. Some popular pop artists in Taiwan include [[Leehom Wang]], [[Jay Chou]], [[Jolin Tsai]], and [[David Tao]]. Some of them have gained international fame and toured Asian countries like Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. Since Taiwan is well known for its entertainment scene, some of its TV stations have organised talent search to find new and young talents to join the big family of pop culture here. Some successful bands like [[S.H.E]] were formed in the talent search.\n\n[[Hip-hop culture]] from the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan also flourished in Taiwan. [[J-pop]], [[G-Unit]] and [[Eminem]] are also very popular as well. In this process, Taiwan produced several hip-hop artists, including [[Dog G]], [[MC HotDog]], [[Machi (Hip-Hop)|Machi]], and [[L.A. Boyz]].\n\n[[Taiwanization]] of the culture of Taiwan has been a trend since democratisation in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2000, after half a century of Chinese [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party rule, the first ever democratic change of ruling parties in Taiwan occurred with the election of Chen Shui-bian and his Taiwan-centric [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), marking an important step towards Taiwanization. While generally the KMT, the other major political party, is also more open to promoting Taiwan's cultural autonomy than in the past, the DPP made Taiwanization a key plank in its political platform. The Chen administration's policies included measures designed to focus on Taiwan while de-emphasizing cultural and historical ties to China. These policies included changes such as revising textbooks and changing school curricula to focus more on Taiwan's own history to the exclusion of China, and changing the names of institutions that contain \"China\" to \"Taiwan\". This sometimes led to incongruities such as [[Sun Yat-sen]] being treated as both a \"foreign\" (Chinese) historical figure and as the \"Father of the Country\" (Republic of China). These policies are called [[Taiwanization]] but have been attacked by detractors as \"[[desinicization]]\", which explains why these policies are generally applauded by most ethnic Taiwanese and opposed by the KMT.\n\nOne phenomenon that has resulted from the Taiwanization movement is the advent of ''Taike'' subculture, in which people consciously adopt the wardrobe, language and cuisine to emphasize the uniqueness of popular, groundroots Taiwanese culture, which in previous times had often been seen as provincial and brutally suppressed by [[Chiang Kai-shek]].\n\nThe Kuomintang took power in 2008 with the election of [[Ma Ying-jeou]] to the presidency. The new KMT administration has controversially sought to reverse some of the desinicizing policies of the Chen administration, to various degrees of public support. The restoration of the [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]] to its former state has been generally supported. By contrast, a directive by the administration to foreign missions to henceforth refer to visits by foreign dignitaries as \"visiting (cultural) China\" has been rescinded after criticism from DPP legislators.\n\n[[File:taiwan.nch.ntnu.apo-hsu.2005-10a.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|250px|Apo Hsu and the [[National Taiwan Normal University|NTNU]] Symphony Orchestra on stage in the [[National Concert Hall (Taiwan)|National Concert Hall]] in [[Taipei City|Taipei]] and Play [[Saint-Saens]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saens)|Organ Symphony No. 3]]]]\n\nSince 1949, Taiwan had managed to develop itself into the center of Chinese pop culture (also known as \"[[C-pop]]\" or \u4e2d\u6587\u6d41\u884c\u6587\u5316). Today, the commercial Chinese music industry in the world (especially [[Mandopop]] and [[Taiwanese pop]]) is still largely dominated by Taiwanese pop artists. Successful Chinese pop artists from other countries (e.g. [[Stefanie Sun]], [[JJ Lin]] from Singapore) are also trained, groomed and [[marketing|marketed]] in Taiwan. Chinese pop artists from other countries who wish to become successful usually have to go to Taiwan to develop their music career. Mandopop and Taiwanese (Hokkien) genre music continue to flourish in Taiwan today.\n\nEver since the 1990s, Taiwanese variety shows (\u7d9c\u85dd\u7bc0\u76ee) had grown from its home base in Taiwan to other parts of the world.

In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behavior shared by the [[Taiwanese people|people of Taiwan]].{{sfnp|Hsiau|2005|pp=125\u2013129}}{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|pp=23\u201341}}\n\n==State cultural policy overview==\n{{Main article|Taiwanese Aborigines|History of Taiwan}}\n\n===Historical context===\n{{Main article|Taiwan under Japanese rule}}\nTaiwan's culture and cultural legacy has been largely shaped by the processes of [[imperialism]] and [[colonization]] as the structural and psychological effects of successive colonial projects have been integral to developing Taiwan's self-image and the evolution of both official and unofficial Taiwanese culture.{{sfnp|Yip|2004|pp=2\u20135}} For most of its colonized existence, Taiwan remained on the cultural margins, far from the centers of civil and cultural life of each regime, and with every regime change, Taiwan's cultural center shifted. At various times Taiwan's cultural center has been [[Taiwanese Aborigines|Indigenous Taiwan]], Amsterdam, [[Xiamen]] (Amoy), [[Qing dynasty|Qing]]-era Beijing, [[Imperial Japan]], postwar China and even, arguably, the United States.{{sfnp|Morris|2004|pp=7\u201331}}{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|pp=28\u201331}}\n[[File:Taiwan bunun dancer.jpg|thumb|[[Bunun people|Bunun]] dancer in traditional aboriginal dress]]\n\nBefore the [[Qing Empire]] ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895, Taiwan's culture was characterized by Qing frontier societies of [[Han Chinese|Han]] farmers and highland [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aborigines]]. Due to Taiwan's strategic location along East Asian trade routes, Taiwanese were also exposed to cosmopolitan influences and the effects of European commerce. By the middle of the Japanese era (1895\u20131945), Taiwan had begun to shift from local to contemporary global culture, under the guidance of Japanese style \u201cwesternization\u201d. Beginning during Japan's build up for war,{{sfnp|Wachman|1994|pp=6\u20137}} Japan invigorated its policies to Japanize Taiwan for mobilization against the Allies. Japan's effort taught Taiwan's elite, Japanese culture and language, but did not largely interfere in religious organization. When Japan's suppressive wartime policies were lifted following [[World War II]], Taiwanese were eager to continue with their prewar [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] activities.{{sfnp|Mendel|1970|pp=13\u201314}} Japan's colonial legacy has shaped many of the customs and mannerisms of Taiwanese. Japan's colonial legacy is still visible, due to Japan's massive effort in constructing Taiwan's economic infrastructure and industrial base, which is often cited as a major factor in Taiwan's rapid [[economic development]].{{sfnp|Gold|1986|pp=21\u201332}}\n\n==KMT era cultural policy==\n{{Main article|History of KMT cultural policy}}\nDuring the early postwar period the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] (KMT) suppressed Taiwanese cultural expression and barred Taiwanese from cosmopolitan life except in the spheres of science and technology.{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|p=29}} The authoritarian KMT dominated public cultural space and Chinese nationalist networks became a part of cultural institutions, leaving little resource for cultural autonomy to grow.{{sfnp|Phillips|2003|pp=10\u201315}}\n\nUnder the early KMT, Taiwan was realigned from a Japanese imperial center to a Chinese nationalist center, under the influence of KMT and American [[geo-political]] interests.{{sfnp|Gold|1994|p=47}} Although American cultural activities were modest, they played a significant role in Taiwan's developing cultural scene. The KMT claimed a loss of morale led to \u201closing China\u201d and thus the state issued a series of ideological reforms aimed to \u201cretake\" China, which became the major state cultural program of the time.  The immediate preoccupation with losing China diverted long term investment in the humanities and social sciences. On another level, the state's main objective was to \u201c[[sinicization|sinicize]]\u201d the Taiwanese by teaching them [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Nationalist ideology through compulsory primary education.{{sfnp|Wachman|1994|pp=82\u201388}}\n\nBy the late 1940s the KMT had [[authoritarianism|eliminated dissent]] for its cultural policies. When Taiwanese had resumed the cultural activities, which were outlawed by the Japanese in 1937, the Nationalist attitude was that Taiwanese had been Japanese \u201cslaves\u201d and would therefore have to complete a period of moral and ideological tutelage before they could enjoy their full rights as citizens of the [[Republic of China]].{{sfnp|Kerr|1965|pp=72;266}} The [[February 28 Incident]] destroyed Taiwan's urban elite and the arrival of the mainlander elite ensured Nationalist domination of urban cultural centers.{{sfnp|Gates|1981|pp=266\u2013269}}\n\nIn 1953, Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] issued his first major opinion on culture to complete [[Sun Yat-sen]]\u2019s [[Three Principles of the People]], which included prescribing Nationalist curriculum for education, building facilities for intellectual and physical recreation and the major state cultural program of promoting anti-communist propaganda.{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|p=30}} In regard to Taiwanese cultural life, the major thrust was for \u201cuniversalization\u201d of education in Mandarin, which was enforced by law. Despite the hard-line Chinese control over culture, the Soviet advances in technology led to a new Nationalist focus on building closer cooperation with American universities and developing engineering programs.{{sfnp|Wilson|1970|}} The American presence in Taiwan also encouraged Taiwanese to resume some politically, ethnically neutral cultural activities, which was expressed in a flourishing Taiwanese-language media market.{{sfnp|Winckler|1994|p=32}}  \n\nBetween the 1960s and the 1980s Taiwan's culture was described by its media as the contrast between Taiwan (Free China) and China (Communist China), often drawing from the official tropes of Taiwan as a bastion of traditional Chinese culture, which had preserved \u201ctrue\u201d Chinese values against the \u201cfalse\u201d Chinese values of post Communist China. At the same time, Taiwanese cultural expressions were brutally suppressed by Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT. In response to the [[Cultural Revolution]] of China, the government of Taiwan began promoting the [[Chinese Cultural Renaissance]]\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u6587\u5316\u5fa9\u8208\u904b\u52d5), with a myriad of programs designed to promote traditional Chinese culture to counter the communist movement on the mainland which aimed at uprooting the \"[[Four Olds]]\". These programs involved subsidized publication of [[Chinese Classics]], the symbolic functions of the [[National Palace Museum]], promoting famous prewar scholars to prominent positions in government and academic institutions, textbook and curriculum design with a focus on the official view of \u201ctraditional\u201d Chinese culture and involvement in social and community events and the exemplification of Confucian ideology intertwined with [[Sun Yat-sen]] thought.\n\n==Taiwanization==\n{{Main article|Taiwanization}}\n\n===After 1975===\n[[Bentuhua]] or [[Bentuhua|Taiwanization]]/[[Taiwanese localization]] has become, arguably, the most important symbol of cultural change over the past twenty years.

A notable Japanese influence exists due to the period when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. Taiwanese cuisine itself is often associated with influences from mid to southern provinces of China, most notably from the province of [[Fujian]], but influences from all of China can easily be found due to the large number of Chinese who immigrated to Taiwan at end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and when Taiwan was under Chinese rule (ROC). In the process, Taiwan developed a distinct style of cuisine.\n\n==Languages==\n{{Main article|Languages of Taiwan}}\nThe language with the most native speakers in Taiwan is [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], or \"Taiwanese\" for short, spoken by about 70% of the population. People who emigrated from [[mainland China]] after 1949 (about 13% of the population) mostly speak [[Mandarin Chinese]]. The [[Hakka people|Hakka]], who make about 13% of the population, speak the distinct [[Hakka language]]. The [[Formosan languages]] are the ethnic languages of the [[Taiwanese Aborigines]], comprising about 2.3% of the island's population.\n\n[[Standard Chinese]] is the official language and is almost universally spoken and understood. English is taught universally, starting in elementary school.\n\n[[Taiwanese Mandarin]], derived from Standard Chinese, is spoken at different levels according to the social class and situation of the speakers.\n\nSome terms have different meanings in Taiwan and mainland China, such as: \u571f\u8c46 (''t\u01d4d\u00f2u''), which means peanut in Taiwan, but potato in China. There also exist differences in official{{what|date=October 2016}} pronunciations of a few words such as \u5783\u573e, which is pronounced ''l\u00e8s\u00e8'' in Taiwan but ''l\u0101j\u012b'' in China, with the former being derived from [[Shanghainese]].\n\n==Art==\n{{Main article|Taiwanese art}}\nThe artistic heritage of Taiwan is extremely diverse. Stonecutters of the Changbin culture began to make art on Taiwan at least 30,000 years ago. Around 5,000 years ago jade and earthenware works started to appear. Art was first institutionalized in Taiwan during the Japanese Colonial period and the establishment of public schools dedicated to the fine arts. The Japanese introduced oil and watercolor paintings to Taiwan and Taiwanese artists were heavily influenced by their Japanese counterparts. As was typical of colonel rulers Japanese did not establish tertiary institutions for art education in Taiwan, all students wishing to pursue an advanced degree in the arts had to travel to Japan to do so. When the Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 they brought many of China\u2019s most prestigious artists with them. The Nationalists also established the first art colleges and universities in Taiwan. Along with Chinese influences the Nationalists also allowed the United States to establish a series of military bases in Taiwan, American [[pop culture]] and artistic ideas such as [[abstract expressionism]] were introduced to Taiwan by the Americans. Democratization in the late 1980s and the lifting of martial law granted Taiwanese artists freedom of expression for the first time in history.

Nearly all students attend some sort of ''buxiban'', whether for mathematics, computer skills, English, other foreign languages, or exam preparation (college, graduate school, [[TOEFL]], [[GRE]], [[SAT]], etc.). This is perpetuated by a [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] culture that measures merit through testing, with entrance into college, graduate school, and government service decided entirely on testing. This has also led to a remarkable respect for degrees, including PhDs and overseas Western degrees (US and Great Britain).\n\nEnglish teaching is a big business in Taiwan, with Taiwan, as part of its project to reinvigorate the [[Taiwan Miracle]], aiming to become a trilingual country\u2014fluent in Mandarin, Taiwanese, and English.\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{main article|Taiwanese Wave}}\n[[Mobile phone|Cell phones]] are very popular in Taiwan. Mobile penetration rate stands at just over 100%.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Because of their high use, phones in Taiwan have many functions and are becoming cheaper.\n\n[[Internet cafe]]s are very popular with teenagers. They often sell food. Many gamers eat while using the internet. Many parents and teachers are concerned with the amount of time youth spend in the internet cafes.\n\nOne of the best known figures in Taiwanese cinema is director [[Ang Lee]], who has also made movies in the West and has won an [[Academy Award]]. Some popular pop artists in Taiwan include [[Leehom Wang]], [[Jay Chou]], [[Jolin Tsai]], and [[David Tao]]. Some of them have gained international fame and toured Asian countries like Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. Since Taiwan is well known for its entertainment scene, some of its TV stations have organised talent search to find new and young talents to join the big family of pop culture here. Some successful bands like [[S.H.E]] were formed in the talent search.\n\n[[Hip-hop culture]] from the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan also flourished in Taiwan. [[J-pop]], [[G-Unit]] and [[Eminem]] are also very popular as well. In this process, Taiwan produced several hip-hop artists, including [[Dog G]], [[MC HotDog]], [[Machi (Hip-Hop)|Machi]], and [[L.A. Boyz]].\n\n[[Taiwanization]] of the culture of Taiwan has been a trend since democratisation in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2000, after half a century of Chinese [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party rule, the first ever democratic change of ruling parties in Taiwan occurred with the election of Chen Shui-bian and his Taiwan-centric [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), marking an important step towards Taiwanization. While generally the KMT, the other major political party, is also more open to promoting Taiwan's cultural autonomy than in the past, the DPP made Taiwanization a key plank in its political platform. The Chen administration's policies included measures designed to focus on Taiwan while de-emphasizing cultural and historical ties to China. These policies included changes such as revising textbooks and changing school curricula to focus more on Taiwan's own history to the exclusion of China, and changing the names of institutions that contain \"China\" to \"Taiwan\". This sometimes led to incongruities such as [[Sun Yat-sen]] being treated as both a \"foreign\" (Chinese) historical figure and as the \"Father of the Country\" (Republic of China). These policies are called [[Taiwanization]] but have been attacked by detractors as \"[[desinicization]]\", which explains why these policies are generally applauded by most ethnic Taiwanese and opposed by the KMT.\n\nOne phenomenon that has resulted from the Taiwanization movement is the advent of ''Taike'' subculture, in which people consciously adopt the wardrobe, language and cuisine to emphasize the uniqueness of popular, groundroots Taiwanese culture, which in previous times had often been seen as provincial and brutally suppressed by [[Chiang Kai-shek]].\n\nThe Kuomintang took power in 2008 with the election of [[Ma Ying-jeou]] to the presidency. The new KMT administration has controversially sought to reverse some of the desinicizing policies of the Chen administration, to various degrees of public support. The restoration of the [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]] to its former state has been generally supported. By contrast, a directive by the administration to foreign missions to henceforth refer to visits by foreign dignitaries as \"visiting (cultural) China\" has been rescinded after criticism from DPP legislators.\n\n[[File:taiwan.nch.ntnu.apo-hsu.2005-10a.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|250px|Apo Hsu and the [[National Taiwan Normal University|NTNU]] Symphony Orchestra on stage in the [[National Concert Hall (Taiwan)|National Concert Hall]] in [[Taipei City|Taipei]] and Play [[Saint-Saens]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saens)|Organ Symphony No. 3]]]]\n\nSince 1949, Taiwan had managed to develop itself into the center of Chinese pop culture (also known as \"[[C-pop]]\" or \u4e2d\u6587\u6d41\u884c\u6587\u5316). Today, the commercial Chinese music industry in the world (especially [[Mandopop]] and [[Taiwanese pop]]) is still largely dominated by Taiwanese pop artists. Successful Chinese pop artists from other countries (e.g. [[Stefanie Sun]], [[JJ Lin]] from Singapore) are also trained, groomed and [[marketing|marketed]] in Taiwan. Chinese pop artists from other countries who wish to become successful usually have to go to Taiwan to develop their music career. Mandopop and Taiwanese (Hokkien) genre music continue to flourish in Taiwan today.\n\nEver since the 1990s, Taiwanese variety shows (\u7d9c\u85dd\u7bc0\u76ee) had grown from its home base in Taiwan to other parts of the world. Today, it is widely watched and enjoyed by the [[Overseas Chinese]] communities in countries such as [[Chinese Singaporeans|Singapore]], [[Malaysian Chinese|Malaysia]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Indonesia]], and the [[Chinese American|United States]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cinema of Taiwan]]\n*[[Cuisine of Taiwan]]\n*[[Education in Taiwan]]\n*[[Han Taiwanese]]\n*[[Languages of Taiwan]]\n*[[List of Taiwanese authors]]\n*[[List of ethnic groups in Taiwan]]\n*[[List of museums in Taiwan]]\n*[[Media in Taiwan]]\n*[[Music of Taiwan]]\n*[[Photography of Taiwan]]\n*[[Religion in Taiwan]]\n*[[Sports in Taiwan]]\n*[[Taiwanese literature]]\n*[[Taiwanese drama]]\n*[[Taiwanese opera]]\n*[[Glove puppetry]]\n*[[Night markets in Taiwan]]\n* [[Taipei Community Services Center]] (offers support services to the international community)\n*[[Hokkien culture]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Cited works ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Chang |first=Maukuei |chapter = Chapter 7 : The Movement to Indigenize to Social Sciences in Taiwan: Origin and Predicaments |editor1-last=Makeham |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Hsiau |editor2-first=A-chin |title=Cultural, Ethnic, and Political Nationalism in Contemporary Taiwan: Bentuhua |date=2005 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=9781403970206 |edition=1 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Hsiau |first=A-Chin |chapter = Chapter 4 : The Indigenization of Taiwanese Literature: Historical Narrative, Strategic Essentialism, and State Violence |editor1-last=Makeham |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Hsiau |editor2-first=A-chin |title=Cultural, Ethnic, and Political Nationalism in Contemporary Taiwan: Bentuhua |date=2005 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=9781403970206 |edition=1 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite conference\n  |last=Huang |first=Chun-chieh |year=1994\n  |title=Introduction\n  |editor1-last=Harrell |editor1-first=Stevan\n  |editor2-last=Huang |editor2-first=Chun-chieh \n  |conference=Cultural Change in Postwar Taiwan (April 10\u201314, 1991; Seattle)\n  |publisher=Westview Press |place=Boulder, Colo.\n  |ISBN=9780813386324 |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book |last=Makeham |first=John |chapter=Chapter 6 : Indigenization Discourse in Taiwanese Confucian Revivalism |editor1-last=Makeham |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Hsiau |editor2-first=A-chin |title = Cultural, Ethnic, and Political Nationalism in Contemporary Taiwan: Bentuhua |year = 2005 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=9781403970206 |edition=1 |ref=harv |doi = 10.1057/9781403980618 }}\n* {{cite conference\n  |last=Winckler |given=Edwin |year=1994\n  |title=Cultural Policy in Postwar Taiwan\n  |editor1-last=Harrell |editor1-first=Stevan\n  |editor2-last=Huang |editor2-first=Chun-chieh \n  |conference=Cultural Change in Postwar Taiwan (April 10\u201314, 1991; Seattle)\n  |publisher=Westview Press |location = Boulder, Colo.\n  |ISBN = 9780813386324 |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book |last=Yip |first=June |year=2004 |title=Envisioning Taiwan: Fiction, Cinema and the Nation in the Cultural Imaginary |publisher=Duke University Press |location = Durham, N.C. and London |isbn=9780822333579 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |year=2014 |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2014 |publisher=Executive Yuan, R.O.C. |url = http://www.ey.gov.tw/Upload/UserFiles/YB%202014%20all%20100dpi.pdf |accessdate=2016-06-11 |isbn = 9789860423020 |ref = {{harvid|Exec.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.
