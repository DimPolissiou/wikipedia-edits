These problems include: \n#Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n#Class imbalance in data \n\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n\n*Emails\n*Blogs\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of social media in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. Social bots (add link to bots) have also become a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling <ref name=\" Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref>. While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n\nSocial media platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. However, data obtained from social media platforms for author profiling may not always be reliable or accurate. This is because users of platforms may lie or avoid providing information about themselves, such as age, preferences, character traits, and gender, among other details <ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I.

As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate.\n\n\nAdditionally, social media text tend to deviate from normal linguistic standards as they contain spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration such as the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling <ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

Retrieved from http://personales.upv.es/prosso/resources/RangelRosso_NLPCS13.pdf</ref>.\n\n\n==== Weibo ====\n\n[[Sina Weibo]] is one of the few social media platforms originating from asian countries with predominantly asian languages that is analysed with author profiling. Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical Chinese characters, hashtags, emoticons, kaomoji, homogenous punctuation, Latin sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular Chinese expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author age from Weibo microblog posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>.\n\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between Mandarin Chinese and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019 <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author age from Weibo microblog posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref> . This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo <ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M. (2015). Age Detection for Chinese Users in Weibo. WAIM 2015, LNCS 9098, 83\u201395. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref>. In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters <ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M. (2015). Age Detection for Chinese Users in Weibo. WAIM 2015, LNCS 9098, 83\u201395. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref>.\n\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of Mainland China, limiting its rates of usage to predominantly Chinese  Nationals. Studies done for this platform have utilised bots, machine learning algorithms to identify authors\u2019 age-group and gender. Data is acquired from Weibo microblog posts of willing participants to be analysed, and used to train algorithms that build concept-based profiles of users to a certain accuracy <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P.

In the first two, the goal is to recognize the author from a set of authors, while in author profiling, the goal is to find specific characteristics of the author, based on stylistic- or content-based features.<ref>Mikros, George K., and Kostas Perifanos. \"[https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS13/paper/viewPDFInterstitial/5714/5914 Authorship Attribution in Greek Tweets Using Author's Multilevel N-Gram Profiles].\" 2013 AAAI Spring Symposium Series. 2013.</ref><ref>Stamatatos, Efstathios. \"[https://www.aflat.org/~walter/educational/material/Stamatatos_survey2009.pdf A survey of modern authorship attribution methods].\" Journal of the American Society for information Science and Technology 60.3 (2009): 538-556.</ref>\n\nThe author profiling task is a yet unsolved problem, due to its difficulty.

These problems include: \n#Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n#Class imbalance in data \n\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n\n*Emails\n*Blogs\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of social media in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. Social bots (add link to bots) have also become a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling <ref name=\" Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref>. While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n\nSocial media platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. However, data obtained from social media platforms for author profiling may not always be reliable or accurate. This is because users of platforms may lie or avoid providing information about themselves, such as age, preferences, character traits, and gender, among other details <ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I.

As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate.\n\n\nAdditionally, social media text tend to deviate from normal linguistic standards as they contain spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration such as the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling <ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

Retrieved from http://personales.upv.es/prosso/resources/RangelRosso_NLPCS13.pdf</ref>.\n\n\n==== Weibo ====\n\n[[Sina Weibo]] is one of the few social media platforms originating from asian countries with predominantly asian languages that is analysed with author profiling. Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical Chinese characters, hashtags, emoticons, kaomoji, homogenous punctuation, Latin sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular Chinese expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author age from Weibo microblog posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>.\n\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between Mandarin Chinese and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019 <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author age from Weibo microblog posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref> . This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo <ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M. (2015). Age Detection for Chinese Users in Weibo. WAIM 2015, LNCS 9098, 83\u201395. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref>. In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters <ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M. (2015). Age Detection for Chinese Users in Weibo. WAIM 2015, LNCS 9098, 83\u201395. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref>.\n\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of Mainland China, limiting its rates of usage to predominantly Chinese  Nationals. Studies done for this platform have utilised bots, machine learning algorithms to identify authors\u2019 age-group and gender. Data is acquired from Weibo microblog posts of willing participants to be analysed, and used to train algorithms that build concept-based profiles of users to a certain accuracy <ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P.
