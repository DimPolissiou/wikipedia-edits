In 1864, Shimla was declared as the [[summer capital]] of [[British Raj|British India]], succeeding [[Murree]], northeast of [[Rawalpindi]]. After [[Indian independence movement|independence]], the city became the capital of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and was later made the capital of [[Himachal Pradesh]].

The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of [[Himalayas]]. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord of 1914]] and the [[Simla Conference]] of 1945. After independence, The state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 [[princely state]]s. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the [[Simla Agreement]] of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.\n\nShimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the [[Tudorbethan]] and [[neo-Gothic]] architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]], the [[Jakhoo|Jakhoo Temple]], the [[Mall Road, Shimla|Mall Road]], [[The Ridge, Shimla|the Ridge]] and [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]] which together form the city centre. The [[Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway]] line built by the British, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race [[MTB Himalaya]], which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest [[Ice rink|natural ice skating rink]] in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.\n\n==History==\nMost of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the [[Jakhoo]] temple and a few scattered houses.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\">{{cite book | author=Vipin Pubby | title=Shimla Then and Now | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrZ-ibfhMyMC&pg=PA17 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | year=1996 | publisher=Indus Publishing | isbn=978-81-7387-046-0 | pages=17\u201334}}</ref> The area was called 'Shimla', named after a [[Hindu goddess]], ''Shyamala Devi'', an incarnation of [[Kali]].<ref name=\"hpshimla.nic.in\"/>\n\n[[File:Shimla, 1850s.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s]]\nThe area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by [[Bhimsen Thapa]] of [[Nepal]] in 1806. The [[British East India Company]] took control of the territory as per the [[Sugauli Treaty]] after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814\u201316). The [[Gurkha]] leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of [[David Ochterlony]] in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the [[Hill States of India#|Hill States]], set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil servant [[Charles Pratt Kennedy]] built the first [[pucca housing|pucca house]] in the area in 1822, near [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]], what is now the [[Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], the [[Governor-General of Bengal]], visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near [[Jakhoo]]. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of [[Keonthal]] and [[Patiala]] in exchange for the Rawin [[pargana]] and a portion of the Bharauli pargana.

After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal and saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from [[Sood]] and [[Parsi]] communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the [[National Highway 22 (India)|Hindustan-Tibet road]] with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851\u201352. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851\u201352.<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080206/himplus1.htm#2 |title=Shimla A five-tunnel town|publisher=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The [[1857 uprising]] caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/>\n\nIn 1863, the [[Viceroy of India]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\" /> He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between [[Calcutta]] and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007</ref> [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] ([[Viceroy of India]] 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], later built on Observatory Hill.

British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as [[Rudyard Kipling]] said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip and intrigue\".<ref name=\"heritagereport\">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | title = Heritage of Shimla | publisher = Town & Country Planning Department, Shimla | accessdate = 4 May 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171701/http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | archivedate = 30 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang.

In 1864, Shimla was declared as the [[summer capital]] of [[British Raj|British India]], succeeding [[Murree]], northeast of [[Rawalpindi]]. After [[Indian independence movement|independence]], the city became the capital of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and was later made the capital of [[Himachal Pradesh]].

The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of [[Himalayas]]. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord of 1914]] and the [[Simla Conference]] of 1945. After independence, The state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 [[princely state]]s. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the [[Simla Agreement]] of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.\n\nShimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the [[Tudorbethan]] and [[neo-Gothic]] architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]], the [[Jakhoo|Jakhoo Temple]], the [[Mall Road, Shimla|Mall Road]], [[The Ridge, Shimla|the Ridge]] and [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]] which together form the city centre. The [[Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway]] line built by the British, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race [[MTB Himalaya]], which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest [[Ice rink|natural ice skating rink]] in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.\n\n==History==\nMost of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the [[Jakhoo]] temple and a few scattered houses.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\">{{cite book | author=Vipin Pubby | title=Shimla Then and Now | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrZ-ibfhMyMC&pg=PA17 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | year=1996 | publisher=Indus Publishing | isbn=978-81-7387-046-0 | pages=17\u201334}}</ref> The area was called 'Shimla', named after a [[Hindu goddess]], ''Shyamala Devi'', an incarnation of [[Kali]].<ref name=\"hpshimla.nic.in\"/>\n\n[[File:Shimla, 1850s.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s]]\nThe area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by [[Bhimsen Thapa]] of [[Nepal]] in 1806. The [[British East India Company]] took control of the territory as per the [[Sugauli Treaty]] after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814\u201316). The [[Gurkha]] leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of [[David Ochterlony]] in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the [[Hill States of India#|Hill States]], set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil servant [[Charles Pratt Kennedy]] built the first [[pucca housing|pucca house]] in the area in 1822, near [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]], what is now the [[Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], the [[Governor-General of Bengal]], visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near [[Jakhoo]]. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of [[Keonthal]] and [[Patiala]] in exchange for the Rawin [[pargana]] and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Harrop, F.

In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:<ref>Researches and Missionary Labours Among the Jews, Mohammedans, and Other Sects By Joseph Wolff, published by O.

After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal and saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from [[Sood]] and [[Parsi]] communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the [[National Highway 22 (India)|Hindustan-Tibet road]] with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851\u201352. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851\u201352.<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080206/himplus1.htm#2 |title=Shimla A five-tunnel town|publisher=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The [[1857 uprising]] caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/>\n\nIn 1863, the [[Viceroy of India]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\" /> He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between [[Calcutta]] and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007</ref> [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] ([[Viceroy of India]] 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the \"Upper Bazaar\" nowadays known as the [[The Ridge, Shimla|Ridge]]<ref name=\"harisud\">{{cite book | author=Hari Sud | title=Entrepreneurs of British Shimla | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8aRBQAAQBAJ | accessdate=15 August 2015 | year=2013 | publisher=Lulu | isbn=978-1-304-11357-3 | pages=73\u201374}}</ref>), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.\n\nDuring the \"Hot Weather\", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], the head of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], and many departments of [[Government of India|the government]]. The summer capital of the regional Government of the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] moved from [[Murree]], in modern-day [[Pakistan]], to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]],<ref>''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007: p. 134</ref> \"was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.\" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as [[Rudyard Kipling]] said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip and intrigue\".<ref name=\"heritagereport\">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | title = Heritage of Shimla | publisher = Town & Country Planning Department, Shimla | accessdate = 4 May 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171701/http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | archivedate = 30 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang.

Their primary objective was to force [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egyptian]] ally, to evacuate the occupied regions and the Peloponnese. The intervention began when a [[Bourbon Restoration|Franco]]-[[Russian Empire|Russo]]-[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet was sent to the region and won the [[Battle of Navarino]] in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps of 15,000 men led by [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Nicolas-Joseph Maison]] landed in the southwestern Peloponnese. During October, soldiers took control of the principal strongholds still held by the Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France in early 1829 after an 8 month-deployment, the French kept a military presence in the area until 1833. The French army, however, suffered numerous human losses, mainly due to [[fever]] and [[dysentery]], with around 1,500 dead.\n\nAs had occurred during [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian Campaign]], when a [[Commission des Sciences et des Arts]] accompanied the military campaign, a scientific commission (''Exp\u00e9dition scientifique de Mor\u00e9e'') was attached to the French troops and placed under the supervision of three [[Academy|academies]] of the [[Institut de France]]. Directed by the naturalist and geographer [[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent|Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent]], nineteen scientists representing different specialties in [[natural history]], [[archaeology]] and [[architecture]]-[[sculpture]] made the voyage to Greece in March 1829; most of them stayed there for 9 months. Their work proved essential to the ongoing development of the [[First Hellenic Republic|new Greek State]] and, more broadly, marked a major milestone in the modern history of archaeology, cartography and natural sciences, as well as in the study of Greece.<ref name=\":9\">Yiannis Sa\u00eftas et al., ''L'\u0153uvre de l'exp\u00e9dition scientifique de Mor\u00e9e 1829-1838'', Edited by Yiannis Sa\u00eftas, Editions Melissa, 2011 (Part I) - 2017 (Part II).</ref><ref name=\":11\">Marie-No\u00eblle Bourguet, Bernard Lepetit, [[:fr:Daniel Nordman|Daniel Nordman]], Maroula Sinarellis, ''L\u2019Invention scientifique de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. \u00c9gypte, Mor\u00e9e, Alg\u00e9rie.'', \u00c9ditions de l\u2019EHESS, 1998.

They won numerous victories early on and declared independence on 1 January 1822. However, the declaration contradicted the principles of the [[Congress of Vienna]] and of the [[Holy Alliance]], which imposed a European equilibrium of the ''status quo'', outlawing any possible change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the [[Liberalism|liberal]] Greek insurgents.\n\nThe liberal and national uprising displeased [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], chancellor of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the principal political architect of the Holy Alliance. Russia looked favourably on the insurrection due to its [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious solidarity and its geostrategic interest (control of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosphorus]]). France, another active member of the Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at [[Battle of Trocadero|Trocadero]] (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade.<ref name=\"Athanassoglou-Kallmyer1989\">{{cite book|author=Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer|title=French Images from the Greek War of Independence (1821-1830): Art and Politics Under the Restoration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unXeZpkaxTMC&pg=PA124|year=1989|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-04532-1|page=124}}</ref> Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the situation of the region, primarily because it was on the route to [[British East India Company|India]] and London wished to exert there a form of control.<ref name=\":7\">C.

The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a demonstration of force was proposed and adopted; subsequently a joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exert diplomatic pressure against Constantinople.<ref name=\":7\" /> The [[Battle of Navarino]] (20 October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.\n\n[[File:The Battle of Navarino 20 October 1827.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Navarino]], on 20 October 1827, where the Allied naval forces (Britain, France and Russia) decisively defeated the Ottoman and Egyptian fleet]]\nIn 1828, Ibrahim Pasha thus found himself in a difficult situation: he had just suffered a defeat at Navarino; the joint fleet enforced a blockade which prevented him from receiving reinforcements and supplies; and his Albanian troops, whom he could no longer pay, had returned to their country under the protection of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]]' Greek troops. On 6 August 1828, a convention had been signed at [[Alexandria]] between the viceroy of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], and the British admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. By its terms, Ibrahim Pasha was required  to evacuate his Egyptian troops and leave the Peloponnese to the few Turkish troops (estimated at 1,200 men) remaining there, but he refused to honour the agreement and continued to control various Greek regions: [[Messenia]], [[Pylos|Navarino]], and [[Patras]] as well as several other strongholds\u2014and even ordered the systematic destruction of [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitza]].<ref> Brunet de Presle, Alexandre Blanchet, ''La Gr\u00e8ce'', p. 555.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the French government of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] was beginning to have doubts about its Greek policy.<ref>de Presle, p. 556.</ref> Ibrahim Pasha himself noted this ambiguity when he met [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Maison]] in September.<ref>Arch de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 472, \"Why was France, after enslaving men in Spain in 1823, now coming to Greece to make free men?\"</ref>  Eventually a pro-Greek liberal movement, inspired by what was then happening in Greece, began to develop in France. The longer France waited to act, the more delicate her position vis-\u00e0-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A proposal to send a joint land expedition was made to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|declared war against the Ottoman Empire]] and its military victories were unsettling for Great Britain, which did not wish to see the Tsarist empire extend too far south, and compelled it to not oppose an intervention by France alone.<ref>Arch. de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 649.</ref>\n\n===Intellectual context===\n[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy had stimulated Western Europeans' interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised [[ancient Greece]], the linchpin of [[classical antiquity]] as it was perceived and taught in academe. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of classical Athens. The ancient Greek democracies, and above all [[Athenian democracy|Athens]], became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works such as Abb\u00e9 [[Jean-Jacques Barth\u00e9lemy|Barth\u00e9lemy]]'s ''[[Anacharsis|Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis]]'' (1788) served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].\n\n[[File:Prise de Coron par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade S\u00e9bastiani.jpg|thumb|Capture of Koroni by General Sebastiani ([[Hippolyte Lecomte]])]]\nThe theories and system of interpreting ancient art devised by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] influenced European tastes for decades. His major work, ''History of Ancient Art'', was published in 1764 and translated into French in 1766 (the English translation did not appear until 1881). In this major work Winckelmann initiated the tradition of dividing ancient art into periods, classifying the works chronologically and stylistically.<ref>Alain Schnapp, ''La Conqu\u00eate du pass\u00e9. Aux origines de l'arch\u00e9ologie.'', Editions Carr\u00e9, Paris, 1993. p. 258.</ref>\n\nThe views of Winckelmann on art encompassed the entirety of civilisation. He drew a parallel between a civilisation's general level of development and the evolution of its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation in terms of progress\u2014apogee and then decline.<ref>Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique.'', Yale University Press, 1981, p. 104.</ref> For him, the golden age of Greek art had been the pinnacle of artistic achievement,<ref name=\"Nivala2017\">{{cite book|author=Asko Nivala|title=The Romantic Idea of the Golden Age in Friedrich Schlegel's Philosophy of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzUlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150|date=3 February 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-79728-3|pages=150\u2013151}}</ref> culminating with the career of the sculptor [[Phidias]]. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek art had been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful ([[Praxiteles]]) and Decadent (Roman period).\n\n[[File:Burrow Parthenon.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] at the time of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]]]]\nWinckelmann concluded his theory on the evolution of art with an explication of the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of political and religious liberty. His theories idealised ancient Greece and increased Europeans's desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He persuaded 18th-century Europe that life in ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\".<ref>Cited by Roland and Fran\u00e7oise Etienne, ''La Gr\u00e8ce antique.'', Gallimard, 1990, p. 60-61.</ref> Greece became the \"motherland of the arts\" and \"the teacher of taste\".<ref>Roland and Fran\u00e7oise Etienne, ''La Gr\u00e8ce antique.'', Gallimard, 1990, p. 44-45.</ref>\n\nThe French government had planned the Morea expedition in the same spirit as those of [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]], whose work it wished to complete. The semi-scientific expeditions commissioned and financed by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] remained a benchmark: these represented the first attempts to rediscover ancient Greece. The first, that of Stuart and Revett to Athens and the islands, took place in 1751\u20131753, and resulted in publication of ''The Antiquities of Athens'', a work mined by architects and designers for models of a refined \"Grecian\" [[neoclassicism]]. The expedition of Revett, [[Richard Chandler]] and William Pars to Asia Minor took place between 1764 and 1766. Finally, the removal by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] of half of the surviving marble sculptures of the [[Parthenon]], as well as sculptures from other buildings, and their transport to Britain at the beginning of the 19th century, had inspired further philhellenic longing for the cultural glories of ancient Greece: it now seemed possible to build vast collections of ancient art in Western Europe.\n\n==Military expedition==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Cogniet - Nicolas-Joseph Maison (1771-1840) - MV 1168.jpg|thumb|General [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]], Commander-in-Chief of the expeditionary corps from 1828 to 1829]]\nThe Chamber of Deputies authorised a loan of 80 million gold [[French franc|francs]] to allow the government to meet its obligations for the expedition.<ref>Antoine Calmon, ''Histoire parlementaire des finances de la Restauration.'', Michel L\u00e9vy, 1868\u20131870, vol. 2, p. 313.</ref> An expeditionary corps of 13,000\u201315,000 men<ref>Sources differ on this point.

What I have to add is that at first glance he was very attractive, and that he made a lot of expenses, especially for the latest arrivals'' [...]''The brilliant mind of [[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent|Mr. Bory Saint-Vincent]] could not get me, as young as I was, to overcome his arrogance and his aplomb, and I got used with difficulty to this activity, to this perpetual movement. His clothing, in the ceremonies or in the visits that we were going to pay to the authorities, was of a grotesque completion. He had combined in a very bizarre mixture the costume of a colonel and that of a member of the Institute. But he was not aware, or pretended not to notice, the amazement he caused everywhere. From the first days, he let his ambition, which he did not stop having during the trip, to pass for the supreme head of the commission, and I quickly noticed the coldness that Mr. Blouet and Mr. Dubois testified to him when he let his pretensions appear too much. As an indifferent spectator of this little antagonism, I could easily foresee how much the results of the expedition would suffer from that. I am probably mistaken; but I find difficult to understand a commission of this nature without a single chief, who directs the whole and who assumes all the responsibility. There were at our head three chiefs: they were already too many, and who were intended, and soon, to each pull their own side... It is true that there are many other circumstances for which I do admit only one master. Therefore, I repeat, I am probably wrong.

But the two most curious types of the commission were, without question, Edgar Quinet and Vietty, sculptor from Lyon. [...] The sculptor, a sort of peasant of the Danube, for the form at least, was said to have a deep education: he knew Greek as much as a man from France; so he treated the inhabitants of the Morea like donkeys, because they did not understand the language of Homer: finally, more Hellenist than sculptor.\" and p. 103: \"Did he intend to teach the language of Homer to modern Greeks? Perhaps, because we were told later that, willing to enter a closed city by force, he had addressed in Greek to the sentry a speech so little understood, especially with French pronunciation, that, to end it, we had driven to the police station. The fact remains that he left us, and that I never saw him again.\" Indeed, Vietty died soon after in France in 1842, in great poverty and without having published a single page of her research in the Morea (according to the testimony of geologist Virlet d'Aoust in a letter to the ministry in 1843, see previous note on St\u00e9phane Gioanni's study). As for [[Edgar Quinet]] when he left the commission (p. 104, Chapter VII): \"Mounted on a donkey that was partly hiding his huge coat, he was wearing a huge woman's straw hat, the edges of which, lifted by the wind, let see a pink silk ribbon tied under the neck and floating on his chest. On both sides of the saddle were attached species of baskets filled with books; behind, the guide and a horse loaded with the rest of the luggage. He passed thus in the middle of the crowd, without noticing the effect it produced, and without suspecting that it was going to be an extended theme for the officers' conversations and lazzi.\" Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval, ''[[iarchive:souvenirs182918300amau/page/n7/mode/2up|Souvenirs (1829-1830)]]'', Librairie Plon, E.

The presence of the troops from the expeditionary corps was important, alternating with that of the Greek shepherds: \"[...] their generous hospitality and simple and innocent manners reminded us of the beautiful period of pastoral life which fiction calls the [[Golden age]], and which seemed to offer the real characters of the [[Theocritus]]' and [[Virgil]]'s [[eclogue]]s.\" <ref name=\":2\">Blouet, 1831, v.

Thus, at [[Cape Zonchio|Cape Coryphasium]] near Navarino (''Paleokastro, [[Old Navarino castle|Old Navarino]] or Zonchio''), the location of the city of the Homeric [[Nestor (mythology)|King Nestor]], the famous [[Pylos]], was determined for the first time from the adjectives \"inaccessible\" and \"sandy\" (''\u1f20\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2'') used in the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' (the [[palace of Nestor]], located higher up in the land, was not discovered until 1939 by the American archaeologist [[Carl Blegen]]). Blouet added: \"These Hellenic constructions, which no modern traveller had yet mentioned, and which I had noticed in a previous visit, were for us an important discovery and a very-plausible reason to convince us that we saw the Pylos of Messinia.\"<ref>Blouet, 1831, v. I, pp. 5-6</ref> Similarly, a little further, he says about the city of Modon ([[Methoni, Messenia#Antiquity and Byzantine era|Methoni]]), the Homeric city of [[Pedasus (Messenia)|Pedasus]]: \"the ancient remains of the port, whose description agrees perfectly with that of Pausanias, are sufficient to determine with certainty the location of the ancient city.\"<ref>Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==== The first archaeological excavations of the Ancient Messene ====\nHaving explored Navarino, Methoni and Koroni, the members of the section went to the ancient city of [[Messene]] (founded in 369 BC by the Theban general [[Epaminondas]] after his victory over Sparta at [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]]), located on the slopes of Mounts  [[Ithome]] and Eva. They spent a full month there from April 10, 1829, where they were warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of the village of [[Mavrommati, Ithomi|Mavrommati]]. They were the first archaeologists to carry out scientific excavations on this site of [[classical Greece]].<ref>\"During the month that we spent at Messene, I requested some rather considerable excavations, the results of which were not without importance for our work\". in Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 12</ref>\n\nThey found there the famous fortified and crenelated surrounding walls of Epaminondas in a perfect state of preservation. There were two monumental [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] in the wall, one of which, having a [[lintel]] or [[architrave]] of an extraordinary 6 meters in length, was described by Blouet as \"perhaps the most beautiful in all of Greece\".<ref>Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 40.</ref> This enclosure initially allowed them to delimit the site and to \"give a general plan of Messene with the most meticulous and precise topographic details.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Then, they proceeded to the proper excavation of the archaeological site. They unearthed for the first time many fragments of stadium bleachers, drum sections and capitals of columns, porticoes, altars, bas-reliefs, sculptures and inscriptions (noted by Charles Lenormant, still present at that time). These excavations, carried out by means of dug trenches, enabled them to determine the precise plans of the foundations of the monuments and thus to propose restored models of the [[stadium]] of Messene and its [[heroon]], as well as the small theater or [[ekklesiasterion]]. However, they did not find all monuments, including the great theater and the ''Arsino\u00eb'' fountain. Only the ''Clepsydra'' fountain (where according to Pausanias, Zeus as a child was washed by the nymphs Ithome and Neda), located higher in the village of Mavrommati, was described and drawn.[[File:Prosper Baccuet - Mess\u00e8ne - Morea Expedition 1829.jpg|center|thumb|620x620px|The members of the scientific commission of the Morea Expedition studying the ruins of the stadium of [[Messene|ancient Messene]] (detail of a lithograph by [[Prosper Baccuet]])]]\n\n==== The first archaeological excavations of Olympia and the discovery of the temple of Olympian Zeus ====\n[[File:Plain d'Olympie.

The site of Olympia had been rediscovered in 1766 by the English antiquarian [[Richard Chandler]]. Since then, it had been visited by many other travellers such as [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois-S\u00e9bastien Fauvel|Fauvel]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville|Pouqueville]], [[William Gell|Gell]], [[Charles Robert Cockerell|Cokerell]] and [[William Martin Leake|Leake]]. Its general identification by the archaeologists of the Morea expedition was made possible thanks to the more precise descriptions of [[Edward Dodwell]] (for Dubois) and [[John Spencer Stanhope]] (for Blouet). Most of the buildings were invisible, because as Abel Blouet noted, they must have been covered with a thick layer of sediment due to the frequent overflows of rivers [[Alfeios]] and [[Kladeos]].<ref group=\"N\">\"''Another observation which completely destroys these assumptions, is that the excavations which we had made at the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|temple of Olympian Jupiter]], proved to us that the ancient soil of the plain was 10 and 12 feet below the modern soil. In this modern soil, which is a ground of alluvium brought by the waters of both the [[Alfeios]] and those which came down from the sandy mountains that surround the valley, one should not look for traces of the hippodrome and the stadium, since this land did not exist when there was a stadium and an hippodrome''.\" Abel Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 58</ref>\n\nOnly a single large fragment of a Doric column was visible. It had already been spotted by the previous travellers because the inhabitants of neighboring villages had dug trenches there to remove the stone, but none of them had attributed it with certainty to the temple of Zeus. Abel Blouet specified:<ref name=\":17\">Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 61</ref> \"Therefore, there could have been no merit in discovering a monument there. But what could have been a discovery was to find evidence that this monument was the famous [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|temple of Olympian Jupiter]]. And this is what our excavations have enabled us to demonstrate. When we arrived at Olympia, Mr. Dubois, director of the Archaeology section of our expedition, had already been there for a few days with Mr. Tr\u00e9zel and Mr. Amaury Duval, his collaborators. Following the instructions which had been given to him by the commission of the Institute, this antiquarian (Dubois) had begun the excavations of which the result had been the discovery of the first bases of the two columns of the [[Portico|pronaos]] and several fragments of sculpture.\" The archaeological advice of [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]] was thus followed. Dubois installed his workers on the front side of the temple and Blouet installed his own on the back side in order to give these excavations all possible extension. The painter [[Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval|Amaury-Duval]] gave in his ''[[iarchive:souvenirs182918300amau/page/n7/mode/2up|Souvenirs (1829-1830)]]'' a personal, direct and precise, testimony<ref group=\"N\"> \"Before looking for a site to establish our camp, a real natural curiosity made us go on an adventure. Some Greeks who plowed their field, as always with the pistol and the yatagan on their belts, offered to guide us. Mr. [[L\u00e9on-Jean-Joseph Dubois|Dubois]], believing that he already knew enough the place, wanted to do without their help, and chance made it so that I, who was far from having this pretension, arrived first on the site of the temple that my colleagues found, later, to be that of [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Olympian Zeus]]. Here is how. A Greek, whom Mr. Dubois had rejected, attached himself to me, and, probably looking for the tip, wanted to lead me to a place, which his pantomime made me suppose to be very interesting. \"Go ahead, if you like, said Mr. Dubois; but he will lead you to some uninteresting Roman ruin.\" So I followed my guide to a part of the almost inaccessible plain, covered with shrubs, grasses, huge stones, but shapeless and which rose from the ground at an equal distance. This confused heap of materials of all kinds seemed to me, however, to deserve attention. I came back to rejoin Mr. Dubois, whom I found disappointed to have encountered only uninviting ruins, very badly preserved, and nothing which seemed to lead to any discovery.

Their primary objective was to force [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egyptian]] ally, to evacuate the occupied regions and the Peloponnese. The intervention began when a [[Bourbon Restoration|Franco]]-[[Russian Empire|Russo]]-[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet was sent to the region and won the [[Battle of Navarino]] in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps of 15,000 men led by [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Nicolas-Joseph Maison]] landed in the southwestern Peloponnese. During October, soldiers took control of the principal strongholds still held by the Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France in early 1829 after an 8 month-deployment, the French kept a military presence in the area until 1833. The French army, however, suffered numerous human losses, mainly due to [[fever]] and [[dysentery]], with around 1,500 dead.\n\nAs had occurred during [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian Campaign]], when a [[Commission des Sciences et des Arts]] accompanied the military campaign, a scientific commission (''Exp\u00e9dition scientifique de Mor\u00e9e'') was attached to the French troops and placed under the supervision of three [[Academy|academies]] of the [[Institut de France]]. Directed by the naturalist and geographer [[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent|Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent]], nineteen scientists representing different specialties in [[natural history]], [[archaeology]] and [[architecture]]-[[sculpture]] made the voyage to Greece in March 1829; most of them stayed there for 9 months. Their work proved essential to the ongoing development of the [[First Hellenic Republic|new Greek State]] and, more broadly, marked a major milestone in the modern history of archaeology, cartography and natural sciences, as well as in the study of Greece.<ref name=\":9\">Yiannis Sa\u00eftas et al., ''L'\u0153uvre de l'exp\u00e9dition scientifique de Mor\u00e9e 1829-1838'', Edited by Yiannis Sa\u00eftas, Editions Melissa, 2011 (Part I) - 2017 (Part II).</ref><ref name=\":11\">Marie-No\u00eblle Bourguet, Bernard Lepetit, [[:fr:Daniel Nordman|Daniel Nordman]], Maroula Sinarellis, ''L\u2019Invention scientifique de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. \u00c9gypte, Mor\u00e9e, Alg\u00e9rie.'', \u00c9ditions de l\u2019EHESS, 1998.

They won numerous victories early on and declared independence on 1 January 1822. However, the declaration contradicted the principles of the [[Congress of Vienna]] and of the [[Holy Alliance]], which imposed a European equilibrium of the ''status quo'', outlawing any possible change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the [[Liberalism|liberal]] Greek insurgents.\n\nThe liberal and national uprising displeased [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], chancellor of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the principal political architect of the Holy Alliance. Russia looked favourably on the insurrection due to its [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious solidarity and its geostrategic interest (control of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosphorus]]). France, another active member of the Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at [[Battle of Trocadero|Trocadero]] (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade.<ref name=\"Athanassoglou-Kallmyer1989\">{{cite book|author=Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer|title=French Images from the Greek War of Independence (1821-1830): Art and Politics Under the Restoration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unXeZpkaxTMC&pg=PA124|year=1989|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-04532-1|page=124}}</ref> Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the situation of the region, primarily because it was on the route to [[British East India Company|India]] and London wished to exert there a form of control.<ref name=\":7\">C.

The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a demonstration of force was proposed and adopted; subsequently a joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exert diplomatic pressure against Constantinople.<ref name=\":7\" /> The [[Battle of Navarino]] (20 October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.\n\n[[File:The Battle of Navarino 20 October 1827.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Navarino]], on 20 October 1827, where the Allied naval forces (Britain, France and Russia) decisively defeated the Ottoman and Egyptian fleet]]\nIn 1828, Ibrahim Pasha thus found himself in a difficult situation: he had just suffered a defeat at Navarino; the joint fleet enforced a blockade which prevented him from receiving reinforcements and supplies; and his Albanian troops, whom he could no longer pay, had returned to their country under the protection of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]]' Greek troops. On 6 August 1828, a convention had been signed at [[Alexandria]] between the viceroy of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], and the British admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. By its terms, Ibrahim Pasha was required  to evacuate his Egyptian troops and leave the Peloponnese to the few Turkish troops (estimated at 1,200 men) remaining there, but he refused to honour the agreement and continued to control various Greek regions: [[Messenia]], [[Pylos|Navarino]], and [[Patras]] as well as several other strongholds\u2014and even ordered the systematic destruction of [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitza]].<ref> Brunet de Presle, Alexandre Blanchet, ''La Gr\u00e8ce'', p. 555.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the French government of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] was beginning to have doubts about its Greek policy.<ref>de Presle, p. 556.</ref> Ibrahim Pasha himself noted this ambiguity when he met [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Maison]] in September.<ref>Arch de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 472, \"Why was France, after enslaving men in Spain in 1823, now coming to Greece to make free men?\"</ref>  Eventually a pro-Greek liberal movement, inspired by what was then happening in Greece, began to develop in France. The longer France waited to act, the more delicate her position vis-\u00e0-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A proposal to send a joint land expedition was made to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|declared war against the Ottoman Empire]] and its military victories were unsettling for Great Britain, which did not wish to see the Tsarist empire extend too far south, and compelled it to not oppose an intervention by France alone.<ref>Arch. de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 649.</ref>\n\n===Intellectual context===\n[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy had stimulated Western Europeans' interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised [[ancient Greece]], the linchpin of [[classical antiquity]] as it was perceived and taught in academe. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of classical Athens. The ancient Greek democracies, and above all [[Athenian democracy|Athens]], became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works such as Abb\u00e9 [[Jean-Jacques Barth\u00e9lemy|Barth\u00e9lemy]]'s ''[[Anacharsis|Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis]]'' (1788) served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].\n\n[[File:Prise de Coron par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade S\u00e9bastiani.jpg|thumb|Capture of Koroni by General Sebastiani ([[Hippolyte Lecomte]])]]\nThe theories and system of interpreting ancient art devised by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] influenced European tastes for decades. His major work, ''History of Ancient Art'', was published in 1764 and translated into French in 1766 (the English translation did not appear until 1881). In this major work Winckelmann initiated the tradition of dividing ancient art into periods, classifying the works chronologically and stylistically.<ref>Alain Schnapp, ''La Conqu\u00eate du pass\u00e9. Aux origines de l'arch\u00e9ologie.'', Editions Carr\u00e9, Paris, 1993. p. 258.</ref>\n\nThe views of Winckelmann on art encompassed the entirety of civilisation. He drew a parallel between a civilisation's general level of development and the evolution of its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation in terms of progress\u2014apogee and then decline.<ref>Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique.'', Yale University Press, 1981, p. 104.</ref> For him, the golden age of Greek art had been the pinnacle of artistic achievement,<ref name=\"Nivala2017\">{{cite book|author=Asko Nivala|title=The Romantic Idea of the Golden Age in Friedrich Schlegel's Philosophy of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzUlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150|date=3 February 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-79728-3|pages=150\u2013151}}</ref> culminating with the career of the sculptor [[Phidias]]. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek art had been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful ([[Praxiteles]]) and Decadent (Roman period).\n\n[[File:Burrow Parthenon.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] at the time of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]]]]\nWinckelmann concluded his theory on the evolution of art with an explication of the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of political and religious liberty. His theories idealised ancient Greece and increased Europeans's desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He persuaded 18th-century Europe that life in ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\".<ref>Cited by Roland and Fran\u00e7oise Etienne, ''La Gr\u00e8ce antique.'', Gallimard, 1990, p. 60-61.</ref> Greece became the \"motherland of the arts\" and \"the teacher of taste\".<ref>Roland and Fran\u00e7oise Etienne, ''La Gr\u00e8ce antique.'', Gallimard, 1990, p. 44-45.</ref>\n\nThe French government had planned the Morea expedition in the same spirit as those of [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]], whose work it wished to complete. The semi-scientific expeditions commissioned and financed by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] remained a benchmark: these represented the first attempts to rediscover ancient Greece. The first, that of Stuart and Revett to Athens and the islands, took place in 1751\u20131753, and resulted in publication of ''The Antiquities of Athens'', a work mined by architects and designers for models of a refined \"Grecian\" [[neoclassicism]]. The expedition of Revett, [[Richard Chandler]] and William Pars to Asia Minor took place between 1764 and 1766. Finally, the removal by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] of half of the surviving marble sculptures of the [[Parthenon]], as well as sculptures from other buildings, and their transport to Britain at the beginning of the 19th century, had inspired further philhellenic longing for the cultural glories of ancient Greece: it now seemed possible to build vast collections of ancient art in Western Europe.\n\n==Military expedition==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Cogniet - Nicolas-Joseph Maison (1771-1840) - MV 1168.jpg|thumb|General [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]], Commander-in-Chief of the expeditionary corps from 1828 to 1829]]\nThe Chamber of Deputies authorised a loan of 80 million gold [[French franc|francs]] to allow the government to meet its obligations for the expedition.<ref>Antoine Calmon, ''Histoire parlementaire des finances de la Restauration.'', Michel L\u00e9vy, 1868\u20131870, vol. 2, p. 313.</ref> An expeditionary corps of 13,000\u201315,000 men<ref>Sources differ on this point.

But the two most curious types of the commission were, without question, Edgar Quinet and Vietty, sculptor from Lyon. [...] The sculptor, a sort of peasant of the Danube, for the form at least, was said to have a deep education: he knew Greek as much as a man from France; so he treated the inhabitants of the Morea like donkeys, because they did not understand the language of Homer: finally, more Hellenist than sculptor.\" and p. 103: \"Did he intend to teach the language of Homer to modern Greeks? Perhaps, because we were told later that, willing to enter a closed city by force, he had addressed in Greek to the sentry a speech so little understood, especially with French pronunciation, that, to end it, we had driven to the police station. The fact remains that he left us, and that I never saw him again.\" Indeed, Vietty died soon after in France in 1842, in great poverty and without having published a single page of her research in the Morea (according to the testimony of geologist Virlet d'Aoust in a letter to the ministry in 1843, see previous note on St\u00e9phane Gioanni's study). As for [[Edgar Quinet]] when he left the commission (p. 104, Chapter VII): \"Mounted on a donkey that was partly hiding his huge coat, he was wearing a huge woman's straw hat, the edges of which, lifted by the wind, let see a pink silk ribbon tied under the neck and floating on his chest. On both sides of the saddle were attached species of baskets filled with books; behind, the guide and a horse loaded with the rest of the luggage.

The presence of the troops from the expeditionary corps was important, alternating with that of the Greek shepherds: \"[...] their generous hospitality and simple and innocent manners reminded us of the beautiful period of pastoral life which fiction calls the [[Golden age]], and which seemed to offer the real characters of the [[Theocritus]]' and [[Virgil]]'s [[eclogue]]s.\" <ref name=\":2\">Blouet, 1831, v.

Thus, at [[Cape Zonchio|Cape Coryphasium]] near Navarino (''Paleokastro, [[Old Navarino castle|Old Navarino]] or Zonchio''), the location of the city of the Homeric [[Nestor (mythology)|King Nestor]], the famous [[Pylos]], was determined for the first time from the adjectives \"inaccessible\" and \"sandy\" (''\u1f20\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2'') used in the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' (the [[palace of Nestor]], located higher up in the land, was not discovered until 1939 by the American archaeologist [[Carl Blegen]]). Blouet added: \"These Hellenic constructions, which no modern traveller had yet mentioned, and which I had noticed in a previous visit, were for us an important discovery and a very-plausible reason to convince us that we saw the Pylos of Messinia.\"<ref>Blouet, 1831, v.

They spent a full month there from April 10, 1829, where they were warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of the village of [[Mavrommati, Ithomi|Mavrommati]]. They were the first archaeologists to carry out scientific excavations on this site of [[classical Greece]].<ref>\"During the month that we spent at Messene, I requested some rather considerable excavations, the results of which were not without importance for our work\". in Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 12</ref>\n\nThey found there the famous fortified and crenelated surrounding walls of Epaminondas in a perfect state of preservation. There were two monumental [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] in the wall, one of which, having a [[lintel]] or [[architrave]] of an extraordinary 6 meters in length, was described by Blouet as \"perhaps the most beautiful in all of Greece\".<ref>Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 40.</ref> This enclosure initially allowed them to delimit the site and to \"give a general plan of Messene with the most meticulous and precise topographic details.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Then, they proceeded to the proper excavation of the archaeological site. They unearthed for the first time many fragments of stadium bleachers, drum sections and capitals of columns, porticoes, altars, bas-reliefs, sculptures and inscriptions (noted by Charles Lenormant, still present at that time). These excavations, carried out by means of dug trenches, enabled them to determine the precise plans of the foundations of the monuments and thus to propose restored models of the [[stadium]] of Messene and its [[heroon]], as well as the small theater or [[ekklesiasterion]]. However, they did not find all monuments, including the great theater and the ''Arsino\u00eb'' fountain. Only the ''Clepsydra'' fountain (where according to Pausanias, Zeus as a child was washed by the nymphs Ithome and Neda), located higher in the village of Mavrommati, was described and drawn.[[File:Prosper Baccuet - Mess\u00e8ne - Morea Expedition 1829.jpg|center|thumb|620x620px|The members of the scientific commission of the Morea Expedition studying the ruins of the stadium of [[Messene|ancient Messene]] (detail of a lithograph by [[Prosper Baccuet]])]]\n\n==== The first archaeological excavations of Olympia and the discovery of the temple of Olympian Zeus ====\n[[File:Plain d'Olympie.

Its general identification by the archaeologists of the Morea expedition was made possible thanks to the more precise descriptions of [[Edward Dodwell]] (for Dubois) and [[John Spencer Stanhope]] (for Blouet). Most of the buildings were invisible, because as Abel Blouet noted, they must have been covered with a thick layer of sediment due to the frequent overflows of rivers [[Alfeios]] and [[Kladeos]].<ref group=\"N\">\"''Another observation which completely destroys these assumptions, is that the excavations which we had made at the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|temple of Olympian Jupiter]], proved to us that the ancient soil of the plain was 10 and 12 feet below the modern soil.

It had already been spotted by the previous travellers because the inhabitants of neighboring villages had dug trenches there to remove the stone, but none of them had attributed it with certainty to the temple of Zeus. Abel Blouet specified:<ref name=\":17\">Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 61</ref> \"Therefore, there could have been no merit in discovering a monument there.

Following the instructions which had been given to him by the commission of the Institute, this antiquarian (Dubois) had begun the excavations of which the result had been the discovery of the first bases of the two columns of the [[Portico|pronaos]] and several fragments of sculpture.\" The archaeological advice of [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]] was thus followed. Dubois installed his workers on the front side of the temple and Blouet installed his own on the back side in order to give these excavations all possible extension. The painter [[Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval|Amaury-Duval]] gave in his ''[[iarchive:souvenirs182918300amau/page/n7/mode/2up|Souvenirs (1829-1830)]]'' a personal, direct and precise, testimony<ref group=\"N\"> \"Before looking for a site to establish our camp, a real natural curiosity made us go on an adventure. Some Greeks who plowed their field, as always with the pistol and the yatagan on their belts, offered to guide us. Mr. [[L\u00e9on-Jean-Joseph Dubois|Dubois]], believing that he already knew enough the place, wanted to do without their help, and chance made it so that I, who was far from having this pretension, arrived first on the site of the temple that my colleagues found, later, to be that of [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Olympian Zeus]]. Here is how. A Greek, whom Mr. Dubois had rejected, attached himself to me, and, probably looking for the tip, wanted to lead me to a place, which his pantomime made me suppose to be very interesting. \"Go ahead, if you like, said Mr. Dubois; but he will lead you to some uninteresting Roman ruin.\" So I followed my guide to a part of the almost inaccessible plain, covered with shrubs, grasses, huge stones, but shapeless and which rose from the ground at an equal distance. This confused heap of materials of all kinds seemed to me, however, to deserve attention. I came back to rejoin Mr. Dubois, whom I found disappointed to have encountered only uninviting ruins, very badly preserved, and nothing which seemed to lead to any discovery. My account made him think: he went, with [[Pierre F\u00e9lix Trezel|Tr\u00e9zel]] and me, towards the place I had just seen, and decided immediately that the excavations would be started there\", [[Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval]], [[iarchive:souvenirs182918300amau/page/n7/mode/2up|''Souvenirs (1829-1830)'']], Chapter IX, Librairie Plon, E.

The simple treasure hunt was beginning to be abandoned. The fundamental contribution of the Morea scientific expedition was its total indifference towards looting, treasure hunting, and antiquities smuggling. [[Guillaume-Abel Blouet|Blouet]] refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues with the intent of taking a piece separated from the rest without regard, as [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Elgin]] had done on the Parthenon some twenty-five years before.<ref>Olga Polychronopoulou, ''Arch\u00e9ologues sur les pas d\u2019Hom\u00e8re.'', p. 33.</ref> It is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were transferred in their entirety to the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]] (with the authorization of the Greek Government of Ioannis Kapodistrias).<ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\"Murray2007\">{{cite book|author=Tim Murray|title=Milestones in Archaeology: A Chronological Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZ7Gj2ocIEsC&pg=PA182|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-186-1|page=182}}</ref> However, many precious works they excavated were re-buried in order to protect them, according to the direct testimony of [[Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval|Amaury-Duval]].<ref group=\"N\"> \"We left the valley of the [[Alfeios]], with real sadness and regretting not being able to take away some souvenirs; but the fragments of sculpture, even the smallest, were of an embarrassing volume and weight.There was, among other works, a marble foot, of admirable work, which was still attached to a part of the base: lest it be subjected to yet another more complete mutilation, we went to bury it, [[Pierre F\u00e9lix Trezel|Tr\u00e9zel]] and I, in a deeply dug hole.
