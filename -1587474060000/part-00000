{"title_page": "Army", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{army units}}\nAn '''army''' (from Latin ''arma'' \"arms, weapons\" via Old French ''arm\u00e9e'', \"armed\" [feminine]), '''ground force''' or '''land force''' is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based [[military branch]], service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a national [[military]] force, the word army may also mean a [[field army]].\n\nIn some countries, such as France and China, the term \"army\", especially in its plural form \"armies\", has the broader meaning of [[armed forces]] as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called [[French Army|''Arm\u00e9e de terre'']], meaning '''Land Army''', and the air force is called [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']], meaning '''Air Army'''. The naval force, although not using the term \"army\", is also included in the broad sense of the term \"armies\" \u2014 thus the [[French Navy]] is an integral component of the collective French Armies ([[French Armed Forces]]) under the [[Ministry of the Armies (France)|Ministry of the Armies]]. A similar pattern is seen in China, with the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) being the overall military, the \"actual army\" being the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|PLA Ground Force]], and so forth for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLA Air Force]], the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLA Navy]], and other branches.\n\nThe current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the PLA Ground Force of China with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 [[Military reserve force|reserve personnel]] followed by the [[Indian Army]] with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.\n\nBy convention, [[irregular military]] is understood in contrast to [[regular army|regular armies]] which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite [[militia]]. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular military can also refer to full-time status ([[standing army]]), versus [[Military reserve force|reserve]] or part-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the [[National Defence Act]]), from de facto \"non-statutory\" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] (designed for overseas or international deployment) or [[fencible]] (designed for \u2013 or restricted to \u2013 homeland defence)\n\n==History==\n{{for|the magazine ''Army History''|United States Army Center of Military History#Fellowships and publications|l1=United States Army Center of Military History \u00a7 Fellowships and publications}}\n\n===India===\nIndia's armies were among the first in the world.

During the Iron Age, the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] and [[Nanda Empire|Nanda]] Empires had the largest armies in the world, the peak being approximately over 600,000 Infantry, 30,000 Cavalry, 8,000 [[Ratha|War-Chariots]] and 9,000 War Elephants not including [[tributary state]] allies.<ref>{{citation |last=Majumdar |first=Ramesh Chandra |authorlink=R.

By the [[Warring States period]], the crossbow had been perfected enough to become a military secret, with bronze bolts which could pierce any armor. Thus any political power of a state rested on the armies and their organization. China underwent political consolidation of the states of [[Han (state)|Han (\u97d3)]], [[Wei (state)|Wei (\u9b4f)]], [[Chu (state)|Chu (\u695a)]], [[Yan (state)|Yan (\u71d5)]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao (\u8d99)]] and [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi (\u9f4a)]], until by 221 BCE, [[Qin Shi Huang]] (\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d), the first emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], attained absolute power. This first emperor of China could command the creation of a [[Terracotta Army]] to guard his tomb in the city of [[Xi'an]] (\u897f\u5b89), as well as a realignment of the [[Great Wall of China]] to strengthen his empire against insurrection, invasion and incursion.\n\n[[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' remains one of China's [[Seven Military Classics]], even though it is two thousand years old.<ref>In the twentieth c., [[Mao Zedong]] (People's Republic of China), General [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] (Viet Nam), General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (United States),  and in medieval Japan, [[Takeda Shingen]] (1521\u20131573) have drawn inspiration from the work</ref> Since no political figure could exist without an army, measures were taken to ensure only the most capable leaders could control the armies.<ref>\"who wishes to fight must first count the cost\" \u2014[[Sun Tzu]], ''[[The Art of War]]''</ref> [[Scholar-bureaucrat|Civil bureaucracies (\u58eb\u5927\u592b)]] arose to control the productive power of the states, and their military power.<ref>\"You conquered the empire on horseback, but from horseback you will never succeed in ruling it.\" \u2014Lu Chia, as quoted by [[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''. vol 7, part II.</ref>\n\n===Sparta===\nThe [[Spartan Army]] was one of the earliest known professional armies. Boys were sent to a [[barracks]] at the age of seven or eight to train for becoming a soldier. At the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family. After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons, the Spartan [[serf]]s or ''[[helot]]s'', did the manual labor.\n\nThis allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Spartan Army was largely composed of [[hoplite]]s, equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other. Each hoplite bore the Spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform. The main pieces of this armor were a round shield, a spear and a helmet.\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:Relief Kolumna Trajana2.jpg|thumb|A 2nd-century depiction of Roman soldiers on [[Trajan's column]]]]\n\nThe [[Roman Army]] had its origins in the citizen army of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. [[Marian Reforms|Reforms]] turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens, but these citizens [[career soldier|served continuously]] for 25 years before being discharged.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Knighton |first1=Andrew |title=The Roman Army \u2013 The Development Of One Of The Most Powerful Military Forces In The Ancient World |url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/ancient-history/roman-army-development-military.html |website=War History Online |accessdate=4 September 2018 |date=May 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans were also noted for making use of [[Auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]], non-Romans who served with the [[Roman legion|legion]]s and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as [[skirmisher|light skirmish troops]] and [[heavy cavalry]]. After their service in the army they were made citizens of Rome and then their children were citizens also. They were also given land and money to settle in Rome. In the [[Late Roman Empire]], these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman Army; moreover, by the time of the Late Roman Empire tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were paid to serve as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\n===Medieval Europe===\n[[File:Belagerung von Calais 1346-1347.JPG|thumb|Armies of the Middle Ages consisted of noble knights, rendering service to their [[suzerain]], and hired footsoldiers]]\nIn the earliest [[Middle Ages]] it was the obligation of every [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment, archers, and infantry. This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to, the better his troops would be.\n\nInitially, the words \"knight\" and \"noble\" were used interchangeably as there was not generally a distinction between them. While the nobility did fight upon horseback, they were also supported by lower class citizens \u2013 and mercenaries and criminals \u2013 whose only purpose was participating in warfare because, most often than not, they held brief employment during their lord's engagement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strong of Body, Brave and Noble: Chivalry and Society in Medieval France|last=Bouchard|first=Constance Brittain|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=0801430976|location=Ithaca|pages=13}}</ref> As the Middle Ages progressed and [[feudalism]] developed in a legitimate social and economic system, knights started to develop into their own class with a minor caveat: they were still in debt to their lord. No longer primarily driven by economic need, the newly established vassal class were, instead, driven by fealty and [[chivalry]].\n\nAs central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the [[peasantry]] began to be the central recruiting tool. England was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.\n\nIn theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Bob|title=Medieval Warfare|date=2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781781592243|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThus the [[scutage]] was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large [[mercenary]] market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.\n\nAs the Middle Ages progressed in Italy, Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.\n\nIn 1439 the French legislature, known as the  [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] (French: ''\u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux''), passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone. There was a new tax to be raised known as the ''[[taille]]'' that was to provide funding for a new Royal army. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as ''[[Compagnie d'ordonnance|compagnies d'ordonnance]]'' on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. The reforms of the 1440s,  eventually led to the [[Battle of Castillon|French victory at Castillon]] in 1453, and the conclusion of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By 1450 the companies were divided into the field army, known as the ''grande ordonnance'' and the garrison force known as the ''petite ordonnance''.<ref>Vale, M.G.A. (1992). ''Charles VII''. Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref>\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Marignano.jpg|thumb|[[Swiss mercenaries]] and German [[Landsknechts]] fighting for glory, fame and money at the [[Battle of Marignan]] (1515). The bulk of the [[Renaissance]] armies was composed of mercenaries.]]\n\nFirst [[nation state]]s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.\n\nThe [[veteran]] soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.\n\nAs late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.\n\nThe newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the [[Fronde]] in France and the [[English Civil War]].\n\nIn many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of [[absolute monarchy]]. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the [[Dutch Republic]]. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.\n\nHowever, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.\n\nAs any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The colonels of the [[Gardes fran\u00e7aises|French Guards]] and [[Grenadier Guards|British guard]]s politely discussing who should fire first at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] (1745).<ref>Mackinnon, Daniel.

However, this would only become apparent after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At this time, the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' and [[conscription]] would become the defining paradigm of [[modern warfare]].\n\nBefore then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, [[Wallonia]] ([[Walloon Guards]]) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from [[Piedmont]]. Britain recruited [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanovrian]] troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many Catholic European states.\n\nPrior to the [[English Civil War]] in England, the monarch maintained a personal bodyguard of [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], or \"gentlemen pensioners\", and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as [[Berwick on Tweed]] or [[Portsmouth]] (or [[Calais]] before it was [[Siege of Calais (1558)|recaptured]] by France in 1558).\n\nTroops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ''ad hoc'' basis. [[Noblemen]] and professional regular [[soldier]]s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by [[indenture]] from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the [[British Army]], although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the United States, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. Then [[First American Regiment]] was established in 1784. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the [[Legion of the United States]], was established in 1791.\n\nUntil 1733 the common soldiers of [[Prussian Army]] consisted largely of [[peasantry]] recruited or impressed from [[Brandenburg]]\u2013[[Prussia]], leading many to flee to neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600\u20131947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97 97]|isbn=0-674-02385-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97}}</ref> To halt this trend, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] divided Prussia into [[Cantonist (Prussia)|regimental cantons]].

In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I introduced a [[Imperial Russian Army|modern regular army]] built on German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from [[nobility]], as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers.<ref name=blum>Jerome Blum (1971) \"Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century\", {{ISBN|0-691-00764-0}}, pp. 465, 466</ref> The term of service in the 18th century was for life.

They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors (''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]s'') whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.\n\nFrom the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The \"recruits\" were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of [[mamluk]]s.\n\nChina organized the [[Manchu people]] into the [[Eight Banner system]] in the early 17th century. Defected [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] armies formed the [[Green Standard Army]]. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.\n\n===Late modern===\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|Indian Army personnel during [[Operation Crusader]] in Egypt, 1941]]\n[[Conscription]] allowed the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] to form the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which successfully battled European professional armies.\n\nConscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.\n\nCanada also had a political dispute over conscription during World War II. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.\n\nIn developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\nRussia, as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare ''citizen army'' as used in Switzerland (see [[Military of Switzerland]]).\n\n==Armies as armed services==\nWestern armies are usually subdivided as follows:\n*'''[[Corps]]''': A corps usually consists of two or more divisions and is commanded by a [[lieutenant general]].\n*'''[[Division (military)|Division]]''': Each division is commanded by a [[major general]], and usually holds three brigades including infantry, artillery, engineers and communications units in addition to [[logistics]] (supply and service) support to sustain independent action. Except for the divisions operating in the mountains, divisions have at least one armored unit, some have even more depending upon their functionality. The basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division.\n*'''[[Brigade]]''': A brigade is under the command of a [[brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]] and sometimes is commanded by a [[colonel]]. It typically comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.\n*'''[[Battalion]]''': Each battalion is commanded by a [[colonel]] or sometimes by [[lieutenant colonel]] who commands roughly 500 to 750 soldiers. This number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment. A battalion comprises 3\u20135 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (3 rifle companies, a fire support company and headquarters company) or its functional equivalent such as batteries (artillery) or squadrons (armour and cavalry), each under the command of a [[major]]. The company can be divided into platoons, each of which can again be divided into sections or squads.

For example, the [[First United States Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).\n\nArmies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]], \"Armies\" could vary in size, but were subordinate to an [[Army Group]]-sized \"[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]\" in wartime. In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]].

A similar pattern is seen in China, with the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) being the overall military, the \"actual army\" being the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|PLA Ground Force]], and so forth for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLA Air Force]], the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLA Navy]], and other branches.\n\nThe current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the PLA Ground Force of China with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 [[Military reserve force|reserve personnel]] followed by the [[Indian Army]] with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.\n\nBy convention, [[irregular military]] is understood in contrast to [[regular army|regular armies]] which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite [[militia]]. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular military can also refer to full-time status ([[standing army]]), versus [[Military reserve force|reserve]] or part-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the [[National Defence Act]]), from de facto \"non-statutory\" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] (designed for overseas or international deployment) or [[fencible]] (designed for \u2013 or restricted to \u2013 homeland defence)\n\n==History==\n{{for|the magazine ''Army History''|United States Army Center of Military History#Fellowships and publications|l1=United States Army Center of Military History \u00a7 Fellowships and publications}}\n\n===India===\nIndia's armies were among the first in the world.

By the [[Warring States period]], the crossbow had been perfected enough to become a military secret, with bronze bolts which could pierce any armor. Thus any political power of a state rested on the armies and their organization. China underwent political consolidation of the states of [[Han (state)|Han (\u97d3)]], [[Wei (state)|Wei (\u9b4f)]], [[Chu (state)|Chu (\u695a)]], [[Yan (state)|Yan (\u71d5)]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao (\u8d99)]] and [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi (\u9f4a)]], until by 221 BCE, [[Qin Shi Huang]] (\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d), the first emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], attained absolute power. This first emperor of China could command the creation of a [[Terracotta Army]] to guard his tomb in the city of [[Xi'an]] (\u897f\u5b89), as well as a realignment of the [[Great Wall of China]] to strengthen his empire against insurrection, invasion and incursion.\n\n[[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' remains one of China's [[Seven Military Classics]], even though it is two thousand years old.<ref>In the twentieth c., [[Mao Zedong]] (People's Republic of China), General [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] (Viet Nam), General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (United States),  and in medieval Japan, [[Takeda Shingen]] (1521\u20131573) have drawn inspiration from the work</ref> Since no political figure could exist without an army, measures were taken to ensure only the most capable leaders could control the armies.<ref>\"who wishes to fight must first count the cost\" \u2014[[Sun Tzu]], ''[[The Art of War]]''</ref> [[Scholar-bureaucrat|Civil bureaucracies (\u58eb\u5927\u592b)]] arose to control the productive power of the states, and their military power.<ref>\"You conquered the empire on horseback, but from horseback you will never succeed in ruling it.\" \u2014Lu Chia, as quoted by [[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''. vol 7, part II.</ref>\n\n===Sparta===\nThe [[Spartan Army]] was one of the earliest known professional armies. Boys were sent to a [[barracks]] at the age of seven or eight to train for becoming a soldier. At the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family. After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons, the Spartan [[serf]]s or ''[[helot]]s'', did the manual labor.\n\nThis allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Spartan Army was largely composed of [[hoplite]]s, equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other. Each hoplite bore the Spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform. The main pieces of this armor were a round shield, a spear and a helmet.\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:Relief Kolumna Trajana2.jpg|thumb|A 2nd-century depiction of Roman soldiers on [[Trajan's column]]]]\n\nThe [[Roman Army]] had its origins in the citizen army of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. [[Marian Reforms|Reforms]] turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens, but these citizens [[career soldier|served continuously]] for 25 years before being discharged.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Knighton |first1=Andrew |title=The Roman Army \u2013 The Development Of One Of The Most Powerful Military Forces In The Ancient World |url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/ancient-history/roman-army-development-military.html |website=War History Online |accessdate=4 September 2018 |date=May 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans were also noted for making use of [[Auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]], non-Romans who served with the [[Roman legion|legion]]s and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as [[skirmisher|light skirmish troops]] and [[heavy cavalry]]. After their service in the army they were made citizens of Rome and then their children were citizens also. They were also given land and money to settle in Rome. In the [[Late Roman Empire]], these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman Army; moreover, by the time of the Late Roman Empire tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were paid to serve as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\n===Medieval Europe===\n[[File:Belagerung von Calais 1346-1347.JPG|thumb|Armies of the Middle Ages consisted of noble knights, rendering service to their [[suzerain]], and hired footsoldiers]]\nIn the earliest [[Middle Ages]] it was the obligation of every [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment, archers, and infantry. This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to, the better his troops would be.\n\nInitially, the words \"knight\" and \"noble\" were used interchangeably as there was not generally a distinction between them. While the nobility did fight upon horseback, they were also supported by lower class citizens \u2013 and mercenaries and criminals \u2013 whose only purpose was participating in warfare because, most often than not, they held brief employment during their lord's engagement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strong of Body, Brave and Noble: Chivalry and Society in Medieval France|last=Bouchard|first=Constance Brittain|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=0801430976|location=Ithaca|pages=13}}</ref> As the Middle Ages progressed and [[feudalism]] developed in a legitimate social and economic system, knights started to develop into their own class with a minor caveat: they were still in debt to their lord. No longer primarily driven by economic need, the newly established vassal class were, instead, driven by fealty and [[chivalry]].\n\nAs central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the [[peasantry]] began to be the central recruiting tool. England was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.\n\nIn theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Bob|title=Medieval Warfare|date=2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781781592243|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThus the [[scutage]] was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large [[mercenary]] market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.\n\nAs the Middle Ages progressed in Italy, Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.\n\nIn 1439 the French legislature, known as the  [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] (French: ''\u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux''), passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone. There was a new tax to be raised known as the ''[[taille]]'' that was to provide funding for a new Royal army. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as ''[[Compagnie d'ordonnance|compagnies d'ordonnance]]'' on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. The reforms of the 1440s,  eventually led to the [[Battle of Castillon|French victory at Castillon]] in 1453, and the conclusion of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By 1450 the companies were divided into the field army, known as the ''grande ordonnance'' and the garrison force known as the ''petite ordonnance''.<ref>Vale, M.G.A. (1992). ''Charles VII''. Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref>\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Marignano.jpg|thumb|[[Swiss mercenaries]] and German [[Landsknechts]] fighting for glory, fame and money at the [[Battle of Marignan]] (1515). The bulk of the [[Renaissance]] armies was composed of mercenaries.]]\n\nFirst [[nation state]]s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.\n\nThe [[veteran]] soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.\n\nAs late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.\n\nThe newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the [[Fronde]] in France and the [[English Civil War]].\n\nIn many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of [[absolute monarchy]]. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the [[Dutch Republic]]. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.\n\nHowever, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.\n\nAs any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The colonels of the [[Gardes fran\u00e7aises|French Guards]] and [[Grenadier Guards|British guard]]s politely discussing who should fire first at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] (1745).<ref>Mackinnon, Daniel.

However, this would only become apparent after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At this time, the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' and [[conscription]] would become the defining paradigm of [[modern warfare]].\n\nBefore then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, [[Wallonia]] ([[Walloon Guards]]) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from [[Piedmont]]. Britain recruited [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanovrian]] troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many Catholic European states.\n\nPrior to the [[English Civil War]] in England, the monarch maintained a personal bodyguard of [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], or \"gentlemen pensioners\", and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as [[Berwick on Tweed]] or [[Portsmouth]] (or [[Calais]] before it was [[Siege of Calais (1558)|recaptured]] by France in 1558).\n\nTroops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ''ad hoc'' basis. [[Noblemen]] and professional regular [[soldier]]s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by [[indenture]] from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the [[British Army]], although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the United States, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. Then [[First American Regiment]] was established in 1784. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the [[Legion of the United States]], was established in 1791.\n\nUntil 1733 the common soldiers of [[Prussian Army]] consisted largely of [[peasantry]] recruited or impressed from [[Brandenburg]]\u2013[[Prussia]], leading many to flee to neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600\u20131947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97 97]|isbn=0-674-02385-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97}}</ref> To halt this trend, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] divided Prussia into [[Cantonist (Prussia)|regimental cantons]].

In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I introduced a [[Imperial Russian Army|modern regular army]] built on German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from [[nobility]], as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers.<ref name=blum>Jerome Blum (1971) \"Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century\", {{ISBN|0-691-00764-0}}, pp. 465, 466</ref> The term of service in the 18th century was for life.

They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors (''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]s'') whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.\n\nFrom the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The \"recruits\" were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of [[mamluk]]s.\n\nChina organized the [[Manchu people]] into the [[Eight Banner system]] in the early 17th century. Defected [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] armies formed the [[Green Standard Army]]. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.\n\n===Late modern===\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|Indian Army personnel during [[Operation Crusader]] in Egypt, 1941]]\n[[Conscription]] allowed the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] to form the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which successfully battled European professional armies.\n\nConscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.\n\nCanada also had a political dispute over conscription during World War II. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.\n\nIn developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\nRussia, as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare ''citizen army'' as used in Switzerland (see [[Military of Switzerland]]).\n\n==Armies as armed services==\nWestern armies are usually subdivided as follows:\n*'''[[Corps]]''': A corps usually consists of two or more divisions and is commanded by a [[lieutenant general]].\n*'''[[Division (military)|Division]]''': Each division is commanded by a [[major general]], and usually holds three brigades including infantry, artillery, engineers and communications units in addition to [[logistics]] (supply and service) support to sustain independent action. Except for the divisions operating in the mountains, divisions have at least one armored unit, some have even more depending upon their functionality. The basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division.\n*'''[[Brigade]]''': A brigade is under the command of a [[brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]] and sometimes is commanded by a [[colonel]]. It typically comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.\n*'''[[Battalion]]''': Each battalion is commanded by a [[colonel]] or sometimes by [[lieutenant colonel]] who commands roughly 500 to 750 soldiers. This number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment. A battalion comprises 3\u20135 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (3 rifle companies, a fire support company and headquarters company) or its functional equivalent such as batteries (artillery) or squadrons (armour and cavalry), each under the command of a [[major]]. The company can be divided into platoons, each of which can again be divided into sections or squads. (Terminology is nationality and even unit specific.)<ref name=\"definitions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/pk%5Eard.html |title=Subdivisions of the army |accessdate=2007-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116031246/http://www.fotw.net/flags/pk%5Eard.html |archivedate=2006-11-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Field army==\nA [[field army]] is composed of a headquarters, army [[troops]], a variable number of [[corps]], typically between three and four, and a variable number of [[Division (military)|divisions]], also between three and four. A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point. Field armies are controlled by a general or lieutenant general.\n\n===Formations===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[2nd Armored Division (United States)]] -->\n[[File:Army Nato.svg|thumb|Standard map symbol for a numbered Army, the 'X's are not substituting the army's number]]\n\nA particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general. For example, the [[First United States Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).\n\nArmies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]], \"Armies\" could vary in size, but were subordinate to an [[Army Group]]-sized \"[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]\" in wartime. In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]]. [[Viktor Suvorov]]'s ''Inside the Soviet Army'' describes how [[Cold War]] era Soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co-located for administration and [[Military deception|deception]] ('maskirovika') reasons.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Army aviation]]\n* [[World War I|First world war]]\n* [[List of armies]]\n* [[List of armies by country]]\n* [[List of numbered armies]]\n* [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel]]\n* [[Mercenary]]\n* [[Military history]]\n* [[Military organization]]\n* [[Militia]]\n* [[Military]]\n* [[Paramilitary]]\n* [[Soldier]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Army|army}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Military branches}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Armies| ]]\n[[Category:Military]]\n", "name_user": "Stratosk2027", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army"}

Supporters of the former, mostly in Asturias, identify Eonavian as a [[dialect continuum]] between the Asturian and Galician languages or even a third language belonging to [[Portuguese-Galician]] group spoken only in that area (Ruth Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez, Ricardo Saavedra Fern\u00e1ndez-Combarro and Xox\u00e9 Miguel Su\u00e1rez).<ref>{{in lang|es}} See the points of view of Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez [http://www.lne.es/occidente/2010/02/03/filologos-sostienen-gallego-asturiano-diferencias-lengua-vecina/867574.html La Nueva Espa\u00f1a newspaper] and Ruth Gonz\u00e1lez and Ricardo Saavedra [http://www.lavozdeasturias.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=271308 Un estudio concluye que la fala es una lengua con entidad propia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626165701/http://www.lavozdeasturias.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=271308 |date=2006-06-26 }},</ref> Supporters of the latter, mostly in Galicia, identify it as Galician and want the same protection as Galician in [[Castile and Leon]], which protects the dialects of [[El Bierzo]] in cooperation with the Galician government.\n\n==Classification==\n[[Image:Asturian linguistic areas.PNG|thumb|250px|Linguistic areas of Asturias, attending only to scientific criteria. In green, Asturogalician languages and in purple, Asturoleonese languages]]\nFrom a philological point of view, the origin of the language is surely in the [[Galician-Portuguese]] language family, the dominant language in the northwest of the Iberian peninsula in the [[Middle Ages]]. That follows from an examination of the more than six hundred parchments preserved in the [[monastery of Villanueva de Oscos]]. An examination of the documents of the monastery, written from the late 12th to early 14th centuries, show a certain identity between this language and the [[Galician-Portuguese language]].<ref>{{in lang|es}} See Alv\u00e1rez Castrill\u00f3n, Xose A. Colecci\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica del monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Villanueva de Oscos (1139-1300), Ridea, 2011</ref>\n\nFor the early stage, there are only documented translations of copies of ancient Latin deeds that were beginning to be unintelligible to the common people, (v. AHN sec. clergy, carp. 1617, AHN, Sec Clergy, carp. No. 1617. 15, no. 2, Sec AHN clergy carp. 1621 No 15 etc.), and there would not be until the mid-13th century that the first original deeds were written in the Galician-Portuguese language. In the early 14th century, the oddness of this language with the rest of the galacoifon\u00eda, was noticed. The most of these developments were the result of the Castilian language advancement in the urban centres of the [[River Eo]]: [[Revoredo]], [[Ribadeo]] and [[Castropol]], such influence was more significant in the writings of the bishops' notaries of Oviedo in these villages, but if the influence of Castilian was growing in the urban centres, the manuscripts of the monastery notaries still kept the original features of this language, and others were added that then appeared.\n\nThe cartulary of Oscos is an essential landmark for understanding the evolution of the [[Galician-Portuguese language]], but the monastery's influence was ended with the arrival of the Castillian congregation in 1511. That started another period of great economic and social growth of the monastery around the iron industries, but the installation of the reformed order ended the written language, until its re-emergence in the late 19th century.\n\n==Comparative table==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\"|[[Latin]]\n!width=\"30%\" colspan=\"3\" | [[Galician language|Galician]]\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Eonavian\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Galician- <br/>portuguese\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Western Asturian]]\n!width=\"8%\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n!width=\"8%\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[English language|English]]\n|-\n!

Separable times are documented in Castilian to the 18th century and are still preserved in Judeo-Sephardic; see, for example, Hanssen, Gram\u00e1tica hist\u00f3rica de la lengua castellana, (1913), Paris 1966, \u00a7 62.</ref>\n* The '''conjugated infinitive''' is used subordinate constructions if the infinitive ends or is part of a prepositional phrase; processes have different subjects and aims to avoid ambiguity.\n* Like the rest of the family [[Galician-Portuguese]], there is a strong dependence of original vocalism in Latin, and in Galician-Asturian, it is even more conservative. The verbal inflection of Eonavian is conditioned by the loss of the distinction between open and closed vowels in Vulgar Latin. The disappearance of the distinction between unstressed vowels made the mobility of stressed vowels within the verbal root make morpheme prevail over the root in most cases, distinguishing between open and closed position as tonic when it was combined.\n\nThus, the vowels acquired certain metaphonic connotations, to incorporate the distinction into verbal inflection and ignore the etymological origin of the words. The strong personal forms (the three person singular and third plural present indicative, subjunctive and all of the second imperative)  are always distinguished by speakers between vowel -e- and open-o and between the strong and weak of forms other than monosyllabic verbs if the stressed vowel of the root morpheme and the match, except for the verbs given duty and irregular in Galician-Asturian. These are the main features of the verb forms in the language:\n\nThe \u2013des is in the second person plural of every conjugation. Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda confirms that although the ending is maintained stably in the second and third conjugations, in the first conjugation, it is giving way to the influence of Castilian -ais and -aides.<ref>{{in lang|es}} See, for example, Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda, ''El habla del El Franco'', p. 188</ref>\n\nThe perfect past \u2013che has in the first person singular, \u2018ve\u00f1o\u2019, \u2018te\u00f1o\u2019, \u2018vexo\u2019.\n\nThere is a vocal deformation by the  rizot\u00f3nic effect.\n\nInfinitive ending in -r- join with pronomes.\n\nThere is a disappearance of \u2013s- in the first person plural to join \u2018nos\u2019 enclitic.\n\nThe -n- paragogic is in the first person singular perfect in all strong and bending double \u2013er, -ir, dixen-, puxen, fun, salin, c\u00f2m\u00edn.\n\nEndings in -i often take -n parag\u00f3jica: tomein, falein, subirein, falarein, hein, sein.\n\nThe open -e forms in the first person plural past (coy\u00e8mos, dix\u00e8mos) or the open o- in second and third person plural (f\u00f2mos, f\u00f2ron).\n\nThe infinitive in \u2013er- in many verbs in Castillian is in -ir: \u2018morrer\u2019, \u2018encher\u2019, \u2018ferver\u2019, \u2018render\u2019, etc., less frequently, the form hesitates: \u2018valir\u2019/\u2019valer\u2019 y \u2018tosir\u2019/\u2019toser\u2019.\n\nAn alternation occurs -e- open and closed in verbs with-e-open rizot\u00f3nica for which the -e- radical of the singular and the third person plural.\n\nFoe verbs ending in in-cer, the first person singular present indicative and subjunctive present are treated as ces: ce lluzo, lluce, lluza, lluzas, lluza.\n\nThere is an alternation between open and closed in the thematic vowel tonic of most verbs in -er.\n\nClosed -e- is typical for all persons in the plural of the perfect, six of pluperfect simple, all the imperfect subjunctive in the two series, and forms of the gerund and the first person future, in the first and second person plural present, the plural of the imperative of the first and second person plural of the future, both as in the hypothetical future-e.\n\nVerbs (medir and sentir) show an alternation i/e in the root vowel: with -i-in the strong forms (forms in the singular and the third plural of the present, the singular imperative and all of the subjunctive) and -e-in the weak vowels.\n\nWestern Asturian occurs accentuates the first and second persons of the plural present subjunctive.\n\n* Garcia Garcia and Celso Mu\u00f1iz admit the existence of composite shapes with verb \u2018ter\u2019 as an assistant. However, that is more from such an approach particular of the authors on the morphosyntax of the compound forms than as the existence of their own specialty in Eonavian.\n\n===Nouns===\n\n* The [[gender]] and the [[number]] are o/a, os/as. These forms are altered the loss of intervolcalic -n-: ratois (mice), caxois (drawers).\n* The instability of nasal consonants alters also augmentatives and diminutives: ''cas\u00faa'' (big house), pedr\u00faa (big stones), cas\u00eda (small house), pedr\u00eda (small stone), etc.\n* It is also characteristic of Eonavian to change gender to specify a group or an unknown number of things: \"el anada\", \"el herba\", (\"a herba\" a blade of grass, \"el hierba\", a grass farod) and in adverbial locutions to \"da feito\" (in fact), \"da remoyo\" (soacking), etc.\n* Although the forms of gender-neutral are widespread, highlighted by Fr\u00edas Conde, the use of the forms is from the influence of Castilian, and the forms used to be unknown in Eonavian (\u00abLos derivados de \"ille\" e \"illum\" en el gallego de Asturias\u00bb, Revista de Filolog\u00eda Rom\u00e1nica, n\u00ba 10, 1993, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013252), so it is strange that it is precisely the neutral \"lo\", the only article that begins in a consonant, it is beyond question it is {{clarify|considerwd|date=January 2017}} that no analyst records the existence of contractions with -lo', something unacceptable in Galician and Asturian.\n\n==Syntax==\n\n===Pronouns===\n* The Latin vocalism of the first-person pronoun, albeit with different embodiments, is retained: \u00e8u/\u00e8o.\n* There is a general extension of prepositional contractions of a similar nature. Contractions of unstressed pronouns, accusative dative are used more: mo, ma, mas, cho, cha, chas, yo, yos, yas.\n* The accusative and the dative in the personal pronouns are distinguished: the second person is te/che, the third person ye/lo/la. Pronominal form \u00abmin\u00bb is always a complement with a preposition: a min, por min, de min, etc.\n* Use of an interest dative: \u2018\u2019Eso nun che me gusta nada, vouch\u00e9me fer un traxe, llev\u00e1bachebos un traxe, \u00e9che grande, vaiye cansao\u2019\u2019: the pronomes \"che\"- and \u2013\"ye\"- have a sympathetic or interest value to highlight the attention of the recipient of the action.

It is very interesting its conservation by the massive information provided a community so small as the Villanueva de Oscos Abbey. The documents show us the vitality of this language in the [[Middle Ages]] and give very important information on Romance languages in the northwest of [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The Chartulary preserves 616 parchments about the Middle Ages: 32 from the 12th century, 261 from the 13th century, 224 from the 14th century and 99 from the 15th century.<ref>Alv\u00e1rez Castrill\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Antonio, ''Colecci\u00f3n Diplom\u00e1tica del Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Villanueva de Oscos'', Ridea, 2011, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe first scholar who dealt with its study was Aureliano Fern\u00e1ndez-Guerra in 1865, in the very important article \u00abSpeech about the Carther of Aviles\u00bb. He used extracts of 19 documents from 1256 to 1316. In 1868, Mart\u00edn Sangrador y Vitores included in his work about the Asturias administration a copy in Galician of the royal prerogative given away by [[Fernando II of Portugal|Fernando II]] to the Abbey. The next edition of the documents about monastery had to wait until the mid-20th century, when the [[Royal Institute of Asturian Studies]] (RIDEA) edited the article \u00abEl convento benedictino de Villanueva de Ozcos\u00bb<ref>[http://www.ridea.org/biblioteca/bidea/PDFs/022-07.pdf \u00abEl convento benedictino de Villanueva de Ozcos\u00bb BIDEA n\u00ba 22, 1954]</ref> by Marcos G. Mart\u00ednez, a rather poor edition. Only in 1981, Pedro Floriano Llorente publishes in RIDEA \u00abColecci\u00f3n dipolom\u00e1tica de Villanueva de Ozcos\u00bb,<ref>{{in lang|es}} Vid. Floriano LLorente, Pedro, \u00abColecci\u00f3n dipolom\u00e1tica de Villanueva de Ozcos\u00bb 1st serial, BIDEA 102, Oviedo, 1981, p. 127-190.</ref> which implies an important improvement concerning the previous, both by perfection technical, as by the personal and toponymic references.\n\nNonetheless, the edition dealt with the issue only as far as 1200. In 1994, the Britonia journal published the second serial of the monastery's parchments, edited by Floriano Llorente, covering until the first half of the 13th century. The edition, however, failed to meet the editors' expectations.because no documents were produced in Romance so Britonia published a second version, less known, to covers until 1300, more interesting for the study of the question.\n\nThe works served as a basis to publish another set of documents by Professor Alv\u00e1rez Castrill\u00f3n in his book ''Los Ozcos en los siglos X-XIII, un modelo de organizaci\u00f3n social del espacio en la Asturias medieval'', (2001), but the work addresses only the historic aspects and not the linguistics. In the following years, Professor Sanz Fuentes has published also four other documents with regard to Buron Hospital. Finally, Alv\u00e1rez Castrill\u00f3n, edited, in 2008, 605 more parchments as attachments to the book \u00abLa Comarca de los Oscos en la Edad Media, poblamiento, econom\u00eda y poder\u00bb, and in 2011, he edited 293 more documents from 1139 to 1300, ''Colecci\u00f3n Diplom\u00e1tica del Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Villanueva de Oscos, (1139-1300)''.\n\nThe documents of the chartulary give important information for knowledge of the language spoken in the western Asturias in the Middle Ages. They show the origin and the evolution of this language, but the serial of parchments finishes with the arrival the [[Religious congregation|Congregation]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] in 1511 at Monastery, the end of a cycle and will be the beginning of a new one, the big economic growth around the iron industry. However, the installation of the reformed order closed the documental history of this language, until its resurgence in the late 19th century.\n\n==Sample texts==\n{{quote|...Testo uobis et concedo per suis terminis certis per termino de Menustux e inde de super ad petram de Gio a Cornu de Menyones, et ad penna de Teyxeyra, et al Pico pequeno, et allas mestas de Bouspoulim) et como uay pello regueyro a Sobrepe aa pena das ouellas, et inde in directum ad petra Vocatoria et ad aquam de Ferue\u00e7a et c\u00f3modo uertitur aquam al final de Pena Leyra, na Gauia per ubi potueritis inueniere....

troubadour of the last third of the 13th century. He was the author of four songs of moral satire, known as ''([[c\u00e1ntigas de escarnio y maldecir]])''. One of the [[c\u00e1ntigas]] relates, in ancient [[Galician-Portuguese language]], to the \"costumes\" (manners) and \"feituras\" (facts) of the \"Cavalon\" (old horse), which tells the adventures of a nobleman who lived in Seville, and had come from [[Oscos Region]] in \"Esturas\" ([[Asturias]]) on the border with Galicia. The verses are included in a \"c\u00e1ntiga\" that is within the theme of \"escarnio\" (ridicule) and \"maldecir\" (cursing) but with the impersonation which is typical of the ''\"C\u00e1ntiga de amigo\"'' (friend song). Anyway, it seems that the reference to the knight of Oscos presents allegorical connotations to the origin of the Asturian knight that might be related with the type of speech used in the cantiga.<ref>{{in lang|es}} Beltran, Vicen\u00e7; Tipos y temas trovadorescos XIII. Fernan Soarez de Quinhones; pp. 394-397. Beltran, Vicen\u00e7; La Corte de Babel. Los problemas de Fern\u00e1n Soarez de Qui\u00f1ones; pp. 212</ref>\n\nAfter the arrival of the [[Castillian Congregation]] at the [monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de [[Villanueva de Oscos]] in 1511, the written record of the language ended until its resurgence in the late 19th century.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century was an identification with Galician, reflected in authors like [[Cotarelo Valledor]] and [[Antolin Santos Ferraria]], who wrote entirely in Galician. Fernandez and Fernandez and Bernardo Acevedo Huelves were the first authors who are aware of the peculiarities of this language. The latest one is usually attributed the first sonnet in this language:  ''\"Vust\u00e9 era un gran se\u00f1or, Eu era un gran probe\"''(You was a great lord, I was a large poor man). A poet contemporary of them was Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, (1870-1938), who showedthe influence of the modernist spirit, prevailing in the early 20th century. His best-known work is a long poem entitled ''\"El xard\u00edn\"''. Another poet in that time was Villar Conrado Loza (Taramundi 1873-Tapia 1962), who focused on themes around migration, recurring theme in folk literature on the early 20th century.\n\nAfter the [[Spanish Civil War]] was a decline of the literature in Asturian Galician, which lost the identity features that were beginning to appear. Folk literature was mixing Galician and Castilian and tended to be anecdotic rather than purely literary. In the 1970s, thanks to the work of authors such as [[Damaso Alonso]], writers of the western end of Asturia began to reaffirm the identity of their language, such as Manuel Garcia Sanchez, known Manolo Galano, particularly concerned about the popular culture of the region and published, in 1994, with Jacinto L\u00f3pez D\u00edaz ''\"Vocabulario da Roda\"'' and had published in 1984:  ''\"Cuentos Parzamiques\"''. He was a frequent contributor to the magazine Entrambasauguas and published, in 2005, a recast of twenty written contributions to the magazine in the book ''\"Vento d'outono\"''. Beside them are some more recent authors as Xose Miguel Suarez (Mantaras, Tapia, 1965) and Xavier Frias Conde. The writers started their literary careers, from the philological study of the language albeit from very different perspectives.\n\nThe difficulty of publishing books for an audience so small makes it most remarkable of all that the literature projects through various magazines of the region. The oldest magazine is \"A Freita\", which appeared in eleven numbers, a general magazine that started to being published in 1992. Among its contributors were writers like Benigno Fernandez Bra\u00f1a, Xan Casta\u00f1eira, Xos\u00e9 Maximo Fernandez Muniz, Adela Valledor Conde, etc. In 1995, the magazine attached a literary supplement, published to makes noticed to the authors of Eonavia in other formats, through a kind of less formal book.<ref>{{in lang|es}} See, for example, Fr\u00edas Conde, FJ; \u00abNos conf\u00edns da literatura galega: escritores asturianos en galego\u00bb; Revista de lenguas y literaturas catalana, gallega y vasca, number 5, 1996\u20111997 pp. 223-240</ref>\n\nSince 1996, the Department of Linguistics of Eo Navia has published the magazine \"Entrabasauguas\". Among the writers often to collaborating are [[Veiguela Crisanto]] (Vegadeo 1959), Alejandro Blanco Antunez, (Navia 1933), Teresa Lopez, (Boal 1950), [[Xoxe Carlos Alvarez Blanco]], [[Xavier Vilareyo]] (Mieres 1967), [[Fredo de Carbexe]] (El Franco 1967), etc.\n\nIn theatre, there is some tradition like in Villar and Manuel Galano. Lately, old plays have been recovered: \"Condo el cari\u00f1o \u00e8 de Verd\u00e1\", a comedy released in 1936 by Association Armal, and \"El tratto de FF Arias\", premiered in Figueras in 1926.\n\n==Associations==\nIn the dialectal area are associations supporting each side, such as [[Asociaci\u00f3n Abertal]] (defending the Galician theory) and [[Xeira]] or Fala Viva (defending the Asturian theory). Its protection and [[language policy]] are the responsibility of the Asturian government and the [[Secretar\u00eda Lling\u00fc\u00edstica del Navia-Eo]], a division of the [[Academia de la Llingua Asturiana]] responsible for the area. There are two different orthographies for Eonavian, the official one (more Asturian-like) as well as one made by the Mesa pr\u00e1 Defensa del Galego de Asturias (more Galician-like).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iberian languages]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.romaniaminor.net/gramatiques/gramatica_eonaviega.pdf Eonavian grammar] (Galician theory)\n* [http://www.amesa.org Mesa for the defense of Gallego de Asturias] (defending the Galician theory)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134204/http://www.xabielxeira.e.telefonica.net/index.htm Xeira] (defending the Asturian theory)\n\n{{Languages of Spain}}\n{{Romance languages}}\n\n[[Category:Galician language]]\n[[Category:Asturian language]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Romance dialects in a Galician/Portuguese\u2013Asturian continuum}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{cleanup reorganize|date=November 2011}}\n{{expert needed|Linguistics|date=March 2009}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox language\n|name               = Galician\u2013Asturian\n|nativename         = {{lang|gl|gallego-asturiano, eonaviego}}\n|pronunciation      = {{IPA|[\u0261\u00e4\u02cc\u029de\u0263o \u00e4stu\u02c8\u027ej\u00e4no\u032f]|}}<br>{{IPA|[e\u032fon\u00e4\u02c8\u03b2j\u025b\u0263o\u032f]|}}\n|states             = [[Spain]]\n|region             = [[Asturias]]\n|speakers           = 45,000\n|date               = 2002\n|ref = <ref>{{in lang|es}}According to a Sociolinguistic II of Asturias (2002) study, sponsored by the Academy of the Asturian Language, performed by 'Euskobar\u00f3metro', of the respondents, 72% said they spoke the language, but 24% claimed to be able to read, and 16% to be able to write it.

The term ''Eonaviego'' was first used by the linguist Xavier Fr\u00edas Conde, who translated it as ''Eonavian'' in English, ''\u00c9onavien'' in French, and ''Eonavienc'' in Catalan. In 2007, the [[Academy of the Asturian Language]] accepted the term ''Eonavian'' to refer to the [[Galician-Portuguese]] [[dialect]].\n\nThe set of dialects was traditionally included by linguists as Galician-Portuguese or [[Galician language|Galician]], with some characteristics of the [[Astur-Leonese Group|Astur-Leonese group]]. That was the opinion of such linguists as [[Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]],<ref>{{in lang|es}} Men\u00e9ndez Pidal, R (1906): \"El dialecto Leon\u00e9s\", ''Revista de Archivos, Bibliotecas y Museos'', 2-3:130-131</ref> [[Eugenio Coseriu]], [[Lu\u00eds Lindley Cintra]],<ref>{{in lang|pt}} Lindley Cintra, Lu\u00eds F.

Supporters of the former, mostly in Asturias, identify Eonavian as a [[dialect continuum]] between the Asturian and Galician languages or even a third language belonging to [[Portuguese-Galician]] group spoken only in that area (Ruth Gonz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez, Ricardo Saavedra Fern\u00e1ndez-Combarro and Xox\u00e9 Miguel Su\u00e1rez).<ref>{{in lang|es}} See the points of view of Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez [http://www.lne.es/occidente/2010/02/03/filologos-sostienen-gallego-asturiano-diferencias-lengua-vecina/867574.html La Nueva Espa\u00f1a newspaper] and Ruth Gonz\u00e1lez and Ricardo Saavedra [http://www.lavozdeasturias.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=271308 Un estudio concluye que la fala es una lengua con entidad propia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626165701/http://www.lavozdeasturias.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=271308 |date=2006-06-26 }},</ref> Supporters of the latter, mostly in Galicia, identify it as Galician and want the same protection as Galician in [[Castile and Leon]], which protects the dialects of [[El Bierzo]] in cooperation with the Galician government.\n\n==Classification==\n[[Image:Asturian linguistic areas.PNG|thumb|250px|Linguistic areas of Asturias, attending only to scientific criteria. In green, Asturogalician languages and in purple, Asturoleonese languages]]\nFrom a philological point of view, the origin of the language is surely in the [[Galician-Portuguese]] language family, the dominant language in the northwest of the Iberian peninsula in the [[Middle Ages]]. That follows from an examination of the more than six hundred parchments preserved in the [[monastery of Villanueva de Oscos]]. An examination of the documents of the monastery, written from the late 12th to early 14th centuries, show a certain identity between this language and the [[Galician-Portuguese language]].<ref>{{in lang|es}} See Alv\u00e1rez Castrill\u00f3n, Xose A. Colecci\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica del monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Villanueva de Oscos (1139-1300), Ridea, 2011</ref>\n\nFor the early stage, there are only documented translations of copies of ancient Latin deeds that were beginning to be unintelligible to the common people, (v. AHN sec. clergy, carp. 1617, AHN, Sec Clergy, carp. No. 1617. 15, no. 2, Sec AHN clergy carp. 1621 No 15 etc.), and there would not be until the mid-13th century that the first original deeds were written in the Galician-Portuguese language. In the early 14th century, the oddness of this language with the rest of the galacoifon\u00eda, was noticed. The most of these developments were the result of the Castilian language advancement in the urban centres of the [[River Eo]]: [[Revoredo]], [[Ribadeo]] and [[Castropol]], such influence was more significant in the writings of the bishops' notaries of Oviedo in these villages, but if the influence of Castilian was growing in the urban centres, the manuscripts of the monastery notaries still kept the original features of this language, and others were added that then appeared.\n\nThe cartulary of Oscos is an essential landmark for understanding the evolution of the [[Galician-Portuguese language]], but the monastery's influence was ended with the arrival of the Castillian congregation in 1511. That started another period of great economic and social growth of the monastery around the iron industries, but the installation of the reformed order ended the written language, until its re-emergence in the late 19th century.\n\n==Comparative table==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\"|[[Latin]]\n!width=\"30%\" colspan=\"3\" | [[Galician language|Galician]]\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Eonavian\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Galician- <br/>portuguese\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\n!width=\"10%\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Western Asturian]]\n!width=\"8%\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n!width=\"8%\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[English language|English]]\n|-\n!

Separable times are documented in Castilian to the 18th century and are still preserved in Judeo-Sephardic; see, for example, Hanssen, Gram\u00e1tica hist\u00f3rica de la lengua castellana, (1913), Paris 1966, \u00a7 62.</ref>\n* The '''conjugated infinitive''' is used subordinate constructions if the infinitive ends or is part of a prepositional phrase; processes have different subjects and aims to avoid ambiguity.\n* Like the rest of the family [[Galician-Portuguese]], there is a strong dependence of original vocalism in Latin, and in Galician-Asturian, it is even more conservative. The verbal inflection of Eonavian is conditioned by the loss of the distinction between open and closed vowels in Vulgar Latin. The disappearance of the distinction between unstressed vowels made the mobility of stressed vowels within the verbal root make morpheme prevail over the root in most cases, distinguishing between open and closed position as tonic when it was combined.\n\nThus, the vowels acquired certain metaphonic connotations, to incorporate the distinction into verbal inflection and ignore the etymological origin of the words. The strong personal forms (the three person singular and third plural present indicative, subjunctive and all of the second imperative)  are always distinguished by speakers between vowel -e- and open-o and between the strong and weak of forms other than monosyllabic verbs if the stressed vowel of the root morpheme and the match, except for the verbs given duty and irregular in Galician-Asturian. These are the main features of the verb forms in the language:\n\nThe \u2013des is in the second person plural of every conjugation. Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda confirms that although the ending is maintained stably in the second and third conjugations, in the first conjugation, it is giving way to the influence of Castilian -ais and -aides.<ref>{{in lang|es}} See, for example, Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda, ''El habla del El Franco'', p. 188</ref>\n\nThe perfect past \u2013che has in the first person singular, \u2018ve\u00f1o\u2019, \u2018te\u00f1o\u2019, \u2018vexo\u2019.\n\nThere is a vocal deformation by the  rizot\u00f3nic effect.\n\nInfinitive ending in -r- join with pronomes.\n\nThere is a disappearance of \u2013s- in the first person plural to join \u2018nos\u2019 enclitic.\n\nThe -n- paragogic is in the first person singular perfect in all strong and bending double \u2013er, -ir, dixen-, puxen, fun, salin, c\u00f2m\u00edn.\n\nEndings in -i often take -n parag\u00f3jica: tomein, falein, subirein, falarein, hein, sein.\n\nThe open -e forms in the first person plural past (coy\u00e8mos, dix\u00e8mos) or the open o- in second and third person plural (f\u00f2mos, f\u00f2ron).\n\nThe infinitive in \u2013er- in many verbs in Castillian is in -ir: \u2018morrer\u2019, \u2018encher\u2019, \u2018ferver\u2019, \u2018render\u2019, etc., less frequently, the form hesitates: \u2018valir\u2019/\u2019valer\u2019 y \u2018tosir\u2019/\u2019toser\u2019.\n\nAn alternation occurs -e- open and closed in verbs with-e-open rizot\u00f3nica for which the -e- radical of the singular and the third person plural.\n\nFoe verbs ending in in-cer, the first person singular present indicative and subjunctive present are treated as ces: ce lluzo, lluce, lluza, lluzas, lluza.\n\nThere is an alternation between open and closed in the thematic vowel tonic of most verbs in -er.\n\nClosed -e- is typical for all persons in the plural of the perfect, six of pluperfect simple, all the imperfect subjunctive in the two series, and forms of the gerund and the first person future, in the first and second person plural present, the plural of the imperative of the first and second person plural of the future, both as in the hypothetical future-e.\n\nVerbs (medir and sentir) show an alternation i/e in the root vowel: with -i-in the strong forms (forms in the singular and the third plural of the present, the singular imperative and all of the subjunctive) and -e-in the weak vowels.\n\nWestern Asturian occurs accentuates the first and second persons of the plural present subjunctive.\n\n* Garcia Garcia and Celso Mu\u00f1iz admit the existence of composite shapes with verb \u2018ter\u2019 as an assistant. However, that is more from such an approach particular of the authors on the morphosyntax of the compound forms than as the existence of their own specialty in Eonavian.\n\n===Nouns===\n\n* The [[gender]] and the [[number]] are o/a, os/as. These forms are altered the loss of intervolcalic -n-: ratois (mice), caxois (drawers).\n* The instability of nasal consonants alters also augmentatives and diminutives: ''cas\u00faa'' (big house), pedr\u00faa (big stones), cas\u00eda (small house), pedr\u00eda (small stone), etc.\n* It is also characteristic of Eonavian to change gender to specify a group or an unknown number of things: \"el anada\", \"el herba\", (\"a herba\" a blade of grass, \"el hierba\", a grass farod) and in adverbial locutions to \"da feito\" (in fact), \"da remoyo\" (soacking), etc.\n* Although the forms of gender-neutral are widespread, highlighted by Fr\u00edas Conde, the use of the forms is from the influence of Castilian, and the forms used to be unknown in Eonavian (\u00abLos derivados de \"ille\" e \"illum\" en el gallego de Asturias\u00bb, Revista de Filolog\u00eda Rom\u00e1nica, n\u00ba 10, 1993, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013252), so it is strange that it is precisely the neutral \"lo\", the only article that begins in a consonant, it is beyond question it is {{clarify|considerwd|date=January 2017}} that no analyst records the existence of contractions with -lo', something unacceptable in Galician and Asturian.\n\n==Syntax==\n\n===Pronouns===\n* The Latin vocalism of the first-person pronoun, albeit with different embodiments, is retained: \u00e8u/\u00e8o.\n* There is a general extension of prepositional contractions of a similar nature. Contractions of unstressed pronouns, accusative dative are used more: mo, ma, mas, cho, cha, chas, yo, yos, yas.\n* The accusative and the dative in the personal pronouns are distinguished: the second person is te/che, the third person ye/lo/la. Pronominal form \u00abmin\u00bb is always a complement with a preposition: a min, por min, de min, etc.\n* Use of an interest dative: \u2018\u2019Eso nun che me gusta nada, vouch\u00e9me fer un traxe, llev\u00e1bachebos un traxe, \u00e9che grande, vaiye cansao\u2019\u2019: the pronomes \"che\"- and \u2013\"ye\"- have a sympathetic or interest value to highlight the attention of the recipient of the action. However, the indirect object lost the condition when it is preceded by the reflexive indirect object.\n*  The lack of reflexive complement.is replaced by different forms: \u2018\u2019ye: yo, ya, yos, yas, as\u00ed: deoyo, llevayo\u2019\u2019, etc.\n\n===Partitives===\n* Retention of prepositional syntagma partitives (accusative partial) in restrictive clauses or specification of content with transitive verbs.<ref>{{in lang|ast}} See too \u00abInforme sobre a fala ou gallego asturiano\u00bb, publicado por la [[Academia de la Lengua Asturiana]] en 2006, p. 31; Bechara, Evanildo, Moderna Gram\u00e1tica Portuguesa, 36\u00aa edici\u00f3n, 2003, p. 161; {{in lang|gl}} Cidr\u00e1s Esc\u00e1neo, Francisco (1998): \"Marcaxe preposicional do obxecto en galego.

It is very interesting its conservation by the massive information provided a community so small as the Villanueva de Oscos Abbey. The documents show us the vitality of this language in the [[Middle Ages]] and give very important information on Romance languages in the northwest of [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The Chartulary preserves 616 parchments about the Middle Ages: 32 from the 12th century, 261 from the 13th century, 224 from the 14th century and 99 from the 15th century.<ref>Alv\u00e1rez Castrill\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Antonio, ''Colecci\u00f3n Diplom\u00e1tica del Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Villanueva de Oscos'', Ridea, 2011, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe first scholar who dealt with its study was Aureliano Fern\u00e1ndez-Guerra in 1865, in the very important article \u00abSpeech about the Carther of Aviles\u00bb. He used extracts of 19 documents from 1256 to 1316. In 1868, Mart\u00edn Sangrador y Vitores included in his work about the Asturias administration a copy in Galician of the royal prerogative given away by [[Fernando II of Portugal|Fernando II]] to the Abbey. The next edition of the documents about monastery had to wait until the mid-20th century, when the [[Royal Institute of Asturian Studies]] (RIDEA) edited the article \u00abEl convento benedictino de Villanueva de Ozcos\u00bb<ref>[http://www.ridea.org/biblioteca/bidea/PDFs/022-07.pdf \u00abEl convento benedictino de Villanueva de Ozcos\u00bb BIDEA n\u00ba 22, 1954]</ref> by Marcos G. Mart\u00ednez, a rather poor edition. Only in 1981, Pedro Floriano Llorente publishes in RIDEA \u00abColecci\u00f3n dipolom\u00e1tica de Villanueva de Ozcos\u00bb,<ref>{{in lang|es}} Vid. Floriano LLorente, Pedro, \u00abColecci\u00f3n dipolom\u00e1tica de Villanueva de Ozcos\u00bb 1st serial, BIDEA 102, Oviedo, 1981, p. 127-190.</ref> which implies an important improvement concerning the previous, both by perfection technical, as by the personal and toponymic references.\n\nNonetheless, the edition dealt with the issue only as far as 1200. In 1994, the Britonia journal published the second serial of the monastery's parchments, edited by Floriano Llorente, covering until the first half of the 13th century. The edition, however, failed to meet the editors' expectations.because no documents were produced in Romance so Britonia published a second version, less known, to covers until 1300, more interesting for the study of the question.\n\nThe works served as a basis to publish another set of documents by Professor Alv\u00e1rez Castrill\u00f3n in his book ''Los Ozcos en los siglos X-XIII, un modelo de organizaci\u00f3n social del espacio en la Asturias medieval'', (2001), but the work addresses only the historic aspects and not the linguistics. In the following years, Professor Sanz Fuentes has published also four other documents with regard to Buron Hospital. Finally, Alv\u00e1rez Castrill\u00f3n, edited, in 2008, 605 more parchments as attachments to the book \u00abLa Comarca de los Oscos en la Edad Media, poblamiento, econom\u00eda y poder\u00bb, and in 2011, he edited 293 more documents from 1139 to 1300, ''Colecci\u00f3n Diplom\u00e1tica del Monasterio de Santa Mar\u00eda de Villanueva de Oscos, (1139-1300)''.\n\nThe documents of the chartulary give important information for knowledge of the language spoken in the western Asturias in the Middle Ages. They show the origin and the evolution of this language, but the serial of parchments finishes with the arrival the [[Religious congregation|Congregation]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] in 1511 at Monastery, the end of a cycle and will be the beginning of a new one, the big economic growth around the iron industry. However, the installation of the reformed order closed the documental history of this language, until its resurgence in the late 19th century.\n\n==Sample texts==\n{{quote|...Testo uobis et concedo per suis terminis certis per termino de Menustux e inde de super ad petram de Gio a Cornu de Menyones, et ad penna de Teyxeyra, et al Pico pequeno, et allas mestas de Bouspoulim) et como uay pello regueyro a Sobrepe aa pena das ouellas, et inde in directum ad petra Vocatoria et ad aquam de Ferue\u00e7a et c\u00f3modo uertitur aquam al final de Pena Leyra, na Gauia per ubi potueritis inueniere....

Navia'''\n|}\n\n==Literature==\nThe first known writer in Eonavian language perhaps could be [[Fernan Soares de Qui\u00f1ones]] or [[Fernan Soares de Qui\u00f1ones|Quinh\u00f5es dos cancioneiros]], a troubadour of the last third of the 13th century. He was the author of four songs of moral satire, known as ''([[c\u00e1ntigas de escarnio y maldecir]])''. One of the [[c\u00e1ntigas]] relates, in ancient [[Galician-Portuguese language]], to the \"costumes\" (manners) and \"feituras\" (facts) of the \"Cavalon\" (old horse), which tells the adventures of a nobleman who lived in Seville, and had come from [[Oscos Region]] in \"Esturas\" ([[Asturias]]) on the border with Galicia. The verses are included in a \"c\u00e1ntiga\" that is within the theme of \"escarnio\" (ridicule) and \"maldecir\" (cursing) but with the impersonation which is typical of the ''\"C\u00e1ntiga de amigo\"'' (friend song). Anyway, it seems that the reference to the knight of Oscos presents allegorical connotations to the origin of the Asturian knight that might be related with the type of speech used in the cantiga.<ref>{{in lang|es}} Beltran, Vicen\u00e7; Tipos y temas trovadorescos XIII. Fernan Soarez de Quinhones; pp. 394-397. Beltran, Vicen\u00e7; La Corte de Babel. Los problemas de Fern\u00e1n Soarez de Qui\u00f1ones; pp. 212</ref>\n\nAfter the arrival of the [[Castillian Congregation]] at the [monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de [[Villanueva de Oscos]] in 1511, the written record of the language ended until its resurgence in the late 19th century.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century was an identification with Galician, reflected in authors like [[Cotarelo Valledor]] and [[Antolin Santos Ferraria]], who wrote entirely in Galician. Fernandez and Fernandez and Bernardo Acevedo Huelves were the first authors who are aware of the peculiarities of this language. The latest one is usually attributed the first sonnet in this language:  ''\"Vust\u00e9 era un gran se\u00f1or, Eu era un gran probe\"''(You was a great lord, I was a large poor man). A poet contemporary of them was Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, (1870-1938), who showedthe influence of the modernist spirit, prevailing in the early 20th century. His best-known work is a long poem entitled ''\"El xard\u00edn\"''. Another poet in that time was Villar Conrado Loza (Taramundi 1873-Tapia 1962), who focused on themes around migration, recurring theme in folk literature on the early 20th century.\n\nAfter the [[Spanish Civil War]] was a decline of the literature in Asturian Galician, which lost the identity features that were beginning to appear. Folk literature was mixing Galician and Castilian and tended to be anecdotic rather than purely literary. In the 1970s, thanks to the work of authors such as [[Damaso Alonso]], writers of the western end of Asturia began to reaffirm the identity of their language, such as Manuel Garcia Sanchez, known Manolo Galano, particularly concerned about the popular culture of the region and published, in 1994, with Jacinto L\u00f3pez D\u00edaz ''\"Vocabulario da Roda\"'' and had published in 1984:  ''\"Cuentos Parzamiques\"''. He was a frequent contributor to the magazine Entrambasauguas and published, in 2005, a recast of twenty written contributions to the magazine in the book ''\"Vento d'outono\"''. Beside them are some more recent authors as Xose Miguel Suarez (Mantaras, Tapia, 1965) and Xavier Frias Conde. The writers started their literary careers, from the philological study of the language albeit from very different perspectives.\n\nThe difficulty of publishing books for an audience so small makes it most remarkable of all that the literature projects through various magazines of the region. The oldest magazine is \"A Freita\", which appeared in eleven numbers, a general magazine that started to being published in 1992. Among its contributors were writers like Benigno Fernandez Bra\u00f1a, Xan Casta\u00f1eira, Xos\u00e9 Maximo Fernandez Muniz, Adela Valledor Conde, etc. In 1995, the magazine attached a literary supplement, published to makes noticed to the authors of Eonavia in other formats, through a kind of less formal book.<ref>{{in lang|es}} See, for example, Fr\u00edas Conde, FJ; \u00abNos conf\u00edns da literatura galega: escritores asturianos en galego\u00bb; Revista de lenguas y literaturas catalana, gallega y vasca, number 5, 1996\u20111997 pp. 223-240</ref>\n\nSince 1996, the Department of Linguistics of Eo Navia has published the magazine \"Entrabasauguas\". Among the writers often to collaborating are [[Veiguela Crisanto]] (Vegadeo 1959), Alejandro Blanco Antunez, (Navia 1933), Teresa Lopez, (Boal 1950), [[Xoxe Carlos Alvarez Blanco]], [[Xavier Vilareyo]] (Mieres 1967), [[Fredo de Carbexe]] (El Franco 1967), etc.\n\nIn theatre, there is some tradition like in Villar and Manuel Galano. Lately, old plays have been recovered: \"Condo el cari\u00f1o \u00e8 de Verd\u00e1\", a comedy released in 1936 by Association Armal, and \"El tratto de FF Arias\", premiered in Figueras in 1926.\n\n==Associations==\nIn the dialectal area are associations supporting each side, such as [[Asociaci\u00f3n Abertal]] (defending the Galician theory) and [[Xeira]] or Fala Viva (defending the Asturian theory). Its protection and [[language policy]] are the responsibility of the Asturian government and the [[Secretar\u00eda Lling\u00fc\u00edstica del Navia-Eo]], a division of the [[Academia de la Llingua Asturiana]] responsible for the area. There are two different orthographies for Eonavian, the official one (more Asturian-like) as well as one made by the Mesa pr\u00e1 Defensa del Galego de Asturias (more Galician-like).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iberian languages]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.romaniaminor.net/gramatiques/gramatica_eonaviega.pdf Eonavian grammar] (Galician theory)\n* [http://www.amesa.org Mesa for the defense of Gallego de Asturias] (defending the Galician theory)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134204/http://www.xabielxeira.e.telefonica.net/index.htm Xeira] (defending the Asturian theory)\n\n{{Languages of Spain}}\n{{Romance languages}}\n\n[[Category:Galician language]]\n[[Category:Asturian language]]\n", "name_user": "Wydd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eComparative table", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician-Asturian"}

It then turned west and entered the Dargan's Creek valley. After climbing out the head of this valley it reached an escarpment where the Zigzag was constructed to reach the valley floor. The Zig Zag was created by the track switching back on itself twice to reach the bottom of the [[Great Dividing Range]]. From here it continued west to Lithgow. This section was opened on 18 October 1869.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nThe 1869 Zig Zag became a bottleneck to the flow of traffic and as early as 1885, consideration was given to its replacement. In 1897, the first major change was made, known as Dargan's Creek Deviation. This involved traversing the Dargan's Creek Valley on the northern side of the creek instead of the south. The line was still single-track at this point, and this soon became a bottleneck. In order to alleviate this, electric staff crossing loops were added at Edgecombe in 1901 (between [[Clarence, New South Wales|Clarence]] and Top Points) and Dargan's in 1902 (between [[Bell, New South Wales|Bell]] and Clarence).<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nIn 1906, a new junction and station were constructed at the first Newnes Junction Station. The junction was for the private [[Newnes railway line]].<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nBy 1910, it had become evident that a new route was required for the descent to Lithgow. Accordingly, a new route, known as the Ten Tunnels Deviation, was built and the Dargan's Creek Deviation was closed. The existing stations were all closed, with Newnes Junction relocated closer to [[Sydney]], and a new Clarence station built where the line goes under the [[Bells Line of Road]]. The Newnes Line closed after 25 years of operation in 1932, and only the formation remains.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nThe Ten Tunnel Deviation started at Newnes Junction and finished at Bottom Points (now Zig Zag platform). As its name suggests, it featured 10 new tunnels, and it bypassed the Zig Zag. The new route broadly followed the previous one as far as Newnes Junction, before turning south and taking a more circuitous route via the tunnels to emerge from the final one near the base of the Zig Zag.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nSupplies to the line during construction were provided by a funicular railway that descended {{convert|350|ft|m|0|order=flip}} from the ridge to a location near No. 10 tunnel. Up to 1500 day employees worked on the project.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nThe deviation was a part of the duplication of the Main Western Railway between [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] and Lithgow. Upon completion the deviation comprised ten tunnels of varying length from {{convert|77|to|902|yd|m|0|order=flip}}. The work also included the excavation of the deepest cutting of {{convert|200|ft|m|0|order=flip}} on the NSW rail system. Journey times were reduced by between 20 and 30 minutes. Also, the gradient was reduced from 1 in 42 to 1 in 90, thereby allowing a doubling in the loads of trains.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nIn 1972, a group of enthusiasts formed the Zig Zag Cooperative, and took over the track between the original Clarence station and Bottom Points and today the [[Zig Zag Railway]] is a successful tourist operation based at the restored Clarence station. A new Cityrail platform, Zig Zag was constructed on the Main Western line to allow public transport access to the Zig Zag. The previous stations at Newnes Junction and Clarence have closed, with little trace of the latter remaining.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Lithgow funicular.jpg|thumb|A [[funicular]] rail line was used for supplies.]]\nThe Act approving the construction of the double line deviation was passed by the New South Wales Parliament in December 1906.<ref name=network/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/1906-36.pdf | title=Great Western Railway Deviation (Lithgow Zigzag) Act, 1906 }}</ref> Construction started near the former Oakey Park Colliery on the 1 in 42 Bottom Road, which had already been duplicated in 1880. It eventually passed Bottom Points before entering a series of ten tunnels. Originally eleven were planned, but one of them was opened out instead, owing to the discovery of rock faults, leaving the deepest cutting on the New South Wales rail system. The headquarters for the works was at nearby [[Clarence, New South Wales|Clarence]], where many of the [[Navvy|navvies]] were temporarily housed. Here a temporary power station was established for rock drills, lighting, compressors, etc.<ref name=sing>{{cite journal |title=The Railway Crossing of the Blue Mountains |author1=Wylie, R.

At one isolated point, horses and drays were placed on to the worksite by means of a crane and long jibs. There they remained until the tunnels were completed to provide them with a way out.<ref name=network/> The supply of materials for tunnels 8, 9 and 10 was expedited by the construction of a {{convert|350|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} [[funicular]]<ref name=nswshr-1037/> of the 4-rail type from near Mount Sinai on the original line.<ref name=sing/> Only experienced miners were employed on the more dangerous tunnelling activities, which were carried out by day and night;<ref name=network/> with approximately 1,500 employees working each day.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nThe tunnels were situated on a maximum grade of 1 in 90. The line curves towards Newnes Junction after leaving the tunnels at the eastern end. Newnes Junction also had to be moved {{convert|660|m}} to its current place, and two more tracks were also constructed for the [[Commonwealth Oil Corporation]]'s Newnes railway line.<ref name=network/> When the deviation was completed, much of the equipment was moved to the deviation of the [[Lapstone Zig Zag]], as well as the navvies.

It is of a high level of technical significance as a large scale engineering achievement of the early 20th century including excavation of the deepest cutting on the NSW rail system. The project was one of the great railway deviations constructed throughout NSW, and was a success in reducing both journey time and track gradient, and continues to be in use today. The tunnels form part of a larger railway landscape in the Lithgow area and across the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] including the Zig Zag railway, Dargan's Creek Deviation, Eskbank Goods Yard and the State Mine Colliery railway.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nTen Tunnels Deviation was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Ten Tunnel Deviation is historically significant as the second phase of the Great Dividing Range railway crossing. The project was one of the great railway deviations and is still in use today.

It then turned west and entered the Dargan's Creek valley. After climbing out the head of this valley it reached an escarpment where the Zigzag was constructed to reach the valley floor. The Zig Zag was created by the track switching back on itself twice to reach the bottom of the [[Great Dividing Range]]. From here it continued west to Lithgow. This section was opened on 18 October 1869.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nThe 1869 Zig Zag became a bottleneck to the flow of traffic and as early as 1885, consideration was given to its replacement. In 1897, the first major change was made, known as Dargan's Creek Deviation. This involved traversing the Dargan's Creek Valley on the northern side of the creek instead of the south. The line was still single-track at this point, and this soon became a bottleneck. In order to alleviate this, electric staff crossing loops were added at Edgecombe in 1901 (between [[Clarence, New South Wales|Clarence]] and Top Points) and Dargan's in 1902 (between [[Bell, New South Wales|Bell]] and Clarence).<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nIn 1906, a new junction and station were constructed at the first Newnes Junction Station. The junction was for the private [[Newnes railway line]].<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nBy 1910, it had become evident that a new route was required for the descent to Lithgow. Accordingly, a new route, known as the Ten Tunnels Deviation, was built and the Dargan's Creek Deviation was closed. The existing stations were all closed, with Newnes Junction relocated closer to [[Sydney]], and a new Clarence station built where the line goes under the [[Bells Line of Road]]. The Newnes Line closed after 25 years of operation in 1932, and only the formation remains.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nThe Ten Tunnel Deviation started at Newnes Junction and finished at Bottom Points (now Zig Zag platform). As its name suggests, it featured 10 new tunnels, and it bypassed the Zig Zag. The new route broadly followed the previous one as far as Newnes Junction, before turning south and taking a more circuitous route via the tunnels to emerge from the final one near the base of the Zig Zag.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nSupplies to the line during construction were provided by a funicular railway that descended {{convert|350|ft|m|0|order=flip}} from the ridge to a location near No. 10 tunnel. Up to 1500 day employees worked on the project.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nThe deviation was a part of the duplication of the Main Western Railway between [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] and Lithgow. Upon completion the deviation comprised ten tunnels of varying length from {{convert|77|to|902|yd|m|0|order=flip}}. The work also included the excavation of the deepest cutting of {{convert|200|ft|m|0|order=flip}} on the NSW rail system. Journey times were reduced by between 20 and 30 minutes. Also, the gradient was reduced from 1 in 42 to 1 in 90, thereby allowing a doubling in the loads of trains.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nIn 1972, a group of enthusiasts formed the Zig Zag Cooperative, and took over the track between the original Clarence station and Bottom Points and today the [[Zig Zag Railway]] is a successful tourist operation based at the restored Clarence station. A new Cityrail platform, Zig Zag was constructed on the Main Western line to allow public transport access to the Zig Zag. The previous stations at Newnes Junction and Clarence have closed, with little trace of the latter remaining.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Lithgow funicular.jpg|thumb|A [[funicular]] rail line was used for supplies.]]\nThe Act approving the construction of the double line deviation was passed by the New South Wales Parliament in December 1906.<ref name=network/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/act/1906-36.pdf | title=Great Western Railway Deviation (Lithgow Zigzag) Act, 1906 }}</ref> Construction started near the former Oakey Park Colliery on the 1 in 42 Bottom Road, which had already been duplicated in 1880. It eventually passed Bottom Points before entering a series of ten tunnels. Originally eleven were planned, but one of them was opened out instead, owing to the discovery of rock faults, leaving the deepest cutting on the New South Wales rail system. The headquarters for the works was at nearby [[Clarence, New South Wales|Clarence]], where many of the [[Navvy|navvies]] were temporarily housed. Here a temporary power station was established for rock drills, lighting, compressors, etc.<ref name=sing>{{cite journal |title=The Railway Crossing of the Blue Mountains |author1=Wylie, R.

At one isolated point, horses and drays were placed on to the worksite by means of a crane and long jibs. There they remained until the tunnels were completed to provide them with a way out.<ref name=network/> The supply of materials for tunnels 8, 9 and 10 was expedited by the construction of a {{convert|350|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} [[funicular]]<ref name=nswshr-1037/> of the 4-rail type from near Mount Sinai on the original line.<ref name=sing/> Only experienced miners were employed on the more dangerous tunnelling activities, which were carried out by day and night;<ref name=network/> with approximately 1,500 employees working each day.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nThe tunnels were situated on a maximum grade of 1 in 90. The line curves towards Newnes Junction after leaving the tunnels at the eastern end. Newnes Junction also had to be moved {{convert|660|m}} to its current place, and two more tracks were also constructed for the [[Commonwealth Oil Corporation]]'s Newnes railway line.<ref name=network/> When the deviation was completed, much of the equipment was moved to the deviation of the [[Lapstone Zig Zag]], as well as the navvies. As a result, the population of Clarence declined rapidly.<ref name=nswshr-1037/>\n\nThe deviation was electrified along with the rest of the line in 1957.<ref name=nswshr-1037/> In 1978, the roadbed of the Ten Tunnels was lowered to allow [[NSW TrainLink V set|double deck V sets]] to operate on the line.<ref name=network/><ref>\"NSW slab track installation completed\" ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' January 1979 page 31</ref> In 2018, modifications are planned to accommodate the [[NSW TrainLink D set|D sets]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180205162128/https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects/current-projects/new-intercity-fleet-program-ten-tunnels New Intercity Fleet Program Ten Tunnels Deviation Modifications] Transport for NSW 5 February 2018</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe deviation comprises ten tunnels of varying length from {{convert|77|to|902|yd|m|0|order=flip}}.

It is of a high level of technical significance as a large scale engineering achievement of the early 20th century including excavation of the deepest cutting on the NSW rail system. The project was one of the great railway deviations constructed throughout NSW, and was a success in reducing both journey time and track gradient, and continues to be in use today.

Then in 1901, he was sent to [[Rugby School|Rugby]] with his more academically successful brother, where he was a boarder in School House. A moderate pupil, he studied [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] but was described by a teacher as \"not a good classic\".<ref>Kinvig, ''Scapegoat: General Percival of Singapore'', p5</ref> Percival's only qualification on leaving in 1906 was a higher school certificate.

Percival, then his Chief Staff Officer, was tasked to draw up a tactical assessment of how the Japanese were most likely to attack.\nIn late 1937, his analysis duly confirmed that north [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] might become the critical battleground. The Japanese were likely to seize the east coast landing sites on [[Thailand]] and Malaya in order to capture aerodromes and achieve air superiority. This could serve as a prelude to further Japanese landings in [[Johore]] to disrupt communications northwards and enable the construction of another main base in North Borneo. From North Borneo, the final sea and air assault could be launched against eastern Singapore\u2014in particular the [[Changi]] area.<ref>Ong, Chit Chung (1997) ''Operation Matador : Britain's war plans against the Japanese 1918\u20131941''. Singapore : Times Academic Press.</ref>\n\n===General Officer Commanding (Malaya)===\nIn April 1941 Percival was promoted to acting [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35160 |supp=y|page=2731|date=9 May 1941}}</ref> and was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Malaya. This was a significant promotion for him as he had never commanded an army [[Corps]]. He left Britain in a [[Sunderland flying boat]] and embarked on an arduous two-week, multi-stage flight via [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]] (where he was delayed by the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), [[Basra]], [[Karachi]] and [[Yangon|Rangoon]], where he was met by an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] transport.<ref name=\"percival1\" />\n\nPercival had mixed feelings about his appointment, noting that \"In going to Malaya I realised that there was the double danger either of being left in an inactive command for some years if war did not break out in the East or, if it did, of finding myself involved in a pretty sticky business with the inadequate forces which are usually to be found in the distant parts of our [[British Empire|Empire]] in the early stages of a war.\"<ref name=\"percival2\" />\n\nFor much of the interwar period, Britain's defensive plan for Malaya had centred on the dispatch of a [[Royal Navy|naval]] fleet to the newly built [[Singapore Naval Base]]. Accordingly, the army's role was to defend Singapore and Southern [[Johore]]. While this plan had seemed adequate when the nearest Japanese base had been {{convert|1700|mi|km}} away, the outbreak of war in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], combined with the partial Japanese occupation of the northern part of [[French Indochina]] and the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact]] in September 1940, had underlined the difficulty of a sea-based defence. Instead it was proposed to use the RAF to defend Malaya, at least until reinforcements could be dispatched from Britain. This led to the building of airfields in northern Malaya and along its east coast and the dispersal of the available army units around the peninsula to protect them.<ref>Percival, Chapter 3</ref>\n\nOn arrival, Percival set about training his inexperienced army; his Indian troops were particularly raw, with most of their experienced officers having been withdrawn to support the formation of new units as the Indian army expanded. Relying upon commercial aircraft or the Volunteer air force to overcome the shortage of RAF planes, he toured the peninsula and encouraged the building of defensive works around [[Jitra]].<ref>Percival, Chapter 4</ref> A training manual approved by Percival, ''Tactical Notes on Malaya'', was distributed to all units.\n\nIn July 1941 when the Japanese occupied southern Indochina, Britain, the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]] imposed economic [[international sanctions|sanctions]], freezing Japanese financial assets and cutting Japan from its supplies of [[petroleum|oil]], [[tin]] and [[rubber]]. The sanctions were aimed at pressuring Japan to abandon its [[Second Sino-Japanese War|involvement in China]]; instead, the Japanese government planned to seize the resources of South-East Asia from the European nations by force. Both the Japanese navy and army were mobilised, but for the moment an uneasy state of cold war persisted. British Commonwealth reinforcements continued to trickle into Malaya. On 2 December, the [[battleship]] [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and the [[battle-cruiser]] [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']], escorted by four [[destroyer]]s, arrived in Singapore, the first time a battle fleet had been based there. (They were to have been accompanied by the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}} to provide air cover but she had run aground in the Caribbean en route.) The following day [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Ernest John Spooner|Spooner]] hosted a dinner attended by the newly arrived Commander-in-Chief [[Eastern Fleet]], [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Thomas Phillips (Naval officer)|Sir Tom Phillips]], and Percival.<ref>Percival, Chapter 7</ref>\n\n===Japanese attack and British surrender===\n{{main article|Japanese invasion of Malaya|Battle of Singapore}}\n[[File:Pacific War - Malaya 1941-42 - Map.jpg|thumb|350px|Malaya Command and the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya]]]]\n\nOn 8 December 1941 the [[Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)|Japanese 25th Army]] under the command of Lieutenant-General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] launched an [[amphibious assault]] on the Malay Peninsula (one hour before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the difference in date was because the two places lie on opposite sides of the [[international date line]]). That night the first Japanese invasion force arrived at [[Kota Bharu]] on Malaya's east coast. This was just a diversionary force, and the main landings took place the next day at [[Singora]] and [[Pattani (town)|Pattani]] on the south-eastern coast of [[Thailand]], with troops rapidly deploying over the border into northern Malaya.\n\nOn 10 December Percival issued a stirring, if ultimately ineffective, Special Order of the Day:\n<blockquote>In this hour of trial the General Officer Commanding calls upon all ranks Malaya Command for a determined and sustained effort to safeguard Malaya and the adjoining British territories. The eyes of the Empire are upon us. Our whole position in the Far East is at stake. The struggle may be long and grim but let us all resolve to stand fast come what may and to prove ourselves worthy of the great trust which has been placed in us.<ref>Percival, chapter 9</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Royal Engineers prepare to blow up a bridge in Malaya.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Engineers]] prepare to blow up a bridge during the retreat.]]\n\nThe Japanese advanced rapidly, and on 27 January 1942 Percival ordered a general retreat across the [[Johore Strait]] to the island of [[Singapore]] and organised a defence along the length of the island's {{convert|70|mi|km|sing=on}} coast line. But the Japanese did not dawdle, and on 8 February Japanese troops landed on the northwest corner of Singapore island. After a week of fighting on the island, Percival held his final command conference at 9&nbsp;am on 15 February in [[the Battle Box]] of [[Fort Canning]]. The Japanese had already occupied approximately half of Singapore and it was clear that the island would soon fall.  Having been told that ammunition and water would both run out by the following day, Percival agreed to surrender. The Japanese at this point were running low on artillery shells, but Percival did not know this.\n\nThe Japanese insisted that Percival himself march under a [[white flag]] to the [[Old Ford Motor Factory]] in [[Bukit Timah]] to negotiate the surrender. A Japanese officer present noted that he looked \"pale, thin and tired\".<ref>Warren, p265</ref> After a brief disagreement, when Percival insisted that the British keep 1,000 men under arms in Singapore to preserve order, which Yamashita finally conceded, it was agreed at 6:10&nbsp;pm that the British Empire troops would lay down their arms and cease resistance at 8:30&nbsp;pm. This was in spite of instructions from Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] for prolonged resistance.<ref name=\"Morris\"/> The [[Pacific War]] was just ten weeks old.\n\nA common view holds that 138,708 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel surrendered or were killed by fewer than 30,000 Japanese. However, the former figure includes nearly 50,000 troops captured or killed during the [[Battle of Malaya]], and perhaps 15,000 base troops. Many of the other troops were tired and under-equipped following their retreat from the [[Malayan peninsula]]. Conversely, the latter number represents only the front-line troops available for the invasion of Singapore. British Empire battle casualties since 8 December amounted to 7,500 killed and 11,000 wounded. Japanese losses totalled around 3,500 killed and 6,100 wounded.<ref>Thompson, p9 and p424</ref>\n\n===Culpability for the fall of Singapore===\n[[File:Singaporesurrender.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant-General Percival led by a Japanese officer, marches under a flag of [[truce]] to negotiate the capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore, on 15 February 1942. It was the largest surrender of British-led forces in history.]]\nChurchill viewed the fall of Singapore to be \"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.\" However, the British defence was that the [[Middle East]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had all received higher priorities in the allocation of men and material, so the desired [[air force]] strength of 300 to 500 aircraft was never reached, and whereas the Japanese invaded with over two hundred [[tank]]s, the British Army in Malaya did not have a single tank.<ref>Kinvig.</ref> In ''The War in Malaya'' Percival himself cites this as the major factor for the defeat stating that the 'war material which might have saved Singapore was sent to Russia and the Middle East'. However he also concedes that Britain was engaged in 'a life and death struggle in the West' and that 'this decision, however painful and regrettable, was inevitable and right'.<ref>The War in Malaya; Authur Percival p306</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Percival had been described as \"a slim, soft spoken man... with a proven reputation for bravery and organisational powers\"<ref>Kinvig, p. 47.</ref> but by 1945 this description had been turned on its head with even Percival's defenders describing him as \"something of a damp squib\".<ref>Kinvig, p. 242.</ref> The fall of Singapore switched Percival's reputation to that of an ineffective \"staff wallah\", lacking ruthlessness and aggression, even though few doubted that he was a brave and determined officer. Over six feet in height and lanky, with a clipped moustache and two protruding teeth, and unphotogenic, Percival was an easy target for a caricaturist, being described as \"tall, bucktoothed and lightly built\".<ref>Warren, p. 29.</ref> There was no doubt his presentation lacked impact as \"his manner was low key and he was a poor public speaker with the cusp of a lisp\".<ref>Kinvig, ''General Percival and the Fall of Singapore'', p. 241.</ref>\n[[File:BritishSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lieutenant-General Yamashita (seated, centre) thumps the table with his fist to emphasise his demand for unconditional surrender.

Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham|Robert Brooke-Popham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[British Far East Command]], refused Percival permission to launch [[Operation Matador (1941)|Operation Matador]] in advance of the Japanese landings in Thailand, not wishing to run any risk of provoking the coming war. Brooke-Popham also had a reputation for falling asleep in meetings and not arguing forcefully for the air reinforcements required to defend Malaya. Admiral [[Thomas Spencer Vaughan Phillips|Tom Phillips]]' leadership of [[Force Z]] led to his demise and the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|destruction of the British fleet]] on 10 December 1941, early in the campaign.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Peter Wykeham]] suggested that the government in London was more to blame than any of the British commanders in the Far East. Despite repeated requests, the British government did not provide the necessary reinforcements and they denied Brooke-Popham \u2013 and therefore Percival \u2013 permission to enter neutral Thailand before it was too late to put in place forward defences.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite journal| last =Wykeham| first =Peter| author2 =Thomas Paul Ofcansky| title =Popham, Sir (Henry) Robert Moore Brooke| work =Oxford Dictionary of National Biography| url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/32/101032096/| date =January 2008| doi =10.1093/ref:odnb/32096}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Percival had difficulties with his subordinates [[Lewis Heath|Sir Lewis \"Piggy\" Heath]], commanding [[Indian III Corps]], and the independent-minded [[Gordon Bennett (general)|Gordon Bennett]], commanding the [[Australian 8th Division]]. The former officer had been senior to Percival prior to his appointment as GOC (Malaya). Bennett was full of confidence in his [[Australia]]n troops and his own ability, but faced a mixed reaction in Australia when he escaped from Singapore immediately after its surrender.\n\nPercival was ultimately responsible for the men who served under him, and with other officers \u2013 notably Major-General [[David Murray-Lyon]], commander of the [[Indian 11th Infantry Division]] \u2013 he had shown a willingness to replace them when he felt their performance was not up to scratch. Perhaps his greatest mistake was to resist the building of fixed defences in either Johore or the north shore of Singapore, dismissing them in the face of repeated requests to start construction from his Chief Engineer, Brigadier [[Ivan Simson]], with the comment \"Defences are bad for morale \u2013 for both troops and civilians\".<ref>Thompson, p. 182.</ref> In doing so, Percival threw away the potential advantages he could have derived from the 6,000 engineers under his command and perhaps missed his best chance to blunt the danger posed by the Japanese tanks.\n\nPercival also insisted on defending the north-eastern shore of Singapore most heavily, against the advice of the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|Allied supreme commander in South East Asia]], General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]]. Percival was perhaps fixed on his responsibilities for defending the Singapore Naval Base.<ref>Dixon, ''[[On the Psychology of Military Incompetence]]'', p. 143.</ref> He also spread his forces thinly around the island and kept few units as a strategic reserve. When the Japanese attack came in the west, the [[Australian 22nd Brigade]] took the brunt of the assault.<ref>Thompson, p. 414.</ref> Percival refused to reinforce them as he continued to believe that the main assault would occur in the north east.<ref>Thompson, p. 430.</ref>\n\n===Captivity===\nPercival himself was briefly held prisoner in [[Changi Prison]], where \"the defeated GOC could be seen sitting head in hands, outside the married quarters he now shared with seven brigadiers, a colonel, his ADC and cook-sergeant. He discussed feelings with few, spent hours walking around the extensive compound, ruminating on the reverse and what might have been\".<ref>Kinvig, p221</ref> In the belief that it would improve discipline, he reconstituted a Malaya Command, complete with staff appointments, and helped occupy his fellow prisoners with lectures on the [[Battle of France]].<ref>MacArthur, ''Surviving the Sword: Prisoners of the Japanese 1942\u201345'', p188</ref>\n[[File:Douglas MacArthur signs formal surrender.jpg|left|thumb|The signing of the Japanese surrender; [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] (sitting), behind him are Generals Percival (background) and [[Jonathan M. Wainwright (general)|Wainwright]] (foreground).]]\n\nAlong with the other senior British captives above the rank of colonel, Percival was removed from Singapore in August 1942. First he was imprisoned in [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and then sent on to [[Manchuria]], where he was held with several dozen other VIP captives, including the [[United States|American]] General [[Jonathan M. Wainwright (general)|Jonathan Wainwright]], in a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] near [[Xi'an District, Mudanjiang|Hsian]], about {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the north east of [[Mukden]].\n\nAs the war drew to an end, an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] team removed the prisoners from Hsian. Percival was then taken, along with Wainwright, to stand immediately behind General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as he confirmed the terms of the Japanese surrender aboard [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'' (BB-63)]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on 2 September 1945.<ref>''Battleship Missouri Memorial'', {{cite web|url=http://www.ussmissouri.org/surrender.aspx |title=Surrender |accessdate=2006-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109061015/http://ussmissouri.org/surrender.aspx |archivedate=9 November 2005 |df=dmy }} , accessed 2 February 2006</ref> Afterwards, MacArthur gave Percival a pen he had used to sign the treaty.<ref>Warren, p286</ref>\n\nPercival and Wainwright then returned together to the [[Philippines]] to witness the surrender of the Japanese army there, which in a twist of fate was commanded by General Yamashita. Yamashita was momentarily surprised to see his former captive at the ceremony; on this occasion Percival refused to shake Yamashita's hand, angered by the mistreatment of POWs in Singapore. The flag carried by Percival's party on the way to Bukit Timah was also a witness to this reversal of fortunes, being flown when the Japanese formally surrendered Singapore back to Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]].<ref>Morris, p458</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nPercival returned to the United Kingdom in September 1945 to write his despatch at the [[War Office]] but this was revised by the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] and only published in 1948.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38215|pages=1245\u20131346|date=20 February 1948}}</ref> He retired from the army in 1946 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general but the pension of his substantive rank of major-general.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37706|page=4347|date=27 August 1946}}</ref> Thereafter, he held appointments connected with the county of Hertfordshire, where he lived at Bullards in [[Widford, Hertfordshire|Widford]]: he was Honorary Colonel of [[479th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]], ([[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|T.A.]]) from 1949 to 1954<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38762|page=5465|date=18 November 1949}}</ref><ref>Col J.D.

Percival's 1949 memoir, ''The War in Malaya'', did little to quell this criticism, being a restrained rather than self-serving account of the campaign. Unusual for a British lieutenant-general, Percival was not awarded a [[British honours system|knighthood]].\n\nPercival was respected for the time he had spent as a Japanese [[prisoner of war]]. Serving as life president of the [[Far East Prisoners of War]] Association (FEPOW), he pushed for compensation for his fellow captives, eventually helping to obtain a token \u00a35 million of frozen Japanese assets for this cause. This was distributed by the FEPOW Welfare Trust, on which Percival served as Chairman.<ref name = \"MacArthur442\">MacArthur, p. 442.</ref> He led protests against the film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' when it was released in 1957, obtaining the addition of an on-screen statement that the movie was a work of fiction.

She was the daughter of Thomas MacGregor Greer of Tallylagan Manor, a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[linen]] merchant from [[County Tyrone]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. They had met during his tour of duty in Ireland but it had taken Percival several years to propose. They had two children.

Then in 1901, he was sent to [[Rugby School|Rugby]] with his more academically successful brother, where he was a boarder in School House. A moderate pupil, he studied [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] but was described by a teacher as \"not a good classic\".<ref>Kinvig, ''Scapegoat: General Percival of Singapore'', p5</ref> Percival's only qualification on leaving in 1906 was a higher school certificate. He was a more successful sportsman, playing [[cricket]] and [[tennis]] and running [[cross-country running|cross country]].<ref>Smith, ''Singapore Burning: Heroism and Surrender in World War II'', p23</ref> He also rose to [[Colour Sergeant|colour sergeant]] in the school's Volunteer Rifle Corps. However, his military career began at a comparatively late age: although a member of Youngsbury Rifle Club, he was still working as a clerk for the iron ore merchants Naylor, Benzon & Company Limited in London, which he had joined in 1914, when the [[World War I]] broke out.\n\n===Enlistment and First World War===\nPercival enlisted on the first day of the war as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[Officer Training Corps]] of the [[Inns of Court]], at the age of 26, and was promoted after five weeks' basic training to temporary [[second lieutenant]].<ref name=commission>{{London Gazette|issue=29058 |supp=y|pages=1176\u20131179|date=2 February 1915}}</ref> Nearly one third of his fellow recruits would be dead by the end of the war.

The following day Barry found out that Percival had left the barracks at 6:00PM and was out raiding IRA houses while they were waiting for him.\n\nBarry later stated that Percival was \"easily the most vicious anti-Irish of all serving British officers\". <ref>Guerilla Days in Ireland, page 57-8 </ref>\n\nA second assassination squad was dispatched{{cn|date=May 2017}} to London in March 1921, but was forced to abandon the planned attack in [[Liverpool Street Station]] when they learned that the [[Metropolitan Police]] knew of their plans.

Percival, then his Chief Staff Officer, was tasked to draw up a tactical assessment of how the Japanese were most likely to attack.\nIn late 1937, his analysis duly confirmed that north [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] might become the critical battleground. The Japanese were likely to seize the east coast landing sites on [[Thailand]] and Malaya in order to capture aerodromes and achieve air superiority. This could serve as a prelude to further Japanese landings in [[Johore]] to disrupt communications northwards and enable the construction of another main base in North Borneo. From North Borneo, the final sea and air assault could be launched against eastern Singapore\u2014in particular the [[Changi]] area.<ref>Ong, Chit Chung (1997) ''Operation Matador : Britain's war plans against the Japanese 1918\u20131941''. Singapore : Times Academic Press.</ref>\n\n===General Officer Commanding (Malaya)===\nIn April 1941 Percival was promoted to acting [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35160 |supp=y|page=2731|date=9 May 1941}}</ref> and was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Malaya. This was a significant promotion for him as he had never commanded an army [[Corps]]. He left Britain in a [[Sunderland flying boat]] and embarked on an arduous two-week, multi-stage flight via [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]] (where he was delayed by the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), [[Basra]], [[Karachi]] and [[Yangon|Rangoon]], where he was met by an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] transport.<ref name=\"percival1\" />\n\nPercival had mixed feelings about his appointment, noting that \"In going to Malaya I realised that there was the double danger either of being left in an inactive command for some years if war did not break out in the East or, if it did, of finding myself involved in a pretty sticky business with the inadequate forces which are usually to be found in the distant parts of our [[British Empire|Empire]] in the early stages of a war.\"<ref name=\"percival2\" />\n\nFor much of the interwar period, Britain's defensive plan for Malaya had centred on the dispatch of a [[Royal Navy|naval]] fleet to the newly built [[Singapore Naval Base]]. Accordingly, the army's role was to defend Singapore and Southern [[Johore]]. While this plan had seemed adequate when the nearest Japanese base had been {{convert|1700|mi|km}} away, the outbreak of war in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], combined with the partial Japanese occupation of the northern part of [[French Indochina]] and the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact]] in September 1940, had underlined the difficulty of a sea-based defence. Instead it was proposed to use the RAF to defend Malaya, at least until reinforcements could be dispatched from Britain. This led to the building of airfields in northern Malaya and along its east coast and the dispersal of the available army units around the peninsula to protect them.<ref>Percival, Chapter 3</ref>\n\nOn arrival, Percival set about training his inexperienced army; his Indian troops were particularly raw, with most of their experienced officers having been withdrawn to support the formation of new units as the Indian army expanded. Relying upon commercial aircraft or the Volunteer air force to overcome the shortage of RAF planes, he toured the peninsula and encouraged the building of defensive works around [[Jitra]].<ref>Percival, Chapter 4</ref> A training manual approved by Percival, ''Tactical Notes on Malaya'', was distributed to all units.\n\nIn July 1941 when the Japanese occupied southern Indochina, Britain, the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]] imposed economic [[international sanctions|sanctions]], freezing Japanese financial assets and cutting Japan from its supplies of [[petroleum|oil]], [[tin]] and [[rubber]]. The sanctions were aimed at pressuring Japan to abandon its [[Second Sino-Japanese War|involvement in China]]; instead, the Japanese government planned to seize the resources of South-East Asia from the European nations by force. Both the Japanese navy and army were mobilised, but for the moment an uneasy state of cold war persisted. British Commonwealth reinforcements continued to trickle into Malaya. On 2 December, the [[battleship]] [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and the [[battle-cruiser]] [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']], escorted by four [[destroyer]]s, arrived in Singapore, the first time a battle fleet had been based there. (They were to have been accompanied by the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}} to provide air cover but she had run aground in the Caribbean en route.) The following day [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Ernest John Spooner|Spooner]] hosted a dinner attended by the newly arrived Commander-in-Chief [[Eastern Fleet]], [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Thomas Phillips (Naval officer)|Sir Tom Phillips]], and Percival.<ref>Percival, Chapter 7</ref>\n\n===Japanese attack and British surrender===\n{{main article|Japanese invasion of Malaya|Battle of Singapore}}\n[[File:Pacific War - Malaya 1941-42 - Map.jpg|thumb|350px|Malaya Command and the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya]]]]\n\nOn 8 December 1941 the [[Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)|Japanese 25th Army]] under the command of Lieutenant-General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] launched an [[amphibious assault]] on the Malay Peninsula (one hour before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the difference in date was because the two places lie on opposite sides of the [[international date line]]). That night the first Japanese invasion force arrived at [[Kota Bharu]] on Malaya's east coast. This was just a diversionary force, and the main landings took place the next day at [[Singora]] and [[Pattani (town)|Pattani]] on the south-eastern coast of [[Thailand]], with troops rapidly deploying over the border into northern Malaya.\n\nOn 10 December Percival issued a stirring, if ultimately ineffective, Special Order of the Day:\n<blockquote>In this hour of trial the General Officer Commanding calls upon all ranks Malaya Command for a determined and sustained effort to safeguard Malaya and the adjoining British territories. The eyes of the Empire are upon us. Our whole position in the Far East is at stake. The struggle may be long and grim but let us all resolve to stand fast come what may and to prove ourselves worthy of the great trust which has been placed in us.<ref>Percival, chapter 9</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Royal Engineers prepare to blow up a bridge in Malaya.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Engineers]] prepare to blow up a bridge during the retreat.]]\n\nThe Japanese advanced rapidly, and on 27 January 1942 Percival ordered a general retreat across the [[Johore Strait]] to the island of [[Singapore]] and organised a defence along the length of the island's {{convert|70|mi|km|sing=on}} coast line. But the Japanese did not dawdle, and on 8 February Japanese troops landed on the northwest corner of Singapore island. After a week of fighting on the island, Percival held his final command conference at 9&nbsp;am on 15 February in [[the Battle Box]] of [[Fort Canning]]. The Japanese had already occupied approximately half of Singapore and it was clear that the island would soon fall.  Having been told that ammunition and water would both run out by the following day, Percival agreed to surrender. The Japanese at this point were running low on artillery shells, but Percival did not know this.\n\nThe Japanese insisted that Percival himself march under a [[white flag]] to the [[Old Ford Motor Factory]] in [[Bukit Timah]] to negotiate the surrender. A Japanese officer present noted that he looked \"pale, thin and tired\".<ref>Warren, p265</ref> After a brief disagreement, when Percival insisted that the British keep 1,000 men under arms in Singapore to preserve order, which Yamashita finally conceded, it was agreed at 6:10&nbsp;pm that the British Empire troops would lay down their arms and cease resistance at 8:30&nbsp;pm. This was in spite of instructions from Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] for prolonged resistance.<ref name=\"Morris\"/> The [[Pacific War]] was just ten weeks old.\n\nA common view holds that 138,708 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel surrendered or were killed by fewer than 30,000 Japanese. However, the former figure includes nearly 50,000 troops captured or killed during the [[Battle of Malaya]], and perhaps 15,000 base troops. Many of the other troops were tired and under-equipped following their retreat from the [[Malayan peninsula]]. Conversely, the latter number represents only the front-line troops available for the invasion of Singapore. British Empire battle casualties since 8 December amounted to 7,500 killed and 11,000 wounded. Japanese losses totalled around 3,500 killed and 6,100 wounded.<ref>Thompson, p9 and p424</ref>\n\n===Culpability for the fall of Singapore===\n[[File:Singaporesurrender.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant-General Percival led by a Japanese officer, marches under a flag of [[truce]] to negotiate the capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore, on 15 February 1942. It was the largest surrender of British-led forces in history.]]\nChurchill viewed the fall of Singapore to be \"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.\" However, the British defence was that the [[Middle East]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had all received higher priorities in the allocation of men and material, so the desired [[air force]] strength of 300 to 500 aircraft was never reached, and whereas the Japanese invaded with over two hundred [[tank]]s, the British Army in Malaya did not have a single tank.<ref>Kinvig.</ref> In ''The War in Malaya'' Percival himself cites this as the major factor for the defeat stating that the 'war material which might have saved Singapore was sent to Russia and the Middle East'. However he also concedes that Britain was engaged in 'a life and death struggle in the West' and that 'this decision, however painful and regrettable, was inevitable and right'.<ref>The War in Malaya; Authur Percival p306</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Percival had been described as \"a slim, soft spoken man... with a proven reputation for bravery and organisational powers\"<ref>Kinvig, p. 47.</ref> but by 1945 this description had been turned on its head with even Percival's defenders describing him as \"something of a damp squib\".<ref>Kinvig, p. 242.</ref> The fall of Singapore switched Percival's reputation to that of an ineffective \"staff wallah\", lacking ruthlessness and aggression, even though few doubted that he was a brave and determined officer. Over six feet in height and lanky, with a clipped moustache and two protruding teeth, and unphotogenic, Percival was an easy target for a caricaturist, being described as \"tall, bucktoothed and lightly built\".<ref>Warren, p. 29.</ref> There was no doubt his presentation lacked impact as \"his manner was low key and he was a poor public speaker with the cusp of a lisp\".<ref>Kinvig, ''General Percival and the Fall of Singapore'', p. 241.</ref>\n[[File:BritishSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lieutenant-General Yamashita (seated, centre) thumps the table with his fist to emphasise his demand for unconditional surrender. Lieutenant-General Percival sits between his officers, his clenched hand to his mouth. (Photo from [[Imperial War Museum]]).]]\n\nIt has been argued{{by whom|date=November 2015}} that Percival's colleagues bear a share of the responsibility of defeat. Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham|Robert Brooke-Popham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[British Far East Command]], refused Percival permission to launch [[Operation Matador (1941)|Operation Matador]] in advance of the Japanese landings in Thailand, not wishing to run any risk of provoking the coming war. Brooke-Popham also had a reputation for falling asleep in meetings and not arguing forcefully for the air reinforcements required to defend Malaya. Admiral [[Thomas Spencer Vaughan Phillips|Tom Phillips]]' leadership of [[Force Z]] led to his demise and the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|destruction of the British fleet]] on 10 December 1941, early in the campaign.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Peter Wykeham]] suggested that the government in London was more to blame than any of the British commanders in the Far East. Despite repeated requests, the British government did not provide the necessary reinforcements and they denied Brooke-Popham \u2013 and therefore Percival \u2013 permission to enter neutral Thailand before it was too late to put in place forward defences.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite journal| last =Wykeham| first =Peter| author2 =Thomas Paul Ofcansky| title =Popham, Sir (Henry) Robert Moore Brooke| work =Oxford Dictionary of National Biography| url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/32/101032096/| date =January 2008| doi =10.1093/ref:odnb/32096}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Percival had difficulties with his subordinates [[Lewis Heath|Sir Lewis \"Piggy\" Heath]], commanding [[Indian III Corps]], and the independent-minded [[Gordon Bennett (general)|Gordon Bennett]], commanding the [[Australian 8th Division]]. The former officer had been senior to Percival prior to his appointment as GOC (Malaya). Bennett was full of confidence in his [[Australia]]n troops and his own ability, but faced a mixed reaction in Australia when he escaped from Singapore immediately after its surrender.\n\nPercival was ultimately responsible for the men who served under him, and with other officers \u2013 notably Major-General [[David Murray-Lyon]], commander of the [[Indian 11th Infantry Division]] \u2013 he had shown a willingness to replace them when he felt their performance was not up to scratch. Perhaps his greatest mistake was to resist the building of fixed defences in either Johore or the north shore of Singapore, dismissing them in the face of repeated requests to start construction from his Chief Engineer, Brigadier [[Ivan Simson]], with the comment \"Defences are bad for morale \u2013 for both troops and civilians\".<ref>Thompson, p. 182.</ref> In doing so, Percival threw away the potential advantages he could have derived from the 6,000 engineers under his command and perhaps missed his best chance to blunt the danger posed by the Japanese tanks.\n\nPercival also insisted on defending the north-eastern shore of Singapore most heavily, against the advice of the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|Allied supreme commander in South East Asia]], General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]]. Percival was perhaps fixed on his responsibilities for defending the Singapore Naval Base.<ref>Dixon, ''[[On the Psychology of Military Incompetence]]'', p. 143.</ref> He also spread his forces thinly around the island and kept few units as a strategic reserve. When the Japanese attack came in the west, the [[Australian 22nd Brigade]] took the brunt of the assault.<ref>Thompson, p. 414.</ref> Percival refused to reinforce them as he continued to believe that the main assault would occur in the north east.<ref>Thompson, p. 430.</ref>\n\n===Captivity===\nPercival himself was briefly held prisoner in [[Changi Prison]], where \"the defeated GOC could be seen sitting head in hands, outside the married quarters he now shared with seven brigadiers, a colonel, his ADC and cook-sergeant. He discussed feelings with few, spent hours walking around the extensive compound, ruminating on the reverse and what might have been\".<ref>Kinvig, p221</ref> In the belief that it would improve discipline, he reconstituted a Malaya Command, complete with staff appointments, and helped occupy his fellow prisoners with lectures on the [[Battle of France]].<ref>MacArthur, ''Surviving the Sword: Prisoners of the Japanese 1942\u201345'', p188</ref>\n[[File:Douglas MacArthur signs formal surrender.jpg|left|thumb|The signing of the Japanese surrender; [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] (sitting), behind him are Generals Percival (background) and [[Jonathan M.

First he was imprisoned in [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and then sent on to [[Manchuria]], where he was held with several dozen other VIP captives, including the [[United States|American]] General [[Jonathan M.

Percival was then taken, along with Wainwright, to stand immediately behind General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as he confirmed the terms of the Japanese surrender aboard [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'' (BB-63)]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on 2 September 1945.<ref>''Battleship Missouri Memorial'', {{cite web|url=http://www.ussmissouri.org/surrender.aspx |title=Surrender |accessdate=2006-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109061015/http://ussmissouri.org/surrender.aspx |archivedate=9 November 2005 |df=dmy }} , accessed 2 February 2006</ref> Afterwards, MacArthur gave Percival a pen he had used to sign the treaty.<ref>Warren, p286</ref>\n\nPercival and Wainwright then returned together to the [[Philippines]] to witness the surrender of the Japanese army there, which in a twist of fate was commanded by General Yamashita. Yamashita was momentarily surprised to see his former captive at the ceremony; on this occasion Percival refused to shake Yamashita's hand, angered by the mistreatment of POWs in Singapore. The flag carried by Percival's party on the way to Bukit Timah was also a witness to this reversal of fortunes, being flown when the Japanese formally surrendered Singapore back to Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]].<ref>Morris, p458</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nPercival returned to the United Kingdom in September 1945 to write his despatch at the [[War Office]] but this was revised by the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] and only published in 1948.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38215|pages=1245\u20131346|date=20 February 1948}}</ref> He retired from the army in 1946 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general but the pension of his substantive rank of major-general.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37706|page=4347|date=27 August 1946}}</ref> Thereafter, he held appointments connected with the county of Hertfordshire, where he lived at Bullards in [[Widford, Hertfordshire|Widford]]: he was Honorary Colonel of [[479th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]], ([[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|T.A.]]) from 1949 to 1954<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38762|page=5465|date=18 November 1949}}</ref><ref>Col J.D.

Percival's 1949 memoir, ''The War in Malaya'', did little to quell this criticism, being a restrained rather than self-serving account of the campaign. Unusual for a British lieutenant-general, Percival was not awarded a [[British honours system|knighthood]].\n\nPercival was respected for the time he had spent as a Japanese [[prisoner of war]]. Serving as life president of the [[Far East Prisoners of War]] Association (FEPOW), he pushed for compensation for his fellow captives, eventually helping to obtain a token \u00a35 million of frozen Japanese assets for this cause.
