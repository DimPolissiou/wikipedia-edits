Janes (2007)===\nCastellucci wrote the inaugural [[graphic novel]] for [[DC Comics]]'s [[Minx (comics)|Minx]] imprint, which targets the YA audience. A long time comic book fan (she invited [[Batman]] to her fourth birthday party), Cecil jumped at the opportunity when contacted by Group Editor Shelly Bond.\n\nThe story follows a boy named Jane who moves to suburbia after a terrorist attack in her hometown of Metro City.  In the chaos after the attack, she finds a \"John Doe\" and his sketchbook. He serves as an inspiration for her to spread art to others.  Jane's family decides to move away from Metro City in favor of a more sheltered, quiet community, where Jane spends a lot of time drawing in the sketchbook. This book becomes her inspiration to form P.L.A.I.N. (People Loving Art In Neighborhoods).  At school, she rejects the popular girls, and instead finds her \"tribe\" with three other girls named Jayne (aka Brain Jane), Jane (Theater Jane), and Polly Jane (Sporty Jane). Even though each girl embodies a high school stereotype, as the story progresses, readers see how each girl grows out of her mold and presents her other interests and abilities.  They band together to form P.L.A.I.N. and commit \"art attacks\" to fight against their individual hardships and emotions but end up fighting against the social hierarchy.  They eventually inspire other teens to use art as their weapons as well.  At the end of the story, when Main Jane tries to admit that she was behind the P.L.A.I.N. attacks, the police dismiss her confession because they believe the attacks were too labor-intensive to be done by a girl. This part of the story challenges the notion that anything involving physical labor is exclusively for men.\n\nJane refuses to be defined as a victim of her terrorist attack experience, unlike her parents who are shackled by their fear; instead, she transforms her trauma into art through P.L.A.I.N.  The Plain Janes' message of \"art saves\" embodies the idea of giving people permission, even inspiration to face their fears and to move forward, while in addition aims to challenge conformity and to bring back life and spirit into the town of Kent Waters.  The story shows how Jane (Main Jane) is comfortable with her own identity as an individual and refuses to conform to what society defines as \"cool.\" An example of this would be the first P.L.A.I.N \"attack\" which protest the building of the new shopping mall, challenging what the students defined as \"cool.\"  By participating in these \"attacks,\" the Janes are able to empower both themselves and their community by pushing the boundaries of normalcy and bringing a sense of imagination and spontaneity to the otherwise monotonous suburbia.\n\nA Canadian citizen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://castellucci.livejournal.com/461482.html |title=The Divine Miss Pixie Woods (aka Cecil Castellucci) - today this and that = star wars! trains! shuster! rabbits! squirrels! yuri gargarin{{sic|nolink=y}}! |publisher=Castellucci.livejournal.com |accessdate=2011-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120204556/http://castellucci.livejournal.com/461482.html |archivedate=2016-01-20 }}</ref> Castellucci won the [[Joe Shuster Awards#Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Writer|Joe Shuster Award]] in the category of \"Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Writer\" for ''Janes''.<ref>[http://joeshusterawards.com/story.asp?storyID=124 The 2008 Joe Shuster Award Results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619121704/http://joeshusterawards.com/story.asp?storyID=124 |date=June 19, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA sequel, called ''Janes in Love'', was released in 2008.

Janes (2007)===\nCastellucci wrote the inaugural [[graphic novel]] for [[DC Comics]]'s [[Minx (comics)|Minx]] imprint, which targets the YA audience. A long time comic book fan (she invited [[Batman]] to her fourth birthday party), Cecil jumped at the opportunity when contacted by Group Editor Shelly Bond.\n\nThe story follows a girl named Jane who moves to suburbia after a terrorist attack in her hometown of Metro City.  In the chaos after the attack, she finds a \"John Doe\" and his sketchbook. He serves as an inspiration for her to spread art to others.  Jane's family decides to move away from Metro City in favor of a more sheltered, quiet community, where Jane spends a lot of time drawing in the sketchbook. This book becomes her inspiration to form P.L.A.I.N. (People Loving Art In Neighborhoods).  At school, she rejects the popular girls, and instead finds her \"tribe\" with three other girls named Jayne (aka Brain Jane), Jane (Theater Jane), and Polly Jane (Sporty Jane). Even though each girl embodies a high school stereotype, as the story progresses, readers see how each girl grows out of her mold and presents her other interests and abilities.  They band together to form P.L.A.I.N. and commit \"art attacks\" to fight against their individual hardships and emotions but end up fighting against the social hierarchy.  They eventually inspire other teens to use art as their weapons as well.  At the end of the story, when Main Jane tries to admit that she was behind the P.L.A.I.N. attacks, the police dismiss her confession because they believe the attacks were too labor-intensive to be done by a girl. This part of the story challenges the notion that anything involving physical labor is exclusively for men.\n\nJane refuses to be defined as a victim of her terrorist attack experience, unlike her parents who are shackled by their fear; instead, she transforms her trauma into art through P.L.A.I.N.  The Plain Janes' message of \"art saves\" embodies the idea of giving people permission, even inspiration to face their fears and to move forward, while in addition aims to challenge conformity and to bring back life and spirit into the town of Kent Waters.  The story shows how Jane (Main Jane) is comfortable with her own identity as an individual and refuses to conform to what society defines as \"cool.\" An example of this would be the first P.L.A.I.N \"attack\" which protest the building of the new shopping mall, challenging what the students defined as \"cool.\"  By participating in these \"attacks,\" the Janes are able to empower both themselves and their community by pushing the boundaries of normalcy and bringing a sense of imagination and spontaneity to the otherwise monotonous suburbia.\n\nA Canadian citizen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://castellucci.livejournal.com/461482.html |title=The Divine Miss Pixie Woods (aka Cecil Castellucci) - today this and that = star wars! trains! shuster! rabbits! squirrels! yuri gargarin{{sic|nolink=y}}! |publisher=Castellucci.livejournal.com |accessdate=2011-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120204556/http://castellucci.livejournal.com/461482.html |archivedate=2016-01-20 }}</ref> Castellucci won the [[Joe Shuster Awards#Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Writer|Joe Shuster Award]] in the category of \"Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Writer\" for ''Janes''.<ref>[http://joeshusterawards.com/story.asp?storyID=124 The 2008 Joe Shuster Award Results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619121704/http://joeshusterawards.com/story.asp?storyID=124 |date=June 19, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA sequel, called ''Janes in Love'', was released in 2008.

Its original venue was the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand Casino and Hotel]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] from 2002 to 2005, but the tournament moved down the [[Las Vegas Strip|strip]] to the [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] from 2006 to 2009.\n\n[[File:MandalayBay03.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] where the tournament was held from 2006 to 2009]]\nThe tournament carried a total prize purse of \u00a3126,400 (approx US$250,000). Due to the time difference between the UK and US, the matches were played in the morning local time \u2013 which is prime-time evening in the UK where the tournament was broadcast live on [[Sky Sports]].\n\nInitially [[Fox Soccer|Fox Sports World]] transmitted the tournament live but in recent years they broadcast recorded coverage in the United States. Partypoker.net became the first sponsors of the event in 2006.\n\nThe format of the Classic changed over the years. In 2002, the tournament had a sets format with best of 7 legs per set. In 2003, the tournament had a legs only format throughout with a round robin group stage of 8 groups with 3 players each, before it became straight knockout from the quarter finals onwards. In 2004 and 2005, the tournament reverted to straight knockout with a sets format with best of 5 legs per set throughout. In 2006, the tournament had a legs only format in the Last 32, before reverting to a sets format with best of 5 legs per set for the Last 16, Quarter Finals, Semi Finals and the Final. From 2007 to 2009, the tournament remained straight knockout but moved back to a legs only format throughout.\n\n[[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] won the title five times out of the eight years the event was staged. [[Peter Manley]], [[John Part]] and [[Raymond van Barneveld]] were the only other winners of the event.\n\nThe Las Vegas Desert Classic tournament was retired in 2010 and a new tournament held in Las Vegas, the Tropicana World Series, has been put in its place. However, the tournament is not televised.\n\n==Las Vegas Desert Classic Finals==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! rowspan=2 | Champion <small>(average in final)</small>\n! rowspan=2 | Score\n! rowspan=2 | Runner-Up <small>(average in final)</small>\n! colspan=3 | Prize Money\n! rowspan=2 | Sponsor\n! rowspan=2 | Venue\n|-\n!

Its original venue was the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand Casino and Hotel]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] from 2002 to 2005, but the tournament moved down the [[Las Vegas Strip|strip]] to the [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] from 2006 to 2009.\n\n[[File:MandalayBay03.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] where the tournament was held from 2006 to 2009]]\nThe tournament carried a total prize purse of \u00a3126,400 (approx US$250,000). Due to the time difference between the UK and US, the matches were played in the morning local time \u2013 which is prime-time evening in the UK where the tournament was broadcast live on [[Sky Sports]].\n\nInitially [[Fox Soccer|Fox Sports World]] transmitted the tournament live but in recent years they broadcast recorded coverage in the United States. Partypoker.net became the first sponsors of the event in 2006.\n\nThe format of the Classic changed over the years. In 2002, the tournament had a sets format with best of 7 legs per set. In 2003, the tournament had a legs only format throughout with a round robin group stage of 8 groups with 3 players each, before it became straight knockout from the quarter finals onwards. In 2004 and 2005, the tournament reverted to straight knockout with a sets format with best of 5 legs per set throughout. In 2006, the tournament had a legs only format in the Last 32, before reverting to a sets format with best of 5 legs per set for the Last 16, Quarter Finals, Semi Finals and the Final. From 2007 to 2009, the tournament remained straight knockout but moved back to a legs only format throughout.\n\n[[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] won the title five times out of the eight years the event was staged. [[Peter Manley]], [[John Part]] and [[Raymond van Barneveld]] were the only other winners of the event.\n\nThe Las Vegas Desert Classic tournament was retired in 2010 and a new tournament held in Las Vegas, the Tropicana World Series, has been put in its place. However, the tournament is not televised.\n\n==Las Vegas Desert Classic Finals==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! rowspan=2 | Champion <small>(average in final)</small>\n! rowspan=2 | Score\n! rowspan=2 | Runner-Up <small>(average in final)</small>\n! colspan=3 | Prize Money\n! rowspan=2 | Sponsor\n! rowspan=2 | Venue\n|-\n!

At 28 he is a very experienced footballer. Ghuloom started his career at small first division (the 2nd tier of Bahraini football) club Isa Town or [[Madinat Isa]]. This club produced former Bahrain national team captain, and Ghuloom's teammate, Talal Yousif. Ghuloom's excellent performance for the club prompted one of the three big Bahraini clubs, Al Riffa, to sign him along with Isa Town teammate [[Talal Yousef]]. After signing for Al Riffa he made a huge impact helping them to the [[Bahraini Premier League|Bahraini Premiership]] title in 2002\u20132003. During his time at Al Riffa he played under Bahraini Manager Riyadh Al Thawadi who would go on to manage the Bahrain national team for one match against Kuwait. Salman Isa plays his trade for Al-Arabi of [[Qatar]] currently and is one of the most consistent players at the club.\n\n==Glory Days==\n\nGhuloom is known for his hardworking and tireless displays on the wing, but as Talal Yousif who was deployed as a more offensive player for Al Riffa left for [[Kuwait SC]], [[Riyadh Al Thawadi]] decided to push Ghuloom upfield and play him as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]]. This decision proved to be vital as Ghuloom scored 15 goals as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], leaving him as the league's top scorer. Ghuloom's amazing form also helped Al Riffa to the 2004\u20132005 league championship and the [[Bahraini Crown Prince Cup|Crown Prince Cup]]. In which Ghuloom scored in the final. Ghuloom's best for the national team came in the 2004 [[Gulf Cup of Nations|Gulf Arabian Cup]] in Qatar. Ghuloom scored an amazing goal in the historic 3\u20130 win over Bahrain's fierce rivals and neighbors, the more famous Saudi Arabia. Ghuloom's hardworking ethics paid off as Bahrain again qualified for the semi finals although they were knocked out by Oman. Nevertheless, Bahrain still finished in third place. After the 2004\u20132005 season Ghuloom's amazing displays prompted [[Al-Arabi SC (Qatar)|Al Arabi]] of Qatar, where fellow national team player and captain Mohamed Salmeen plays, to sign Ghuloom from then Bahraini champions Al Riffa. At Al Riffa Ghuloom was a cult hero and fans referred to him as \"AL JANAH AL TAER\" which means the flying wing, for his speedy runs through the wings. At Al Arabi, Ghuloom continued to display good form although there he was being used mostly as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] or wing back.

Although Salman missed the many games of the tournament due to injury, he still managed to play a few matches in Bahrain's run to the Semi Finals. After the Asian Cup, most of the members of the national team were signed by big Qatari clubs such as [[Al-Gharafa Sports Club|Al Gharafa]], Al Arabi, and [[Al-Rayyan Sports Club|Al Rayyan]]. Team players such as Mohamed Ahmed Salmeen and [[A'ala Hubail|Alaa Hubail]] moved on to Qatar. While others like Talal Yousif for instance decided to move to Kuwait.
