The steel [[Truss bridge|truss]] [[vertical lift bridge]] and specially-built [[causeway]] connect the Hobart suburbs of {{TAScity|Bridgewater}} and {{TAScity|Granton}}. The bridge was completed in 1946 and accommodates a two-lane [[highway]], a single track [[Rail_transport_in_Tasmania|railway]] and a [[grade-separated]] [[footpath]]. \n\nThe bridge is the major connector of the Midland Highway on the eastern shore and the [[Brooker Highway]] on the western shore. The bridge is the oldest surviving lift span bridge in Australia; and lifting of the bridge can cause considerable traffic delays.<ref name=stateline/>\n\n==History==\nThe Bridgewater Bridge was one of the first bridges constructed in Tasmania following British settlement in 1803, and gave its name to the nearby suburb of Bridgewater. [[Lieutenant-Governor]] [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|George Arthur]] commissioned the construction of the bridge and causeway as part of the [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]{{spaced endash}} Hobart Trunk Road, linking both Tasmanian towns and providing easier access to farmlands in the [[Midlands, Tasmania|interior of Tasmania]].\n\n===The causeway===\nConstruction commenced on the bridge in 1829. Operations were supervised by [[Roderic O'Connor (land commissioner)|Roderic O'Connor]].<ref>{{cite AuDB |author1=Eldershaw, P. R. |title=O'Connor, Roderic (1784\u20131860) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |volume=2 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press]] |year=1967 }}</ref> The causeway, which was constructed first, was built by a workforce of 200 [[convict]]s who had been condemned to secondary punishment. These convicts, using nothing but wheelbarrows, shovels and picks and sheer muscle power, shifted {{convert|2|e6t|e6ST|abbr=off}} of soil, stones and clay. The finished causeway stretched {{convert|1.3|km|mi|0}}, although did not span the full width of the Derwent. The original plan apparently called for a [[viaduct]], but this plan was abandoned and the half-built arches were filled in to form the present causeway.\n\n===The first bridges===\nUpon completion of the causeway, a [[Punt (boat)|punt]] operated across the deep, navigable section of the river, but could not cope with traffic demands. To resolve this issue, the first bridge across this point of the Derwent opened in 1849. The bridge was designed by the firm of architect and former convict [[James Blackburn (architect)|James Blackburn]].<ref>{{cite AuDB |author=Preston, Harley |title=Blackburn, James (1803 - 1854) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |volume=1 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press]] |year=1966 |pages=109-110 |id2=A010103b.htm }}</ref> Being a [[swing bridge]], it could pivot out of the way to allow ships to pass. In the late 1870s, the Launceston-Hobart Railway called for modifications to the causeway so they could lay tracks over it. The causeway required widening and the swing bridge was modified as well.\n\nOn 22 July 1886, a train from the north was passing over the bridge when the engine left the tracks and tipped over, hanging precariously above the water on the edge of the southern end of the swing bridge. The fireman and driver were injured, but no one was killed and the locomotive was salvageable. The cause of the accident was found to be that the rails failed to match properly when the bridge was closed, so the bridge was modified again to solve this problem. The bridge lasted several decades more before being replaced by another swing bridge in the early 1900s. The pivot and the sandstone abutments of this bridge are still standing and can be viewed on the left of the present bridge as one travels towards the north.\n\nBoth the first and second swing bridges did not run straight off the end of the causeway; rather, they turned slightly to the right. The second swing bridge was left standing when the present lifting bridge was being constructed to prevent traffic stoppages, so the present bridge deviates from the causeway quite appreciably.\n\n==The current lift bridge==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bridgewater bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Bridgewater Bridge (facing east). The rail line runs on the left (north side) of the causeway and bridge.]]\n[[File:Bridgewater Bridge from north.jpg|thumb|right|The Bridgewater Bridge, Tasmania, from the eastern access near the town of Bridgewater (facing west).]]\n\nConstruction on the present steel vertical lift bridge across the Derwent began in 1939. It was briefly interrupted by [[World War II]], but was finally completed in 1946. It consists of a long concrete bridge that leads off the end of the causeway, and a steel lifting section just before the northern bank of the river.  The lifting section is one of only a few remaining in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and is the largest of its kind remaining in Australia. The bridge was designed to last a century without replacement. A small control house stands on the lifting section. Inside are the switches and locks which operate the bridge.\n\nUntil 1984, the Australian Newsprint Mills (now [[Norske Skog]] Paper) at [[Boyer, Tasmania|Boyer]], near [[New Norfolk, Tasmania|New Norfolk]], upstream from Bridgewater, moved all its produce by river.  Many [[barge]]s were used to transport paper from the mill to the storage sheds at Pavilion Point at Hobart, and for this reason the bridge was required to open very frequently. Consequently, a bridge-keeper lived on-site and opened and closed the bridge when required.  However, when the decision was made to cease river transportation, an on-site keeper was no longer necessary, so although the bridge can and does still open, bridge openings are now infrequent.\n\nIn response to vandalism of the house which contains the bridge operating controls, [[closed-circuit television]] cameras were installed along the lifting span sometime between 2003 and 2005.\n\nOn 30 October 2006 a fault was found in one of the steel cables holding up the two {{convert|170|t|ST|adj=on}} concrete counterweights above the road, forcing the temporary closure of the bridge.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Bridgewater bridge problems disrupt rail traffic |journal=[[Tasmanian Rail News]] |number=233 |date=November 2006 |page=3 }}</ref> This closure caused peak hour traffic delays, mainly along the [[East Derwent Highway]], due to traffic being diverted over the [[Bowen Bridge|Bowen]] and [[Tasman Bridge|Tasman]] bridges. The cables, which were put in place in 1994, were supposed to have a 20-year lifespan, and as they have lasted barely over half that time.\n\n==Replacement bridge==\n{{main|Southern Transport Investment Program}}\nBetween 2001 and 2005, the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] granted {{AUD}}100&nbsp;million towards the replacement of the Bridgewater Bridge,<ref name=stateline>{{cite web |author=Blackwood, Fiona |date=7 October 2005 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2005/s1477286.htm |title=Bridgewater Bridge |format=transcript |work=Stateline Tasmania |publisher=[[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]] |location=Australia |accessdate=28 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110155341/http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2005/s1477286.htm |archive-date=10 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> soon after the [[Government of Tasmania|Tasmanian Government]] decided to build the replacement to the south of the existing bridge.

While the Bridgewater Bridge is recognised as being limited in its ability to perform the function of the Midland Highway, it also has important heritage values and is recognised as a landmark in the area.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom 2006 until 2010, the lifting segment of the Bridgewater Bridge was out of commission, due to failed maintenance. The State Government spent $14&nbsp;million to refurbish the bridge and provide it with a further 15 years of life, until a replacement can be built.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ogilvie, Rosemary Ann |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321165350/http://www.earthmover.com.au/news/2010/july/bridgewater-australia2019s-oldest-lift-span-bridge-refurbished |title=Bridgewater: Australia\u2019s oldest lift span bridge refurbished |work=The Earthmover and Civil Contractor |publisher= |date=July 2010 |access-date=7 April 2020 |archive-url=http://www.earthmover.com.au/news/2010/july/bridgewater-australia2019s-oldest-lift-span-bridge-refurbished |archive-date=21 March 2014 }}</ref> This refurbishment replaced the vandalised control house and its controls and all of the cabling to raise and lower the bridge. Touted as a \"major tourist attraction\" with expected regular openings for tourist and private vessels  to travel between Hobart and {{TAScity|New Norfolk}}, the bridge refurbishment has been a major embarrassment to the Tasmanian Government. It has opened no more than six times successfully and has caused major traffic delays, including on a well-promoted occasion the lift span raised approximately {{convert|14|cm}} and was stuck in that position for several minutes before being lowered again.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn March 2016, Infrastructure Tasmania published its review of a design and cost estimate for the construction of a replacement structure for the existing Bridgewater Bridge, which considered various options for a replacement structure and provided advice as to the most feasible crossing solution. As part of the [[2018 Australian federal budget|2018-19 federal budget]], the Australian Government announced a $461&nbsp;million grant towards the construction of a new Bridgewater Bridge, representing 80 per cent of the expected total construction cost. The Tasmanian Government is expected to contribute $115&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stategrowth.tas.gov.au/infrastructure_tasmania/bridgewater_bridge_replacement |title=Bridgewater bridge replacement |work=Department of State Growth |publisher=Tasmanian Government |date=March 2016 |access-date=7 April 2020 }}</ref> Construction was expected to commence in 2019;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stategrowth.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/149877/Review_of_Bridgewater_Bridge_Design_and_Cost_Estimate_-_final.pdf |title=Review of Bridgewater Bridge design and cost estimate |work=Infrastructure Tasmania |publisher=Tasmanian Government |date=March 2016 |access-date=7 April 2020 |page=9 }}</ref> however, following independent assessment of the project by [[Infrastructure Australia]] in July 2019, the evaluation identified a range of issues, which may add to costs and require further work to address, and recommended that the Tasmanian Government revise its business case.

Tasmania|South Railway Line]] across the [[Derwent River, Tasmania|Derwent River]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], Australia. The steel [[Truss bridge|truss]] [[vertical lift bridge]] and specially-built [[causeway]] connect the Hobart suburbs of {{TAScity|Bridgewater}} and {{TAScity|Granton}}. The bridge was completed in 1946 and accommodates a two-lane [[highway]], a single track [[Rail_transport_in_Tasmania|railway]] and a [[grade-separated]] [[footpath]]. \n\nThe bridge is the major connector of the Midland Highway on the eastern shore and the [[Brooker Highway]] on the western shore. The bridge is the oldest surviving lift span bridge in Australia; and lifting of the bridge can cause considerable traffic delays.<ref name=stateline/>\n\n==History==\nThe Bridgewater Bridge was one of the first bridges constructed in Tasmania following British settlement in 1803, and gave its name to the nearby suburb of Bridgewater. [[Lieutenant-Governor]] [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|George Arthur]] commissioned the construction of the bridge and causeway as part of the [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]{{spaced endash}} Hobart Trunk Road, linking both Tasmanian towns and providing easier access to farmlands in the [[Midlands, Tasmania|interior of Tasmania]].\n\n===The causeway===\nConstruction commenced on the bridge in 1829. Operations were supervised by [[Roderic O'Connor (land commissioner)|Roderic O'Connor]].<ref>{{cite AuDB |author1=Eldershaw, P. R. |title=O'Connor, Roderic (1784\u20131860) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |volume=2 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press]] |year=1967 }}</ref> The causeway, which was constructed first, was built by a workforce of 200 [[convict]]s who had been condemned to secondary punishment. These convicts, using nothing but wheelbarrows, shovels and picks and sheer muscle power, shifted {{convert|2|e6t|e6ST|abbr=off}} of soil, stones and clay. The finished causeway stretched {{convert|1.3|km|mi|0}}, although did not span the full width of the Derwent. The original plan apparently called for a [[viaduct]], but this plan was abandoned and the half-built arches were filled in to form the present causeway.\n\n===The first bridges===\nUpon completion of the causeway, a [[Punt (boat)|punt]] operated across the deep, navigable section of the river, but could not cope with traffic demands. To resolve this issue, the first bridge across this point of the Derwent opened in 1849. The bridge was designed by the firm of architect and former convict [[James Blackburn (architect)|James Blackburn]].<ref>{{cite AuDB |author=Preston, Harley |title=Blackburn, James (1803 - 1854) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |volume=1 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press]] |year=1966 |pages=109-110 |id2=A010103b.htm }}</ref> Being a [[swing bridge]], it could pivot out of the way to allow ships to pass. In the late 1870s, the Launceston-Hobart Railway called for modifications to the causeway so they could lay tracks over it. The causeway required widening and the swing bridge was modified as well.\n\nOn 22 July 1886, a train from the north was passing over the bridge when the engine left the tracks and tipped over, hanging precariously above the water on the edge of the southern end of the swing bridge. The fireman and driver were injured, but no one was killed and the locomotive was salvageable. The cause of the accident was found to be that the rails failed to match properly when the bridge was closed, so the bridge was modified again to solve this problem. The bridge lasted several decades more before being replaced by another swing bridge in the early 1900s. The pivot and the sandstone abutments of this bridge are still standing and can be viewed on the left of the present bridge as one travels towards the north.\n\nBoth the first and second swing bridges did not run straight off the end of the causeway; rather, they turned slightly to the right. The second swing bridge was left standing when the present lifting bridge was being constructed to prevent traffic stoppages, so the present bridge deviates from the causeway quite appreciably.\n\n==The current lift bridge==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bridgewater bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Bridgewater Bridge (facing east). The rail line runs on the left (north side) of the causeway and bridge.]]\n[[File:Bridgewater Bridge from north.jpg|thumb|right|The Bridgewater Bridge, Tasmania, from the eastern access near the town of Bridgewater (facing west).]]\n\nConstruction on the present steel vertical lift bridge across the Derwent began in 1939. It was briefly interrupted by [[World War II]], but was finally completed in 1946. It consists of a long concrete bridge that leads off the end of the causeway, and a steel lifting section just before the northern bank of the river.  The lifting section is one of only a few remaining in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and is the largest of its kind remaining in Australia. The bridge was designed to last a century without replacement. A small control house stands on the lifting section. Inside are the switches and locks which operate the bridge.\n\nUntil 1984, the Australian Newsprint Mills (now [[Norske Skog]] Paper) at [[Boyer, Tasmania|Boyer]], near [[New Norfolk, Tasmania|New Norfolk]], upstream from Bridgewater, moved all its produce by river.  Many [[barge]]s were used to transport paper from the mill to the storage sheds at Pavilion Point at Hobart, and for this reason the bridge was required to open very frequently. Consequently, a bridge-keeper lived on-site and opened and closed the bridge when required.  However, when the decision was made to cease river transportation, an on-site keeper was no longer necessary, so although the bridge can and does still open, bridge openings are now infrequent.\n\nIn response to vandalism of the house which contains the bridge operating controls, [[closed-circuit television]] cameras were installed along the lifting span sometime between 2003 and 2005.\n\nOn 30 October 2006 a fault was found in one of the steel cables holding up the two {{convert|170|t|ST|adj=on}} concrete counterweights above the road, forcing the temporary closure of the bridge.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Bridgewater bridge problems disrupt rail traffic |journal=[[Tasmanian Rail News]] |number=233 |date=November 2006 |page=3 }}</ref> This closure caused peak hour traffic delays, mainly along the [[East Derwent Highway]], due to traffic being diverted over the [[Bowen Bridge|Bowen]] and [[Tasman Bridge|Tasman]] bridges. The cables, which were put in place in 1994, were supposed to have a 20-year lifespan, and as they have lasted barely over half that time.\n\n==Replacement bridge==\n{{main|Southern Transport Investment Program}}\nBetween 2001 and 2005, the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] granted {{AUD}}100&nbsp;million towards the replacement of the Bridgewater Bridge,<ref name=stateline>{{cite web |author=Blackwood, Fiona |date=7 October 2005 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2005/s1477286.htm |title=Bridgewater Bridge |format=transcript |work=Stateline Tasmania |publisher=[[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]] |location=Australia |accessdate=28 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110155341/http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2005/s1477286.htm |archive-date=10 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> soon after the [[Government of Tasmania|Tasmanian Government]] decided to build the replacement to the south of the existing bridge.

While the Bridgewater Bridge is recognised as being limited in its ability to perform the function of the Midland Highway, it also has important heritage values and is recognised as a landmark in the area.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom 2006 until 2010, the lifting segment of the Bridgewater Bridge was out of commission, due to failed maintenance. The State Government spent $14&nbsp;million to refurbish the bridge and provide it with a further 15 years of life, until a replacement can be built.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ogilvie, Rosemary Ann |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321165350/http://www.earthmover.com.au/news/2010/july/bridgewater-australia2019s-oldest-lift-span-bridge-refurbished |title=Bridgewater: Australia\u2019s oldest lift span bridge refurbished |work=The Earthmover and Civil Contractor |publisher= |date=July 2010 |access-date=7 April 2020 |archive-url=http://www.earthmover.com.au/news/2010/july/bridgewater-australia2019s-oldest-lift-span-bridge-refurbished |archive-date=21 March 2014 }}</ref> This refurbishment replaced the vandalised control house and its controls and all of the cabling to raise and lower the bridge. Touted as a \"major tourist attraction\" with expected regular openings for tourist and private vessels  to travel between Hobart and {{TAScity|New Norfolk}}, the bridge refurbishment has been a major embarrassment to the Tasmanian Government. It has opened no more than six times successfully and has caused major traffic delays, including on a well-promoted occasion the lift span raised approximately {{convert|14|cm}} and was stuck in that position for several minutes before being lowered again.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn March 2016, Infrastructure Tasmania published its review of a design and cost estimate for the construction of a replacement structure for the existing Bridgewater Bridge, which considered various options for a replacement structure and provided advice as to the most feasible crossing solution. As part of the [[2018 Australian federal budget|2018-19 federal budget]], the Australian Government announced a $461&nbsp;million grant towards the construction of a new Bridgewater Bridge, representing 80 per cent of the expected total construction cost.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the process of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new administrative county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire. \n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit in the early tenth century.<ref>Brooks N, Cubitt C (1996). \"St. Oswald of Worcester - Life and Influence\".

Fig 3 showed that Worcestershire would have witnessed the formation of a county administration and a loss of Yardley, Shipston-on-Stour and Tredington to Warwickshire.<ref>The Times, 4 January 1889</ref> The Act also legislated for Dudley to reunite with the rest of the county, through a transfer of [[Rowley Regis]] and [[Cradley Heath]] from Staffordshire. The proposals would have also seen [[Smethwick]] join Worcestershire, plus [[Burford,_Shropshire|Burford]] (uniting all of [[Tenbury]] [[rural sanitary district]] into one county), [[Ipsley]], [[Upper Arley]], [[Pebworth]] and [[West Malvern]]. The proposed border with Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Herefordshire would have seen considerable exchanges of parishes, thus eliminating all of Worcestershire's exclaves/enclaves.<ref>''The Boundary Commission'', The Times, 28 March 1888</ref> This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative ''[[Local Government Act 1888]]''.

This was due to the size of the general population or historic status as 'Counties Corporate'.<ref>Local Government Act 1888, Section 31</ref> The Act also ensured that Worcestershire's boundaries for what was classified as \"non-administrative purposes\" would match that of the administrative county (including the county boroughs in most cases).

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 8) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 8). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 9: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the process of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].

The proposals would have also seen [[Smethwick]] join Worcestershire, plus [[Burford,_Shropshire|Burford]] (uniting all of [[Tenbury]] [[rural sanitary district]] into one county), [[Ipsley]], [[Upper Arley]], [[Pebworth]] and [[West Malvern]]. The proposed border with Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Herefordshire would have seen considerable exchanges of parishes, thus eliminating all of Worcestershire's exclaves/enclaves.<ref>''The Boundary Commission'', The Times, 28 March 1888</ref> This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative ''[[Local Government Act 1888]]''.

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 8) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 8). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''.
