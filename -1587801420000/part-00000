Xuanzang states that Harsha banned animal slaughter for food, and built monasteries at the places visited by [[Gautama Buddha]]. He erected several thousand 100-feet high [[stupa]]s on the banks of the [[Ganges river]], and built well-maintained [[hospice]]s for travellers and poor people on highways across India. He organized an annual assembly of global scholars, and bestowed charitable alms on them. Every five years, he held a great assembly called [[Moksha]]. Xuanzang also describes a 21-day religious festival organized by Harsha in [[Kannauj]]; during this festival, Harsha and his subordinate kings performed daily rituals before a life-sized golden statue of the Buddha.<ref name=\"AbrahamEraly_2011\"/>\n\nSince Harsha's own records describe him as Shaivite, his conversion to Buddhism would have happened, if at all, in the later part of his life.
